5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was horrified {{at the thought}} of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> any {{children}} could be reared as Jews. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} said to have been rebuilt, after serious fire damage, around 1257–1265, though whether this was a rebuilding, or a {{continuation}} of work commenced after 1246, is unclear. It is not <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> the fire damage was caused when, in 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, with a large army, seized Llanbadarn Fawr from Norman control. Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, son of King Henry III and brother of King Edward I, was Lord of Cardigan from 1265. Given the size of the church it is probable that construction took many years, even if it were not interrupted. If it commenced in 1246 it is quite conceivable that work was not complete until 1265, or later.|$|E
5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church {{on his way back to}} Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E

25|$|The Tanakh {{reports that}} the written Torah was both lost and {{completely}} forgotten for over 50 years and only rediscovered by the Temple priests (2Ki 22:8; 2Chr 34:15). It is <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> an Oral Law could have been remembered when the written Law was forgotten.|$|E

25|$|When Blankers-Koen {{gave birth}} to her first child Jan Junior in 1941, Dutch media {{automatically}} assumed her career would be over.

25|$|Through most {{of history}} many {{philosophers}} found it <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).

25|$|The {{foundation}} {{of much of}} the propaganda relating the Bahá'í Faith to Russian influence is a memoir attributed to Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov who was the Russian ambassador to Persia from 1846 to 1854. The memoir states that Dolgorukov created the Bábí and Bahá'í religions so as to weaken Iran and Shi'a Islam. The memoir was first published in 1943 in Persian in Mashhad, and shortly thereafter published again in Tehran {{with some of the most}} glaring errors corrected. The book still, however, contains so many historical errors that it is <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> it is genuine.|$|E
25|$|At tea on day 2, {{it seemed}} <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that,</b> barring rain, this game {{would go to}} a draw, but Surrey failed to turn the screw and were denied victory by Alex Gidman and Steve Adshead. Surrey won the toss and opted to bat, and after Scott Newman and Richard Clinton had added 136 for the first wicket, things looked {{promising}} for the visitors to Bristol. With seven fifties - numbers 7, 8 and 9 Azhar Mahmood, Martin Bicknell and Harbhajan Singh all adding more than 75 runs - but no century, Surrey amassed 603 before being bowled out at lunch, none of the four bowlers conceding less than 100 runs. This was also the highest total without a century in England, breaking a 106-year-old record by Nottinghamshire, and the second highest total without a century in first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|The apathy {{towards the}} nation's {{heritage}} continued after {{the passing of}} the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, even though this was the most comprehensive law pertaining to planning legislation in England. The 1947 Act went further than its predecessors in dealing with historic buildings, as it required owners of property to notify their local authority of intended alterations, and more significantly, demolitions. This caught any property which may have escaped official notice previously. Theoretically, it gave the local authority the opportunity to impose a preservation order on the property and prevent demolition. Under this law the Duke of Bedford was fined for demolishing half of Woburn Abbey without notification, although it is <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> the Duke {{would have been able to}} demolish half of the huge house (much of it visible from a public highway) without attracting public attention until the demolition was complete.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> inanimate brute matter should, {{without the}} {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{ultimately}} the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, sent to US President Lyndon B. Johnson on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It {{reveals that the}} nuclear option was discounted [...] because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: [...] "because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it is <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> {{the use of nuclear}} weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces".|$|E
500|$|CIA chief Leon Panetta {{said the}} CIA had ruled out {{involving}} Pakistan in the operation, because it feared that [...] "any effort {{to work with}} the Pakistanis could jeopardize the mission.

Obama echoed her sentiments. John O. Brennan, Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, said that it was <b>inconceivable</b> <b>that</b> bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan.

[...] Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed, [...] "the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years...the people who did the best job—and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn't let them—tended to be women", and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic, media coverage would have been vastly different.|$|E
