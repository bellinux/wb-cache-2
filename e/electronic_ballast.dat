25|$|An <b>{{electronic}}</b> <b>ballast</b> uses {{solid state}} electronic circuitry {{to provide the}} proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps. An <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> can be smaller and lighter than a comparably-rated magnetic one. An <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> is usually quieter than a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast,</b> commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|E
25|$|The compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL) replaces regular incandescent bulbs. However, some CFLs will not fit some lamps, because the harp (heavy wire shade support bracket) is shaped for the narrow neck of an incandescent lamp, while CFLs {{tend to have a}} wide housing for their <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> close to the lamp's base.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{high-frequency}} <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> do {{not produce}} visible light flicker, since above about 5kHz, the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle, and light production becomes continuous. Operating frequencies of <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls. Poor quality (or failing) <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> may have insufficient reservoir capacitance or have poor regulation, thereby producing considerable 100/120Hz modulation of the light.|$|R
25|$|Application of <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> {{is growing}} in popularity. Most newer {{generation}} <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> can operate both high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps as well as metal-halide lamps, reducing costs for building managers who use both types of lamps. So, the ballast, at the beginning works as a starter for the voltaic arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. <b>Electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> (digital ballasts) also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.|$|R

25|$|CFLs {{have two}} main {{components:}} a magnetic or <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> and a gas-filled tube (also called bulb or burner). Replacement of magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts has removed {{most of the}} flickering and slow starting traditionally associated with fluorescent lighting, and has allowed the development of smaller lamps directly interchangeable with more sizes of incandescent light bulb.|$|E
25|$|Initial phase: {{the bulb}} is driven with {{controlled}} overload. Because the arc is operated at high power, {{the temperature in}} the capsule rises quickly. The metallic salts vaporize, and the arc is intensified and made spectrally more complete. The resistance between the electrodes also falls; the <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> control gear registers this and automatically switches to continuous operation.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Philips {{introduced}} its model SL, {{which was a}} screw-in or bayonet mount lamp with integral magnetic ballast. The lamp used a folded T4 tube, stable tri-color phosphors, and a mercury amalgam. This was the first successful screw-in replacement for an incandescent lamp. In 1985, Osram started selling its model EL lamp, {{which was the first}} CFL to include an <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast.</b>|$|E

25|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL), also called {{compact fluorescent}} light, energy-saving light, and compact fluorescent tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs. The lamps use a tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into the}} space of an incandescent bulb, and a compact <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> in the base of the lamp.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the wear-out failure modes common to all fluorescent lamps, the <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> may fail, since it {{has a number of}} component parts. Ballast failures are usually due to overheating and may be accompanied by discoloration or distortion of the ballast enclosure, odors, or smoke. The lamps are internally protected and are meant to fail safely {{at the end of their}} lives. Industry associations are working toward advising consumers of the different failure modes of CFLs compared to incandescent lamps, and to develop lamps with inoffensive failure modes. New North American technical standards aim to eliminate smoke or excess heat at the end of lamp life.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{require a}} ballast to {{stabilize}} the current through the lamp, and to provide the initial striking voltage required to start the arc discharge. This increases the cost of fluorescent light fixtures, though often one ballast is shared between two or more lamps. Electromagnetic ballasts with a minor fault can produce an audible humming or buzzing noise. Magnetic ballasts are usually filled with a tar-like potting compound to reduce emitted noise. Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast.</b> Energy lost in magnetic ballasts was around 10% of lamp input power according to GE literature from 1978. Electronic ballasts reduce this loss.|$|E
40|$|Compared with {{electromagnetic}} <b>ballasts,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> {{have much}} shorter lifetime {{and are not}} recyclable. This prompts new concerns about their environmental impacts due to the accumulation of toxic and non-biodegradable waste components and materials. In this paper, the combined use of a central dimming system with low-loss electromagnetic ballasts is compared with <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts.</b> Experimental results have confirmed {{that the use of}} a central dimming system for large electromagnetic ballast driven lighting systems can be as energy efficient as <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts.</b> Considering the long lifetime of electromagnetic ballasts and recyclability of their magnetic chokes, this project shows that such combined technology can provide an improved environmental-friendly and energy-saving solution for large-scale electric lighting systems. © 2005 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{conventional}} magnetic ballasts flicker {{at twice}} the supply frequency. <b>Electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> do not produce light flicker since the phosphor persistence is longer than a half cycle of the higher operation frequency of 20 kHz. The 100-120 Hz flicker produced by magnetic ballasts is associated with headaches and eyestrain.Individuals with high critical flicker fusion threshold are particularly affected by light from fluorescent fixtures that have magnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy. The problems are not observed with <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts.</b> Ordinary people have better reading performance using high-frequency (20-60 kHz) <b>electronic</b> <b>ballasts</b> than magnetic ballasts, although the effect was small except at high contrast ratio.|$|R
25|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast {{permanently}} {{installed in the}} luminaire, and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of tube {{does not}} have {{filaments}} to start it at all. [...] Instant start fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage {{to break down the}} gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin {{at each end of the}} tube. The lamp holders have a [...] "disconnect" [...] socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent electric shock. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life. This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} usually {{supply power}} to the lamp at a frequency of [...] or higher, rather than the mains frequency of this substantially eliminates the stroboscopic effect of flicker, {{a product of the}} line frequency associated with fluorescent lighting (see photosensitive epilepsy). The high output frequency of an <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.|$|E

2500|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL) uses a fluorescent lamp tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into the}} space of an incandescent bulb and contains a compact <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> in the base of the lamp. Compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light, CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power, and may last eight to fifteen times longer. [...] Newer phosphor formulations have improved the perceived color, with [...] "soft white" [...] CFLs judged subjectively similar to standard incandescent lamps. Objections more specifically relating to {{compact fluorescent}} light bulbs include the different quality of light produced by phosphor-based lamps compared to incandescent lamps and that compact fluorescent light bulbs contain small amounts of mercury, a potent neurotoxin, which is especially dangerous to children and pregnant women, and made more serious by the confined area mercury would be dispersed {{in the event of a}} breakage indoors. Environmental concerns about mercury contamination from CFLs have been raised, but CFLs can be shown to result in less mercury in the environment compared to traditional incandescent bulbs due to the significant reductions in power plant emissions. Thus, use of energy-efficient bulbs can actually reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment. Compact fluorescent lamps start poorly when very cold, and most types cannot be dimmed. A few specialist applications are unsuitable for CFLs.|$|E

5000|$|LED tubes {{that are}} {{compatible}} with an electronic (HF) ballast.

Expensive maintenance is a downside. In addition to the LED tube, also the <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> may fail, and it can only be replaced by a qualified electrician. If a LED tube that is compatible with an <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> is installed in an old fluorescent fixture, the question of responsibility must be clarified. Who will be liable for the <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> if it breaks when the LED tube is being installed? The original supplier of the fixture and the coupling device will no longer be responsible if LED tubes with an <b>electronic</b> <b>ballast</b> are used. Therefore, it is worth considering whether electronic ballasts should be scrapped when LED tubes are fitted in old fixtures, particularly in extensive switchover projects. The term retro-fit is also used to refer to these tubes, as the new LED tube will fit into the old fixture without modification. In these cases, the LED tubes may also be compliant with the EN 62776 standard.|$|E
