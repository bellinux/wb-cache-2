5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or <b>emphasis.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
5|$|James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 {{demonstrated}} conclusively {{the likely}} hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused {{a shift of}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half of}} the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.|$|E

5|$|Over time, <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> {{studies of}} leisure {{has shifted from}} the work-leisure relation, {{particularly}} in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

In 'Arena Challenge Mode,' the player can engage one-on-one duels against various opponents, where they'll be rewarded if they win. The new 'Legend Mode' elaborates {{on the individual}} prowess of each individual warrior within Dynasty Warriors. Individual weapons are given the availability to have an 11th evolved state, increasing the weapon's stats further. Due to the great <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the duelling system in this expansion, it is at times seen as its own individual game - separate from the original Dynasty Warriors 4.|$|E
5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.|$|E
