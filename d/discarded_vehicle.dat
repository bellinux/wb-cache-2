Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of Aedes eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly {{over an extended period of}} time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some Anopheles species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.|$|E

The recovered metals account for about 75 % of the total weight of the <b>discarded</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The balance of the material or shredder residue, which amounts to about 3 million tons annually, is currently landfilled. The residue contains a diversity of potentially recyclable materials, including polyurethane foams, iron oxides, and certain thermoplastics. This paper discusses a process under development at Argonne National Laboratory to separate and recover the recyclable materials from this waste stream. The process consists essentially of two-stages. First, a physical separation is used to recover the foams and the metal oxides, followed by a chemical process to extract certain thermoplastics.

40|$|<b>Discarded</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{tires are}} a common habitat for {{container}} mosquito larvae, although the environmental factors that may control their presence or abundance within a tire are largely unknown. We sample <b>discarded</b> <b>vehicle</b> tires in six sites located within four counties of central Illinois during {{the spring and summer}} of 2006 to determine associations between a suite of environmental factors and community composition of container mosquitoes. Our goal was to find patterns of association between environmental factors and abundances of early and late instars. We hypothesized that environmental factors correlated with early instars would be indicative of oviposition cues, whereas environmental factors correlated with late instars would be those important for larval survival. We collected 13 species of mosquitoes, with six species (Culex restuans, Cx. pipiens, Aedes albopictus, Cx. salinarius, Ae. atropalpus, and Ae. triseriatus) accounting for approximate to 95 % of all larvae. There were similar associations between congeneries and environmental factors, with Aedes associated with detritus type (fine detritus, leaves, seeds) and Culex associated with factors related to the surrounding habitat (human population density, canopy cover, tire size) or microorganisms (bacteria, protozoans). Although there was some consistency in factors that were important for early and late instar abundance, there were few significant associations between early and late instars for individual species. Lack of correspondence between factors that explain variation in early versus late instars, most notable for Culex, suggests it difference between environmental determinants of oviposition and survival within tires. Environmental factors associated with discarded tires are important for accurate predictions of mosquito occurrence at the generic level...|$|E

40|$|Understanding dynamic scenes at road intersections is both crucial and {{challenging}} for intelligent vehicles. In order to detect potentially dangerous situations, algorithms are needed that can interpret the behaviour {{of the actors}} in the scene and predict its likely evolution. The difficulty of this task arises from {{the large number of}} possible scenarios. The conventional answer to this issue is to <b>discard</b> <b>vehicle</b> interactions in the manoeuvre prediction process, i. e. to infer the manoeuvre performed by each vehicle from its past and current behaviour, independently from the other vehicles in the scene. In this paper we show how this affects collision risk estimation in very common scenarios, making it unusable in practice for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) applications. As an alternative we propose a probabilistic model for vehicles traversing unsignalised intersections that accounts for the mutual influence between vehicle manoeuvres. The focus is on the utilisation of contextual information (i. e. layout of the intersection, presence of other vehicles and traffic rules) to interpret a vehicle's behaviour. We show how the model can be used for accurate situation and risk assessment...|$|R
30|$|The {{user group}} (blue {{variables}} of Fig. 1) {{is responsible for}} the evaluation and purchase of new vehicles at each time step of the simulation. Overall vehicle demand is determined by internally calibrated variables for each member state. Vehicle stock market share is thus governed by the inflow of new registrations and outflow of <b>discarded</b> <b>vehicles</b> (eg from aging or unaffordability). Within the demand, market shares for each powertrain type, size, and user group (eg urban/non-urban or public/private/fleet) are determined using a simple multinomial logit discrete choice model based on a combined utility of each powertrain. The attributes that characterise the powertrains, and drive their attractiveness are Environment, Performance, Reliability, Safety, Convenience, Popularity, and Choice. They evolve in relation to the investment in research & development (R&D) and infrastructure. Also included in the combined utility is a ‘willingness to consider’ concept [13], and a relative financial cost (purchase price and a proportion of running costs). In future development the choice model will be further refined to obtain more specific preference parameters and a cross-nested structure. User choice is further influenced by the other market agent groups - authorities as they introduce subsidies or scrappage schemes, infrastructure providers who build infrastructure, and manufacturers investing in R&D of the new technologies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{river sand}} {{is one of}} the {{unavoidable}} ingredients in Civil Construction. The Construction activities are increasing day by day. This usage of river sand is increasing its scarcity and its price {{in all parts of the}} country. Reducing the consumption of river sand in construction is a major issue while considering the Economic view. It also helps to save the environment by reducing the harmful impact of sand mining. The <b>Discarded</b> <b>vehicle</b> tyres which are historically been disposed of into landfills constitute an important part of the solid waste. Tyre disposal to landfills is problematic, as waste rubber is not easily biodegradable. An emerging field for the reuse of scrap tyres is in the production of concrete, where rubber tyres can be used as a partial replacement to natural aggregates. This has the additional advantage of saving in natural resources. In this study, an attempt has been made to control the environmental pollution and to save the natural resources by using the discarded rubber tyres for partial replacement for coarse aggregates and Copper slag for the partial replacement for fine aggregates...|$|E
40|$|<b>Discarded</b> <b>vehicle</b> tire casings are an {{important}} artificial habitat for the developmental stages of numerous vector mosquitoes. <b>Discarded</b> <b>vehicle</b> tires degrade under ultraviolet light and leach numerous soluble metals (e. g., barium, cadmium, zinc) and organic substances (e. g., benzothiazole and its derivatives [BZTs], polyaromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) that could affect mosquito larvae that inhabit the tire casing. This study {{examined the relationship between}} soluble zinc, a common marker of tire leachate, on mosquito densities in tire habitats in the field, and tested the effects of tire leachate on the survival and development of newly hatched Aedes albopictus and Aedes triseriatus larvae in a controlled laboratory dose-response experiment. In the field, zinc concentrations were as high as 7. 26  mg/L in a single tire and averaged as high as 2. 39 (SE ±  1. 17)  mg/L among tires at a single site. Aedes albopictus (37 / 42 tires, 81. 1 %) and A. triseriatus (23 / 42, 54. 8 %) were the most widespread mosquito species, co-occurred in over half (22 / 42, 52. 4 %) of all tires, and A. triseriatus was only collected without A. albopictus in one tire. Aedes triseriatus was more strongly negatively associated with zinc concentration than A. albopictus, and another common mosquito, C. pipiens, which was found in 17 tires. In the laboratory experiment, A. albopictus per capita rate of population change (λ′) was over 1. 0, indicating positive population growth, from 0 – 8. 9  mg/L zinc concentration (0 – 10, 000  mg/L tire leachate), but steeply declined to zero from 44. 50 – 89. 00  mg/L zinc (50, 000 – 100, 000  mg/L tire leachate). In contrast, A. triseriatus λ′ declined at the lower concentration of 0. 05  mg/L zinc (100  mg/L tire leachate), and was zero at 0. 45, 8. 90, 44. 50, and 89. 00  mg/L zinc (500, 10, 000, 50, 000 and 100, 000  mg/L tire leachate). These results indicate that tire leachate can have severe negative effects on populations of container-utilizing mosquitoes at concentrations commonly found in the field. Superior tolerance to tire leachate of A. albopictus compared to A. triseriatus, and possibly other native mosquito species, may have facilitated the replacement of these native species as A. albopictus has invaded North America and other regions around the world...|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that the availability of mixed shredded aluminum scrap from end-of-life vehicles (ELV) is likely to surpass the capacity of secondary castings to absorb this type of scrap, {{which could lead to}} a scrap surplus unless suitable interventions can be identified and implemented. However, {{there is a lack of}} studies analyzing potential solutions to this problem, among others, because of a lack of component- and alloy-specific information in the models. In this study, we developed a dynamic model of aluminum in the global vehicle stock (distinguishing 5 car segments, 14 components, and 7 alloy groups). The forecasts made up to the year 2050 for the demand for vehicle components and alloy groups, for the scrap supply from <b>discarded</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and for the effects of different ELV management options. Furthermore, we used a source-sink diagram to identify alloys that could potentially serve as alternative sinks for the growing scrap supply. Dismantling the relevant components could remove up to two-thirds of the aluminum from the ELV stream. However, the use of these components for alloy-specific recycling is currently limited because of the complex composition of components (mixed material design and applied joining techniques), as well as provisions that practically prevent the production of safety-relevant cast parts from scrap. In addition, dismantling is more difficult for components that are currently penetrating rapidly. Therefore, advanced alloy sorting seems to be a crucial step that needs to be developed over the coming years to avoid a future scrap surplus and prevent negative energy use and emission consequences.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed {{by the community}} that reusable launch vehicles will dramatically reduce launch costs because you don’t “throw away the vehicle ” every time it is used. However, this is usually taken as an element of faith, without any substantive analysis to support the conclusion.
