While a relative moderate among House Republicans, Lazio had frequently supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a largely despised figure among many New Yorkers.

5|$|The Liber was <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris, {{who used}} {{it along with}} the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey in his own {{historical}} works. Another 13th-century English writer, Roger of Wendover, was also aware of the Liber.|$|E
5|$|The character's origins lie of the {{accounts}} of Kings Duff and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of Britain <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> Shakespeare.

5|$|Aboriginal people, {{particularly}} the Nyoongar and Yamatji, placed the flower spike in a paperbark-lined hole {{filled with water}} to make a sweet drink. Both this species and B.aemula have been credited with the inspiration behind May Gibbs' Big Bad Banksia Men; this species was <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> Gibbs in her childhood and likely gave her the initial inspiration, although the depictions resemble the latter species. Artist Marianne North produced a highly regarded painting of B.attenuata during her stay in Australia in 1880–1881.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant {{wondered}} where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have {{found himself in the}} rear of the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the other to the southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> the audience.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|Rand began The Fountainhead (originally titled Second-Hand Lives) {{following}} {{the completion of}} her first novel, We the Living, in 1934. That earlier novel was {{based in part on}} people and events <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> Rand; the new novel, on the other hand, focused on the less-familiar world of architecture. She therefore conducted extensive research that included reading many biographies and other books about architecture. She also worked as an unpaid typist in the office of architect Ely Jacques Kahn. Rand began her notes for the new novel in December 1935.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's rule {{consolidated}} {{the usage}} of the coat of arms of Moldavia, featuring the aurochs head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a helmet atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under Alexander the Good, which also featured a rose, crescent, sun and star (often, but not always, five-pointed); its tinctures remain unknown. This arrangement was not <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with attributed arms featuring Maures; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for Sycorax's {{character}} {{may have come}} from the classical literature <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> many in Shakespeare's day. Sycorax is similar to Medea, a witch in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in that both are powerful, magical female figures. Scholars have also pointed out that Sycorax resembles the magical Circe from Greek mythology as well as perhaps a version of Circe found in the mythology of the Coraxi tribe in modern-day Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress party would have been <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> Etty's generally wealthy audience.

Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, {{the richness of the}} design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E

After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him. Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at Wembley Stadium. A live album of the first show, called <b>Familiar</b> <b>to</b> Millions, was released in late 2000 to mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Barry's scheme {{provided}} two plinths for sculptures on {{the north}} side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch, was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late-20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures more <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> the general public.|$|E
