5000|$|Soaring, {{the journal}} of the Soaring Society of America, {{described}} the SGM 2-37 as: [...] "Very versatile, very promising, very expensive". The publication's review noted that the $70,000 base price did not include a feathering propeller, <b>gyro</b> <b>instruments,</b> wheel fairings, long range fuel tanks or other optional extras.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the efforts}} of Lt. Colonel Joseph Duckworth, the Columbus Army Flying School {{developed}} and perfected two systems of training, which was adopted by the command. The first was the Flying Evaluation Board. This board instituted tough new criteria to evaluate an instructor's proficiency. The second was the [...] "full panel" [...] attitude system of instrument flying, which is credited with revolutionizing training in blind flying. In addition to the three instruments already used, students were taught to use two <b>gyro</b> <b>instruments,</b> the magnetic compass, the rate-of-climb indicator, and the clock.|$|E
50|$|Though {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Yak-18, the Yak-20 had a welded steel tube fuselage which was skinned with aluminium alloy sheet and fabric, with aluminium alloy wings, skinned in metal back to the single spar, and fabric aft of the spar. Accommodation was side by side under a large blown canopy, which slid open to the rear. The cockpit had dual stick controls, with the pilot sitting on the left. There was a central push-pull throttle, and simple <b>gyro</b> <b>instruments.</b> The engine was the newly developed Ivchenko AI-10 five-cylinder radial. This engine was small and extremely light. It was rated at 80 hp, driving a V-515 controllable-pitch counterweight propeller. Fuel was carried in two 35 liter (7.7 gallon) tanks in the wing roots, ahead of the single spar.|$|E
5000|$|RLGs require {{accurate}} machining, use {{of precision}} mirrors, and assembly under clean room conditions. Their mechanical dithering assemblies add somewhat to their weight but not appreciably. RLGs {{are capable of}} logging in excess of 100,000 hours of operation in near-room temperature conditions. Their lasers have relatively high power requirements. [...] Interferometric FOGs are purely solid-state, require no mechanical dithering components, do not require precision machining, {{are not subject to}} lock-in, have a flexible geometry, and can be made very small. They use many standard components from the telecom industry. In addition, the major optical components of FOGs have proven performance in the telecom industry, with lifespans measured in decades. However, the assembly of multiple optical components into a precision <b>gyro</b> <b>instrument</b> is costly. Analog FOGs offer the lowest possible cost but are limited in performance; digital FOGs offer the wide dynamic ranges and accurate scale factor corrections required for stringent applications. Use of longer and larger coils increases sensitivity at the cost of greater sensitivity to temperature variations and vibrations.|$|R

Many private vessels sortied from Papeete harbor that night with more joining at first light to aid in the search for survivors. The bodies of several of the flight attendants were the only ones recovered. Speculation at the time at Pan Am on the cause of the {{accident}} also considered a catastrophic windshield failure, as well as <b>gyro</b> horizon <b>instrument</b> failure.

40|$|In 1817, F. Bohnenberger {{presented}} an apparatus {{consisting of a}} fast spinning rotor with cardanic suspension. His invention {{formed the basis for}} L. Foucault’s epochal studies on gyroscopic sensors {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. The development of instruments like the artificial horizon and the directional gyro is a direct result of this work. Later on, gyro technology led also to stabilized platforms forming the early variants of inertial navigation systems. Foucault’s initial intention of using Bohnenberger’s invention as a sensor was the provision of a device offering an inertial direction reference for surveying and navigation. Due to technical limitations, a gyro is, however, suitable for such a task during only a limited period of time. To enable a long-term usage, additional, complementary measurements are required. An artificial horizon therefore includes levelling sensors, and a directional gyro is typically coupled with a magnetic compass. On the other hand, the main feature of integrated navigation systems is the fusion of data from dis-similar signal sources. Thus, artificial horizons and directional gyros represent elementary forms of such systems. Modern integrated navigation systems of high performance consist of the combination of inertial strapdown systems (being the successor of stabilized platforms) and GPS receivers. In photogrammetry, they have become an essential tool for direct georeferencing. Nevertheless, their system structure is still traceable to the early <b>gyro</b> <b>instruments</b> mentioned. This classical system design being outlined in the following opens perspectives for new developments...|$|E
40|$|The Hybrid Navigation System {{is being}} {{developed}} to achieve the required attitude accuracy and calculate a navigation solution for the SHEFEX 2 mission, which will be launched in February 2012 from Andø ya Rocket Range in Norway by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches-Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR). This system fuses data from an IMU, GPS receiver, and star tracker using the extended Kalman filter. For testing it needs a realistic software- and hardware-in-the-loop test bench that can simulate the expected flight conditions and test the system. The hardware test bench requirements include: real-time simulation progression, accurate synchronization of all components, and providing stimulation inputs for the GPS receiver, star tracker and <b>gyro</b> <b>instruments</b> (inside the IMU) representative of the expected flight profile. Another key requirement is that the test bench must be easily reconfigurable by swapping real and modeled instruments. This allows the system to be tested with variable levels of complexity, which decreases debugging time by allowing the user to separate or remove the problem points by simply swapping cables. The developed software-in-the-loop simulation consists of the navigation flight code wrapped in a Simulink s-function and fed by several high-fidelity Matlab/Simulink models which simulate the rocket dynamics and system sensors. The hardware-in-the-loop test bench runs the models from the software simulation on a dSPACE real-time simulator, which feeds the modeled sensor outputs to the hybrid navigation system's navigation computer. With {{the help of a}} Spirent GSS 7700 GPS signal generator, a Jenoptik Optical Sky field Simulator, and an Acutronic 3 -axis rotation table all synchronized to the dSPACE simulation, the modeled sensors can be replaced with real sensors fed with stimulated input. Navigation results from the hardware test bench are compared with results from the software-in-the-loop simulation to ensure that the hardware-in-the-loop simulation is working correctly...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} a {{study of}} the gyroscope and the gyrotheodolite, tunnel control networks and a case study of geodetic reference networks and survey methods in the Project Hallandsås. The Project Hallandsås is a railroad tunnel project through the ridge of Hallandsås in the south of Sweden. Two parallel, 9 kilometres long, tunnels are to be constructed. The railway through these tunnels will smooth a difficult section of the Swedish main western railroad. The tunnel is excavated and lined with enforced concrete using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). The demands of accuracy of geodetic reference networks in a tunnel projectare high and in projects using TBM:s, even higher. The total breakthrough accuracy in Project Hallandsås is ± 100 mm. Of this the surveys may use half of this tolerance, i. e. ± 50 mm. The possibility to do accurate surveys and establish accurate reference network are limited. In the normal case when construction takes place on the surface, the first thing that is done is to establish a site-specific geodetic network. The networks are connected to national networks or other regional networks surrounding the construction site. To have a superordinate site-specific geodetic network is also possible for a tunnel project. The differences begin with the establishment of working/construction networks below the superordinate network through densification of higher project networks. In the surface construction case it ispossible to connect the surveys to points that surround the construction area and once the networks are adjusted and checked for errors toward all points, construction may begin. This last procedure is not possible when a tunnel is excavated. However, there are methods to optimise the tunnel control network. This thesis will {{look at some of these}} methods, particularly on how different configurations of network affect the breakthrough accuracy and possibility to check the networks through redundant surveys. The <b>gyro</b> <b>instrument,</b> correctly used, is one of the most important methods to both check and improve the accuracy of the tunnel control network. The studies in this thesis will show that the breakthrough error of an open end traverse is much improved by using gyro observations, and that a more redundant network is also improved but to a lower degree. We will also seethat the gyro observations plays a significant role in checking the open-ended traverse for errors even though more redundant network will always be betterfor the checking and elimination of errors. This thesis will only discuss surveys in the plane coordinate system...|$|R

40|$|Strap-down {{inertial}} navigation system (SDINS) is considered as a highly sophisticated dead reckoning system. The SDINS consists mainly of two triads {{the first is the}} three gyros triad, and the second is the three accelerometers triad. Modeling the SDINS has achieved a lot of importance in the literature, especially for surveying applications. However, using the SDINS for spacecraft applications imply some modifications to the SDINS deterministic models used for surveying applications. Traditional models of the SDINS include the effect of the earth rotational rate on the SDINS <b>instruments</b> (<b>gyros,</b> and accelerometers). This effect must be removed from the instrument model if the SDINS is to be used onboard of a spacecraft simply because the spacecraft doesn’t rest on the earth, and thus doesn’t sense the earth’s rotational rate. Necessary modifications of the accompanying algorithms are derived analytically in the research at hand...|$|R

40|$|A ring laser {{gyroscope}} (gyro) {{is an active}} laser interferometer designed to sense rotation through the Sagnac frequency shift encountered by two beams travelling in opposite directions around a closed path. The classes of devices considered in this thesis are the large and ultra-large ring laser <b>gyros.</b> These <b>instruments</b> are designed for direct measurement of earth rotation rate and find applications in geodesy, geophysics, and tests of physical theories. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the demonstration of new techniques for operating ring laser gyros. The main goal of these techniques has been the correction for variations in the geometry of an ultra-large ring laser gyro, UG- 3. This instrument is a 77 m perimeter ultra-large ring laser gyro of heterolithic construction and is the primary instrument used in the experiments presented here. UG- 3 {{has been used to}} demonstrate measurement of earth strains which have been used to correct for changes in the geometry of the instrument. It has also been used to demonstrate a control technique where the co-rotating beams were alternately offset allowing the number of wavelengths around the perimeter to be counted and a Sagnac rotation signal to be obtained. Among the most important outcomes of this research of interest to the large ring laser gyro community is that we now understand most of the problems that would affect a next generation ring laser gyro. This understanding allows us to choose an operational technique best suited to the measurements being made and thus maximise the scientific potential of the instrument. Additionally, {{the development of a new}} standard for data storage and an associated suite of software to acquire, query and analyse ring laser data is expected to improve collaboration with the wider research community. Other research outcomes of more general interest include the analysis of how oscillation of a single mode is established in a high finesse laser cavity. We demonstrate that the ultimate mode of operation can be selected with a ‘seed’ beam of exceptionally low intensity. An interesting related outcome is the demonstration of Sagnac beat frequency measurement during the ring down of a ring cavity, a type of measurement immune to dispersive and flow related frequency shifts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative {{application of the}} Particle Filtering techniques to the Vertical Gyro problem, which is a highly nonlinear and non Gaussian recursive state estimation problem. The classical approach to recursive state estimation problem of nonlinear and/or non Gaussian systems {{is based on the}} Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is a heuristic method based on the linearization of the state dynamics and observations near a nominal path. Depending on the amount of nonlinearities and non Gaussian noise, the EKF often provides a solution far from acceptable. 12 The Vertical <b>Gyro</b> is an <b>instrument</b> adopted to measure the tilt angles (pitch and roll) of an aircraft with respect to local vertical. It is composed by three orthogonal gyros that are used as process sensors and by three orthogonal accelerometers that are used as aiding sensors. The output of accelerometers is filtered using a proper low-pass filter to allow for the estimation of the local direction of the gravity vector that is assumed the same of the local vertical. In the application to the Vertical Gyro, Gordon’s version of the Particle Filter was used. The relevant dynamical model is based on non-linear attitude rate equation using Euler Angles rather than quaternions. The algorithm, developed in Matlab environment, was first calibrated and tested in simulations, obtaining very appealing performances. Subsequently, it was implemented using real data, acquired by means of an inertial unit produced by CrossbowTM (model DMU-HDXTM), and its results were compared to those provided by the proprietary EKF embedded in the unit. First of all, stationary tests were performed. Sensor data were input to the Particle Filter that outputs the tilt angles (roll and pitch) with respect to the local geodetic reference. The results were compared to those provided by the internal EKF. Subsequently, the same operation was done using data that were acquired with moving platform. The accuracy of the filter was tested also for degraded operating conditions (lower data rates) and large initial errors. The main advantage of the methodology is that, while the internal filter works with 7 states (quaternions, biases and temperature), the Particle Filter ensures the convergence with 3 states, and provides acceptable performances with 1000 particles only, appearing promising for a real time application...|$|R
