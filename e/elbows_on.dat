5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope match between Randy Orton and Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes started the match by {{performing}} {{a series of}} <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> Orton's head. Orton, however, took the advantage after hitting Rhodes' head several times with the cowbell, {{which was in the}} middle of the rope connecting the two men. After a final hit to the head, Orton pinned Rhodes to win the match. After the match, Orton attempted to punt Rhodes in the head, but Rhodes' son, Cody, made the save.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} room, {{there is a}} statue of a man resting his <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> a balustrade.

500|$|The 12-6 elbow {{has often}} been criticized for its brutality, however, the rules prohibiting them have also been criticized. In particular, {{it has been argued}} that the term [...] "downward elbow strikes" [...] is too strict, as it only applies to {{straight}} motions and does not make <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> an arc illegal. Matt Hume, chief referee of the One Fighting Championship, explained that while 12-6 elbows were illegal, [...] "if you change the time to 11:59, it is no longer illegal." [...] Hume felt that the authors of the Unified Rules did not have an understanding of MMA, with McCarthy affirming that view by stating that Lembo [...] "wasn't a big MMA guy at the time". Hume also argued that the rule meant that other elbow strikes that could gain more velocity than 12-6 elbows were legal yet were hitting with the same point of the elbow.|$|E
2500|$|The pfifltriggi (singular pfifltrigg) have tapir-like heads (with a bulge at {{the back}} {{implying}} a large brain) and frog-like bodies; they lean their <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> the ground when at rest, and sometimes when working with their hands.

Their sense of humor is [...] "sharp and excelled in abuse" [...] (Chap. 18).|$|E
