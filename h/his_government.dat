5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and <b>his</b> <b>government.</b> He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. <b>His</b> <b>government</b> had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E

50|$|Weir called four by-elections {{in early}} 1969, largely to test <b>his</b> <b>government's</b> {{popularity}} on the bilingualism issue.

5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} {{was between the}} desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, {{and to protect the}} country's environment from the pollution caused by those industries.

5|$|After Ottawa {{lost the}} Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906, McGee retired at just 23years old.

Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in <b>his</b> <b>government,</b> {{but this was not}} entirely successful. He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted, and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro-Domitianic faction of the Senate, he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} Reitz {{was one of}} {{the first}} Afrikaners to actively develop a so-called Bantu policy, in philosophy and terminology going beyond contemporary ideas on segregation between white and black. Under <b>his</b> <b>government</b> Indian immigrants were by law forbidden to settle in the Orange Free State (1890). This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town, in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established.|$|E

5|$|Back at home, Quisling was {{now less}} {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up the}} membership list, including purging it of drunkards.

5000|$|He is {{considered}} by academics and historians {{to be one of}} New Zealand's greatest and most revered Prime Ministers.

Exemplifying his enthusiasm for <b>his</b> <b>government's</b> policies, Savage personally assisted a family in Fife Lane, Miramar, Wellington, to move their furniture into the first of the government's 1930s state houses.|$|R
5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 <b>his</b> <b>government</b> received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E
