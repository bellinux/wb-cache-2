5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> out {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E

25|$|On Friday, February 26, 1993, Ramzi Yousef and a Jordanian friend, Eyad Ismoil, drove {{a yellow}} Ryder van into Lower Manhattan, and {{pulled into the}} public parking garage beneath the World Trade Center around noon. They parked on the {{underground}} B-2 level. Yousef ignited the 20-foot fuse, and fled. Twelve minutes later, at 12:17:37p.m., the bomb exploded in the underground garage, generating an estimated pressure of 150,000 psi. The bomb opened a 30-m (98ft) wide hole through four sublevels of concrete. The detonation velocity of this bomb was about 15,000ft/s (4.5km/s). Initial news reports indicated a main transformer may <b>have</b> <b>blown,</b> before {{it became clear that}} a bomb had exploded in the basement.|$|E

25|$|Glossopteris {{leaves are}} morphologically simple {{so there are}} few {{characters}} {{that can be used}} to differentiate species. Consequently, many past researchers have considered the Permian Glossopteris flora to be rather homogeneous with the same species distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere. However, more recent studies of the more morphologically diverse fertile organs have shown that taxa had more restricted regional distributions and several intra-gondwanan floristic provinces are recognizable. Seeds, much too large to be wind-borne, could not <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> across thousands of miles of open sea, nor is it likely they have floated across vast oceans. Observations such as these led the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to deduce that there had once been a land bridge between these areas. He named this large land mass Gondwanaland (named after the district in India where the plant Glossopteris was found). These same observations would also lend support to Alfred Wegener's Continental drift theory.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks–Sharks Conference Quarterfinals {{was only}} the second series in NHL history to pit two Californian teams against one another; the first took place in 1968–69 between the Los Angeles Kings and the Oakland Seals. The Ducks stunned the Sharks by winning {{the first two games}} in San Jose 2–0 and 3–2. Jonas Hiller took over the {{starting}} job from Giguere and recorded his first NHL playoff shutout. Back at home for Game 3, the game was tied at three in the third period when Corey Perry took a hooking penalty and Patrick Marleau scored on the ensuing power play to win the game. Game 4 was completely dominated by the Ducks, prevailing 4–0. The first chance for the Ducks to eliminate the Sharks came in Game 5 at San Jose which went into overtime where once again Marleau was the hero after scoring the game-winner. In Game 6, the Ducks received goals from Perry, Selanne, Beauchemin and Getzlaf to win the game 4–1 and the series four games to two. The Ducks became just the fourth team to beat the Presidents' Trophy winner in the playoffs' first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Ducks faced a familiar foe in the Detroit Red Wings. In Game 1, Nicklas Lidstrom scored in the final minute to win it for Detroit, 3–2. In Game 2, Todd Marchant scored in triple overtime to even the series at one game apiece. It was the first playoff game to go at least three overtimes for the Ducks since game one of the 2003 Conference Semifinals against Dallas. (That game had ended after five overtime periods.) The Ducks won Game 3 on a controversial goal scored by Marian Hossa. The referee claimed to <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> the whistle before the puck went in. Game 4 was all Detroit by a final score of 6–3. Hiller was pulled in the third period after giving up five goals. A pivotal Game 5 was won by the Red Wings, 4–1. However, the Ducks evened the series at three with a 2–1 win the game six. In the Ducks' first Game 7 since the 2006 Conference Quarterfinals against Calgary, Detroit got out to a 2–0 lead. Selanne then scored a power play goal to cut the lead, but Detroit scored again to make it 3–1. Perry scored next to trim the lead to 3–2 and in the third period, Ryan scored to tie the game at 3–3. Detroit's Daniel Cleary, however, scored with three minutes left in regulation to end the Ducks' season.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, Lieutenant Colonel Richard J. Dunn was {{appointed}} as bandmaster. As {{a former member}} of John Philip Sousa's Marine Band and with 26 years of military band leadership experience, Dunn quickly instituted changes within the band. The first was to the position of bugler, whose duties had fallen to the bandmaster since 1894. When informed that he was expected to fill the role, Dunn told college officials, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> enough bugles. I am the Bandmaster. Someone else can blow the bugle calls."

In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band's involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, [...] "We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren't endorsing it, but that would <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> the whole thing out of proportion ...

[...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years."

500|$|The way the {{situation}} had been handled was subject to criticism; firstly, the choice by Carmichael-Smyth to hold the firing drill parade was immediately criticised by his superior, Hewitt, who felt that had the parade not been held, the issue with the cartridges [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> over." [...] Furthermore, a junior officer from Carmichael-Smyth's regiment, Lieutenant John Campbell MacNabb, felt that the drill parade was unnecessary and stated that the dislike held by the men toward their commanding officer was an aggravating factor in the events that followed. When Hewitt informed the Commander in Chief, Major General George Anson, about the public nature of the men's sentence, and of placing them in irons {{in front of the}} entire Meerut Division, on 9 May, Anson confirmed the sentences but did not approve of the [...] "unusual procedure" [...] that Hewitt had followed. For his conduct on 10 May, Hewitt later faced criticism from Lieutenant General Sir Patrick Grant, (who was the acting Commander in Chief by that point, following Anson's death) and from John Lawrence (who was then Commissioner of Punjab province). Following the mutiny of the troops at Meerut, Hewitt's command of the Meerut Division was taken away. At a subsequent appeal, Hewitt and his immediate subordinate, Brigadier General Archdale Wilson of the Bengal Artillery, blamed each other for the way {{the situation}} unfolded; Hewitt said that Wilson was responsible for the tactics on the day, and Wilson stated that as Hewitt was the overall commander, responsibility lay with him; Hewitt lost the appeal. The historian Kim A. Wagner, in his 2010 book The Great Fear of 1857, stated that the senior officers' fear of [...] "making a 'wrong decision'" [...] led them to make no decision at all, [...] "with devastating results".|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after Maserfield, Penda also destructively waged war against Oswiu of Bernicia on his own territory. At one point before the death of Bishop Aidan (31 August 651), Bede says that Penda [...] "cruelly ravaged the country of the Northumbrians far and near" [...] and besieged the royal Bernician stronghold of Bamburgh. When the Mercians were unable to capture it—"not being able to enter it by force, or by a long siege"—Bede reports that they {{attempted}} to set the city ablaze, {{but that it was}} saved by a sacred wind supposedly sent in response to a plea from the saintly Aidan: [...] "Behold, Lord, how great mischief Penda does!" [...] The wind is said to <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> the fire back towards the Mercians, deterring them from further attempts to capture the city. At another point, some years after Aidan's death, Bede records another attack. He says that Penda led an army in devastating the area where Aidan died—he [...] "destroyed all he could with fire and sword"—but that when the Mercians burned down the church where Aidan died, the post against which he was leaning {{at the time of his}} death was undamaged; this was taken to be a miracle. No open battles are recorded as being fought between the two sides before the Winwaed in 655 (see below), however, and this may mean that Oswiu deliberately avoided battle due to a feeling of weakness relative to Penda. This feeling may have been in religious as well as military terms: N. J. Higham wrote of Penda acquiring [...] "a pre-eminent reputation as a god-protected, warrior–king", whose victories may have led to a belief that his pagan gods were more effective for protection in war than the Christian God.|$|E
500|$|An {{earthquake}} {{on the sea}} bed—a [...] "seaquake"—could {{have caused}} sufficient turbulence on the surface to damage parts of Mary Celestes cargo, thus releasing noxious fumes. Rising fears of an imminent explosion could plausibly have led Briggs to order the ship's abandonment; the displaced hatches suggest that an inspection, or an attempted airing, had taken place. The New York World of January 24, 1886, drew attention to a case where a vessel carrying alcohol had exploded. The same journal's issue of February 9, 1913, cited a seepage of alcohol through a few porous barrels {{as the source of}} gases that may have caused or threatened an explosion in Mary Celestes hold. Briggs's cousin Oliver Cobb was a strong proponent of this theory as providing a sufficiently alarming scenario—rumblings from the hold, the smell of escaping fumes and possibly an explosion—for Briggs to have ordered the evacuation of the ship. In his haste to leave the ship before it exploded, Briggs may have failed to properly secure the yawl to the tow line. A sudden breeze could <b>have</b> <b>blown</b> the ship away from the occupants of the yawl, leaving them to succumb to the elements. The lack of damage from an explosion and the generally sound state of the cargo upon discovery tend to weaken this case. In 2006 an experiment was carried out for Channel Five television by Andrea Sella of University College, London, the results of which helped to revive the [...] "explosion" [...] theory. Sella built a model of the hold, with paper cartons representing the barrels. Using butane gas, he created an explosion that caused a considerable blast and ball of flame—but contrary to expectation, no fire damage within the replica hold. [...] "What we created was a pressure-wave type of explosion. There was a spectacular wave of flame but, behind it, was relatively cool air. No soot was left behind and there was no burning or scorching." ...|$|E
