500|$|Cotto's next {{scheduled}} {{match was}} against the then-undefeated Paul Malignaggi in a fight that took place on June 10, 2006 in Madison Square Garden. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance {{over the course of}} the fight, by stating [...] "this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And it bothered me the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, as <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> champion". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1989, Hughes {{signed on}} as captain of Natal in the South African Currie Cup competition. His two seasons with Natal were disappointing for the team and himself; Natal {{struggled}} {{on the field and}} there was disharmony amongst the squad. With the bat he scored 176 runs at an average of 13.53 in 1989–90 and 266 at 24.16 in 1990–91. He did, however, have a positive influence on two cricketers who later represented South Africa. Andrew Hudson claimed that [...] "Kim installed a positiveness and a self-belief" [...] in him and Jonty Rhodes—who stayed in Hughes' home during Natal home matches—wanted to play with the same passion as Hughes: [...] "There are too many robots...Kim was emotional because he cared. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same." [...] During his second season at Natal, Hughes was dropped from the Natal side and later was dropped from the Natal [...] "B" [...] side. He retired from all first-class cricket in February 1991.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} many {{explicit}} sex scenes, including a tryst {{in a restaurant}} bathroom and a passionate exchange in an apartment building hallway. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were demanding for the actors, especially for Lane, {{who had to be}} emotionally and physically fit for the scenes. To prepare for the initial love scene between Paul and Constance, Lyne had the actors watch clips from Fatal Attraction, Five Easy Pieces, and Last Tango in Paris. Lane and Martinez would also talk over the scenes in his trailer beforehand. Once on the set, they felt uncomfortable until several takes in. She said, [...] "My comfort level with it just had to catch up quickly if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> actress to play it." [...] Martinez was not comfortable with nudity.

Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, [...] "It got pretty dark. My friends thought I was going to die. I was blind to it.

I hoped something {{would happen to the}} coral builders and their island; but I was so curious that I couldn't keep away, and, on going back there, I found a settlement of fishermen, and the beginning of a thriving town. Now I should have been in a towering passion at this, if in my travels I hadn't discovered a race of little creatures as much smaller than polypes as a mouse is smaller than an elephant. I heard two learned men talking about diatoms, as they sailed to Labrador; and I listened. They said these people lived in both salt and fresh water, and were found {{in all parts of the}} world. They were a glassy shell, holding a soft, golden-yellow substance, and that they were so countless that banks were made of them, and that a town here in these United States was founded on them. They were the food of many little sea-animals, who, in turn, fed us big creatures, and were very interesting and wonderful. I saved up this story; and, when the polypes asked if they hadn't done what they intended, I told them I didn't think it so very remarkable, for the tiny diatoms made cities, and were far more astonishing animals than they. I thought that would silence them; but they just turned round, and informed me that my diatoms were plants, not animals,--so my story was all humbug. Then I was mad; and couldn't get over the fact that these little rascals had done what we, the kings of the sea, couldn't do. I wasn't content with being the biggest creature there: <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most skilful also.
