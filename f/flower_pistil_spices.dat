40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] influence of pre-blossom temperatures on flower development and fruit set is ascertained in apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.), a species without previous records {{on the effect}} of pre-blossom temperature on fruit set, but that is particularly prone to erratic fruit set. A polyethylene cage was used during pre-blossom development of flower buds to increase maximum temperatures by 6 – 7 °C and mean temperatures by 3 °C in orchard conditions. This increase in temperature accelerated flower bud development, caused a hastening in flowering time and following hand-pollination, reduced fruit set. At anthesis, flowers that had developed in warmer conditions weighed less and showed less development of the <b>pistil</b> than control <b>flowers.</b> <b>Pistil</b> growth of <b>flowers</b> under warm conditions did not differ from that of the control flowers when both the populations were compared on a real time scale {{in spite of the fact}} that warmed buds were at an advanced external phenological stage.

The number of flowers was reduced in the presence of IAA (with or without fruit set), or following fruit set by pollination.

The positive impact of P nutrition on the productivity parameters was not related to carbohydrate reserves or to carbohydrate transport to the developing inflorescence. Phosphorous deficient trees showed significant impairment of assimilation rate, and yet, carbohydrates were accumulated in inflorescences at levels comparable to or higher than trees receiving high P. In contrast to female reproductive organs, pollen viability was consistently higher in P deficient trees, possibly due to the enhanced carbohydrate availability. Overall, the positive effect of P on female reproductive development was found to be independent of the total carbohydrate availability. Hence, P is speculated to have a direct influence on reproductive processes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin on pollen-pistil interactions in Brassica. Inhibitor-treated flowers or floral buds were pollinated with untreated pollen and examined for pollen tube growth by fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that type 1 or type 2 A serine/threonine phosphatases {{play a crucial role in}} the pollination responses of Brassica. We observed two distinct effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors on pollination: (a) the inhibition of pollen tube growth during cross-pollination in flowers, and (b) the break-down of self-incompatibility or promotion of pollen tube growth during self-pollination in flower buds just prior to anthesis. Thus, treatment of <b>flower</b> <b>pistils</b> with protein phosphatase inhibitors resulted in the inhibition of pollen tube growth at the surface of the papillar cells of the stigma in crosses between different self-incompatible Brassica oleracea strains, in an interspecific cross between B. oleracea and Brassica campestris, and in self-pollinations of a self-fertile Brassica napus cultivar. With four different self-incompatibility genotypes, treatment of mature flowers with protein phosphatase inhibitors had no effect on self-pollination response. In contrast, treatment of flower buds just prior to the anthesis stage allowed self-pollen tube invasion of papillar cells. However, the magnitude of this effect was genotype dependent, being most pronounced in the S 22 genotype. The data support the conclusion that pollinations in Brassica are controlled in part by the presence of phosphorylated proteins in the papillar cells of the stigma, and that the quantity of these proteins or their levels of phosphorylation changes during stigma development...|$|R

Apricot is genetically prone to the formation of a high percentage of flowers morphologically hermaphroditic but physiologically unisexual due to pistil hypotrophy, atrophy and/or necrosis. The number of anthers, the amount of the total and stainable number of pollen grains per anther and per <b>flower</b> and <b>flower</b> (<b>pistil)</b> anomalies have been investigated in apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) cultivars. Anthers and pollen were investigated for two years, 2004 and 2005, whereas flower bud differentiation and anomalies for three years, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Pistil hypo(a) -trophy anomalies occurred between the Baggiolini stages C and D and appeared to be significantly more frequent on the basal portion of long twigs with respect to either the apical portion or spurs and short twigs. All pollen characteristics taken into account varied significantly among the cultivars. The number of anthers per flower ranged from a maximum of 33. 2 ('Rouge de Fournes') to a minimum of 22. 6 ('Boccuccia Liscia'); the number of pollen grains per anther ranged from 2369 ('Kioto') to 1267 ('Ninfa'), and the pollen stainability was very high in all the examined cultivars (95. 0 - 98. 8 %). The mean number of stainable pollen grains per flower was 57, 149, ranging from 35, 629 ('Boccuccia Liscia') up to 76, 728 ('San Castrese').

40|$|Pollen {{tubes are}} polarly growing plant {{cells that are}} able to respond to a {{combination}} of chemical, mechanical, and electrical cues during their journey through the <b>flower</b> <b>pistil</b> in order to accomplish fertilization. How signals are perceived and processed in the pollen tube is still poorly understood and evidence for electrical guidance, in particular, is vague and highly contradictory. To generate reproducible experimental conditions for ex vivo pollen cell cultures, here we present a low-cost, reusable Electrical Lab-on-a-Chip (ELoC) for investigating the influence of electric fields on growing cells. Viability of pollen growth using a structured microfluidic network is first investigated and validated. Then the integration of microelectrodes into the device is addressed in detail. Characterization of the pollen growth medium conductivity and simulation of the ELoC electrical configuration were carried out to define the experimental conditions. Reusability of the microdevice is achieved by structuring the design into two separate rebondable modules: a microfluidic module and a microelectrode module. Two experimental approaches were realized: a batch design for exposing simultaneously a large number of cells to a global electric field, and a single-cell design in which a localized electric field is applied to individual cells. Extensive batch results indicate that DC fields were inhibitory above 6 V/cm. However, switching to AC fields re-established pollen tube growth at frequencies above 100 mHz, suggesting a significant role of the medium conductivity in controlling the cellular response. Unlike macroscopic open-assay experimental setups, single-cell tests further indicate no reorientation of pollen tube growth, suggesting that previously reported tropic behavior was caused by ion movement in the substrate rather than by a direct effect of the electric field on the cell...|$|R

40|$|Systemins {{and their}} hydroxyproline-rich {{glycopeptide}} systemin (ppHS) subfamily members {{are known to}} mediate antiherbivore defenses in some solanaceous taxa but not others; functions other than in defense remain largely unexplored. Nicotiana attenuata's ppHS is known not to function in herbivore defense. NappHS transcripts are abundant in <b>flowers,</b> particularly in <b>pistils,</b> and when two N. attenuata accessions from Utah and Arizona were transformed to silence NappHS by RNAi (IRsys), seed capsule production and seed number per capsule were reduced in both accessions. These reductions in reproductive performance could not be attributed to impaired pollen or ovule viability; hand-pollination of all IRsys lines of both accessions restored seed production per capsule to levels found in wild-type plants. Rather, changes in flower morphology that decreased the efficiency of self-pollination are likely responsible: IRsys plants of both accessions have <b>flowers</b> with <b>pistils</b> that protrude beyond their anthers. Because these changes in flower morphology are reminiscent of CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 -silenced N. attenuata plants, we measured jasmonates (JAs) and their biosynthetic transcripts in different floral developmental stages, and found levels of JA-isoleucine (Ile) /leucine and threonine deaminase transcripts, which are abundant in wild-type pistils, to be significantly reduced in IRsys buds and flowers. Threonine deaminase supplies Ile for JA-Ile biosynthesis, and we propose that ppHS mediates JA signaling during flower development and thereby changes flower morphology.

Conventional methods include steam distillation, liquid–liquid extraction, adsorption, solid-phase extraction, wet air oxidation, catalytic wet air oxidation and biodegradation {{for the removal of}} phenols. Highly developed technologies are also there for treatment of phenol such as electrochemical oxidation, photo-oxidation, ozonation, Fenton reaction, membrane processes and microbial and enzymatic treatment (Mohammadi et al. 2015). Enzymes have several favourable characteristics. They have either narrowed or far-reaching specificity. Due to its specificity, enzymes show their functionality even in mixed compounds. Enzymes extensively alter structural and toxicological properties of contaminants into mild inorganic harmless end products. Furthermore, enzymes may present balance over traditional technologies and also over microbial remediation. All these characteristics turn enzymes into eco-friendly catalysts, and enzymatic techniques are environmentally affable processes (Rao et al. 2010). Peroxidases are the enzymes that catalyse the variety of organic and inorganic compounds at the expense of peroxide, usually H 2 O 2. Peroxidases tarnish phenolic compounds to simple radical species, which spontaneously produce insoluble oligo- or polymeric derivatives. These insoluble, polymerized products may be isolated using uncomplicated techniques like sedimentation and filtration techniques (Regalado et al. 2004). Maize silk is the name given to the long styles and stigmas on <b>flower</b> <b>pistils.</b> The stigmas are fine and soft, yellowish to green or purple threads of female flowers. Silk of some maize genotypes contains abundant phenolics, such as flavonoids, tannins and hydroxycinnamic acid esters. Besides their role in defence against pathogens and in host–plant resistance to insects, phenolics are implicated in free radical scavenging, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and defence against UV radiation. Of particular interest in maize are chlorogenic acid and some flavones with similar adjacent hydroxyl ring structure because they are implicated in corn earworm resistance (Elliger et al. 1980; Duffey and Stout 1996) and are considered as silk antibiotics. These adjacent hydroxyls undergo enzymatic oxidation resulting in the production of quinones, which condense with themselves or proteins to produce brown-coloured complexes. Two polyphenol oxidase enzymes, laccase (o- and p-diphenol oxidase, EC 1.10. 3.2) and catechol oxidase (o-diphenol oxidase, EC 1.10. 3.1), and POD (EC 1.11. 1.7) oxidize a large number of aromatic structures at the expense of O 2 or H 2 O 2, respectively (Pütter and Becker 1983; Mayer 1987; Pourcel et al. 2007). Oxidized phenolics protect sensitive plant tissues from biotic and abiotic stress (Hurrell et al. 1982; Duffey and Stout 1996).|$|R
