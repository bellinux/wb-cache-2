25|$|A Roomette, in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a <b>folding</b> <b>bed,</b> a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes {{are placed on both}} sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of Roomette.|$|E

I nailed {{a pair of}} cuffs on him {{one morning}} before he was awake; and I dragged him that evening to the palm-cage {{of one of the}} biggest hotels in the city--to see the Johnnies and the Alice-sit-by-the-hours. They were out in {{numerous}} quantities, with the fat of the land showing in their clothes. While we were looking them over, Solly divested himself of a fearful, rusty kind of laugh--like moving a <b>folding</b> <b>bed</b> with one roller broken.

60|$|So {{far from}} embarking at once for Europe, Mrs. Lander {{went to that}} hotel {{in a suburb of}} Boston, where she had the habit of passing the late autumn months, in order to fortify herself for the climate of the early winter months in the city. She was a little puzzled how to provide for Clementina, with respect to herself, but she decided that the best thing would be to have her sleep in a room opening out of her own, with a <b>folding</b> <b>bed</b> in it, so that it {{could be used as a}} sort of parlor for both of them during the day, and be within easy reach, for conversation, at all times.|$|E

Think that my {{sandwiches}} would be more relishing without so strong a flavor of napkin, and my gingerbread more easy of consumption {{if it had not been}} pulverized by being sat upon. People act as if early traveling didn't agree with them. Children scream and scamper; men smoke and growl; women shiver and fret; porters swear; great truck horses pace up and down with loads of baggage; and every one seems to get into the wrong car, and come tumbling out again. One man, with three children, a dog, a bird-cage, and several bundles, puts himself and his possessions into every possible place where a man, three children, dog, bird-cage and bundles could be got, and is satisfied with none of them. I follow their movements, with an interest that is really exhausting, and, as they vanish, hope for rest, but don't get it. A strong-minded woman, with a tumbler in her hand, and no cloak or shawl on, comes rushing through the car, talking loudly to a small porter, who lugs a <b>folding</b> <b>bed</b> after her, and looks as if life were a burden to him.|$|E

5000|$|Chevron folds are a {{structural}} feature characterized by repeated well behaved <b>folded</b> <b>beds</b> with straight limbs and sharp hinges. Well developed, these folds develop repeated set of v-shaped beds. [...] They develop {{in response to}} regional or local compressive stress. Inter-limb angles are generally 60 degrees or less. Chevron folding preferentially occurs when the bedding regularly alternates between contrasting competences. Turbidites, characterized by alternating high-competence sandstones and low-competence shales, provide the typical geological setting for chevron folds to occurs.|$|R

50|$|Infant beds can be {{stationary}} or portable (portacots, portacribs or <b>folding</b> infant <b>beds).</b> In their portable {{form the}} beds generally don't feature a dropside, and portability factors are emphasised. Portacots are often made from plastics, are often smaller and fold into a compact package. Rather than bars, {{they will have}} breathable mesh sides with an aperture too small for any finger to fit into (less than 5mm by the standards). Standards for <b>folding</b> infant <b>beds</b> exist for Australia and New Zealand, Europe and international (adopted by various organisations including the American National Standards Institute).|$|R
50|$|In a {{flexural}} slip algorithm deformation occurs by unfolding the deformed fault bounded horse by slip along bedding planes. This modelling mechanism does {{represent a}} real geological mechanism, {{as shown by}} slickensides along <b>folded</b> <b>bedding</b> planes. The shape of the unfolded horse is further constrained either by using the restored fault boundary to the previous horse in the restored section of by using an internal pin within the block itself, assuming this was unsheared during the deformation. This algorithm is normally only used in software based restoration. It preserves both area and line length.|$|R

The often obscure terminology used by miners and quarrymen was clarified by his dictionary of rock terms. Arkell was interested in the tectonic history of Southern England, particularly with reference to the highly <b>folded</b> <b>beds</b> of the Isle of Purbeck.

50|$|Donald {{goes back}} to bed, relieved. This time, however, {{whenever}} he turns out the lights his <b>folding</b> <b>bed</b> snaps shut with him inside. Donald struggles to get free, only to be launched into the ceiling by the bed springs.

The broken clock, however, reassembles itself just enough to ring its alarm. Donald sits up fast, and his bed flies apart, launching Donald into the air. He lands back down on his bed, now little more than a board with tacks in it, a sheet wrapped around his head like a turban. A sock lands in front of him on a spring, swaying back and forth so that he looks like an angry snake charmer and a frustrated Donald gives up.|$|E
50|$|Ross {{stand out}} from the many other {{campaign}} furniture makers of the period {{for a number of reasons}} but perhaps the most important is their originality in design. As can be seen from the adverts of the London makers of the day, such as Hill & Millard, J W Allen and Day & Son they were all making fairly similar campaign pieces. Their adverts would typically show a two part chest of drawers, a washstand, <b>folding</b> <b>bed</b> and a Douro pattern chair. There would be the odd item that was specific to a particular maker but generally by the mid 19th century there were standard pieces that most officers would require and which they could easily find from a number of makers. Apart from their most basic chest of drawers, which followed the traditional design, most items manufactured by Ross differed greatly to that by other makers. A number of their chests would have a clever, folding superstructure or an unusual combination of drawers, their washstands wouldn’t have the normal brass standards adopted by the other makers but have turned columns and their Easy Chairs would put comfort at a premium.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{proposes a}} {{structural}} {{solution to the}} <b>folding</b> <b>bed,</b> which is combined with a workspace that even after folding of the bed itself remains in the horizontal position, and therefore {{it is not necessary}} to clear away objects lying on it. The proposed design is based on theoretical knowledge of the subject, which are collected and shown in the first part of the text. The solution is therefore supported by both technical and safety requirements as well as requirements for anthropometry and ergonomics, especially of beds, but also of desks. The structural design is drawn up using form of manufacturing drawings including bill of materials, economic evaluation of the level of direct material costs, and created visualizations. At the same time it is based on gathered informations by research of Czech market in supply area of folding beds which was evaluated in terms of price, design, and materials used in the manufacturing process...|$|E
