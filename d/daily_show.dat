5|$|In Egypt, {{the show}} Al Bernameg is modeled after The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> as well. Host Bassem Youssef even imitates Jon Stewart's mannerisms, such as using his mug as a comedic prop. Youssef has {{appeared}} as a guest on The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> multiple times.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, the Persian-language satire program Parazit was {{directly}} inspired by The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> with the hosts even making a guest {{appearance on the}} January 20, 2011, episode of The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show.</b> Parazit was later succeeded by OnTen debuting on May 11, 2012.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout {{period on}} the show as a correspondent. Her {{credentials}} were questioned by Irin Carmon of the website Jezebel, who suggested that Munn was better known as a sex symbol than as a comedian. Carmon's column was denounced by Munn and the <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal {{on the show}}'s website in which they asserted that {{the description of the}} <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate. Munn appeared as a <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> correspondent in a total of 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> is an American late-night {{talk and}} news satire {{television}} program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing {{itself as a}} fake news program, The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well.|$|E

5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello {{to develop a}} new comedy series for Comedy Central, Strangers with Candy. Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show.</b> As a result, he {{accepted}} a reduced role, filming only around 20 <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> segments a year while he worked on the new series.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, {{the digital}} {{television}} channel More4 used to broadcast episodes of The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> Tuesday through Friday evenings with the Global Edition, which is uncensored, airs on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 {{was the first}} international broadcaster to syndicate entire <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references. The program was also available to watch via the internet video on demand service 4oD. However, the 'toss' to The Colbert Report was usually included {{even though it was}} aired on FX, another channel. In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.|$|E

5|$|On December 8, 2015, former host Jon Stewart {{returned}} to The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> {{for the first}} time in an extended length show to return attention to extending the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, otherwise referred to as 9/11 First Responders Bill, which Stewart explained had been blocked by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell for political reasons. On October 20, 2016, Noah was unable to host a scheduled taping of The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> due to illness, so correspondent Jordan Klepper guest hosted.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 2017, it was {{announced}} that Comedy Central had extended Trevor Noah's contract as host of The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> for five years, through 2022.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show,</b> disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> {{was created}} by Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg and premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, having been marketed as a {{replacement}} for Politically Incorrect (a successful Comedy Central program that had moved to ABC earlier that year). Madeleine Smithberg was co-creator of The <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> as well as the former executive producer. A graduate of Binghamton University, she was an executive producer of Steve Harvey's Big Time and a talent coordinator for Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} The Report was first {{seen in a}} series of <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> {{segments}} which advertised the then-fictional series as a joke. It was later developed by Stewart's Busboy Productions and pitched to Comedy Central, which green-lighted the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful <b>Daily</b> <b>Show</b> franchise beyond a half-hour. The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2million viewers nightly during its first week on the air. Comedy Central signed a long-term contract for The Colbert Report within its first month on the air, when it immediately established itself among the network's highest-rated shows.|$|E
