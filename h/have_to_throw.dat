25|$|Gouren, a {{style of}} folk wrestling, {{is the most popular}} Breton sport. The Boule bretonne is related to pétanque. The Palets, common in Upper Brittany and in other French regions, is also related to pétanque, but players use iron disks instead of balls and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> them on a wooden board.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Bouvet Island, Wasp {{continued}} eastward, {{reaching the}} Kerguelen Islands on December 31, 1822, where she remained for 11 days. The voyage then evidently continued {{to the south}} and east until February 1, 1823, when Morrell records his position as 65°52'S, 118°27'E. Here, Morrell says he took advantage of an eleven-knot breeze and turned the ship, to begin a passage westward. Apart from one undated position at 69°11'S, 48°15'E, Morrell's journal is silent until February 23, when he records crossing the Greenwich (0°) meridian. Historians have doubted whether such a long passage from 118°E, about , could have been made so quickly in ice-strewn waters and against the prevailing winds. Although some writers, including former Royal Navy navigator Rupert Gould, have argued that Morrell's claims as to speed and distance are plausible, Morrell's undated interim latitude was later shown to be well inside the Antarctic mainland territory of Enderby Land. Gould, writing in 1928 before the continental boundaries of this sector of Antarctica were known, based his support for Morrell on the premise that Enderby Land was an island with a sea channel south of it. He added: [...] "If at some future date Enderby Land is found to form part of the Antarctic continent, Morrell's most inveterate champions will, perforce, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> up the sponge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before 2000, the Laws of Cricket {{defined a}} catch as being {{completed}} when the player had [...] "complete {{control over the}} further disposal of the ball".

"I don't mind {{some kinds}} of pick and shovel work," [...] he said to Percival Serle, [...] "but when I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> heavy stuff over my {{shoulder}} it gives me rather a wrench."

[...] CBS Correspondent David Martin noted that during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan in the prior year, the U.S. forces were [...] "badly surprised by the willingness of al Qaeda to fight to the death. If the Iraqis fight, the U.S. would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in reinforcements and win the old fashioned way by crushing the Republican Guards, and that would mean more casualties on both sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Leach {{rushed for}} 65 yards and {{completed}} 9 of 15 passes for 151 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. [...] With Illinois putting seven or eight men on the line at times, no Michigan player was able to rush for 100 yards in the game. [...] Accordingly, Michigan opened up the passing attack. [...] Bo Schembechler said after the game, [...] "When they put that many people on the line of scrimmage, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the ball over their heads." [...] In addition to the touchdown pass to Lytle, Leach connected with tight end Mark Shmerge {{in the second quarter}} for a seven-yard touchdown pass. [...] Jim Smith also caught six passes for 127 yards. [...] Leach's two touchdown passes gave him 13 for the season, tying the Michigan record set in 1947 by Bob Chappuis. [...] After the game, Illinois coach Bob Blackman said, [...] "Leach is not just a good quarterback, he is a great quarterback. [...] We knew he could run the option, but he can also pass the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|The cup {{involves}} three players, {{arranged in}} a semi-circular cup-shaped formation, one {{in the middle and}} back, the other two on the sides and forward. One of the side players marks the handler with a force, while the other two guard the open side. Therefore, the handler will normally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> into the cup, allowing the defenders to more easily make blocks. With a cup, usually the center cup blocks the up-field lane to cutters, while the side cup blocks the cross-field swing pass to other handlers. The center cup usually also has the responsibility to call out which of the two sides should mark the thrower, usually the defender closest to the sideline of the field. The idea of the cup is to force the offense into making many short passes behind and around the cup. The cup (except the marker) must also remember to stay 3 meters or more away from the offensive player with the disc. [...] The only time a player in the cups can come within 3 meters of the player with the disc is when another offensive player comes within 3 meters of the person with the disc, also known as [...] "crashing the cup".|$|E
