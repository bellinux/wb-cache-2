25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its <b>data</b> <b>safety</b> and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E

This study is focused on improving emergency and non-emergency services (city resources) by using Participatory Crowdsourcing as a data collection method (collect public <b>safety</b> <b>data)</b> utilising voice technology in the form of an advanced IVR system known as the Spoken Web. The study illustrates how Participatory Crowdsourcing can be used as a Smart City initiative by illustrating what is required to contribute to the Smart City, and developing a roadmap in the form of a model to assist decision-making when selecting the optimal Crowdsourcing initiative. A Public <b>Safety</b> <b>Data</b> Quality criteria was also developed to assess and identify the problems affecting Data Quality.

These are required by agencies such as OSHA in its Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200.

The MSDSs differ from country to country, as different countries have different regulations. In some jurisdictions, it is compulsory for the SDS to state the chemical's risks, safety, and effect on the environment.|$|R

40|$|Today, drug <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> {{collection}} in India is both manual and electronic with reporting of potential overlapping and duplicate data, {{which is likely}} incomplete for further review and analysis. Furthermore, standardized data collection and timelines are not aligned with international standards. Complete coverage of <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> from all sources throughout {{the life of the}} drug cannot be ensured. There is no requirement to submit periodic <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> in clinical trials to regulatory authority. There is clearly a lack of emphasis on deriving meaningful <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> insights for ensuring patient safety. Efforts toward the early detection of drug safety issues are minimal. There is no mandate to publicly disclose drug safety findings. Benefit-risk evaluation of investigational and marketed products cannot be assured merely through annual status reports and periodic safety update reports, respectively. Focused initiatives involving stakeholders from regulatory, health-care, and pharmaceutical industries are required to change the current situation and enable derivation of meaningful insights from <b>safety</b> <b>data.</b> Equal emphasis on assessing real-time safety of the drugs and protection of patients' rights, safety, and well-being is required. Periodic <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> reporting in clinical trials, proactive <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> collection related to potential safety concerns, electronic medical records, electronic expedited reporting, collection of targeted data from stakeholders, and standardized and harmonized data collection aligned to the International Council for Harmonization guidelines are required.
