His second marriage was to a New York writer who didn't like sports {{and was unable to}} reach orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the some other version {{of events in the}} 'legend', which give <b>him</b> <b>no</b> title, may have been an attempt to discredit royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E

5|$|Aristodemus: The lone Spartan {{survivor}} of the slaughter of the 300 at the Battle of Thermopylae had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by Leonidas I because of an eye infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded <b>him</b> <b>no</b> special honour, because he failed {{to fight in the}} disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left <b>him</b> <b>no</b> choice but to continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or}} another on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E

You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

Before his marriage to Monique, Sihanouk had married five other women including Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, Mam Manivan Phanivong, and Thavet Norleak. Monikessan died of childbirth in 1946, and his marriages to the other women all ended in divorce.

Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his judgment and ordering such an assassination will make <b>him</b> <b>no</b> better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his brothers or nephews.|$|E

Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore <b>him</b> <b>no</b> ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland. He agreed to take the chair of Leyland in 1976 as a stop-gap measure but ended up holding the post {{for more than a}} year before the company, beset with strikes, nationalised and he handed the chair to Michael Edwardes. Clark remained a board member and in 1986 undertook discussions with General Motors in an attempt to get an increased bid for Leyland Vehicles, a bid later stopped by public outcry over the inclusion of the Land Rover name.|$|E
