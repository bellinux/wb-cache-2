The reform, however, did nothing to improve the life of peasants: they paid for the allotted land with labor service. The colonial powers tried hard to preserve the old order of things in the agrarian sector. The situation in Transcaucasia remained vague even when the reform based on the Regulations of 14 May, 1870 began; the local offi cial structures and top bureaucrats spared no <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>assure</b> <b>the</b> peasants that as soon as they redeemed their land they would no longer be tied to their landlords. The Council of Ministers gathered three times to discuss the Notes submitted on 22 November, 1905, which outlined the conditions on which the relations of dependence and temporary obligations could be discontinued by making the peasants owners of land without redemption payments and by shifting to the state treasury the burden of redemption payment to the landlords. The second draft was amended accordingly. In fact, before the second draft was submitted, the Viceroy and the Ministry of Internal Affairs had agreed that the land should not be transferred to the peasants free of charge: this looked like a fl agrant violation of the right of ownership; this explains the second (less radical) draft. On 19 December, 1912, the State Council approved the draft with no considerable changes; on 20 December it was signed by Emperor Nicholas II and became a law.

This poster outlines the process of the information management of the research outputs at TUT. The library is responsible for producing reports on university’s research outputs. The reporting on scientific expert tasks and publications for different purposes is produced via the university’s internal reporting system called Varasto. The material is collected and stored in 24 departments and transferred to Varasto from university’s current research information system called TUT Portfolio. TUT Portfolio is a portal to the academic expertise at TUT. It is maintained by the library and is freely available for all users on the web. Three different reports of departments’ achievements are produced monthly: the departments’ performance-based bonus system, university’s official statistics and the Ministry of Education statistics called Kota. The reports based on similar criteria are produced also for every researcher at TUT. At the end of the year, the university shares the profit money to the departments based on their achievements. The publications and scientific expertise tasks generate the different bonus according to the quality. The articles published in the peer-reviewed international journals are the most important. There are altogether 12 bonus categories in the university’s performance-based bonus system. The library is responsible for three of them. 30 % of the bonus money is shared by these three categories. Finnish universities adopted the new salary system and the important part of the system is the individual salary component based on the employee’s competence and performance.

Design and settings: The present study was a prospective multicenter study. Women from three major university hospitals in Norway were consecutively invited to participate and to answer two questionnaires. Data were collected approximately in gestational week 11 and 18 respectively (prior to and after the risk assessment) 211 women answered the first questionnaires and 146 answered both of the questionnaires. Measurements: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale {{was used to measure}} anxiety and depression, the Cambridge Worry Scale for measuring worry and the Satisfaction with Genetic Counseling Scale for measuring satisfaction with the counseling/information. Additionally the womens riskperception was assessed. Findings: There {{were no significant differences in}} the levels of anxiety and depression between the two measuring points. The total level of general worry decreased. Womens perceived risk of carrying a fetus with a chromosome anomaly was more accurate after counselling and testing. Conclusions: Risk assessment for chromosomal anomalies does not cause increased anxiety and depression in women with age related increased risk. The women were generally less worried after compared to prior to the he risk assessment compared, and they were very satisfied with the genetic counselling. Implications for practice: Many women with an age-related risk of carrying a fetus with a chromosome anomaly have a high perceived risk prior to having the risk assessment.

40|$|Lightweight {{structures}} {{have the}} advantages of being ecological, virtuous, and beautiful to the eyes. The transparency and the fluent geometry {{that can be achieved}} with these structures, make them a reference point in modern structural engineering. Their design and production attain to many challenging fields in engineering such as the digital fabrication, the control and optimization theory, and the smart structures. However, their slenderness returns an high sensitivity to instability problems. Stability of equilibrium has a key role in structural engineering: the multiple nature and the vast set of influencing factors makes necessary a constant investigation and development of focused approaches. Above all, the sudden character that distinguish the instabilities requires a consistent <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>assure</b> <b>the</b> safety of large and slender structures. Lastly, the interactive and dynamic essence of the instability demands a complex composition of solution schemes to treat it from a static point of view. Aim of this thesis is to study the interaction between the snap-through and the buckling and its effect on maximum load reduction, imperfection sensitivity, and especially on the variation in the structural behavior. Even if the dangerousness of the phenomenon is known, the problem requires a systematic treatment that concerns the study of the equilibrium paths. The path shape and characteristic provides crucial information about variation of inner forces regime, shallowness and slenderness effects, imperfections and connections influence. Hence, {{in the first part of}} the manuscript, a focused theoretical approach is devoted to the establish the describing and discriminating parameters. Additionally, a series of numerical simulations are presented to validate the formulations. Obtained results fulfill a first step in covering the gap between the physical knowledge of the problem and its actual scientific connotation. The results find an application in the stability of reticulated structures, commonly geometrically non-linear, but also a useful tool for the design and analysis of MEMS and micro-switchers. In this scale, the interaction phenomenon is too much often used for triggering a device without being completely grasped. The heinous data about mems collapse due to pull-in instability, about more than 40 % of mems broke in this manner, is a reliable witness. In the structural engineering field, from the famous collapses of the 60 's and 70 's to the 2014 emblematic collapses of more than 100 reticulated domes in China caused by some exceptional snow storms. International organizations, such as the IASS, redacted new guideline for design, constructions and reliability of metal roofs, demonstrating a renewed interest in the interactive collapses. Among all, new methods for taking into account the imperfection sensitivity has been presented, based on probabilistic approaches. In the second part of the thesis, using the results obtained for a simple structures, the structural weaknesses and flaws are investigated. The results suggest that the methods adopted, commonly used for Fracture Mechanics, are useful for studying the local instability occurrence and consequences. For classical morphologies, such as diamatic and geodesic domes, the elastic local collapses of lateral and compressive buckling appears to be responsible for sharp load decreases. At the same time, for grid shells, the high stiffness connections required, proves to be a trigger to progressive and catastrophic collapses. Identification of snap-back phenomena in the equilibrium path of these structures are similar to the shell and cylinders collapses, where the intensity of flexural and axial regime of forces determines the catastrophic degree of the fail. The concept illustrated in this manuscript can be used for the safety assessment of lightweight structures and for optimization criteria for mems and micro-scale material structure...|$|R

Peaches are a tree crop, so the fruit are never in contact with the soil, and fecal contamination from past land use is not a serious concern. Furthermore, the non-bearing orchard establishment phase allows time for any microbiological contamination present to have time to become inactivated. The possibility of toxic residues in the soil, such as heavy metals from sewage sludge or excessive pesticide residues, should receive greater scrutiny. Soils may also become naturally contaminated with animal feces. For example, deer browsing in peach orchards may leave fecal contamination behind. The key management imperative is that manure should never have an opportunity to come in contact with fruit. Drops or windfalls, peaches that fall to the ground, should never be picked up and utilized as fresh-market fruit. Irrigation Water.
