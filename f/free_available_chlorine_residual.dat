40|$|Performance {{assessment}} of WDS {{has been extensively}} reported in the research and practice literature. The use of performance indicators (PIs) can {{play a key role}} in the process of measuring the quality of service provided by the water utility, can simplify the comparison between different objectives, and help decision processes involved in the planning and management phases. The use of PIs like reliability, resiliency and vulnerability have been approved by many authors and researchers, and led to the achievement of wide numbers of research studies in multidisciplinary scientific fields (Hashimoto et al., 1982; Fiering, 1982 a; Merabtene et al., 2002). In reality, in WDS, different kinds of failure like that related to pressure, flow and water quality are linked with similar or same parameters. As a results, when one kind of failure occurred it also influences the other type of failure. Therefore, consideration of holistic system performance with regards to various aspects will make the process more complicated but decision makers will potentially gain insights into the performance of the whole system as well as the information on the impacts of each component and aspect on improving the overall performance. The proposed methodology is based on a hierarchical system approach that begins by identifying two aspects namely; hydraulic and water quality aspects, which could be divided broadly into available nodal pressure and available flow, and <b>available</b> <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration, respectively. Then, based on these services, three complementary reliability estimators (index) are adopted namely; demand-reliability, pressure-reliability, and quality-reliability. To reach the outcome of the proposed approach which is the overall reliability, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) coupled with fuzzy theory is then developed to bring all the reliability estimators into a unique platform and aggregate them into one index. The final model outcome is a single index that depicts the overall reliability which resembles both the hydraulic and water quality performances, and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the system...|$|R

The {{time required for}} 99. 9 % inactivation of ten enteroviruses and two adenoviruses by 0. 5 mg/l <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> at pH 7. 0 and 25 degrees C was prolonged approximately 4. 8 - 28. 8 times {{by the addition of}} 30 mg/l cyanuric acid. Comparative inactivation of poliovirus 1 by <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> with or without cyanuric acid revealed the following.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{procedure was}} developed to study the association of selected bacteria and macroinvertebrates and their response to <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> disinfection. The organisms selected for study were Escherichia coli (LacZ 545), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 23355), and the amphipod Hyalella azteca. E. coli was shown to bind tightly (1. 6 X 10 (4) CFU per amphipod) to this macroinvertebrate and to resist repeated attempts to wash it off. E. cloacae was shown to bind much less tightly (1. 4 X 10 (3) CFU per amphipod) to H. azteca and was less resistant to removal by washing. The extent of association {{is a function of}} macroinvertebrate size (surface area), but the procedure produces repeatable results usable for controlled experimentation. This method, together with the dual bacterial identification criteria (morphology and antibiotic resistance), was used to study the response of unassociated and associated E. coli and E. cloacae to disinfection with <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> at 1. 0 mg/liter.

5000|$|The {{presence}} of chlorine in traditional swimming pools {{can be described}} as a combination of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> (FAC) and combined <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> (CAC). While FAC is composed of the <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> that is <b>available</b> for sanitizing the water, the CAC includes chloramines, which are formed by the reaction of FAC with amines (introduced into the pool by human perspiration, saliva, mucus, urine, and other biologics). [...] Chloramines are responsible for the [...] "chlorine smell" [...] of pools, as well as skin and eye irritation. These problems are the result of insufficient levels of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine,</b> and indicate a pool that must be [...] "shocked" [...] by the addition of 5-10 times the normal amount of chlorine. [...] In saltwater pools, the generator uses electrolysis to continuously produce free chlorine. It also burns off chloramines {{in the same manner as}} traditional shock (oxidizer). As with traditionally chlorinated pools, saltwater pools must be monitored in order to maintain proper water chemistry. Low chlorine levels can be caused by insufficient salt, incorrect (low) chlorine-generation setting on the SWG unit, higher-than-normal chlorine demand, low stabilizer, sun exposure, or mechanical issues with the chlorine generator. Salt count can be lowered due to splash-out, backwashing, and dilution via rainwater.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Sodium {{hypochlorite}} (NaOCl) is {{an important}} tool in root canal disinfection although {{it is well known}} that the shelf-life of NaOCl is limited. In this study, NaOCl solutions that were collected from dental practices and were intended for endodontic irrigation were investigated to see whether they contained the expected concentration of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine.</b> Method and Materials: NaOCl solutions were collected from dental practices. The concentration of <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> per sample was determined with iodometric titration and the pH was measured. Each participating dentist completed a questionnaire that requested data on a range of issues relating to the assumed concentration of NaOCl and handling of the sample. Results: Eighty-four samples with questionnaires were received. NaOCl was purchased from supermarkets and drugstores (36 %), dental suppliers (48 %), or pharmacies (16 %). The median expected concentration was 2 % (n = 36). On average, 27 % less <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> was measured than the dentist assumed was in the sample (P <. 001). Fifteen percent of samples contained less than 1 % <b>available</b> <b>chlorine,</b> which is needed for tissue dissolution and disinfection. The average pH was 11. 5. Conclusion: The greatest differences in concentrations were found in NaOCl sourced from supermarkets or drugstores. Future studies should elucidate the cause of this discrepancy.

The potential use of chloramines was considered after observing that disinfection by chlorine occurred in two distinct phases. During the initial phase, chlorine reducing compounds (i. e., demand) cause the rapid disappearance of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine.</b> However, when ammonia was present bactericidal action was observed to continue [even though free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> was dissipated]. The subsequent disinfection phase occurs {{by the action of}} the inorganic chloramines. 6. 1 Chloramines Chemistry Chloramines are formed by the reaction of ammonia with aqueous chlorine (i. e., HOCl). Initially, chloramines were used for taste and odor control. However, it was soon recognized that chloramines were more stable than free chlorine in the distribution system and consequently were found to be effective for controlling bacterial regrowth. As a result, chloramines were used regularly during the 1930 s and 1940 s for disinfection. Due to an ammonia shortage during World War II, however, the popularity of chloramination declined. Concern {{during the past two decades}} over chlorinated organics (e. g., THM and HAA formation) in water treatment and distribution systems, increased interest in chloramines because they form very few disinfection byproducts (DBPs). 6. 1. 1 Equilibrium, Kinetic, and Physiochemical Properties Chloramines are formed from the reaction of chlorine and ammonia.

The solutions were stored in closed plastic bottles and protected from light at a constant 20 °C for 213 days. FAC was measured using iodometric titration, whereas pH, surface tension, and viscosity were measured using a pH meter, pendant drop method, and rheometer, respectively. The influence of the type of solution and the presence of surfactant over time on FAC was compared with the aid of linear regression models. Two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of passage of time and the type of solution on surface tension and the effect of the presence or absence of surfactant on the solutions.

Currently chlorine-based disinfectants are the products of choice, a position reflected in UK guidance. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate a peracetic acid (PAA) generating disinfectant to determine if it provided a realistic alternative to commonly used chlorine-based disinfectants.

Solutions of urea with chloride ions were electrolyzed using a bismuth doped TiO_ 2 (BiOx/TiO_ 2) anode coupled with a stainless steel cathode at applied anodic potentials (E_a) of either + 2. 2 V or + 3. 0 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode. In NaCl solution, the current efficiency of RCS generation was near 30 % at both potentials. In divided cell experiments, the pseudo-first-order rate of total nitrogen decay was {{an order of magnitude}} higher at E_a of + 3. 0 V than at + 2. 2 V, presumably because dichlorine radical (Cl_ 2 –•) ions facilitate the urea transformation primary driven by free chlorine.

The microbicidal activity of chlorine-based disinfectants depends on the <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> (FAC), but their oxidative potential is rapidly eliminated by organic matter. In this study, the microbicidal activities of weakly acidified chlorous acid water (WACAW) and sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO) against feline calcivirus (FCV) and C. difficile spores were compared in protein-rich conditions. WACAW inactivated FCV and C. difficile spores better than NaClO under all experimental conditions used in this study. WACAW above 100 ppm FAC decreased FCV > 4 log 10 within 30 sec {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 % each of bovine serum albumin (BSA), polypeptone or meat extract. Even in the presence of 5 % BSA, WACAW at 600 ppm FAC reduced FCV > 4 log 10 within 30 sec. Polypeptone inhibited the virucidal activity of WACAW against FCV more so than BSA or meat extract. WACAW at 200 ppm FAC decreased C. difficile spores > 3 log 10 within 1 min in the presence of 0. 5 % polypeptone. The microbicidal activity of NaClO was extensively diminished in the presence of organic matter. WACAW recovered its FAC to the initial level after partial neutralization by sodium thiosulfate, while no restoration of the FAC was observed in NaClO. These results indicate that WACAW is relatively stable under organic matter-rich conditions and therefore may be useful for treating environmental surfaces contaminated by human excretions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Root canal irrigants play a {{significant}} role in the elimination of microorganisms, tissue dissolution, and the removal of debris and smear layer. No single solution is able to fulfill these actions completely; therefore, their association is required. The aim of this investigation was to review the antagonistic interactions occurring when sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorhexidine (CHX), EDTA, and citric acid (CA) are used together during endodontic treatment. Methods A search was performed in the electronic database Medline (articles published through 2011; English language; and the following search terms or combinations: “interaction AND root canal irrigant or endodontic irrigant or sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine,” “sodium hypochlorite AND EDTA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or citric acid or chelating agent or chlorhexidine,” and “chlorhexidine AND EDTA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or citric acid or chelating agent”) to identify publications that studied unwanted chemical interactions between NaOCl, CHX, and EDTA and CA. Results The search identified 1, 285 publications; 19 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review. Their research methodology was classified as either in vitro or ex vivo. Conclusions Antagonistic interactions included the loss of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> for NaOCl when in contact with chelators, which consequently reduced the tissue dissolution capability and to a lesser extent antimicrobial activities. When CHX and NaOCl are mixed, a precipitate forms that can present detrimental consequences for endodontic treatment, including a risk of discoloration and potential leaching of unidentified chemicals into the periradicular tissues.

40|$|Introduction The {{shelf life}} of sodium {{hypochlorite}} (NaOCl) is limited, and a previous article {{showed that there}} can be a discrepancy between the expected concentration of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> (FAC) and the actual FAC concentration in NaOCl solutions intended for endodontic irrigation. The current study investigates the FAC content of domestic and professional NaOCls and evaluates the influences of dilution and storage on FAC concentration. Methods First, domestic and professional NaOCls not obtained from manufacturers were iodometrically titrated. Then, NaOCls were diluted with demineralized water or tap water and stored at 4 °C or 18 °C and analyzed at baseline and 2 and 22 weeks. Statistical analyses included paired samples, independent samples t tests and repeated multivariate analysis of variance. Correlations were calculated with the Pearson or Spearman rank correlation test. A P <. 05 was considered significant. Results Label specifications of domestic NaOCl were very imprecise (ie, < 5 % NaOCl). Domestic NaOCl contained 1. 8 %- 3. 5 % NaOCl (w/v). Professional NaOCl varied from 14. 3 % relative less FAC than specified on the label to 23. 5 % relative more FAC than specified. After 22 weeks, the relative average loss of FAC in all conditions was 5. 4 % FAC (P =. 002). Dilution, diluents, or storage temperature had no effect on the decline of FAC caused by aging. Conclusions There is a great variation in NaOCl concentrations, with domestic NaOCl being the least accurate. NaOCl can be stored up to 5 months. The FAC concentration of domestic NaOCl is unpredictable, and, therefore, it appears less suitable for clinical application as root canal irrigant...|$|R

40|$|Benzophenones {{compounds}} (BPs) {{are widely}} used as UV filters, and have been frequently found in multiple environmental matrices. The residual of BPs in water would cause potential threats on ecological safety and human health. Chlorination disinfection is necessary in water treatment process, in which many chemicals remained in water would react with disinfectant chlorine and form toxic byproducts. By using ultra performance liquid phase chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTOF-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the transformation of 4 -hydroxyl benezophenone (4 HB) with <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> (FAC) was characterized. Eight major products were detected and seven of them were identified. Transformation pathways of 4 HB under acid, neutral, and alkaline conditions were proposed respectively. The transformation mechanisms involved electrophilic chlorine substitution of 4 HB, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones, hydrolysis of esters and oxidative breakage of benzene ring. The orthogonal experiments of pH and dosages of disinfectant chlorine were conducted. The results suggested that pH conditions determined the occurrence of reaction types, and the dosages of disinfectant chlorine affected the extent of reactions. Photobacterium assay demonstrated that acute toxicity had significant increase after chlorination disinfection of 4 HB. It was proved that 3, 5 -dichloro- 4 HB, {{one of the major}} transformation products, was responsible for the increasing acute toxicity after chlorination. It is notable that, 4 HB at low level in real ambient water matrices could be transformed during simulated chlorination disinfection practice. Especially, two major products 3 -chloro- 4 HB and 3, 5 -dichloro- 4 HB were detected out, implying the potential ecological risk after chlorination disinfection of 4 HB. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: Acid electrolyzed water (AEW), {{which is}} {{produced}} through the electrolysis of dilute sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride solution, {{is used as}} a disinfectant in various fields because of its potent antimicrobial activity. The hydroxyl radical, an oxygen radical species, is often suggested as a putative active ingredient for AEW antimicrobial activity. Methodology/Principal Findings: The aim of the present study is to detect hydroxyl radicals in AEW. The hydroxyl radicals in AEW prepared under different conditions were determined using an electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. A signal from 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) -OH, an adduct of DMPO and the hydroxyl radical, was detected in AEW prepared by double or triple electrolyses of 1 % NaCl but not of 0. 1 % NaCl solution. Then the presence of hydrogen peroxide as a proposed source of hydroxyl radicals was examined using a combination of ESR and a Fenton reaction. The DMPO-OH signal was clearly detected, even in AEW prepared by single electrolysis of 0. 1 % NaCl solution, when ferrous sulfate was added to induce a Fenton reaction, indicating the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the AEW. Since sodium formate, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, did not affect the bactericidal activity of AEW, it is concluded that the radical is unlikely to contribute to the antimicrobial activity of AEW, although a small amount of the radical is produced from hydrogen peroxide. Dimethyl sulfoxide, the other hydroxyl radical scavenger used in the present study, canceled the bactericidal activity of AEW, accompanied by complete depletion of <b>free</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine,</b> suggesting that hypochlorous acid is probably a majo...|$|R
