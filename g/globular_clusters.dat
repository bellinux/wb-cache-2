5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has an associated group of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain {{considerably}} more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. <b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500.

40|$|Abstract. The present-day <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> {{populations of}} galaxies reflect the {{cumulative}} effects {{of billions of}} years of galaxy evolution via such processes as mergers, tidal stripping, accretion, {{and in some cases}} the partial or even complete destruction of other galaxies. If large galaxies have grown by consuming their smaller neighbors, or by accreting material stripped from other galaxies, then their observed <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems are an amalgamation of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems of their progenitors. Careful analysis of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> populations of galaxies can thus allow astronomers to reconstruct their dynamical histories. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{discovered}} continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{have now been}} discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20.

Almost a hundred have been identified from the thousands of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in M87.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, {{suggesting}} the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers.

5|$|M53 (NGC 5024) is a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> {{which was}} {{discovered}} independently by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 and Charles Messier in February 1777; William Herschel {{was the first}} to resolve it into stars. The magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any <b>globular</b> <b>cluster.</b> It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer <b>globular</b> <b>cluster,</b> with a much-smaller apparent size.|$|R
50|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>Cluster</b> M107 (also {{known as}} Messier Object 107 or NGC 6171) {{is the last}} <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> in the Messier Catalogue. It is a very loose <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> in the {{constellation}} Ophiuchus. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in April 1782 and independently by William Herschel in 1793. It wasn't until 1947 that Helen Sawyer Hogg added it and three other objects discovered by Méchain {{to the list of}} Messier objects.|$|R
5|$|Almost all <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> have a half-light {{radius of}} less than 10 pc, {{although}} there are well-established <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> with very large radii (i.e. NGC 2419 (Rh = 18 pc) and Palomar 14 (Rh = 25 pc)).|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> The clusters share other characteristics with <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} that <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> contain {{some of the first}} stars to be {{produced}} in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a model of <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> self-enrichment, based {{on the ability of}} the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> gaseous progenitors to retain the ejecta of a first generation of Type II Supernovae. The key point is that this ability depends on the pressure exerted on the progenitor cloud by the surrounding protogalactic medium and therefore on the location of the cloud in the protogalaxy. The model is able to explain the galactic halo metallicities and the metallicity gradient of the Old Halo which is thought to be the genuine galactic <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> system. The possibility that metallicity gradients are a common property of extragalactic <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems is also presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurement}} of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> populations of galaxies in Hickson compact groups, in order to investigate {{the effect of these}} high density environments on the formation and evolution of <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems. Based on V and R band images that we obtained of HCG 22 a and HCG 90 c with the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT), we find a total <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> population of 1590 ± 854 for HCG 22 a and 2136 ± 718 for 90 c. The specific frequency for HCG 22 a was found to be S_N= 1. 9 ± 1. 0 and S_N= 3. 4 ± 1. 1 for HCG 90 c. A power-law fit to the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> radial profile of HCG 22 a yields σ∼ R^- 2. 01 ± 0. 30 and for HCG 90 c we found σ∼ R^- 1. 20 ± 0. 16. A comparison of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> radial profiles with the surface brightness of the parent galaxy shows that the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems are at least as extended as the halo light. The measured values for the specific frequency are consistent with a scenario in which the host galaxies were in a low density "field-like" environment when they formed their <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems.

40|$|Dynamical {{friction}} and tidal disruption are effective mechanisms of evolution of <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems, especially in nonaxisymmetric galaxies {{with a central}} compact nucleus. With a semi-analytical approach based on {{a knowledge of the}} dependence of the dynamical {{friction and}} tidal disruption effects on the relevant parameters, we are able to follow the time evolution of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> system in a model or a triaxial galaxy and give its observable properties to compare with observational data. An important result is that the flatter distribution of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> system compared with that of the stellar bulge, as observed in many galaxies, {{can be explained by the}} evolution of the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> system, starting from the same density profile...|$|R
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{can also be}} used to {{determine}} changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> While there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
5|$|The ages of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> place a bound on the {{age limit}} of the entire universe. This lower limit has been a {{significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> that appeared older than cosmological models would allow.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} two classes of ellipticals calls for a comparison of the properties of their <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems. I compiled information on the properties of over 50 <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems of faint and bright early-type galaxies, and investigated them {{in the light of the}} properties of the parent galaxies. The properties of <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems appear to separate into two classes rather than to follow continuous relations with their host galaxy properties. <b>Globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems in faint, disky early-type galaxies with unresolved cores appear essentially unperturbed and show no clear signs of a merger past, while systems in bright, boxy ellipticals with resolved cores show all signs expected after a merger event. The <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems are therefore compatible with the idea that major merger events could be a cause for the dichotomy of early-type galaxies.

5|$|The {{formation}} of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> What distinguishes them from the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E
5|$|Observations of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{show that}} these stellar {{formations}} arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation, {{and where the}} interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. Globular cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies. Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black holes (SMBH) {{and the extent of}} the globular cluster systems of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|E

5|$|Of the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{within the}} Milky Way, the {{majority}} are found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{generally}} appear spherical in form, ellipticities {{can occur}} due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
