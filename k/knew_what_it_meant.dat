2500|$|In 2001, Riegel {{was voted}} one of Soaps' Hottest Newcomers by Soap Opera Digest and the {{following}} year as one of Soaps' Hottest Teens by the same magazine. Riegel modestly accepted, [...] "What does that mean, 'hot?' Does that mean I'm hot, like sexy? I feel pretty damn hot. I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> No, that's very flattering." [...] In 2003, Bianca was {{the winner of the}} first GLAAD Media Award as Favorite OUT Image. With her win, GLAAD released a statement: ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{smile at}} this, {{for all the}} boys <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|E
60|$|The horse neighed, and Petru <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> {{and did not}} go {{with his}} brothers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rather. We {{discussed}} it for hours. You don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to me. A wonderful man. Imam Din, was not our Hajji marvellous?" ...|$|R
60|$|The report soon {{circulated}} throughout Colby Hall that Jack and Fred {{had been}} placed under arrest, {{and many of the}} cadets wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|R
60|$|Just at this moment, they {{perceived}} a strange sensation, {{as if the}} steamboat had been suddenly pushed backwards. Marco was startled. He did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|R
60|$|Only Jane {{knew what}} the loss meant to her father, and none there <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to her.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{felt the}} mare tremble, quiver, and {{apparently}} sink under him. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> and was prepared.|$|E
60|$|A five-pound note! It {{seemed to}} take away the breath of those who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> and then an exulting shout broke forth.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{asked her}} if she liked to hear stories; this also puzzled her, and after some cross-questioning I {{discovered}} that she had never heard a story, and did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then off we went again, {{almost as}} fast as before; and oh, the relief it was to me to get that change of horses! Anybody who has ever ridden against time will <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{know about}} that!" [...] Pamela interrupted. [...] "That {{is the one}} thing that always sets me {{thinking}} about you. What did you do it for? How did you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Although {{her gown}} was purple, {{there was a}} little black crape bow upon each arm. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> and it saddened him. 'Do you ever visit your mother's grave?' he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why--don't fall on him--with Fulbert. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> Now, Felix, don't come {{on him for}} it. Come on {{me as much as}} you please. I've been {{a traitor}} to you. I see it now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{hard and}} harder I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> - [...] The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene; It meant the west {{mirrored}} by the coffin {{of my friend}} there, [...] Turning to the road from his green, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, all right,' he said, {{too much}} dazed to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> He heard his {{daughter}} going downstairs. Then swiftly returned over him the throbbing ache {{of his head}} and his arms, the discordant jarring of his body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know <b>it</b> now! I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> {{the feeling}} that has haunted me--the sounds I kept hearing--the guns of the ships at sea and the voices calling in distress! I know now. It means, sir, it means--" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she had an}} opportunity, {{she called}} Mr. Holohan aside {{and asked him to}} tell her <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> Mr. Holohan did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> He said that the Committee had made a mistake in {{arranging}} for four concerts: four was too many.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} a shriek from Honoria resounded from the sick chamber. Lancelot <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> and sprang up, as men do when {{shot through the}} heart.--In a moment he was himself again. A new life had begun for him--alone.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{all things}} {{vanished}} suddenly from my sight, and I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> The next moment {{we were walking}} along in our village; and down toward the river I saw the twinkling lights of the Golden Stag. Then in the dark I heard a joyful cry: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door closed}} behind Sam, and Eustace Hignett, lying on his back, gave himself up to melancholy meditation. He was deeply {{disturbed}} by his cousin's sad story. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> being engaged to Wilhelmina Bennett. It was like being taken aloft in a balloon and dropped with a thud on the rocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't," [...] said Theodosia, in her calm, sweet voice. Her {{face was}} serene, {{but the little}} wrinkle had grown deeper. Old Jim Parmelee would have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> He had seen the same {{expression}} on old Henry Ford's face many a time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{to me to}} fall in love. I {{felt that}} I had lived all my life in a prison, and at last Lucy came and took me by the hand, and led me out. And {{for the first time}} I breathed the free air of heaven.' ...|$|R
5000|$|During a June 2002 {{interview}} with the internet-only music magazine Ear Candy, Johnson was asked, [...] "...who {{came up with the}} band’s name? Bonepony?" [...] Johnson replied, “Actually, Bryan did, the guy that I started the band with, Bryan Ward. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> at the time and still don't!” ...|$|R
60|$|Straight away, Pupkin <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> as plainly {{as if it}} {{were written}} in print. He had forgotten, I say, about being a hero and he only knew that there was sixty {{thousand}} dollars in the vault of the bank below, and that he was paid eight hundred dollars a year to look after it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} going off to sleep," [...] he ses, [...] "when I felt a sort of hot pain in my left knee. O' course, I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> at once, and instead o' taking some of the pellets I thought I'd try your remedy instead. It's a bit nippy, but I don't mind that if it does me good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was that}} confounded Jay," [...] muttered the hunter. [...] "Lightfoot heard him and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> I {{know what he}} has done; he has circled round so as to get behind me and get my scent. It is a clever trick, a very clever trick, but two can play at that game. I'll just try that little trick myself." ...|$|E
5000|$|... though Bishop Hilarion was 'very {{remarkable}} {{young man}} whom I {{wanted to have}} here', he did not yet <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be a bishop; he alleged that Hilarion persistently used the word 'to rule' and not 'to serve' in his presentations, reflecting {{a lack of understanding}} of the spirit of episcopal service; ...|$|R
50|$|Later at Joe's, Apollo {{sits with}} Dee while Starbuck and Anders {{sit at the}} bar. Apollo tries to {{reconcile}} {{his relationship with his}} wife, but periodically makes eye contact with Starbuck. Dee takes his hand and he tells her that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to love her until he was going to lose her.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was upon}} another hill-slope, whose summit {{she had not}} scaled. There was always the marvellous eagerness in her heart, to climb and to see beyond. A Latin verb was virgin soil to her: she sniffed a new odour in it; <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> something, though she did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> But she {{gathered}} it up: it was significant. When she knew that: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, my lord Macumazana, {{there is}} a prophecy among us that when a gun is fired in Pongo-land, its gods will desert us, and the Motombo, who is their priest, will die. That saying is very old, but until {{a little while ago}} none <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> since it spoke of 'a hollow spear that smoked,' and such a weapon was not known to us." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Man Coyote {{had crept}} half-way up the hill, and Peter was {{wondering}} how much nearer he could let him get with safety, when a sudden grunting broke out right behind him. Peter <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> and jumped to one side. Then down the hill, rolling straight towards Old Man Coyote, started the strange, headless, tailess, legless creature that had so frightened Reddy and Granny Fox.|$|E
60|$|To {{this man}} {{she was a}} woman transformed. The new bloom upon her face entranced him. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant.</b> He was looking on the face of love at last, and it was love coming out smiling from its hiding-place because it thought it had heard him call. The artist in him who had done this thing was entranced, as if he had written an immortal page.|$|E
60|$|For the {{few moments}} that Richard Kenton {{remained}} in sight they scarcely found words coherent enough for question, {{and when they}} did, Bittridge had nothing but confused answers {{to give to the}} effect that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> but he would find out. He got into a hack and had himself driven to his hotel, but he never made the inquiry which he threatened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she's {{undoubtedly}} gymnastic in the externals of music, but {{the intrinsic}} spirit {{of music is}} unguessed by her. I asked her what music meant to her--you know I'm always curious to know that particular thing; {{and she did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to her, except that she adored it, that it was the greatest of the arts, and that <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> more than life to her." ...|$|R
60|$|Fred Dobson {{had listened}} to {{the latter part of}} the {{conversation}} with interest, and now he wished to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all <b>meant.</b>|$|R
