5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be seen in an ice core.|$|E
5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the disk, which {{can now be}} called protoplanetary, may {{give birth to a}} planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters. They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which feeds the central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400K inside 5AU and 1,000K inside 1AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks to evaporate, leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> survive only in the outer part of the disk.|$|E

25|$|This {{refrigeration}} method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating dry ice. Perhaps {{the simplest}} {{example of this}} is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a traditional ice-cream maker). Dry <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> reliably bring the temperature well below freezing.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{temperature}} of dry <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> cause viscoelastic materials {{to change to}} glass phase. Thus it is useful for removing many types of pressure sensitive adhesives.|$|E

Based on a robust observer of the rotor angular speed, the increase of inertia and aerodynamic torque due to <b>icing</b> <b>can</b> be detected. Moreover, incorporating an online approximator, the amount of <b>icing</b> <b>can</b> be also estimated. Such estimation {{can be used to}} define a threshold with an associated logic to stop the turbine when the icing appears to be too severe. © 2016 EUCA...|$|R

25|$|Dry <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be used {{to arrest}} and prevent insect {{activity}} in closed containers of grains and grain products, as it displaces oxygen, but does not alter the taste or quality of foods.

25|$|A {{paucity of}} {{suitable}} sediments for analysis makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish. Some reconstructions point towards polar continents — {{which have been}} a feature of all other major glaciations, providing a point upon which <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> nucleate. Changes in ocean circulation patterns may then have provided the trigger of snowball Earth.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{mechanisms}} of ice nucleation in the atmosphere through which <b>ice</b> nuclei <b>can</b> catalyse the formation of ice particles. In the upper troposphere, water vapor can deposit directly onto solid particle. In clouds warmer than about &minus;37 °C where liquid water can persist in a supercooled state, <b>ice</b> nuclei <b>can</b> trigger droplets to freeze.|$|R

25|$|Weather {{along the}} route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather. Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms.

25|$|Heavy {{water is}} 10.6% denser than {{ordinary}} water, and heavy water's physically different properties {{can be seen}} without equipment if a frozen sample is dropped into normal water, as it will sink. If the water is ice-cold the higher melting temperature of heavy <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> also be observed: it melts at 3.7°C, and thus does not melt in ice-cold normal water.|$|E
25|$|Winter: Winter months {{bring the}} risk of shelf ice. This is a {{condition}} where the winter winds push ice from Lake Michigan onto the beaches. As the cold depends, the <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> build up into long ridges creating an arctic dunescape. Much of this ice is floating. It may be dangerous {{to walk on the}} ice as there can be air pockets into which you can sink. Rescue is extremely difficult.|$|E

25|$|The thermal {{features}} at West Thumb are {{not only}} found on the lake shore, but extend {{under the surface of}} the lake as well. Several underwater hydrothermal features were discovered in the early 1990s and can be seen as slick spots or slight bulges in the summer. During the winter, the underwater thermal features are visible as melt holes in the icy surface of the lake. The surrounding <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> reach three feet (one meter) in thickness.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ice on {{aircraft}} are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are {{an increase in}} stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> form {{on the leading edge}} of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.|$|E
25|$|In {{winter when}} the lake freezes, many {{fishermen}} {{go out on}} the ice, cut holes, and fish. It is even possible to build bonfires on the ice. But venturing on Lake Erie <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be dangerous. In a freak incident in 2009, warming temperatures and winds of 35 miles per hour and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles-wide ice floe which broke away from the shore, trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore; one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats.|$|E
50|$|Glaze from {{freezing}} rain {{is also an}} extreme hazard to aircraft, as it causes very rapid structural icing. Most helicopters and small airplanes lack the necessary deicing equipment to fly in {{freezing rain}} of any intensity, and heavy <b>icing</b> <b>can</b> overwhelm even the most sophisticated deicing systems on large airplanes. <b>Icing</b> <b>can</b> dramatically increase an aircraft's weight, and by changing the shape of its airfoils also reduce lift and increase drag. All three factors increase stalling speed and reduce aircraft performance, making {{it very difficult to}} climb or even maintain level altitude. Icing is most easily evaded by moving into warmer air — under most conditions, this requires aircraft to descend, which can usually be done safely and easily even with a moderate accumulation of structural ice. However, freezing rain is accompanied by a temperature inversion aloft, meaning that aircraft actually need to climb to move into warmer air — a potentially difficult and dangerous task with even a small amount of ice accumulation.|$|R
