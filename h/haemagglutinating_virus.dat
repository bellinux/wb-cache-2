40|$|Homologous {{interference}} {{between a}} temperature-sensitive small plaque mutant (HVJ-pB) derived from an HVJ (<b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>virus</b> of Japan- the Sendal strain of parainfiuenza I virus) carrier culture of BHK cells {{and the original}} wild-type virus (HVJ-W) has been investigated. Prior infection of LLCMK 2, HeLa, BHK or mouse L cells with HVJ-pB, both at permissive and non-permissive temperatures, for 24 h resulted in a reduced yield of superinfecting HVJ-W, reflecting {{a smaller number of}} cells capable of producing the superinfecting virus. However, HVJ-pB did not interfere with the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus or Newcastle disease virus. Interference in this system seems to be due to inhibition of the attachment of superinfecting HVJ-W as a result of intracellular mechanisms operating at a late stage in the replication of the inter-fering virus. There is also blocking or destruction of cellular receptors by extra-cellular particles of the interfering virus. Protein synthesis coded for by the com-plete virus genome is required to establish and maintain the interference, and treatment with actinomycin D has no effect on the interference phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria, {{cellular}} organelles playing essential {{roles in}} eukaryotic cell metabolism, {{are thought to}} have evolved from bacteria. The organization of mtDNA is remarkably uniform across species, reflecting its vital and conserved role in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Our objectives were to evaluate the compatibility of xenogeneic mitochondria in the development of preimplantation embryos in mammals. Mouse embryos harbouring bovine mitochondria (mtB-M embryos) were prepared by the cell-fusion technique employing the <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>virus</b> of Japan (HVJ). The mtB-M embryos showed developmental delay at embryonic days (E) 3. 5 after insemination. Furthermore, none of the mtB-M embryos could implant into the maternal uterus after embryo transfer, whereas control mouse embryos into which mitochondria from another mouse had been transferred developed as well as did non-manipulated embryos. When we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) of mouse and bovine ND 5, we found that the mtB-M embryos contained 8. 3 % of bovine mitochondria at the blastocyst stage. Thus, contamination with mitochondria from another species induces embryonic lethality prior to implantation into the maternal uterus. The heteroplasmic state of these xenogeneic mitochondria could have detrimental effects on preimplantation development, leading to preservation of species-specific mitochondrial integrity in mammals...|$|E
40|$|The {{infectious}} virus (HVJ-pi) {{obtained from}} BHK cells persistently infected with <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>virus</b> of Japan {{was found to}} be temperature-sensitive as well as causing little or no cytopathic effect (c. p. e.) and leading to establishment of carrier cultures in several cell lines at both permissive (32 °C) and non-permissive (38 °C) temperature. In order to obtain information about he role of HVJ-pi in the establishment of persistent infection, comparative studies were made of some phenotypic properties of HVJ-pi and HVJ- 38 which was obtained by passing wild-type HVJ in eggs at 38 °C and was proved to be highly cytopathic. HVJ-pi differed from HVJ- 38 in (0 temperature s nsitivity in its ability to produce virus progeny, (2) infectivity for embryonated ggs, (3) neuraminidase activity, (4) the thermal stability of HA and neuraminidase activity, and (5) the polypeptide composition of BHK-grown viruses. BHK cells infected with HVJ-pi release haemagglutinin more efficiently, and less HA was accumulated on the cell membrane. In considering these results, it was concluded that the difference of envelope proteins might be involved in the striking difference in c. p. e, between HJV-pi and HVJ- 38...|$|E

40|$|Surveillance of {{apparently}} healthy ducks, chickens, {{and geese}} at a poultry dressing plant in Hong Kong yielded 51 <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>viruses</b> 25 {{of which were}} influenza A viruses. Of these, 24 were subtyped into 13 combinations based on haemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens. Of the 13 different influenza A viruses isolated, 7 possessed combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits {{that have not been}} reported previously—i. e., Hav 2 N 1, Hav 2 Nav 5, Hav 4 N 2, Hav 7 N 2, Hav 7 Nav 1, Hav 7 Nav 3, and Hav 7 Nav 6. Four of the isolates were non-avid: they were not neutralized by antisera to any of the reference subtypes of influenza A viruses, yet antisera to each isolate inhibited both that virus and a known reference strain. The large number of combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase and the isolation of two different influenza A viruses from one duck suggests that recombination may be occurring in nature...|$|R
40|$|Phospholamban (PLB) {{inhibits}} SR Ca(2 +) -ATPase 2 (SERCA 2) Ca(2 +) uptake and is {{a potential}} therapeutic target {{in the context of}} heart failure. RNA interference (RNAi) is a technique that produces sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing through the use of double-stranded RNA directed against the homologous target gene. The goal of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of the RNAi method for ablation of PLB gene expression and restoration of Ca(2 +) uptake function in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in which SERCA 2 protein levels were decreased. Myocytes were transfected with 21 -nucleotide duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PLB (30 nmol/l) or with scramble sequence using a <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>virus</b> of Japan (HVJ) envelope vector. Administration of PLB siRNA resulted in the reduction of PLB mRNA level to approximately 6 % of that observed after administration of scramble siRNA group at 12 h after transfection. Further, PLB protein levels in the PLB siRNA groups were 12 % of that in cells treated with scramble siRNA on day 2, and the mRNA and protein levels for SERCA 2 and calsequestrin were not affected. In addition, Ca(2 +) uptake affinity was increased in total homogenates from the PLB siRNA group (a 29 % decrease in EC(50) value when compared with scramble siRNA group). Finally, PLB siRNA restored Ca(2 +) uptake affinity following hydrogen peroxide-induced decreases in SERCA 2 and PLB mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that PLB-targeted RNAi inhibited endogenous PLB expression in neonatal rat myocytes and restored Ca(2 +) uptake affinity in cardiac myocytes in which SERCA 2 protein levels were decreased. This technique may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for heart failure. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{electron}} microscope {{was used to}} make particle counts of the viruses of Newcastle disease of fowls, fowl plague, mumps and influenza C. Two counting techniques previously described were also used, and correlations with simultaneous measurements of haemagglutination and infectivity were made. In a previous study (Donald & Isaacs, 1954 a) counts {{were made in the}} {{electron microscope}} of influenza virus particles, and related to measurements of haemagglutination and infectivity of the preparations carried out under optimal conditions. It was found that at the agglutination end-point there was about one virus particle/red cell. It was also found that about ten virus particles of the standard influenza strains corresponded to the minimal infective dose. The particle count methods developed for that study are extended here to the related <b>haemagglutinating</b> <b>viruses</b> of Newcastle disease, fowl plague, mumps and influenza C. It was not always possible to use both counting techniques for each of these viruses; however, the modifications developed for each particular case and the results obtained are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|From 1985 to 1988, a {{total of}} 2496 swine sera from 60 farms in the Tohoku District of the Honshu Island of Japan were {{examined}} for antibodies to swine <b>haemagglutinating</b> encephalomyelitis <b>virus</b> (HEV), human coronavirus (HCV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Antibodies to HEV 67 N strain and HCV OC 43 strain were highly prevalent with positivity rates of 82. 1 and 91. 4 %, respectively, while seropositivity rate to BCV Kakegawa strain was 44. 2 %. No clinical signs of HEV infection were noticed in any farms including farms with relatively high seropositivity. The results suggested that HCV or antigenitically related virus(es) as well as HEV might be perpetuated in swine in the Tohoku District...|$|R

When the immunodiffusion test was compared with the virus neutralization test {{for the detection of}} transmissible gastroeneritis viral antibodies in 20 swine sera certain samples which contained high titres of virus neutralizing antibodies failed to produce precipitation while other sera were positive in the immunodiffusion test although their virus neutralizing antibody titres were relatively low.

40|$|<b>Haemagglutinating</b> {{populations of}} <b>virus</b> {{particles}} of adenovirus type I 6 (I-VIII) {{were separated by}} isopycnic entrifuging in CsC 1. One of these populations (V) contained complete virus particles. Fresh preparations of virus particles from all populations tudied had a morphology indistinguishable from that of complete virus particles. The five lightest populations were shown to contain [aH]-thymidine and to be infective; dose-response r lationships indicated the occurrence of a multiplicity-dependent infectivity of the incomplete virus particles. SDS-polyacrylamide g l electrophoresis of incomplete virus particles of the lightest population demonstrated that they were deficient in three polypeptides, but contained three other polypeptides which were not detectable in complete particles. One characteristic polypeptide of incomplete particles and another characteristic polypeptide of complete particles displayed high ratios of arginine over threonine...|$|R
40|$|The {{second phase}} of a 2 -year {{influenza}} virus surveillance programme of domestic avian species in Hong Kong (up to October 1977) yielded influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Hong Kong paramyxovirus, as well as unidentified <b>haemagglutinating</b> agents. These <b>viruses</b> were isolated from the trachea or cloaca of apparently healthy domestic ducks, geese, and chickens originating from China and Hong Kong. Twenty-five combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens were identified from the 136 influenza A viruses isolated. Eight of the combinations {{do not appear to}} have been previously reported — Hav 3 Nav 2, Hav 4 Nav 2, Hav 4 Nav 4, Hav 4 Nav 5, Hav 4 Neq 1, Hav 6 Nav 4, Hav 6 Nav 6, and Hav 9 Nav 1.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sulphydryl {{reagents}} on <b>haemagglutinating</b> e cephalomyelitis <b>virus</b> (HEV), a coronavirus of pigs, was investigated. Using increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 o % {{of the virus}} infectivity and haemagglutination (HA) activity could be removed by 1. 5 mM and 4 to 5 mM respectively. The effect of DT 1 ~ concentrations on the polypeptide composition was also examined. Of the three external glycoproteins gp 125 {{was found to be}} the most susceptible, 5 o % being removed by incubation of the virus with 5 to 6 mM-DTT. Of the other two glyco-proteins gp 180 was unaffected by DTT concentrations up to I oo mM and the amount of gp IOO gradually declined at concentrations above 2 o raM. The rates of removal of the virus HA activity and gp I 25 suggested that this polypeptide was {{an essential part of the}} virus haemagglutinin. The lack of evidence for any inter-peptide disulphide bonds suggested that the loss of these glycoproteins was due to an alteration i their conformation brought about by the cleavage of intrapeptide disulphide bonds. The loss of protein from the surface of the virus resulted in a change in the virus morphology with the appearance of thin fibrous projections instead of the characteristic petal-like coronavirus projections...|$|R
40|$|Porcine Periweaning Failure-to-Thrive {{syndrome}} (PFTS) is {{a clinical}} syndrome of newly weaned pigs with unknown etiology and characterized by anorexia, lethargy and progressive debilitation. The hypothesis of this thesis is that PFTS is an infectious disease. Investigation in an index farm affected by PFTS from Saskatchewan Canada ruled out most common swine pathogens as the etiology and identified several lesions that were consistent across many cases. A larger study including multiple farms in North America was then undertaken. A total of 8 farms were investigated, within which 5 met the clinical definition of PFTS. Gross and histological examinations {{were performed on}} 8 case and 4 control pigs on each farm. Detection of relevant porcine pathogens, complete blood count, serum chemistry, and serum cytokine analysis were performed on each pig. Thymic atrophy, superficial gastritis and small intestinal villous atrophy were significantly more prevalent in case pigs compared to control pigs. All case pigs had {{at least two of}} these three lesions. All case and control pigs were negative for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, swine influenza virus and were free of porcine circovirus associated diseases. Although several pathogens, such as porcine cytomegalovirus, <b>haemagglutinating</b> encephalomyelitis <b>virus,</b> porcine enteric calicivirus, group A rotavirus, enteroviruses and Cystoisospora suis were detected in some of the case and control pigs, none were associated with clinical status. Clinical pathology findings of case pigs was consistent with anorexia and dehydration, such as increases in haematocrit, blood urea, serum bilirubin, albumin, beta-hydroxybutyrate and decreases in blood glucose, calcium and phosphorous. Case pigs had similar levels to IL 1 -β than control pigs, which suggested that PFTS was not a result of excessive cytokines. In subsequent experiments, a snatched-farrowed porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pig model was developed and tissue homogenates were used to inoculate SF-pCD pigs in an attempt to reproduce the clinical signs of PFTS. The SF-pCD pigs were immunologically characterized and shown to be suitable for inoculation studies. However, inoculation of tissue homogenate from PFTS pigs failed to reproduce the clinical signs of PFTS in SF-pCD pigs. All together, PFTS is a clinical syndrome with consistent pathological and serum analytical changes among affected pigs. Despite the efforts of this research to establish an infectious etiology, {{there is a lack of}} evidence that PFTS is an infectious disease...|$|R
