5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to <b>doubt</b> <b>whether</b> he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
5|$|Tahir's {{unexpected}} {{victory was}} decisive: al-Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abnaʾ, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abnaʾ army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala {{after a series}} of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Banu Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance {{to get involved in the}} civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abnaʾ to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al-Amin, as the abnaʾ began to <b>doubt</b> <b>whether</b> their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abnaʾ, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn ("he of the two headships"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration.|$|E

Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante had saved a dubiously awarded penalty in the first half.

25|$|As a {{significant}} ancestral figure, whose purported descendants included many leading kings from the 7th to early 11th centuries, Diarmait appears in many genealogical collections and related materials. While {{it was once}} supposed that such materials were to be relied upon, many modern historians <b>doubt</b> <b>whether</b> genealogies can be taken as evidence for anything more than political aspirations and beliefs in the milieu {{in which they were}} compiled. Reinforcing this view, Diarmait's recorded ancestry and family ties are believed to {{have been the subject of}} politically motivated changes in the centuries following his death.|$|E
25|$|Imperial Germany's Foreign Office was {{at first}} {{hesitant}} to grant official protection to Lüderitz's acquisitions, fearing immense costs and the military vulnerability of an empire spread across several continents. When economic considerations became more favourable, and {{in preparation for the}} 1884 election, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck changed his mind and from then on repeatedly asked London about Britain's intentions in South West Africa, where they already owned Walvis Bay and several islands in the Atlantic Ocean, including some in the immediate vicinity of Angra Pequena. There was considerable <b>doubt</b> <b>whether</b> a German colony would be politically acceptable to Britain. Bismarck received no answer.|$|E
