Problems within the labour market, such as the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> and job paths, but also related to saving and upgrading the country’s productive system. Problems: of coordinating macroeconomic policies, which cannot be limited to income support measures; of rethinking the rules in order, among other objectives, to redesign the relationships between finance and industry; of identifying the institutions that should be their guarantors. Problems, lastly, of creating the conditions for reviving the dialogue between the social and economic dimensions...|$|E
40|$|As casualisation {{strategies}} have proliferated {{in the wake}} of the global crisis, techniques to exclude discrete time periods from the working day are increasingly being devised. Vulnerable periods are targeted and configured as regulatory no-man’s lands that encircle disjointed episodes of protected work. Travel time is one such disputed site. These periods are especially fraught at the lower end of the labour market, perhaps most prominently in the signs of unacceptably widespread non-payment of travel time in the home care sector. 1 Such temporal fragmentation strategies are beginning to be tested before the courts. 2 In the recent Tyco judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for the first time addressed the status of travel time under the Working Time Directive (WTD). 3 In doing so, the Court reasserted a unitary model of working time and stressed that this model can embrace travel periods. It also identified remuneration as the plane on which temporal <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> can be reconciled with the EU legal order. The judgment in Tyco therefore offers an opportunity to reflect on the evolving role of legal regulation in structuring the temporal dimension of casualisation...|$|E

30|$|Some of the {{implications}} of behavioral economics for policy are overlooked in traditional formal economic analysis but reflect what might best be called “common sense” and are similar to the critiques and prescriptions of many long-time policy practitioners and analysts. These include recommendations to minimize the <b>fragmentation</b> and complexity <b>of</b> <b>job</b> training, employment, and social welfare programs. The behavioral approach also reinterprets traditional labor market policy proposals by taking into account loss aversion and potentially biased wage expectations, particularly relevant considerations in the case for and the design of wage-loss insurance policies. Behavioral findings from other domains generate new insights critical to the choice architecture and choice platforms for helping unemployed and disadvantaged workers navigate training and education options (Thaler and Sunstein [2008]).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} the performance implications {{of using a}} buddy scheme for contiguous node allocation, {{in conjunction with a}} backfilling job scheduler for clusters. When a contiguous node allocation strategy is used, there is a trade-off between improved run-time <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> (due to reduced link contention and lower communication overhead) and increased wait-time <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> (due to external <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the processor system). Using trace-based simulation, a buddy strategy for contiguous node allocation is shown to be unattractive compared to the standard noncontiguous allocation strategy used in all production job schedulers. A simple but effective scheme for selective buddy allocation is then proposed, that is shown to perform better than non-contiguous allocation. ...|$|R
40|$|Polycentrism {{has become}} the {{keystone}} in a major number of regional and urban policies, since it {{has been seen as}} a sustainable and equilibrated urban model. In this paper, the problem has been focused in case study the biggest metropolitan areas in Spain and pretends test whether polycentric urban growth does effectively reduce land consumption and travel-to-work journeys, protecting in this way agricultural and forest areas around cities {{and at the same time}} reducing energy and air emissions produced by cars. The methodology used has been departed from land-use, transport and census data, and using ArcGIS and TransCAD a group of spatial indicators is calculated and introduced in a family of regression models, where explained variables are per capita land consumption and excess commuting respectively. The results suggest that polynucleation has little effect both in the reduction of land consumption and excess commuting. On the contrary, other variables associated to urban form do highly influence land and mobility patterns, such as <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban fabrics, <b>job</b> ratio balance, and the diversity of economic activities and housing offer. Such conclusions may shed light in the design of urban policies, and focus the attention on the definition of small-scale urban variables instead of structural ones at metropolitan scale.

He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>jobs,</b> by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|R
40|$|Multiple team {{membership}} {{as a work}} {{design feature}} is becoming more widespread in modern organizations, with expected positive and negative consequences for individual employees. This study explores whether <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> time across multiple teams is a job demand or a job resource for employees. Drawing on the Job Demands–Resources framework and role theory, we tested a model that relates multiple team membership to a set <b>of</b> <b>job</b> demands (task load, team process load, and conflict with team members) and job resources (team social support and job autonomy). The findings show that multiple team membership increased demands associated with teamwork but not taskwork, while simultaneously reducing social support from team members. In turn, job demands increased job strain, whereas job resources increased work engagement. We conclude that the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> time across different roles in multiple teams {{is perceived as a}} teamwork-related job demand and leads to role strain. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings are further discussed...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed-field agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} showed that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA in Raji cells was induced by infection with the P 3 HR- 1 strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). S 1 nuclease treatment of the agarose plugs containing cells suggested {{that the majority of}} DNA fragments did not contain single-strand gaps. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis was required for DNA fragmentation. Phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of EBV DNA polymerase, did not inhibit <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. These findings suggest that EBV-specific early proteins participate in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal DNA of P 3 HR- 1 cells was also fragmented by treatment with n-butyrate plus 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), which induced activation of latent EBV genome following viral replication. In addition, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> DNA preceded cell death during lytic infection.

40|$|A {{potential}} effect of ICTs {{is that they}} alleviate the traditional space-time constraints of paid-work activities and allow for the decomposition of work into multiple segments of sub-tasks, which can be performed at different times and/or locations. Such separation of activities into discrete pieces is commonly termed the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> activity. Regrettably, only limited empirical evidence {{is available on the}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work activity and the factors that contribute to it. The goal {{of this paper is to}} extend the previous work in the activity fragmentation arena in three ways: (i) to operationalize measures <b>of</b> spatial <b>fragmentation</b> and reformulate some <b>of</b> the temporal <b>fragmentation</b> measures for the specific purpose <b>of</b> investigating the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the work activity; (ii) to analyse fragmentation not only in terms of the individual indicators, but also as a multi-dimensional construct including all dimensions of spatial and temporal fragmentation collectively; (iii) to test a detailed set of ICT-related, work-related, and sociodemographic variables to identify the factors that are crucial in the occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the work activity. The study shows that there is heterogeneity in the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work. Three internally homogeneous patterns <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> which diverge in the degree <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> are identified: (1) a less temporally and spatially fragmented work pattern; (2) a less spatially and more temporally fragmented work pattern; (3) a more spatially and temporally fragmented work pattern.

40|$|<b>Fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> polyatomic {{molecules}} is {{a fundamental}} chemical reaction in intense laser fields when the electric field strength of the laser pulse is comparable to or exceeds the intramolecular Coulomb binding fields. For hydrocarbon molecules, because of the migration of light hydrogen atom (or proton) {{that can lead to}} chemical bond rearrangement <b>of</b> molecules, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon molecules may result in new fragment species that could not be realized from the initial geometry of molecules by direct bond breaking, making the full characterization <b>of</b> their dynamical <b>fragmentation</b> processes difficult.

40|$|Although {{relationships}} between <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development {{and other forms}} of administrative and land cover fragmentation are important, they are poorly understood. This research aimed to better understand these relationships in order to inform land use planning in the Roaring Fork/Colorado River Corridor of Colorado. Change in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development between 1985 and 1999 was modeled as a function of other forms of administrative and land cover fragmentation using two different regression specifications. While a standard “global ” regression provided a good averaged model of change for the entire study area, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) demonstrated how the process changed locally over space. Results of the global regression showed that the intercept was close to zero and therefore the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development was expected to be close to zero in the absence of other forms <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> Results <b>of</b> the GWR showed that the {{relationships between}} change in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development and other fragmentation variables (initial edge density of urban development, edge density of public/private interface, farmland density and road density) varied significantly within the study area. By modeling this variation, GWR helped to identify ways to reduce <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development in two different regions of the study area. The analysis suggested that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development in one area, Aspen–Basalt, was more strongly driven by amenity-related variables, while in the New Castle area fragmentation was more strongly driven by infrastructure-related variables. Ultimately, local analysis may help fine-tune “one-size-fits-all ” land use polices for specific regions...|$|R
