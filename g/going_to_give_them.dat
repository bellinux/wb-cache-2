In apprehensive conversation among the Beatles on board the aircraft to New York February 1964, McCartney had questioned, [...] "They've got their own groups. What are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> that they don't already have?" ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{priorities}} for Goldwyn was to shorten {{the length of the}} show to at least three hours or less. In view of his goal, he told reporters regarding winner's acceptance speeches, [...] "We are actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> 45 seconds. The light (next to the camera) will start blinking at 45 seconds and go red at 55 seconds. After one minute we will either cut to a commercial or go to something else. We've also asked multiple winners to flip a coin and pick a spokesman." [...] Furthermore, instead of each Best Original Song nominee being performed separately, all five songs were performed as part of a musical number featuring actress Bernadette Peters singing brief introductions to each one. Although Goldwyn attempted to move the Documentary and Short Film Categories to a separate ceremony from the broadcast, the AMPAS Board of Governors refused to do so.|$|E
500|$|Crosby {{made his}} NHL debut on October 5, 2005, against the New Jersey Devils, and {{registered}} an assist on the team's first {{goal of the}} season, scored by Mark Recchi in a 5–1 loss. He scored his first NHL goal in the Penguins' home opener on October 8 against goaltender Hannu Toivonen of the Boston Bruins. Despite having registered two assists for a three-point night, the Penguins were defeated 7–6 in overtime. Crosby began his rookie season playing alongside Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux. Unfortunately, Lemieux was forced to retire due to an irregular heartbeat after having played just 26 games of the season. Near the midway point of the season, Penguins head coach Eddie Olczyk was fired and replaced by Michel Therrien on December 15, 2005. [...] The following day, Therrien designated Crosby as an alternate captain for the Penguins. The move drew criticism from some hockey pundits, including Don Cherry, who claimed that Crosby {{did not have the}} experience for the position. He stated, [...] "An 18-year-old kid says he's going to give us ideas. What, from the Quebec League, he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> ideas? Come on. That's ridiculous". Although hopes were high in Pittsburgh for the club to succeed, largely in part to the beginning of Crosby's NHL career and bolstered by the acquisitions of Sergei Gonchar, Žigmund Pálffy and Mark Recchi, the Penguins still finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the rule}} that coaches must remain seated during a game, Hayes was quoted as saying: [...] "If you've got 10,000 people seated in an arena and everybody's {{standing}} up and hollering and you expect the coaches and players to be quiet and relaxed, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a sedative.

"I do not accuse John Simcoe of this crime, but I need hardly {{say that}} the mere {{possibility}} {{of such a thing}} heightened the strong feeling entertained by Miss Covington that Simcoe was the author of the abduction of Walter Rivington.

They suspected that the man who was very intimate with Simcoe had acted as his agent in the matter, and a casual remark which was overheard in a singular manner, which will be explained when the case goes into another court, that this man was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Tilbury, <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> a clew. Then, in a manner which many persons might find it very hard to believe, Miss Covington learned from a conversation between the two men, when together in a box at Her Majesty's Theater, that the lad was in charge of a bargeman living near the little village of Pitsea, in Essex. From that place, my lord, he was brought last week, and Miss Covington will produce him in court, if your lordship wishes to see him.

40|$|This is {{probably}} my favorite lesson plan that I have found so far {{because it has}} great inquiry-based ideas for having the students discover information.

It provides the teachers with assessment forms and suggestions, along with specific questions to ask along the way, in case you aren't really familiar with the material. But probably my favorite part of this site is that it gives graphic organizer ideas, which are great for struggling learners or English language learners. It provides a 3 -D tour of the planets that the students are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> love, besides <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> more concrete ideas to put into their minds.
