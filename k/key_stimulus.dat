5000|$|Much {{of what is}} {{happening}} in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior. Attention refers to mental processes that select relevant information, inhibit irrelevant information, and switch among these as the situation demands. [...] Often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears; such expectation makes for rapid selection of <b>key</b> <b>stimuli</b> when they become available. A large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non-human animals, and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds, mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans.|$|R

The bird was required to respond to the left or right hand key, depending on whether the 2 successively presented centre <b>key</b> <b>stimuli</b> were the same (left) or different (right). The delay intervals ranged from zero to 9 s, and stable performance decrements (with increasing delay) were obtained. Chlordiazepoxide which, it has been argued, produces behavioural changes similar to those observed after hippocampal lesions was found to disrupt performance at doses greater than 4 mg/kg (i. m.).

40|$|In a {{breeding}} population of crested terns near Fremantle, W. A., social behaviour involved complex patterns of social displays and paired behaviour. The social phase was probably truncated {{over much of}} the extended breeding season by the presence of incubating conspecifics, and may serve to synchronise laying in their absence. The responses of pre-laying crested terns to incubating conspecifics were studied by means of artificial ‘colonies’ of polyurethane models. These proved to be most attractive to prebreeding pairs searching for nest sites, and the earliest eggs were invariably laid among the decoys. Pre-breeding terns in the social phase were not attracted to the decoys. It is suggested that loose groups of incubating conspecifics acted as a <b>key</b> <b>stimulus,</b> releasing settlement and laying in birds in an advanced state of reproductive readiness. This <b>key</b> <b>stimulus</b> could change the learned location of colonies but during late summer and early autumn other factors, probably related to food availability, controlled the onset of laying. Small, spatially distinct, nesting groups were less synchronous in their laying than larger colonies. Such small groups are thought to result from discontinuities in reproductive phase between groups of terns, which are not apparent when the number of pre-laying birds is large...|$|E

Experiments included two- and three-component multiple schedules and a comparison of the single-key and the two-key procedures. In general, conditions that typically produce positive contrast in single-key procedures reduced responding to the constant-stimulus key (induction) and increased responding to the component-stimulus key (contrast) in the two-key procedure. The results were interpreted as supporting the contention that two response classes, operant and elicited, are present in standard multiple schedules. In addition, elicited responses were strongly implicated in contrast phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD), {{characterized by}} hyperactivity, impulsiveness and deficient sustained attention, {{is one of}} the most common and persistent behavioral disorders of childhood. ADHD is associated with catecholamine dysfunction. The catecholamines are important for response selection and memory formation, and dopamine in particular is important for reinforcement of successful behavior. The convergence of dopaminergic mesolimbic and glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses upon individual neostriatal neurons provides a favorable substrate for a three-factor synaptic modification rule underlying acquisition of associations between stimuli in a particular context, responses, and reinforcers. The change in associative strength as a function of delay between <b>key</b> <b>stimuli</b> or responses, and reinforcement, is known as the delay of reinforcement gradient. The gradient is altered by vicissitudes of attention, intrusions of irrelevant events, lapses of memory, and fluctuations in dopamine function. Theoretical and experimental analyses of these moderating factors will help to determine just how reinforcement processes are altered in ADHD. Such analyses can only help to improve treatment strategies for ADHD...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{extended}} errorless learning to a conditional temporal discrimination. Pigeons' responses to a left–red key after a 2 -s sample and to a right–green key after a 10 -s sample were reinforced. There were two groups: One learned the discrimination {{through trial and error}} and the other through an errorless learning procedure. Then, both groups were presented with three types of tests. First, they were exposed to intermediate durations between 2  s and 10  s, and given a choice between both <b>keys</b> (<b>stimulus</b> generalization test). Second, a delay from 1  s to 16  s was included between the offset of the sample and the onset of the choice keys (delay test). Finally, pigeons learned a new discrimination in which the stimuli were switched (reversal test). Results showed that pigeons from the Errorless group made significantly fewer errors than those in the Trial-and-Error group. Both groups performed similarly during the stimulus generalization test and the reversal test, but results of the delay test suggested that, on long stimulus trials, responding in the errorless training group was less disrupted by delays...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of informality (tax evasion in particular) utilizing rich cross-country data of firm-level survey from the World Bank, and hypothesizing that competition is a significant factor determining tax evasion behaviors. Competition pressure is a <b>key</b> <b>stimulus</b> to induce questionable manipulations of tax reporting behaviors. However its effect works at a decreasing speed. It is also hypothesized that business obstacles facing firms such as tax administration and corruption play significant roles in explaining tax evasion. This paper further hypothesizes that firm characteristics such as size, age, ownership are important evasion determinants. Empirical results are found supporting these hypotheses above. The analysis controls for country-level effects, for instance {{the quality of the}} legal environment. Industry sectors are also controlled and found significant in explaining corporate tax evasion levels...|$|E
30|$|Farm {{subsidies}} were promoted due {{to concerns}} over the chronically low and highly variable incomes of farmers. The <b>key</b> <b>stimulus</b> for legislative action was the disparity between the incomes of farm and nonfarm households (Mishra and Paudel 2011), but ongoing pressures from World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, criticism of its trade-distorting effects, and consumer concerns regarding the safety and quality of agricultural goods have required the CAP to be continually reformed. In recent years, the most relevant innovation in terms of farm income support tools has been the introduction of decoupled payments by the EU, beginning with the CAP 2003 reform (Moro and Sckokai 2013), which has introduced a new direct payment architecture because the SPS {{has been replaced by}} an innovative system of DPs with eight components (three for mandatory and five for optional) (Westhoek et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Olfactory {{responses}} from the entire antenna and from single antennal sensilla of the male turnip moth, Agrotis segetum (Lepidoptea: Noctuidae Schiff.), were recorded after stimulation of the antenna with the sex pheromone component, (Z) - 5 -decenyl acetate (Z 5 - 10 :OAc), and three sulphur analogues of this compound. Adaptation of olfactory receptor neurones tuned to Z 5 - 10 :OAc was investigated after pre-exposure of these receptor neurones to the <b>key</b> <b>stimulus</b> and to the three sulphur analogues. Both electro-antennographic and single sensillum recordings revealed that the sulphur analogues had a significantly decreased effect compared to the natural stimulus.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the role of the Diffusion of Innovations {{framework}} in adopting an infection prevention and control program (IPCP) in a low and middle income (LMI) country, the Republic of Kiribati. Methods: Case-study methodology was used to examine and contextualise the analysis of the Republic of Kiribati 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of the IPCP from 2003 to 2010. Data were collected from multiple sources including semi-structured interviews, IPCP documentation, program evaluation and a healthcare worker survey. Data were subjected to thematic analysis and descriptive statistics where relevant to the study design. Results: It was found that the self-initiated progression of activities and stimuli has resulted in the successful adoption of a comprehensive IPCP. The process followed the staged model of the classic Diffusion of Innovations process in organisations described by Everett Rogers. Conclusion: This case study provides an illustration of how a comprehensive IPCP can be adopted in a LMI country setting with little involvement from external agencies. It identifies <b>key</b> <b>stimuli,</b> opportunities and activities which could be similarly adopted and implemented by other LMI countries...|$|R
40|$|Floodplain {{wetlands}} of the Murray-Darling Basin provide {{critical habitat}} for numerous species of flora and fauna, yet {{the ecology of}} these wetlands is threatened by a range of environmental issues. This book addresses {{the urgent need for}} an improved ecohydrological understanding of the biota of Australian freshwater wetlands. It synthesises key water and habitat requirements for 35 species of plants, 48 species of waterbirds, 17 native and four introduced species of fish, 15 species of frogs, and 16 species of crustaceans and molluscs found in floodplain wetlands of the Murray-Darling Basin. Each species profile includes: the influence of water regimes on the survival, health and condition of the species; <b>key</b> <b>stimuli</b> for reproduction and germination; habitat and dietary preferences; as well as major knowledge gaps for the species. Floodplain Wetland Biota in the Murray-Darling Basin also provides an overview of the likely impacts of hydrological change on wetland ecosystems and biota, in the context of climate change and variability, with implications for environmental anagement. This important book provides an essential baseline for further education, scientific research and management of floodplain wetland biota in the Murray-Darling Basin. 348 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Cutaneous repair after injury {{requires}} {{activation of}} resident dermal fibroblasts and their transition to myofibroblasts. The <b>key</b> <b>stimuli</b> for myofibroblast formation are activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors and mechanotransduction mediated by integrins and associated proteins. We investigated {{the role of}} integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in TGF-β 1 induction of dermal fibroblast transition to myofibroblasts. ILK-deficient fibroblasts treated with TGF-β 1 exhibited attenuation of Smad 2 and 3 phosphorylation, accompanied by impaired transcriptional activation of Smad targets, such as α-smooth muscle actin. These alterations were not limited to Smad-associated TGF-β 1 responses, as stimulation of noncanonical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways by this growth factor was also diminished {{in the absence of}} ILK. ILK-deficient fibroblasts exhibited abnormalities in the actin cytoskeleton, and did not form supermature focal adhesions or contractile F-actin stress fibers, indicating a severe impairment in their capacity to differentiate into myofibroblasts. These defects extended to the inability of cells to contract extracellular matrices when embedded in collagen lattices. We conclude that ILK is necessary to transduce signals implicated in the transition of dermal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts originating from matrix substrates and TGF-β 1...|$|R
