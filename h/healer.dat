40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} service providers involved in caring for people with 'psychosis' in Uganda. Data from qualitative research investigating conceptualisations of 'madness' held by indigenous, religious and allopathic <b>healers</b> in urban Uganda are used to explore the attitudes of these different service providers towards each other. Case-vignettes of individuals with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder were discussed by the <b>healers</b> and real cases were discussed by allopathic doctors, and their discourse was analysed. The <b>healers</b> varied in their attitudes towards {{other parts of the}} healing context. The indigenous and religious <b>healers</b> were tolerant of allopathic medicine, although the religious <b>healers</b> were inclined to explain its success in terms of a Christian or Islamic framework. In contrast, the allopathic <b>healers</b> made little reference to religious <b>healers</b> and were ambivalent towards indigenous <b>healers.</b> Finally, the relationship between the religious and indigenous <b>healers</b> emerged as one of conflict. The religious <b>healers</b> negated the beliefs and methods of the indigenous <b>healers,</b> whilst the indigenous <b>healers</b> regarded indigenous spirituality and evangelical Christianity as incompatible. Historical and social psychological perspectives are used to understand these differences. There appear to be opportunities for greater dialogue between indigenous and religious <b>healers</b> and allopathic doctors and this could contribute to a more integrative model of care for individuals with psychotic experiences in Uganda.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore and {{describe}} the existing relationship between traditional <b>healers</b> and nurse practitioners in Maseru Health Service Area in Lesotho and also to determine why people consult traditional <b>healers.</b> Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate the relationship between traditional <b>healers</b> and nurse practitioners and also to determine why people utilize the services of traditional <b>healers.</b> The study was limited to Maseru Health Service Area in Lesotho. Data was collected from twenty-seven (27) nurses from nineteen (19) clinics and from thirty (30) traditional <b>healers</b> from the same health service area. Data from traditional <b>healers</b> was collected using semi-structured interviews while nurse practitioners were given a questionnaire to complete. The study revealed that there was no formal relationship between traditional <b>healers</b> and nurse practitioners. Support for traditional <b>healers</b> was revealed to be limited, for example, only four (14. 8 %) nurses had a programme for traditional <b>healers</b> while twenty (66. 7 %) traditional <b>healers</b> did not have any contact with nurse practitioners. Involvement of traditional <b>healers</b> in primary health care at grassroots level has therefore been very minimal. The reasons why people utilize traditional <b>healers</b> were found to be as follows: • When people think they have been bewitched. • Traditional <b>healers</b> can tell the actual cause of disease • Failure of modern practice • For social problems According to the study, both traditional <b>healers</b> and nurse practitioners felt that collaboration between traditional <b>healers</b> and nurse practitioners was essential because it would enable planned referral of patients from one group to another where necessary; it would also facilitate exchange of ideas and knowledge for the benefit of the people served. Recommendations on collaboration and on support systems are given in Chapter Six. Health StudiesD. Litt. et Phil. (Nursing Science...|$|R
40|$|Many African {{traditional}} <b>healers</b> provide {{treatment for}} eye diseases, {{yet there is}} little published information about eye care knowledge and practices among these healers; the information {{is necessary for the}} development of collaborative eye care activities with <b>healers.</b> Focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and a representative sample survey of 107 randomly selected traditional <b>healers</b> in Chikwawa District, Malawi were conducted regarding eye care knowledge and practices. In the survey 68 % of <b>healers</b> treated at least one of six common eye conditions. The most common eye condition treated by <b>healers</b> was cataract, followed by conjunctivitis/inflammatory trachoma. The size of the <b>healer's</b> practice, literacy, and great distance to a health facility were positively associated with the provision of eye care. Traditional <b>healers</b> have considerably more eye care interactions with the rural population than existing biomedical health personnel in Chikwawa District. Interviews revealed that most <b>healers</b> were aware of the availability of treatment for common eye conditions at biomedical health facilities and were interested in collaborating with existing biomedical eye care providers. We subsequently developed a collaborative eye care programme with <b>healers</b> in the district and report on early findings. Collaboration with <b>healers</b> in eye care programmes is advocated and recommendations are provided. traditional <b>healers</b> eye care Malawi...|$|R
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a <b>healer</b> {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the <b>healer</b> prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the <b>healer</b> has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} use of the {{services}} of spiritual <b>healers,</b> among patients visiting the family physicians, at a teaching hospital in, Karachi. Design: Cross-sectional survey Place and Duration of Study: Family practice center, the Aga Khan University, Karachi, from February to June, 2001 Subjects and Methods: A total of 387 patients were surveyed. A questionnaire was developed and administered to collect information on {{the use of}} the services of spiritual <b>healers</b> among the respondents. Results: Most of the respondents were young, well educated and better placed socio-economically. The use of the services of spiritual <b>healers</b> was found in 45 (11. 6 %) of the respondents. Recommendation of someone, having belief in spiritual <b>healers,</b> doctors could not cure and spiritual <b>healers</b> are reliable and effective were stated to be the reasons for consulting them. Reasons given by 342 respondents (88. 3 %) for not consulting the spiritual <b>healers</b> included lack of belief in spiritual <b>healers,</b> allopaths are more effective, spiritual <b>healers</b> are un-scientific and not considered a treatment option. With regards to the future use of the services of spiritual <b>healers,</b> 29 (64. 4 %) of the respondents indicated their willingness to see them, if needed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of traditional <b>healers</b> in sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and collaboration between the traditional and biomedical health care systems as seen by nurses and traditional <b>healers.</b> A convenient sample of 15 professional nurses and 15 traditional <b>healers</b> were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Qualitative analyses identified the following themes: (1) attitude and respect, (2) collaboration between traditional <b>healers</b> and nurses, (3) control/regulation of (traditional) health practices, (4) training needs of <b>healers</b> and nurses. The main results indicated that the professional nurses had mixed attitudes towards traditional <b>healers,</b> mostly negative (e. g. lacked training, used expired medicines, gave improper dosages, and kept poor or no records), but, also positive, such as contributing to the management of opportunistic infections (STIs). The traditional <b>healers</b> also had mixed attitudes towards nurses. The traditional <b>healers</b> believed that nurses undermined their work (did not accept their efficacy in treatment and consequently did not refer patients).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{concepts}} and treatment modalities for diabetes among traditional and faith <b>healers</b> in the Northern Province in South Africa. The sample consisted of 50 traditional <b>healers</b> (13 females and 37 males) and 50 faith <b>healers</b> (12 females and 38 males). They were interviewed on local terminology, clinical manifestations, causes, curability, and treatment for diabetes, help-seeking behaviour of diabetes patients, and the healers’ sources of information about diabetes. Results indicate that all <b>healers</b> were familiar with “diabetes”, however, not all of them had seen patients suffering from diabetes. The perceived causes of diabetes by both traditional and faith <b>healers</b> could be divided into (1) diet (especially too much of sugar), (2) heredity, (3) supernatural, and (4) psychological causes. Most traditional <b>healers</b> (92 %) and faith <b>healers</b> (90 %) indicated that diabetes is curable. Treatments used by the <b>healers</b> in this study included the use of prayer, diet, and herbs. The authors conclude that the concepts and treatment modalities for diabetes among traditional and faith <b>healers</b> should be taken note of by health workers while developing health education programmes in the Province...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. South Africa {{has a high}} HIV/AIDS prevalence. Due to the {{unavailability}} of antiretroviral {{drugs and}} South African’s trust in traditional <b>healers</b> for health problems, traditional <b>healers</b> are involved in treating HIV/AIDS. This dissertation outlines traditional healers’ role in HIV/AIDS in Tembisa, a township situated in the East Rand section of Johannesburg. People living with HIV/AIDS, traditional <b>healers</b> and health care workers were interviewed. The dissertation also confirms the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Tembisa [...] According to the dissertation, a reasonable highest number of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAS) 8 out of 10 consulted Traditional <b>healers</b> to seek treatment of HIV/AIDS Opportunistic infections, although three out of eight indicated that consulting traditional <b>healers</b> was not necessarily their own choice. Two PLWAS {{do not believe in}} traditional <b>healers</b> and have never consulted them. Five PLWAS’s view was that Traditional <b>healers</b> can treat opportunistic infections effectively and they indicated their own health bear evidence to such claims. The study had shown that, although traditional <b>healers</b> have shown good rapport with their clients, and have earned positive respect due to their involvement in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in their communities, there are also challenges with regards to their work that calls for urgent attention. For an example, a highest number of Traditional <b>healers</b> did misrepresent diseases related to sexual intercourse, and also they could not recognize the symptoms of HIV/AIDS. They also hardly gave all biomedical perspective of transmission of HIV/AIDS without being probed. Both the group that believed in traditional <b>healers</b> and those that do not, as well as Biomedicine indicated that using traditional <b>healers</b> alone without biomedicine is not a realistic option. due to their training that is not homogenous and their profession that is rarely regulated.

30|$|Furthermore, {{non-native}} response workers {{attempted to}} educate and negotiate with <b>healers</b> to stop treatment by scarification.

It was noted that there were alternative situations when the <b>healers</b> would make such incisions—this was occasionally observed in epileptic patients, often interpreted as demonic attacks, although some <b>healers</b> would alternatively prescribe herbal concoctions too (Manguvo and Mafuvadze 2015).

40|$|A {{national}} HIV/STD {{prevention program}} focused on traditional <b>healers</b> {{was started in}} South Africa in late 1992. An initial group of 28 <b>healers</b> (the 'first generation') was trained in HIV/AIDS and STD prevention. These 28 in turn trained a total of 630 additional <b>healers</b> (the 'second generation') in formal, week-long workshops within seven months of the first workshop (this figure grew to 1510 <b>healers</b> {{by the end of}} the tenth month). This paper reports results of an assessment of the impact of training during the first seven months of the program. The second generation appeared to be as well trained as the first, if we can rely on measures such as reporting correctly how HIV is transmitted and how HIV transmission can be prevented. <b>Healers</b> also reported advising their patients to use condoms, and demonstrating methods of correct condom use. <b>Healers</b> were initially recruited through national, formal associations of traditional <b>healers,</b> of which there are several in South Africa. Yet several months into the program, <b>healers</b> were critical of donor groups working with and through such associations. Most preferred that membership in such associations not be a prerequisite for participation in donor group-supported collaborative programs.
