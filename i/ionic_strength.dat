5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and <b>ionic</b> <b>strength.</b> The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased <b>ionic</b> <b>strength</b> reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|The total {{volume of}} added strong base should be small {{compared}} to the initial volume of titrand solution {{in order to keep}} the <b>ionic</b> <b>strength</b> nearly constant. This will ensure that pKa remains invariant during the titration.|$|E

When both the {{standard enthalpy}} change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of pKa and ΔH.

30|$|Furthermore, a {{comparison}} with experimental data {{is shown in}} up to 6 molal NaCl solution (Fig.  3). Models based on thermodynamic data from Helgeson and co-workers (slop 16.dat) perform poorly again, even at <b>ionic</b> <b>strength’s</b> lower than 0.5 molal where the Davies equation would still be valid (Stumm and Morgan 1996). Initial solubilities at <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> below 0.1 significantly deviate from experimental data due to the too high log_ 10 K value. As expected, phreeqc.dat {{is not able to}} describe the solubility at very high <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths,</b> but provides remarkably good results. At <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> above 3 molal, experimental data are scarce; however, the available data can be nicely reproduced with pitzer.dat.|$|R
40|$|Histone H 1 -depleted {{chromatin}} {{made from}} acid extracted, intact nuclei {{was exposed to}} various <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths.</b> NaCl concentrations above 0. 3 M sufficed to generate novel oligonucleosomes formerly characterized as "compact oligomers" and "spacerless dinucleosomes". Such particles could not be identified within H 1 -depleted nuclei or chromatin at low <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths.</b> Their formation, proceeding within days at 0 degrees C, was accelerated by increasing <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths.</b> The data was {{discussed in terms of}} a salt-induced motion of nucleosomal core particles along the DNA to form compact oligomers...|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{separation}} of virus rod particles of tobacco mosaic virus {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} externally applied osmotic pressure using an osmotic stress technique. The results have been used to test the assumption that lattice equilibrium in such gels results from a balance between repulsive (electrostatic) and attractive (van der Waals and osmotic) forces. Results have been obtained at different <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> (0. 001 to 1. 0 M) and pH's (5. 0 to 7. 2) and compared with calculated curves for electrostatic nad van der Waals pressure. Under all conditions studied, interrod spacing decreased with increasing applied pressure, the spacings being smaller at higher <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths.</b> Only small differences were seen when the pH was changed. At <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> near 0. 1 M, agreement between theory and experiment is good, but the theory appears to underestimate electrostatic forces at high <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> and to underestimate attractive forces at large interrod spacings (low <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths).</b> It is concluded that an electrostatic-van der Waals force balance can explain stability in tobacco mosaic virus gels near physiological conditions and can provide a good first approximation elsewhere...|$|R
5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high <b>ionic</b> <b>strength</b> and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E
25|$|With {{electrolyte}} solutions, {{the value}} of pKw is dependent on <b>ionic</b> <b>strength</b> of the electrolyte. Values for sodium chloride are typical for a 1:1 electrolyte. With 1:2 electrolytes, MX2, pKw decreases with increasing <b>ionic</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{different}} parameters, which influence {{the release of}} diclofenac sodium (2 -[(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) amino]benzeneacetic acid mono sodium salt) from lipophilic matrix prolonged release tablets, were investigated. Solubility characteristics of diclofenac sodium in aqueous media with various <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths,</b> <b>ionic</b> compositions and pH {{in the range of}} 1 to 10 were determined. According to the obtained results different experimental conditions of the dissolution test on the drug release profiles were studied, i. e. different dissolution apparatus, various rotation speeds of the stirring elements, different buffer media with a pH in the range of 5. 8 to 10. 0 and various <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths.</b> The amount of released diclofenac sodium was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at the wavelength of maximum absorbance at 276 ± 2 nm. From the obtained results it can be concluded, that solubility of diclofenac sodium depends mainly on composition and pH of the dissolution medium and also on <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> of the dissolution medium. Besides these parameters, on the release of diclofenac sodium from lipophilic matrix tablets influence also type of dissolution apparatus and particularly rotation speeds of the stirring elements.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of cyanide and of metal-cyanide complexes in gold hydrometallurgy, {{and the need for}} reliable thermodynamic data for modelling gold solution chemistry, no comprehensive critical overview of the thermodynamics of hydrogen/cyanide and metal/cyanide complex formation has appeared in the literature since that of Beck in 1987. In particular there has been little consideration of the values of the equilibrium constants (and related thermodynamic parameters) at the higher <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> and non-standard temperatures more typical of hydrometallurgical processing. The copper(I) /cyanide system is of particular importance in gold hydrometallurgy as gold is often associated with copper sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite, chalcocite, covellite and bornite, all of which except chalcopyrite are reasonably soluble in cyanide solutions due to the formation of copper(I) /cyanide complexes. This paper reviews the available thermodynamic data for the hydrogen/cyanide and copper(I) /cyanide systems in aqueous solution with special emphasis on measurements made at elevated <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> and as a function of temperature. It has been found that, while reliable data are available at 25 °C and very low <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths,</b> the data for higher <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> and temperatures are limited.

40|$|AbstractWe {{completed}} a biophysical {{characterization of the}} c-MYC proto-oncogene P 1 promoter quadruplex and its interaction with a cationic porphyrin, 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetra(N-methyl- 4 -pyridyl) porphyrin (TMPyP 4), using differential scanning calorimetry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We examined three different 24 -mer oligonucleotides, including the wild-type (WT) sequence found in the c-MYC P 1 promoter and two mutant G→T sequences that are known to fold into single 1 : 2 : 1 and 1 : 6 : 1 loop isomer quadruplexes. Biophysical experiments were performed on all three oligonucleotide sequences at two different <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> (30  mM [K+] and 130  mM [K+]). Differential scanning calorimetry experiments demonstrated that the WT quadruplex consists of a mixture {{of at least two}} different folded conformers at both <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths,</b> whereas both mutant sequences exhibit a single two-state melting transition at both <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths.</b> Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that both mutant sequences bind 4  mols of TMPyP 4 to 1  mol of DNA, in similarity to the WT sequence. The circular dichroism spectroscopy signatures for all three oligonucleotides at both <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> are consistent with an intramolecular parallel stranded G-quadruplex structure, and no change in quadruplex structure is observed upon addition of saturating amounts of TMPyP 4 (i. e., 4 : 1 TMPyP 4 /DNA) ...|$|R

The suspensions have been characterized using rheology and a combination of scattering techniques (neutrons, X-rays, and light).

40|$|The {{stability}} constants, β 1 [MF+(aq) ], for {{the formation}} of the monofluoride complexes of zinc(II) and cadmium(II) in aqueous solution have been determined at 25 °C and <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> ranging from 0. 01 to 3 M (NaClO 4) by fluoride ion-selective electrode potentiometry. Despite the difference in size of the zinc(II) and cadmium(II) ions their β 1 values are almost identical.

The adsorbed amount as a function of pH has a maximum for both proteins. This maximum coincides with the isoelectric point for succinylated lysozyme, and is close to the isoelectric point for lysozyme.

Comparison with experimental data indicates that a theory parameterized by binary and ternary data can be used to accurately predict solubilities in much more complex mixtures. Mineral solubilities calculated with this model are compared with those calculated from other currently available models.

40|$|The {{electrical}} potential due to fixed charge distributions is strongly altered {{in the vicinity}} of a membrane and notably dependent on aqueous electrolyte concentration. We present an efficient way to solve the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation applicable to general cylindrically symmetric dielectric geometries. It generalizes Gouy-Chapman theory to systems containing transmembrane channels. The method is applied to three channel systems: gramicidin, gap junction, and porin. We find that for a long, narrow channel such as gramicidin concentration variation has little influence on the electrical image barrier to ion permeation. However, electrolyte shielding reduces the image induced contribution to the energy required for multiple occupancy. In addition, the presence of electrolyte significantly affects the voltage profile due to an applied potential, substantially compressing the electric field to the immediate vicinity of the pore itself. In the large diameter channels, where bulk electrolyte may be assumed to enter the pore, the electrolyte greatly reduces the image barrier to ion permeation. At physiological <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> this barrier is negligible and the channel may be readily multiply occupied. At all <b>ionic</b> <b>strengths</b> considered (l greater than 0. 005 M) the image barrier saturates rapidly and is essentially constant more than one channel radius from the entrance to the pore.
