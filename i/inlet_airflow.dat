40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an altitude test chamber {{to determine the effects}} of <b>inlet</b> <b>airflow</b> distortion on the compressor steady-state and surge characteristics of a high-pressure ratio, axial-flow turbojet engine. Circumferential-type inlet flow distortions were investigated, which covered a range of distortion sector angles from 20 deg to 168 deg and distortion levels up to 22 percent. The presence of <b>inlet</b> <b>airflow</b> distortions at the compressor face resulted in a substantial increase in the local pressure ratio in the distorted region, primarily for the inlet stages. The local pressure ratio in the distorted region for the inlet stages increased as either the distortion sector angle decreased or the percent distortion increased. The average compressor-surge pressure ratio was much more sensitive to <b>inlet</b> <b>airflow</b> distortions at lower engine speeds than at engine speeds near rated. Hence, compressor-surge margin reduction due to <b>inlet</b> <b>airflow</b> distortion was quite severe at the lower engine speeds. Although the average compressor-surge pressure ratio was generally reduced with inlet flow distortion, local pressure ratios across the distorted sector of the compressor were obtained during surge and were significantly greater than the normal compressor-surge pressure ratio.

To simulate actual operating conditions, {{the effects of}} inlet velocity of clean air and crane movement speed on contaminant removal efficiency (CRE) are considered, and a particle release technique is analyzed to determine contaminant concentrations in the stocker.
