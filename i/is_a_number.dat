5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> encoding certain {{properties of the}} matrix. A matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) of the image of the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.|$|E

50|$|For example, one {{important}} problem <b>is</b> whether <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> prime <b>number.</b> Its complement {{is to determine}} whether <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> composite <b>number</b> (<b>a</b> <b>number</b> which <b>is</b> not prime).

5|$|Zero <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number,</b> {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E

25|$|In {{analogy with}} arithmetic, it is {{possible}} to define addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of functions, in those cases where the output <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number.</b> Another important operation defined on functions is function composition, where the output from one function becomes the input to another function.|$|E
25|$|In number theory, {{a perfect}} number is a {{positive}} integer that {{is equal to the}} sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) i.e. σ1(n)=2n.|$|E
25|$|Thus the Chow {{group of}} an {{elliptic}} curve X {{is closely related}} to the group X(k) of k-rational points of X. When k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> field, X(k) is called the Mordell–Weil group of X, and some of the deepest problems in number theory are attempts to understand this group. When k is the complex numbers, the example of an elliptic curve shows that Chow groups can be uncountable abelian groups.|$|E
