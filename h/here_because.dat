5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other but not with others) is of no help <b>here</b> <b>because</b> archaea reproduce asexually.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place <b>here.</b> <b>Because</b> of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E

5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed <b>here</b> <b>because</b> of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
