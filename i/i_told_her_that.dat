2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she had a big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing. Imagine how stupid I felt about four months later, I’m in London driving around and I hear, ‘And now, the Top of the Pops, Tracey Ullman with ‘They Don’t Know About Us.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{pictures}} were shot in Los Angeles, California, in April 2000. In {{an interview with}} CNN's Style with Elsa Klensch, Mondino {{said that he was}} the one who had the idea of the western themes for the album, and also stated: [...] " [...] wasn't sure at first, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if she didn't like it I won't charge her. But she loved the final result!". Madonna also decided to use her new country style during her public appearances for Musics promotion; including jeans, shirts and cowboy hats. On her next tour in 2001, Madonna included a segment based entirely on this ambient. Meanwhile, Fouz-Hernández explained that [...] "in this appearance Madonna may be parodying and criticizing Country, which symbolizes among other things, the supremacy of the white man, the ambition of the European pioneers and the American Dream. However, we do not realize that while recognizing the importance that the country has in American popular culture, and joins a long list of artists who have done this previously. Despite this, the cowgirl image of Madonna has become one of her most recognized reinventions.|$|E
2500|$|North Carolina {{finished}} {{the regular season}} at 16–15, dropped to third in all-time wins, and bowed {{out in the first}} round of the ACC tournament. The Tar Heels did not receive a post-season tournament bid by the NCAA—the only time in Williams' coaching career that his team didn't take part in that tournament when eligible to do so. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT. The Tar Heels made it to the NIT championship game versus Dayton, which was played on April 1, 2010, at Madison Square Garden. The Tar Heels lost by a score of 79–68, bringing their overall tally to 20–17 for the 2009–10 season. This 20-win season however kept Williams' streak of 20-win seasons alive. Williams stated that the season was [...] "the biggest frustration and the biggest disappointment of my professional life". In addition to frustrating play, Williams was criticized for comparing the season to the disaster in Haiti by stating, [...] "Our massage therapist told me, she said 'You know, Coach, what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe. What you're having is a disappointment.' And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> depends on which chair she was sitting in, because it does feel like a catastrophe to me, and that's because it is my life." [...] Williams later apologized for his comments, stating that he misspoke and [...] "neglected to say that it puts basketball in perspective." ...|$|E

2500|$|Neptune {{entered the}} battle about 25 {{minutes after the}} start of the action, having by then drifted to leeward and fallen astern of Redoutable. Neptune should have had the {{position}} immediately astern of Bucentaure, but the [...] Spanish 74-gun San Justo, which should have been four places astern of Neptune had drifted up to leeward. Maistral hailed San Justo The San Justo not being in her station and edging down to place herself on my windward beam hampered me; I at once hailed her to enquire if she knew her station; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> mine was to be next astern to the Bucentaure; she replied that she was about to place herself astern of me, which she did not do, and continued to the wind and to fore-reach on me, which made me fall off a little to leeward and to draw away from the flagship, of whom I had been within hail in the first place. San Justos captain, Francisco Javier Garstón, blamed the crew's inexperience for failing to keep her station. This would be significant in the coming battle as the position astern of the flagship would be the focus of British attention, and should have been occupied by a powerful ship like the Neptune. Meanwhile, the ship that should have been astern of Neptune, the Spanish 64-gun San Leandro, was following San Justo to leeward, leaving a considerable gap behind the flagship that the British could exploit. Redoutables captain, Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, saw the threat, and brought his ship forward in an attempt to close the gap. Despite his efforts, the British were able to break the line between Bucentaure and Redoubtable.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{wanted to}} know what you did--how you spent your time. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you had no profession, that you did nothing except play cricket and polo, and hunt and shoot, she seemed most unaccountably surprised. She {{appeared}} almost incredulous when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you seldom came to London, and still more seldom went abroad. I wonder what she had in her head?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rectus couldn't; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I {{understood}} the language tolerably well, {{and asked her}} why she wished to know.|$|E

6000|$|... "The Princess is much {{interested}} in you, and sends her love. She is impatient to take you under <b>her</b> care. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{it will not be}} long--nor will it.|$|R

6000|$|... "She says," [...] Simonne continued, [...] "that {{she wrote}} a letter to you this morning, and she brings you a second note herself. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you will not receive anyone, and..." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{sat down}} on the wayside, where she took a place beside me, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> matter much as I have written it, my {{thoughts}} about her father's dealing being alone omitted.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> had {{happened}} in the chandler's shop, bringing in the bundle of rags, and the circumstance of my carrying home the candles in the old torn cravat, as often as possible.|$|R

60|$|She {{said she}} would come with me. She felt the change would do her good, and promised not to do {{anything}} when she got there. And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had done for Dick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay; {{as for my}} {{exact words}} I cannot {{remember}} them. I was thinking more of the words with which it might be fitting that I should answer the bishop. But <b>I</b> certainly <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she had better mind her distaff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite. I did get {{a letter}} this morning from my friend Bernard Dale,--that old harridan's nephew; and Lord De Guest has been worried by some of his animals. I wish <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> his stupid old neck had been broken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{unless you}} wish to draw it out. She told me, some time ago, why she placed it in your name; and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be no}} difficulty." ...|$|E

60|$|In a {{few words}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the tale <b>that</b> we had heard from the dying soldier, and she listened eagerly.|$|R

6000|$|... "You may as {{well know}} everything," [...] she said.

6000|$|... "Silence {{would have}} been unfair. I don't think it {{would have been}} kind either. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she must be {{prepared}} for the world passing a very severe judgment on her father..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I persisted; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I greatly desired {{that she}} should speak a few {{sentences}} in Burmese into my instrument. I had a certain reason for this which I would explain afterwards.|$|E

60|$|We {{were good}} friends, Janet and I, and {{therefore}} it was that I personally undertook her reformation. It was not an occasion for mincing one's words.
