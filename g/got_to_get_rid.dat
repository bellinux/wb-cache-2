According to Bessell, Thorpe said of Scott: [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him", and later: [...] "It is no worse than {{shooting}} a sick dog." [...] Bessell said later that he was unsure whether Thorpe was serious, but decided to play along, by discussing various ways {{of getting rid of}} Scott's body. Thorpe supposedly thought that disposal down one of Cornwall's many disused tin mines offered the best option, and also suggested his friend David Holmes as an appropriate assassin. Holmes, one of four assistant treasurers of the Liberal Party appointed by Thorpe in 1965, had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.|$|E

Stranahan then {{attempts}} to [...] "jog" [...] Rudy's memory of Victoria Barletta's death by [...] "recreating" [...] {{the circumstances of the}} botched nose job, with Rudy as the [...] "patient." [...] Scared, Rudy confesses: he killed Vicki (purely by accident), then <b>got</b> George <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of the body. He also confesses to hiring Chemo to kill Stranahan; Chemo is so alarmed (or embarrassed) at Stranahan learning that Chemo agreed to kill him in exchange for a discount on surgery, that he kills Graveline. Stranahan ties Chemo up, calls the police, and swims away. Garcia arrives, and Chemo is arrested.|$|R

In the past, when you have {{contrived}} to extricate self or some pal from some little difficulty, you have frequently shown a disposition {{to take advantage of}} my gratitude to gain some private end. Those purple socks, for instance. Also the plus fours and the Old Etonian spats. Choosing your moment with subtle cunning, you came to me when I was weakened by relief and <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of them. And what I am saying now is that if you are successful on the present occasion there must be no rot of that description about that mess-jacket of mine." ...|$|R
5000|$|The title {{originated}} from {{the name of}} a brand of bath salts or Run Devil Run oil a folk remedy to ward off evildoers which McCartney had picked up at Miller's Rexall Drugs, a hoodoo store in Atlanta. The mock up of a shop with the name [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] on the album cover is of Miller's Rexall Drugs, with the name altered to fit the title song. In the album press release interview prior to release of the album the interviewer asked McCartney about the genesis of the title track. McCartney answered as follows: I was in Atlanta with my son and he wanted to visit the funky side of town. So we went down there and were just wandering around the block and we came across this sort of voodoo shop selling cures for everything. I was looking in the shop window and I saw this bottle of bath salts called Ran Devil Run. I thought that was a good title for a song. So when I was on holiday after that I started thinking of words for it and it came quite easily - 'Run Devil Run, the angels having fun, making, winners out of sinners, better leave before he's done, and when he gets through he'll be coming after you, so listen to what I'm telling you, run Devil run.' After continuing to describe the process of the lyrics, written while sailing, McCartney said that he himself was planning to use the Run Devil Run bath salts: Yeah, I'm getting the bath salts and I'll be taking a bath with them. Not that I have <b>got</b> many demons <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of but there may be one or two lurking and this stuff is definitely going to do the trick.|$|R

But, as far as heard from, up to date, he means paint first, last, and all the time. At any rate, I'm {{going to take}} him on that basis. He's got some pretty good ideas about it, and he's been stirred up by this talk, just now, about getting our {{manufactures}} into the foreign markets. There's an overstock in everything, and we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of it, or we've got to shut down till the home demand begins again. We've had two or three such flurries before now, and they didn't amount to much. They say we can't extend our commerce under the high tariff system we've got now, because there ain't any sort of reciprocity on our side,--we want to have the other fellows show all the reciprocity,--and the English have got the advantage of us every time. I don't know whether it's so or not; but I don't see why it should apply to my paint. Anyway, he wants to try it, and I've about made up my mind to let him. Of course I ain't going to let him take all the risk. I believe in the paint TOO, and I shall pay his expenses anyway." ...|$|E
