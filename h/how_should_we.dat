25|$|While still a Democrat, {{she and her}} then-fiancé Marcus were {{inspired}} to join the pro-life movement by Francis Schaeffer's 1976 Christian documentary film <b>How</b> <b>Should</b> <b>We</b> Then Live? They prayed outside of clinics and engaged in sidewalk counseling, a pro-life protest activity in which activists approach people entering abortion clinics {{in an attempt to}} dissuade women from obtaining abortions. Since then, Bachmann has made statements supportive of sidewalk counseling. Bachmann was a supporter of Jimmy Carter in 1976, and she and her husband worked on his campaign. During Carter's presidency, Bachmann became disappointed with his liberal approach to public policy, support for legalized abortion and economic decisions she held responsible for increased gas prices. In the 1980 presidential election, she voted for Ronald Reagan and worked for his campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Bachmann has cited theologian Francis Schaeffer as a [...] "profound influence" [...] on {{her life}} and her husband's, {{specifically}} referring to his film series <b>How</b> <b>Should</b> <b>We</b> Then Live?. She has also described Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity by Nancy Pearcey as a [...] "wonderful" [...] book. Journalist Ryan Lizza has argued that Bachmann's worldview is deeply influenced by the Christian movement known as Dominionism, citing the influence of Schaeffer and Pearcey as evidence. Others have criticized Lizza's article, especially its connection of Schaeffer with Dominionism. However, religion writer Sarah Posner broadly concurs with Lizza, pointing {{to the influence of}} Christian Reconstructionists Herb Titus and R. J. Rushdoony on Bachmann via the curriculum at O. W. Coburn School of Law.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, the American {{historian}} Charles S. Maier described Nolte's {{approach in}} Deutschland und der kalte Krieg as: [...] "This approach threatens to degenerate into the excessive valuation of abstraction {{as a surrogate}} for real transactions that Heine satirized and Marx dissected. <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>we</b> cope with a study that begins its discussion of the Cold War with Herodotus and the Greeks versus the Persians? ... Instead Nolte indulges in a potted history of Cold War events as they engulfed Asia and the Middle East as well as Europe, up through the Sino-Soviet dispute, the Vietnam War and SALT. The rationale is evidently that Germany can be interpreted only {{in the light of}} the world conflict, but the result verges on a centrifugal, coffee-table narrative".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the course}} of her novitiate, contemplation of the Holy Face had nourished her inner life. This is an image {{representing}} the disfigured face of Jesus during His Passion. And she meditated on certain passages from the prophet Isaiah (Chapter 53). Six weeks before her death she remarked to Pauline, [...] "The words in Isaiah: 'no stateliness here, no majesty, no beauty,...one despised, left out of all human reckoning; <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>we</b> take any account of him, a man so despised (...) – these words were the basis of my whole worship of the Holy Face. I, too, wanted to be without comeliness and beauty..unknown to all creatures." [...] On the eve of her profession she wrote to Sister Marie, Tomorrow I shall be the bride of Jesus 'whose face was hidden and whom no man knew' – what a union and what a future!. The meditation also helped her understand the humiliating situation of her father.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in the mid-20th century, {{religious}} fundamentalists and {{the religious}} right began using the term [...] "secular humanism" [...] in hostile fashion. Francis A. Schaeffer, an American theologian based in Switzerland, seizing upon {{the exclusion of the}} divine from most humanist writings, argued that rampant secular humanism would lead to moral relativism and ethical bankruptcy in his book <b>How</b> <b>Should</b> <b>We</b> Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture (1976). Schaeffer portrayed secular humanism as pernicious and diabolical, and warned it would undermine the moral and spiritual tablet of America. His themes have been very widely repeated in Fundamentalist preaching in North America. Toumey (1993) found that secular humanism is typically portrayed as a vast evil conspiracy, deceitful and immoral, responsible for feminism, pornography, abortion, homosexuality, and New Age spirituality. [...] In certain areas of the world, Humanism finds itself in conflict with religious fundamentalism, especially over the issue of {{the separation of church and}} state. Many Humanists see religions as superstitious, repressive and closed-minded, while religious fundamentalists may see Humanists as a threat to the values set out in their sacred texts.|$|E
2500|$|Schaeffer was {{eventually}} persuaded to adapt his book <b>How</b> <b>Should</b> <b>We</b> Then Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture to film by Gospel Films, Inc. by CEO and executive evangelical media producer Billy Zeoli who pitched {{the idea of}} hiring Schaeffer's then recently married son, teenage father, and painter Frank Schaeffer as a producer for the film project. [...] Zeoli was instrumental in providing the Schaeffers with introductions to wealthy American evangelicals who would eventually bankroll the How We Should Then Live film project. This book is still being read and used today in American Universities {{as well as in}} various small group studies to help shed light on the contemporary cultural problems of the past and how they have led to many of the issues that America is facing today. Issues such as race, apathy, abortion, and the non-compassionate use of wealth are topics still relevant today. Schaeffer argues that the humanist base for morals is fundamentally a weak base upon which to build a moral framework for society. By contrast, the Bible, understood as the revealed revelation from God is able to provide a fundamentally sound basis for societal norms as well as a base for science. The president of Christian Leaders Institute (CLI), [...] Henry Reyenga Jr., secured rights to post this film series in an ethics class at CLI. This freemium ministry training school lists [...] "deceased" [...] Francis Schaeffer on its faculty.|$|E

For the word of God abideth for ever in heaven, even Jesus Christ, who is the Light {{of the world and the}} Life of men. To him all power is given in heaven and earth. He is set on the throne, judging right, and ministering true {{judgment}} among the people. All things, as the Psalmist says, come to an end. All men's plans, men's notions, men's systems, men's doctrines, grow old, wear out, and perish.|$|R
