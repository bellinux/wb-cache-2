40|$|The {{collection}} contains {{a series of}} recorded meteorological observations taken daily between 1877 - 1922 by pastoralist, astronomer and meteorologist Algernon Henry Belfield at Eversleigh Station in the New England region, 20 kilometres north west of Armidale. The collection comprises 42 Meteorological Observation Books, available as 28 PDF files containing scans of front cover, back cover and each page for each Meteorological Observation Book. The combined size of all data files is 477 MB. The original Meteorological Observation Books for years 1879, 1880 and 1881 are missing and therefore are not digitally available. Daily observations/readings include: attached thermometer, barometer, dry bulb, wet bulb, maximum temperature (Fahrenheit), minimum temperature (Fahrenheit), rain (measure), direction of wind, wind force 0 - 12, cloud coverage 0 - 10, visual daily weather observations including fine and clear, cloudy, fog, thunder, showery, dull, cloudless, squally. Monthly tallies were recorded including: total days of rain, total days of lightning, mean <b>diurnal</b> <b>range,</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>diurnal</b> <b>range,</b> <b>greatest</b> range, mean temperature, mean maximum, mean minimum, mean dry, mean wet, mean cloud, mean humidity, inches of rain, inches of rain (since beginning of the year), winds. The original Meteorological Observing Books were deposited in the University of New England Heritage Centre by Mr Richard E. H. Belfield, Algernon Belfield's grandson. The collection was digitised for Cultural Collections, University of Newcastle by William Oates, University Archivist at the University of New England Heritage Centre...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The bulk heat {{transfer}} coefficient (CH) indicates the land–atmosphere thermal coupling strength. We seek to detect its variability and changes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during 1981 – 2006, particularly concerned with its effects on the sensible heat source. CH is parameterized by Monin– Obukhov similarity theory combining routine meteorological measurements. The South Asian monsoon period is charac-terized by weak sensible heat flux (H), but strong thermal coupling (CH). Winter sees the <b>greatest</b> <b>diurnal</b> CH <b>range,</b> roughly 0. 001 – 0. 008. On average, CH exhibits a notable nighttime increase (10 % decade− 1) and a weak daytime decrease (− 5 % decade− 1). The strengthening thermal coupling at selected sites alleviates the weakening of H, because it enhances nighttime H increase and reduces daytime H decrease. Moreover, we confirm the finding in earlier studies that sensible heating is weakening on the TP, but find its trend less notable than empirically estimated using CH= 0. 004...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how crop systems {{might respond}} to recent {{climate change is}} {{fundamental}} to the successful adaptation of efforts for sustainable agriculture. In the present paper, records over the period 1987 - 2004 from a long-term agroecosystem experiment carried out in Northeast China were used to explore the impacts of global warming on soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) yields under different controlled fertilization treatments. The results indicated that soybean yields were closely related to growing season temperatures. In most fertilization treatments, soybean yields showed a significant negative response to higher daily maximum temperature and <b>greater</b> <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> (DTR), whereas they showed a significant positive response to higher daily minimum temperature. Analysis of covariance showed that these responses of soybean yields to temperature variables did not differ across fertilization treatments. Overall, soybean yields have declined significantly due to the warming trends since 1987. This has been mainly attributed to the higher daily maximum temperature. The present report demonstrates that soybean production in Northeast China may face challenges due to global warming unless potential adaptation options are adopted. The true mechanisms behind these yield impacts need further investigation to address effective agricultural adaptations for soybean systems to adapt to global warming...|$|R

40|$|Ectotherms, such as insects, {{experience}} non-constant {{temperatures in}} nature. Daily mean temperatures {{can be derived}} from the daily maximum and minimum temperatures. However, the converse is not true and environments with the same mean temperature can exhibit very different <b>diurnal</b> temperate <b>ranges.</b> Here we apply a degree-day model for development of the grape berry moth (Paralobesia viteana, a significant vineyard pest in the northeastern USA) to investigate how different <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> conditions can influence degree-day accumulation and, hence, insect life history. We first consider changes in <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> independent of changes in mean temperatures. We then investigate grape berry moth life history under potential climate change conditions, increasing mean temperature via variable patterns of change to <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range.</b> We predict that <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> change can substantially alter insect life history. Altering <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> independent of the mean temperature can affect development rate and voltinism, with the magnitude of the effects dependent on whether changes occur to the daily minimum temperature (Tmin), daily maximum temperature (Tmax), or both. Allowing for an increase in mean temperature produces more marked effects on life history but, again, the patterns and magnitude depend {{on the nature of the}} change to <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> together with the starting conditions in the local environment.

Eight temporary stations were set up between the Taitung (TT) and Hengchun (HC) stations, distributed evenly over the Hengchum peninsula during 13 September 2012 to 25 January 2013 to clarify the phenomenon.

The seasonal variation of clear-sky LST in above areas varies distinctly for the dierent surface albedo, soil water content, {{and the extent of}} in uence by solar radiation. The monthly average <b>diurnal</b> <b>ranges</b> of LST have two peaks and two valleys in one year. The characteristics of LST in most land of East Asia and that of sea surface temperature (SST) in the south of Taiwan Strait and the Yellow Sea are also analyzed as comparison. Tarim Basin and Hunshandake Sands have not only considerable LST diurnal cycle but also remarkable seasonal variation. In 2000, the maximum monthly average <b>diurnal</b> <b>ranges</b> of LST in both areas are over 30 K, and the annual range in Hunshadake Sands reaches 58. 50 K. Seasonal variation of LST in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is less than those in East Asia, Tarim Basin, and Hunshandake Sands. However, the maximum <b>diurnal</b> <b>range</b> exists in this area. The yearly average <b>diurnal</b> <b>range</b> is 28. 05 K in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in 2000.

40|$|The {{downscaling}} of geostationary diurnal thermal {{data can}} ease {{the lack of}} land surface temperature (LST) datasets that combine high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the downscaling of diurnal LST data is more demanding than single scenes. This is because the spatiotemporal interrelationships of the original LST data have to be preserved and accurately reproduced by the downscaled LST (DLST) data. To that end, LST disaggregation kernels/predictors that provide information about the spatial distribution of LST during different times of a day can prove especially useful. Such LST predictors are the LST Annual Cycle Parameters (ACPs). In this work, multitemporal ACPs are employed for downscaling daytime and nighttime ~ 4 km geostationary LST from SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) down to 1 km. The overall goal is to assess if {{the use of the}} ACPs can improve the estimation of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>range</b> of DLST (daytime DLST minus nighttime DLST). The evaluation is performed by comparing the DLST <b>diurnal</b> <b>range</b> maps with reference data from MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer) and also with data retrieved from {{a modified version of the}} TsHARP (Thermal Sharpening) algorithm. The results suggest that the ACPs increase the downscaling performance, improve the estimation of <b>diurnal</b> DLST <b>range</b> and produce more accurate spatial patterns...|$|R
