5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares {{believed}} this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny.

5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering.

5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character <b>from</b> <b>killing,</b> cursing, or having sex.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to find answers, Vincent goes to the town of Nibelheim where Lucrecia studied Omega and Chaos. Whilst at Lucrecia's {{research}} lab, Vincent is ambushed by Rosso the Crimson, who steals the Protomateria but is prevented <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> Vincent by the arrival of Yuffie. As they return to the WRO headquarters, they find that Deepground has launched an assault on the base. However, Deepground member Shelke the Transparent has been captured by the WRO, and reveals that she is synaptically interconnected to Lucrecia's memories, thus allowing the WRO to complete Lucrecia's research on Omega. Shelke's sister, Shalua Rui, a high ranking scientist in the WRO, soon discovers that Omega is a WEAPON, which activates when the Planet senses that it is in mortal danger (like the WEAPONs it activated in the original Final Fantasy VII). Omega's function is to absorb the Lifestream from the Planet and then move to another planet, leaving the inhabitants behind to die. Deepground plans to slaughter a huge number of people at once so as to 'trick' the planet into activating Omega prematurely.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramopakhyana (the {{narrative}} of Rama in the epic Mahabharata), Sita informs Hanuman that Trijata brought her {{a message from}} Avindhya about the well-being of Rama, and that he and Lakshamana will soon come to rescue her from Lanka. Trijata thus assumes the role assigned to Kala in the original Ramayana. The Raghuvamsa, the Setubandha, the Balaramadasa Ramayana, the Kakawin Ramayana and the Seri Rama all replace Sarama with Trijata in the episode where {{the truth of the}} illusory head of Rama is revealed to Sita. The Prasannaraghava has Trijata inform Sita about the burning of Lanka, instead of Sarama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana makes Trijata the saviour of Sita, when she stops Ravana <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> Sita in the Ashoka Vatika; this role was originally assigned to Mandodari. Trijata again saves Sita's life when a vengeful Ravana rushes to slay his captive after his son Indrajit is killed in the war. In the Ramayana, Suparshva – a minister of Ravana – stops him, while other adaptations attribute the act variously to Avindhya or Mandodari.|$|E

5|$|In {{the myth}} called the Destruction of Mankind, related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), Ra uses the Eye {{as a weapon}} against humans who have rebelled against his authority. He sends the Eye—Hathor, in her {{aggressive}} manifestation as the lioness goddess Sekhmet—to massacre them. She does so, but after {{the first day of}} her rampage, Ra decides to prevent her <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims. Through her drunkenness she has been returned to a harmless form. Nadine Guilhou suggests that the Eye's rampage alludes to the heat and widespread disease of the Egyptian summer, and in particular to the epagomenal days before the new year, which were regarded as unlucky. The red beer might then refer to the red silt that accompanied the subsequent Nile flood, which was believed to end the period of misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Later, Suzuha Amane, Daru's future daughter, {{arrives in}} a time machine to tell Okabe {{that the only way}} to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III is to prevent Kurisu's father Nakabachi <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> her and {{stealing}} her time travel theories. Suzuha and Okabe travel back in time, but Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself. Returning to the present, Okabe receives a message from his future self telling him that to escape the current timeline, he needs to save Kurisu while recreating the vision of the dead Kurisu that his past self saw. Traveling back in time again, he provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, knocks Kurisu unconscious, and puts her in his pool of blood for his past self to see, causing the timeline to diverge into one where Kurisu lives and World War III does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident <b>from</b> <b>killing</b> any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E
