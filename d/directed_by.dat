5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), <b>{{directed}}</b> <b>by</b> John Boulting; They Made Me a Fugitive (1947), <b>directed</b> <b>by</b> Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small Back Room (1948), <b>directed</b> <b>by</b> Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), <b>directed</b> <b>by</b> Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), <b>directed</b> <b>by</b> Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The Last Page (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only <b>directed</b> <b>by</b> an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E
