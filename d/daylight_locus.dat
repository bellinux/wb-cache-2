40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of colour constancy in human visual perception keeps surface colours constant, despite {{changes in their}} reflected light due to changing illumination. Although colour constancy has evolved under a constrained subset of illuminations, it is unknown whether its underlying mechanisms, thought to involve multiple components from retina to cortex, are optimised for particular environmental variations. Here we demonstrate a new method for investigating colour constancy using illumination matching in real scenes which, unlike previous methods using surface matching and simulated scenes, allows testing of multiple, real illuminations. We use real scenes consisting of solid familiar or unfamiliar objects against uniform or variegated backgrounds and compare discrimination performance for typical illuminations from the daylight chromaticity locus (approximately blue-yellow) and atypical spectra from an orthogonal locus (approximately red-green, at correlated colour temperature 6700 K), all produced in real time by a 10 -channel LED illuminator. We find that discrimination of illumination changes is poorer along the <b>daylight</b> <b>locus</b> than the atypical locus, and is poorest particularly for bluer illumination changes, demonstrating conversely that surface colour constancy is best for blue daylight illuminations. Illumination discrimination is also enhanced, and therefore colour constancy diminished, for uniform backgrounds, irrespective of the object type. These results are not explained by statistical properties of the scene signal changes at the retinal level. We conclude that high-level mechanisms of colour constancy are biased for the blue dayligh...|$|E
40|$|Wemeasure {{the color}} {{fidelity}} of visual scenes that are rendered under different (simulated) illuminants and shown on a calibrated LCD display. Observers make triad illuminant comparisons involving the renderings from two chromatic test illuminants and one achromatic reference illuminant shown simultaneously. Four chromatic test illuminants are used: two along the <b>daylight</b> <b>locus</b> (yellow and blue), and two perpendicular to it (red and green). The observers select the rendering {{having the best}} color fidelity, thereby indirectly judging {{which of the two}} test illuminants induces the smallest color differences compared to the reference. Both multicolor test scenes and natural scenes are studied. The multicolor scenes are synthesized and represent ellipsoidal distributions in CIELAB chromaticity space having the same mean chromaticity but different chromatic orientations. We show that, for those distributions, color fidelity is best when the vector of the illuminant change (pointing from neutral to chromatic) is parallel to the major axis of the scene’s chromatic distribution. For our selection of natural scenes, which generally have much broader chromatic distributions, we measure a higher color fidelity for the yellow and blue illuminants than for red and green. Scrambled versions of the natural images are also studied to exclude possible semantic effects. We quantitatively predict the average observer response (i. e., the illuminant probability) with four types of models, differing in {{the extent to which they}} incorporate information processing by the visual system. Results show different levels of performance for the models, and different levels for the multicolor scene...|$|E
40|$|Experience and {{experiments}} on human color constancy (i. e., Arend & Reeves, 1986; Craven & Foster, 1992) {{tell us that}} we are capable of judging the illumination. However, when asked to make a match of the illuminant´s color and brightness, human observers seem to be quite poor (Granzier, Brenner, & Smeets, 2009 a). Here we investigate whether human observers use (rather than match) daylight for estimating ecologically important dimensions: time of year, time of day, and outdoor temperature. In the first three experiments we had our observers evaluate calibrated color images of an outdoor urban scene acquired throughout a year. Although some observers could estimate the month and the temperature, overall they were quite poor at judging the time of day. In particular, observers were not able to discriminate between morning and afternoon pictures even when they were allowed to compare multiple images captured on the same day (Experiment 3). However, observers could distinguish between midday and sunset and sunrise daylight. Classification analysis showed that, given a perfect knowledge of its variation, an ideal observer could have performed the task over chance only considering the average chromatic variation in the picture. Instead, our observers reported using shadows to detect the position of the sun in order to estimate the time of day. However, this information is highly unreliable without knowledge of the orientation of the scene. In Experiment 4 we used an LED chamber in order to present our observers with lights whose chromaticity and illuminance varied along the <b>daylight</b> <b>locus,</b> thus isolating the light cues from the sun position cue. We conclude that discriminating the slight variations in chromaticity and brightness, which potentially distinguish morning and afternoon illuminations, lies beyond the ability of human observers...|$|E
40|$|Colour {{discrimination}} {{has been}} widely studied in red-green (R-G) dichromats but {{the extent to which}} their colour constancy is affected remains unclear. This work estimated the extent of colour constancy for four normal trichromatic observers and seven R-G dichromats when viewing natural scenes under simulated daylight illuminants. Hyperspectral imaging data from natural scenes were used to generate the stimuli on a calibrated CRT display. In experiment 1, observers viewed a reference scene illuminated by daylight with a correlated colour temperature (CCT) of 6700 K; observers then viewed sequentially two versions of the same scene, one illuminated by either a higher or lower CCT (condition 1, pure CCT change with constant luminance) or a higher or lower average luminance (condition 2, pure luminance change with a constant CCT). The observers' task was to identify the version of the scene that looked different from the reference scene. Thresholds for detecting a pure CCT change or a pure luminance change were estimated, and it was found that those for R-G dichromats were marginally higher than for normal trichromats regarding CCT. In experiment 2, observers viewed sequentially a reference scene and a comparison scene with a CCT change or a luminance change above threshold for each observer. The observers' task was to identify whether or not the change was an intensity change. No {{significant differences were found between}} the responses of normal trichromats and dichromats. These data suggest robust colour constancy mechanisms along <b>daylight</b> <b>locus</b> in R-G dichromacy.

40|$|In this document, we {{describe}} three different research topics: characterization of red-green and blue-yellow opponent channels, autonomous print quality (PQ) defect diagnosis, {{and design of}} stochastic green-noise masks using dual-metric (DBS and a measure of compactness). ^ For the first work of research, we explore a method to characterize opponent channel in human visual system. Responses of opponent-channels have been modeled {{in the past as}} a linear transformation of cone absorption values L, M, S. We asked two related questions: (i) which of these transformations is psychologically most plausible; (ii) is a linear transformation the right model, in the first place. We tested positions of pure colors for seven subjects in a xy chromaticity diagram as well as in a Boynton-MacLeod chromaticity diagram in log-coordinates. The results showed that neither of the two opponent channels can be adequately approximated by a single straight line. The red-green channel can be approximated by two straight lines. The blue-yellow channel can be approximated by a quadratic function, whose middle section coincides closely with the <b>daylight</b> <b>locus.</b> These results represent a violation of the necessary condition for any linear model to be an adequate description of opponent channels. We further show that the properties of the red-green channel (blue-yellow equilibrium line) measured in our experiment correspond to the properties of parvocellular-pathway cells in the visual system. Our further analysis showed that there was a correlation between the red and the green directions. ^ The goal of the second project is to develop an image analysis tool to automatically identify LJ 9500 PQ defects from scans of the printed PQ test pages. We perform the detection algorithm which correctly identify each type of defect {{in the presence of a}} wide range of variation in the actual appearance of each type of defect. ^ In the third project, we propose a new approach to digital halftoning that generates stochastic dispersed-dot patterns in highlight/shadow textures and aperiodic clustered-dot patterns in midtone textures using dual-metric. ...|$|E
40|$|Humans are trichromatic, and {{yet their}} {{perception}} of colours is rich and complex. The research presented in this thesis explores the process of colour appearance of uniform patches and natural polychromatic stimuli. This is done through the measurement {{and analysis of the}} achromatic locus (Chapter 2), modelling of chromatic adaptation in a large dataset of unique hues settings (Chapter 3), and measurement of thresholds for uniform and polychromatic stimuli derived from simulated skin images (Chapter 4). Chapter 2 proposes a novel navigation scheme based on unique hues for traversing colour space. The results show that when colour adjustments are made using this novel scheme, the variability of achromatic settings made by observers is reduced compared to the classical method of making colour adjustments along the cardinal axes of the CIELUV colour space. This result holds across the tested luminance levels (5, 20, 50 cd/m^ 2) {{in each of the three}} tested ambient illumination conditions – dark, simulated daylight and cool white fluorescent lighting. The analysis also shows that the direction of maximum variance of the achromatic settings lies along the <b>daylight</b> <b>locus.</b> Chapter 3 evaluates models of chromatic adaptation by using unique hues settings measured under different ambient illumination conditions. It is shown that a simple diagonal model in cone excitation space is the most efficient in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and degrees of freedom. It is also found that diagonal and linear models show similar performances, reiterating their theoretical equivalence. Performances of these diagonalisable models are found to be worse for UR and UG unique hue planes compared to UY and UB planes. Chapter 4 presents a set of three experiments reporting estimations of perceptual thresholds for polychromatic and uniform stimuli in a 3 -D chromaticity-luminance colour space. The first experiment reports thresholds for simulated skin images and uniform stimuli of the corresponding mean CIELAB colour. The second and third experiments investigate the effect of ambient illumination and the location of the stimuli in colour space. The thresholds for the polychromatic stimuli are found to be consistently higher than those for the uniform patches, for both the chromatic, and the luminance projections. The area of the chromaticity ellipses shows a gradual increase with distance from the illuminant chromaticity. The orientations of these ellipses for simulated skin are found to align with the vector joining the mean patch chromaticity and the illuminant chromaticity...|$|E
