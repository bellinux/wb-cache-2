Wider gaze took in a wonderful park, not only surrounded by lofty crags, but full of crags of lesser height, many lifting their heads from dark-green groves of trees. The morning sun, not yet above the eastern elevations, sent its rosy and golden shafts in between the towering rocks, to tip the pines.|$|E

2500|$|If the <b>flow</b> <b>turns</b> {{enough so}} that it becomes {{parallel}} to the wall, {{we do not need}} to worry about pressure boundary condition. However, as the <b>flow</b> <b>turns,</b> its static pressure decreases (as described earlier). If there is not enough pressure to start with, the flow won't be able to complete the turn and will not be parallel to the wall. This shows up as the maximum angle through which a <b>flow</b> can <b>turn.</b> The lower the Mach number is to start with (i.e. small [...] ), the greater the maximum angle through which the <b>flow</b> can <b>turn.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Explanations {{that use}} the term [...] "Coandă effect" [...] {{sometimes}} further assert that the viscosity of the flow in the boundary layer {{is responsible for the}} ability of the flow to follow the convex upper surface. However, the idea that viscosity plays a significant role in <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> is not consistent with the physics of curved boundary-layer flows. Analysis of the momentum balance in the flow in the boundary layer shows that the flow curvature is caused almost exclusively by the pressure gradient and that viscosity plays practically no direct role in the ability of the flow to follow a curved surface.|$|E
50|$|Introducing in the {{calculation}} the angle at separation {{found in the}} preceding experiments for each value of the relative curvature h/r, the image here was recently obtained, and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution: the calculated pressure field {{is similar to the}} experimental one described above, outside the nozzle. The flow curvature is caused exclusively by the transverse pressure gradient, as described by T. Young. Then, viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall. According to Van Dyke, quoted in Lift (force) Wikipedia article, §10.3, the derivation of his equation (4c) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> is negligible.|$|E

40|$|Aerojet is {{currently}} executing two Strutjet propulsion contracts: one a Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine for a NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Reusable Transportation Technology (ARTT) program, the second a Dual Mode Ram/Scramjet engine for a USAF Wright Laboratories Storable Fuel Scramjet Flow Path Concepts program. The engines employed in both programs operate at supersonic and low hypersonic speeds and use inlets employing forebody external and sidewall compression. Aerojet has developed and validated a successful design methodology applicable to these inlet types. Design features include an integrated vehicle forebody, external side compression struts, strut sidewall and throat bleed, a throat shock trap, and variable geometry internal contraction. Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) predictions and test data show these inlets allow substantially increased <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> angles over other designs. These increased <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> angles allow shorter and lighter engines than current designs, {{which in turn}} enables higher performing vehicles with broad operating characteristics. This paper describes the designs of two different inlets evaluated by the NASA-MSFC and USAF programs, discusses the results of wind tunnel tests performed by NASA-Lewis Research Center, and provides correlations of test data with CFD predictions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a viscous adjoint method in the optimization of a low-aspect-ratio turbine blade through spanwise restaggering and endwall contouring. A gen-eralized wall-function method is implemented in a Navier-Stokes flow solver coupled with Menter’s SST k-ω turbulence model to simulate secondary flow with reduced requirements on grid den-sity. Entropy production through the blade row combined with a <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> constraint is used as the objective function in the optimization. With the viscous adjoint method, the complete gra-dient information needed for optimization can be obtained by solving the governing flow equations and their corresponding adjoint equations only once, regardless of the number of design parameters. The endwall profiles are contoured alone in the first design case, while it is combined with spanwise restaggering in the second design case. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to reduce flow loss through the blade redesign while maintaining the same mass-averaged <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> by using the viscous ad-joint optimization method. The performance of the redesigned blade is calculated and compared at off-design conditions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates over tip leakage {{where the}} tip {{clearance}} is large. In the high pressure stages of axial compressors the tip clearance can be typically 6 % of span {{and the total}} blockage due to tip clearance can consume in excess of {{forty percent of the}} annulus height. Experimental and computational investigations of large tip clearance in a linear cascade have been used to investigate this phenomenon. Two cascade builds have been used the first (Build A) consisted of a controlled diffusion aerofoil of low stagger and thirty degrees <b>flow</b> <b>turning.</b> The second cascade (Build B) consisted of an engine representative design with high stagger and around ten degrees of <b>flow</b> <b>turning.</b> The diffusion factor of both cascades was around 0. 3. The major findings are that: Large tip clearances have a smaller detrimental influence on single row performance than the previous research would have suggested, for Build B the loss at 10 % tip clearance was the same as the 0 % tip clearance loss, though the overall <b>flow</b> <b>turning</b> was much reduced. An increase in blade loading towards the tip was observed with both builds. Both these phenomenon were attributed to the small amount of movement of the over tip leakage vortex. An engine representative level of inlet skew was implemented using upstream injection so to assess its influence. This was found to have a remarkably small influence on the performance of a single row with the tip clearance and geometry of the blading having a much greater influence. Finally a circumferential grooved casing treatment was applied in the linear cascade but this was found not to be an appropriate tool for such an investigation.
