The album {{failed to achieve}} positive critical or commercial success, proving to be Roth's first solo <b>effort</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> achieve RIAA Gold or Platinum status shortly after its release. The support tour found Roth playing smaller venues in the U.S., and larger venues in Europe. Your Filthy Little Mouth saw a remastered re-release in 2007.|$|E

He even arrives at the royal court where his return should be welcomed, {{disguised}} as a fool; a court where there is a growing romantic attachment between himself and the queen, although she does not recognise him.

25|$|Although it avoided {{much of the}} {{physical}} destruction that ravaged other cities in the region, the American Civil War was still a cause of resentment and division among residents of Germantown. Many Germantown residents were against slavery and had sons fighting for the Union Army. In contrast, other residents of Germantown, owned slaves, and even those who weren't slave-owners had sons fighting for the Confederate Army. As a result, many people in Germantown, who were once on friendly terms with each other, made an <b>effort</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> interact with each other, such as switching churches, or frequenting a store or mill {{miles away from the}} ones they would normally do business with.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{was born}} {{about five years}} after her brother, around the time that her father began to isolate {{himself and his family}} from others. At birth she was in the 50th {{percentile}} for weight. The following day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a blood transfusion, but had no sequelae and was otherwise described as healthy. A medical appointment at three months showed that she was gaining weight normally, but found a congenital hip dislocation which required her to wear a highly restrictive Frejka splint from the age of 4½ to 11 months. The splint caused Genie to be late to walk, and researchers believed this led her father to start speculating that she was mentally retarded. As a result, he made a concerted <b>effort</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk to or pay attention to her, and strongly discouraged his wife and son from doing so.|$|E

[...] Since such sites abandon the [...] "desperation" [...] title which implies an <b>effort</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> wet, {{they are more likely to}} include nudity, overtly sexual models and situations, as well as purposeful (as opposed to accidental) wetting. There are still communities which focus on the more tame or softcore aspects of omorashi, which are generally focused on simple wetting in fully or semi-clothed situations without the overtly sexual models and situations.
