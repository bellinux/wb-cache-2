50|$|An {{internal}} vertical insulated chimney, {{the combustion}} chamber, ensures an efficient high-temperature burn and creates enough draft to push exhaust gases {{through the rest}} of the system. Flue gases are cooled to a relatively low temperature within the thermal store, approximately 50 °C (122 °F), and steam within these gases condenses into liquid releasing the associated latent heat of condensation, which further increases the efficiency in the manner of a condensing (<b>gas)</b> <b>boiler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Condensing boiler {{manufacturers}} {{claim that}} up to 98% thermal efficiency can be achieved, compared to 70%-80% with conventional designs (based on the higher heating value of fuels). Typical models offer efficiencies around 90%, which brings most brands of condensing <b>gas</b> <b>boiler</b> in to the highest available categories for energy efficiency. In the UK, this is a SEDBUK (Seasonal Efficiency of Domestic Boilers in the UK) Band A efficiency rating, while in North America they typically receive an Eco Logo and/or Energy Star Certification.|$|E

50|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{include the}} Organic Rankine cycle, which operates at lower temperatures and pressures using low-grade heat sources. The primary advantage {{to this is}} that the equipment is essentially an air-conditioning or refrigeration unit operating as an engine, whereby the piping and other components need not be designed for extreme temperatures and pressures, reducing cost and complexity. Electrical efficiency suffers, but it is presumed that such a system would be utilizing waste heat or a heat source such as a wood stove or <b>gas</b> <b>boiler</b> that would exist anyway for purposes of space heating.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{appearance}} of marketing and implementation of marketing concept in practice, {{the importance of the}} marketing mix, through which organizations adapt their offer to targeted customer segments, was emphasized. Regardless {{of the fact that the}} product is commonly referred to as the basic (key) instrument of the marketing mix, in the last ten years, due to the rapid and strong development of science, technology, especially information technology, business and society in general, integrated marketing communications (IMK) are becoming increasingly important, without which organizations can not even begin, or end, any significant marketing activity.
