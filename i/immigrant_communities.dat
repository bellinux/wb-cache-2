5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages {{has given rise}} to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a whole}} have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken natively by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E
5|$|For centuries {{a fishing}} {{community}} of mostly Norman origin, where ethnic isolationism {{was a common}} practice, Póvoa de Varzim is today a cosmopolitan town, with people originating from the Ave Valley who settled in the coastal Northern districts during the 20th century, the ancient immigration from Galicia, Portuguese-Africans (who arrived in significant numbers after the independence of Angola and Mozambique) in the late 1970s and people of diverse nationalities, the biggest <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> are Ukrainians, Brazilians, Chinese, Russians, and Angolans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> first {{developed}} in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis.

Crews would be paid off {{at the end of}} their voyage. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of Lascars and Africans from the Guinea Coast. Large Chinatowns at both Shadwell and Limehouse developed, associated with the crews of merchantmen in the opium and tea trades. It was only after the devastation of the Second World War that this predominantly Han Chinese community relocated to Soho.|$|E

5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

The purpose of this qualitative {{study was to investigate}} conceptualizations of mental health in the Mexican <b>immigrant</b> <b>community</b> in the United States. Careful consideration was taken to ensure that the research design was developed to respect and consider the participants’ culture and surrounding community. Eight individuals from the Mexican <b>immigrant</b> <b>community</b> were interviewed about their beliefs regarding the causes of mental illness, explanations of mental illness, experiences with treatment providers, and ideas about appropriate treatment. The results were organized into five categories: Causal Factors, Phenomena, Strategies, Mediating Factors, and Consequences.
