Although there is not any outbreak report in pediatric wards, a distillate water tank was shown {{to be the source}} of C. indologenes that caused a blood stream infection (Bayraktar et al. 2007). The organism may spread because of limited education of the healthcare personnel and incomplete adherence to infection control measures. The physician should report this rare pathogen to infection control department. If necessary, <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> should be performed to identify the source. Healthcare personnel have to be careful and they should be educated about the implementation of infection control measures, especially hand hygiene compliance. We reported this case to our hospital infection control committee. <b>Environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> such as the respiratory circuit, humidifier, etc. were not performed. Contact isolation precautions were applied to the patient, and healthcare workers were educated and reinforced about infection control measures. Outbreak did not occur.|$|R

During a 3 -month period, two patients at our center were infused with LAK cells subsequently {{found to have}} been contaminated by Aspergillus fumigatus. Each case was investigated by obtaining <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> and assessing aseptic practices during LAK cell preparation. Investigation of the first case demonstrated a malfunction of the laminar air flow hood, under which interleukin- 2 and the patient's lymphocytes had been added to cell culture medium, and showed heavy A. fumigatus contamination of the hood, adjacent countertop, and cell culture incubator. Despite repair of the laminar air flow hood and cleaning of the laboratory, a second case occurred, and cultures at that time implicated the humidified cell culture incubators {{as the source of}} A. fumigatus. Following incubator sterilization and removal of the humidffication apparatus from the incubators, weekly <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> in the LAK cell laboratory were negative, and none of the LAK cell cultures from the 20 patients treated during the ensuing 15 months grew A. fumigatus.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the epidemiology of a protracted nosocomial clonal outbreak due to multidrug-resistant IMP- 8 producing Klebsiella oxytoca (MDRKO) that was finally eradicated by removing an environmental reservoir. The outbreak {{occurred in the}} ICU of a Spanish hospital from March 2009 to November 2011 and evolved over four waves. Forty-two patients were affected. First basic (active surveillance, contact precautions and reinforcement of surface cleaning) and later additional control measures (nurse cohorting and establishment of a minimum patient/nurse ratio) were implemented. Screening of ICU staff was repeatedly negative. Initial <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures,</b> including dry surfaces, were also negative. The above measures temporarily controlled cross-transmission but failed to eradicate the epidemic MDRKO strain that reappeared {{two weeks after the}} last colonized patients in waves 2 and 3 had been discharged. Therefore, an occult environmental reservoir was suspected. Samples from the drainpipes and traps of a sink were positive; removal of the sink reduced the rate number but did not stop new cases that clustered in a cubicle whose horizontal drainage system was connected with the eliminated sink. The elimination of the horizontal drainage system finally eradicated the outbreak. In conclusion, damp environmental reservoirs (mainly sink drains, traps and the horizontal drainage system) could explain why standard cross-transmission control measures failed to control the outbreak; such reservoirs should be considered even when <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> of surfaces are negative...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{overlapping}} generations model with environmental quality and endogenous <b>environmental</b> <b>culture.</b> Based upon empirical evidence, preferences over culturally-weighted consumption and envi- ronmental quality {{are assumed to}} follow a Leontie function. We fi nd that four diff erent regimes may be possible, with interior or corner solutions in investments in <b>environmental</b> <b>culture</b> and maintenance. Depending on the parameter conditions, there exists one of two possible, asymptotically stable steady states, one with and one without investments in <b>environmental</b> <b>culture.</b> For low wealth levels, society is unable to free resources for <b>environmental</b> <b>culture.</b> In this case, society will only invest in environmental maintenance if environmental quality is suffi ciently low. Once society has reached {{a certain level of}} economic development, then it may optimally invest a part of its wealth in developing an <b>environmental</b> <b>culture.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>culture</b> has not only a positive impact on environmental quality through lower levels of consumption, but it improves the environment through maintenance expenditure for wealth-environment combinations at which, in a restricted model without <b>environmental</b> <b>culture,</b> no maintenance would be undertaken. <b>Environmental</b> <b>culture</b> leads to a society with a higher indirect utility at steady state in comparison to the restricted model. Our model leads us to the conclusion that, by raising the importance of environmental quality for utility, <b>environmental</b> <b>culture</b> leads to lower steady state levels of consumption and wealth, but higher environmental quality. Thus, for societies trapped in a situation with low environmental quality, investments in culture may induce positive feedback loops, where more culture raises environmental quality which in turn raises <b>environmental</b> <b>culture.</b> We also discuss how en- vironmental culture may lead to an Environmental Kuznets Curve...|$|E

METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and the Danish Neobase database. All MRSA isolates obtained from neonates, relatives and NICU health care workers (HCW) as well as <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> were typed. RESULTS: During the 46 day outbreak period, 102 neonates were admitted to the two neonatal wards. Ninety-nine neonates were subsequently sampled, and 32 neonates (32 %) from 25 families were colonized with MRSA (spa-type t 127, SCCmec V, PVL negative). Thirteen family members from 11 of those families (44 %) and two of 161 HCWs (1 %) were colonized with the same MRSA. No one was infected. Five <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> were MRSA positive. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) treatment (p =  0. 006) and Caesarean section (p =  0. 016) were independent risk factors for MRSA acquisition, whereas days of exposure to MRSA was a risk factors in the unadjusted analysis (p =  0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: MRSA transmission occurs with high frequency in the NICU during hospitalization with unidentified MRSA neonates. Caesarean section and nCPAP treatment were identified as risk factors for MRSA colonization. The MRSA outbreak was controlled through infection control procedures...|$|R

Methods: From 1994 to 1996, the potable water systems of 20 hospitals in Catalonia were tested for Legionella, Cases of hospital-acquired LD and availability of an “in-house” Legionella test in the previous 4 years were assessed. After the hospitals were informed {{of the results of}} their water cultures, a prospective 5 -year-study was conducted focusing on the detection of new cases of nosocomial legionellosis and the availability and use of Legionella testing. Results: Before <b>environmental</b> <b>cultures</b> were started, only one hospital had conducted active surveillance of hospital-acquired pneumonia and used Legionella tests including Legionella urinary antigen in all pneumonia cases. Only one other hospital had used the latter test at all. In six hospitals, Legionella tests had been completely unavailable.

During prospective surveillance, 12 hospitals (60 %) used Legionella urinary antigen testing in house and 11 (55 %) found cases of nosocomial legionellosis, representing 64. 7 % (11 of 17) of those with positive water cultures. Hospitals with negative water cultures did not find nosocomial LD. Conclusions: The environmental study increased the index of suspicion for nosocomial LD.
