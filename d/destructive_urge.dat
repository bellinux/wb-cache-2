50|$|Gérard Rabinovitch has {{developed}} {{the concept of}} “destructiveness” elaborating upon earlier work in phenomenological (Georg Simmel) and weberian sociology centered {{on the role of}} emotions in society. He develops the concept of the ‘death drive’ in its hetero-destructive form (<b>destructive</b> <b>urge)</b> that has been theorized in the field of psychoanalysis and which echoes Kant’s notion of Radical Evil. The notion of “destructiveness” is a powerful concept for understanding Nazism, that enduring enigma of Western culture. In his book, De la destructivité humaine, fragments sur le Béhémoth (On Human Destructiveness: figures of the Behemoth) Gérard Rabinovitch reconsiders and criticizes the limited viewpoint of political, sociological and philosophical thinkers who have understood Nazism through the Hobbesian metaphor of the Leviathan. In the footsteps of Franz Leopold Neumann, he proposes instead, that we take up the idea of the Behemoth, the opposite of the Leviathan, to study this phenomenon. The Behemoth is a model of disorganization, chaos and criminal pleasure. Gérard Rabinovitch analyses the Nazi chimera, with its heroicisation of violence, its promotion of aggression, and the liquidation of all ethical norms. This Nazi chimera is made-up of gangster activity, of pagan inspired peasant actions, of medical biologicalism, and of instrumental rationalism.|$|E
50|$|Kramer and his screenwriter Mac Benoff {{decided to}} {{compromise}} Swarthout’s time sequence {{by having the}} entire film set in the present with flashbacks into the past of all the boys, to explicate their presence at the camp. Whereas Swarthout’s novel - thematically powerful though it is- is episodic and difficult for some six-graders to follow, the Kramer film flows almost faultlessly to its tragic conclusion. The plight of the American buffalo and any other endangered species {{is at the center}} of the film’s focus. Almost predictably, the dysfunctional group, under Cotton’s guidance, set out to free a large herd of the bison, after they witness their perverted macho camp counselor “Wheaties” shooting the animals in a festive (and deeply disturbing) western lottery, which is given validation as a proper method to thin out the large numbers by eliminating the ‘weak’ or ‘sick’ buffalo. Of course, the buffalo are not the only targets of this <b>destructive</b> <b>urge,</b> as the Bedwetters-similarly-have been have also been “tamed,” “penned” and crushed in spirit. As a result of their parents’ neglect, they have been turned into psychological misfits. Ridiculed and rejected by the other boys in the camp, they are forced to cling even more strongly to their deviant behavior. The boys’ pilgrimage to free the buffalo is also a search for freedom.|$|E

Dude is an Everyman who loses his innocence and fights to regain it.|$|R
40|$|We {{are just}} {{beginning}} to understand the brain of the psychopath. His mind is another matter. Recent neuroimaging research has begun to functionally map the abnormalities of the psychopath’s brain (Kiehl et al., 2001, 2003), and such findings help us to bio-logically ground the clinical and forensic extremes of his behavior. But a theory of the psychopath’s mind is also important (Meloy, 1988). It guides empirical research. It puts flesh on the bone of empirical findings. It specifies the motivation and meaning of the psy-chopath’s behavior. And most importantly, it helps us understand his discrete experience of the world, and thus shapes our realistic perception of the risks he poses to himself and others. Freud understood the psychopath, but devoted little time and thought to investigating his mind. He wrote in 1928, ‘two traits are essential in a criminal: boundless egoism and a strong <b>destructive</b> <b>urge.</b> Common to both of these, and a necessary condition for their expression, is absence of love, lack of an emotional appreciation of (human) objects ’ (p. 178). We define the psychopath’s personality nearly 80 years later in essentially the same twofold manner: his pathological narcissism and his cruel aggression. There is also a general recognitio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{shows how}} Bowles's style and themes have {{developed}} {{from a number}} of sources, including Dada and Surrealism and Edgar Allan Poe, but moved beyond them to a writing which is unique and radical. The thesis traces the progress of Bowles's work from his examination of representative Western characters undergoing immensely testing journeys into their deepest selves, to his fascination with altered states of perception and Moroccan culture. It argues that Bowles has recognised a double division within humanity; from the natural world itself, and from a true and authentic relationship to our unconscious. As a result of this double division, the self and society which Bowles examines are distorted and corrupted. The thesis explores how Bowles has consistently worked to undermine the system of values and perceptions which permit such divisions to exist. In order to do this, he attacks the self, as the centre of our own importance within the world, and society, because it conditions us into an acceptance of values and ways of seeing life. Much of his fiction aims to disintegrate and destroy these two key areas in order that he might expose their failings and suggest alternative ways of existing. In particular, Bowles has grown more interested in preserving elements of Moroccan culture as remnants of a more open, less rational way of life. This thesis, therefore, examines the final balance between a <b>destructive</b> <b>urge</b> and a desparate need to preserve and learn from what remains when the distorted and corrupt has been stripped away...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{application}} of Freud’s psychoanalysis theory to Abagnale’s Catch Me If You Can. It is aimed at analyzing the psychological problem of Frank related to his criminal conducts {{for the sake of}} pleasure. This research is a qualitative research and a content analysis method is used to analyze the data. The object of this study is Abagnale’s novel entitled Catch Me If You Can. The data of this study are expressions in words, phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs taken from the novel. The writer collected the data by reading the data comprehensively and taking simple notes of the important words, phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs related to the topic. The data analysis was observed by using Freud’s psychoanalysis theory, focused on the system of personality, especially in the domination of the id. In order to obtain the trustworthiness of the data, the researcher used peer- debriefing method. The findings of the study show that Frank’s imbalanced system of personality is caused by the domination of his id. The divorce of his parents, which is filled with conflicts, stimulates Frank’s id to seek for pleasure through delinquency and crimes, such as engaging in sexual activity with women when Frank is still underage, doing forgeries and conning people for his own advantage. Frank’s id imposes its demands for pleasure of love to his ego and causes his ego to neglect the superego’s command to search what is demanded by the id in a lawful way. As a result, the domination of the id causes Frank to become a criminal in four continents. There is no guilty feeling at all during committing crimes because Frank’s id has fully dominated his system of personality. The term that is widely known for someone who has id- dominated personality is called as psychopath. Frank manifests several malicious characteristics which are boundless egoism, strong <b>destructive</b> <b>urge,</b> impulse control problems and increased pleasureseeking drives...|$|E

It examines the eclipsing of contemporary models of cultural attachment and social feeling, sentiment development and equilibrium of character {{as the basis of}} the effective management of social relations, as Freudian models that proposed <b>destructive</b> <b>urges</b> and aggression as the basis of character appeared more relevant to the dynamics of escalating national conflict...|$|R
50|$|With {{his girlfriend}} now murdered (in {{the same manner}} as Warren), the grief-stricken Mateo suffers a breakdown. He admits to {{threatening}} both Warren and Laura before their deaths. Mateo feels this force is connected with himself, carrying out his subconscious <b>destructive</b> <b>urges.</b> To bring it out into the open, he asks to recreate his experiment. Koenig agrees and the senior staff assembles in Hydroponics. With the mental power of eight participants, Mateo conjures up a chilling apparition—a being who is the image of himself, its right side grotesquely mutilated.|$|R

Heathcliff shows symptoms of abandonment neurosis transforming natural life energies into <b>destructive</b> <b>urges</b> against his external world when Catherine marries for social status. Her death drive is re-directed inwards when she no longer can {{have a relationship with}} Heathcliff and they both perish in a life denying psychotic state.

Initially, Girgus played bass, however he {{switched}} to the drums when the group faced difficulty finding a drummer. The band issued their debut 7-inch single titled Two Songs in early 1994 through Punk In My Vitamins?, an independent label operated by Vern Rumsey, the bassist of Unwound. The duo followed this up with a second 7-inch single, Brass Tracks, which was issued in 1995 through X-Mas Records. That same year, the band was signed onto Amphetamine Reptile Records, who issued their debut full-length All <b>Destructive</b> <b>Urges...</b> Seem So Perfect on November 11, 1996. That same year, the band moved out to San Francisco, where they would stay until their disbandment in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Ortiz {{wrote this}} in his {{influential}} Destructivist Manifesto in 1962. It {{was only the beginning}} of a series of writings in which the artist would illuminate and develop his ideas about creating an art that was simultaneously avant-garde and politically, historically, and socially engaged. His warning against aggressive <b>destructive</b> <b>urges</b> is particularly relevant for our times, evoking war, genocide, exploitation and other consequences of human actions. Rather than evoking hopelessness and dread, however, the artist directs our attention to the link between the history of art, human development, ritual and inner relationships of the mind, body and spirit. Recalling historic practices of indigenous peoples, the artist offers his modern rituals as events through which to experience connections with the authentic self and others. Ortiz has achieved the highest professorial rank at Rutgers University, where he has been on the faculty since 1972. He has been teaching at Mason Gross School of the Arts since its inception.|$|R
50|$|Raised in {{a family}} which was {{interested}} in psychoanalytic theory, Kramer herself became a follower of Sigmund Freud. Kramer especially believed {{in the concept of}} sublimation. Freudian theory describes sublimation as a process in which primitive urges coming from the id are transformed into socially productive activities that lead to gratification of the original urge. Kramer's training was in art, art education and psychoanalytically informed psychotherapy. Kramer believed sublimation {{to be one of the}} most vital goals of art therapy. Through art, she believed, negative and <b>destructive</b> emotions and <b>urges</b> are transformed into useful products. Kramer asserted that the success of the therapy could be measured by the visual product.|$|R
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{found the}} mode {{and timing of}} the discovery suspicious and the convergence of data on it little short of miraculous. The puzzling features which require elucidation and explanation were gathered by one eminent Mexican scholar (Rafael Tena) under six headings as follows: provenance (his comments predated the release of new information in 2002, as to which see under Provenance above); materials analysis (where Tena <b>urged</b> <b>destructive</b> investigatory techniques despite the document's exiguous dimensions); art-historical criticism (including orthography); graphology (where Tena, despite Dibble's expert opinion, expressed the view that access to the original is indispensable for a conclusive attribution of Sahagún's signature); historiography (where Tena contends the codex must post-date 1573 when Valeriano was appointed juez gobernador of Tenochtitlan, and that Sahagún's signature on the codex is irreconcilable with his known opposition to the cult - as to which, see below); and finally linguistic analysis.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the interplay between}} destructiveness in art and destructiveness in the human psyche in Siri Hustvedt's The Blindfold (1993) and What I Loved (2003). In order to examine this relationship, the character's destructive tendencies are studied, focusing especially on those destructive and self-destructive behavioral patterns seemingly lacking exterior purpose. In explaining these tendencies in terms of internal motives and intersubjective processes, the explanatory models which are given most importance are psychoanalysis, evil, self-preservation through posing as someone else and Hustvedt's theory of relational identity formation, called "mixing". These concepts are then applied to destructiveness in the artist, the artwork, and {{the recipient of the}} artwork. Possible therapeutic effects are pointed to, as are the predominantly destructive effects that come from producing and consuming art relating to destructiveness. The artworks themselves vicariously have destructive effects on their surroundings, and some are capable of subverting distinctions between art and reality, at least for Leo and Iris. The diverse, yet sometimes overlapping, explanatory models make up a complex and ambiguous web of interconnections between destructiveness in art and the psyche, which collectively render clear-cut conclusions about destructiveness as misleading. Still, <b>destructive</b> thoughts and <b>urges</b> tend to grow in strength when they are repressed, while acceptance of one's appreciation of destructiveness, and the dangers it poses, seem to decrease the level of shame and to increase the chances of becoming a fuller, happier self. In this sense, the outcome of catharsis-invoking destructive art relies heavily on strength and awareness to detect and accept hidden, ugly sides of one s psyche. Overall, neither Leo nor Iris succeeds at this. Both, however, receive occasional therapeutic effects from destructive-related art throughout the novels, and Leo more so than Iris...|$|R
