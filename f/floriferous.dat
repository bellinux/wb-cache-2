5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very <b>floriferous,</b> with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Professor Liberty Hyde Bailey defined, in detail, two 'garden species' (C. × generalis and C. × orchiodes) to {{categorise}} the <b>floriferous</b> cannas being grown at that time, namely the Crozy hybrids and the 'orchid-like' hybrids introduced by Carl Ludwig Sprenger in Italy and Luther Burbank in the USA, {{at about the}} same time (1894). The definition was based on the genotype, rather than the phenotype, of the two cultivar groups. Inevitably, over time those two <b>floriferous</b> groups were interbred, the distinctions became blurred and overlapped, and the Bailey species names became redundant. Pseudo-species names are now deprecated by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants which, instead, provides Cultivar Groups for categorising cultivars (see groups at List of Canna cultivars).|$|E
25|$|All species {{remaining}} are ephiphytic with pendent habit. Scuticaria hadwenii, {{due to its}} {{several more}} or less isolated groups of populations along Serra do Mar, mostly {{on the west side}} of this chain of mountains, spreading throughout the interior highland in some states of Brazil, is the Scuticaria species that presents most variable colors. It can be separated from S. strictifolia because shows leaves always pending, flowers of more vivid colors and by the interior of the labellum, which ordinarily is more pubescent. There is a variety denominated dogsonii, native from Guyana, which is more <b>floriferous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unique in {{sense of}} not fitting {{into any of}} the above categories. The {{parentage}} of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P.fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique’, also known as or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, {{as a result of this}} cross, are much more <b>floriferous.</b>|$|E
500|$|Golden wattle is {{cultivated}} in Australia and {{was introduced to}} the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it {{has been used as a}} windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is <b>floriferous,</b> with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.|$|E
2500|$|These {{are large}} bush-type <b>floriferous</b> {{evergreen}} pelargoniums. In addition to [...] "Regals" [...] {{they are also}} known as “Show Pelargoniums”. In the United States they are often known as the [...] "Martha Washington" [...] or ‘"Lady Washington" [...] pelargoniums. They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently {{are the result of}} hybridization over the last 50 years. They are very short-jointed and compact, which results in their requiring very little work {{in order to create a}} floriforous and well-rounded plant. Flowers are single, rarely double, in mauve, pink, purple or white. They have rounded, sometimes lobed or partially toothed (serrated) leaves, unlike the Zonal groups, without any type of zoning.|$|E

60|$|He {{was to come}} in to tea, and Mrs. Larkins, exuberantly genial in a <b>floriferous</b> but dingy flannel {{dressing}} gown, {{appeared to}} confirm that. He brought in his bicycle {{and put it in the}} narrow, empty passage, and everyone crowded into a small untidy kitchen, whose table had been hastily cleared of the débris of the midday repast.|$|E
6000|$|In the car, {{sprawling}} upon {{a sort of}} bed-bench, in {{an attitude}} of elaborate self-abandonment, was a large, blond lady, wearing a fur coat and a big <b>floriferous</b> hat. Her head lolled back against the padded corner of the car, {{and her eyes were}} shut and her mouth open. [...] "Me dear!" [...] said Mr. Butteridge, in a common, loud voice, [...] "we're safe!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There were a {{great number}} of texts that set Marjorie's mind {{stirring}} dimly with intimations of a missed significance. Over her own bed, within the lattice of an Oxford frame, was the photograph of a picture of an extremely composed young woman in a trailing robe, clinging to the Rock of Ages in the midst of histrionically aggressive waves, and she had a feeling, rather than a thought, that perhaps for all the oddity of the presentation it did convey something acutely desirable, that she herself had had moods when she would have found something very comforting in just such an impassioned grip. And on a framed, <b>floriferous</b> card, these incomprehensible words: ...|$|E
60|$|There {{he stands}} in my memory, the symbol of this age for me, the man of luck and advertisement, the current master of the world. There he stands upon the great outward sweep of the terrace before the huge main entrance, a little figure, ridiculously disproportionate to that forty-foot arch, with the granite ball behind him--the astronomical ball, brass coopered, that {{represented}} the world, with a little adjustable tube of lenses on a gun-metal arm that focussed the sun upon just that point of the earth on which it chanced to be shining vertically. There he stands, Napoleonically grouped with his retinue men in tweeds and golfing-suits, a little solicitor, whose name I forget, in grey trousers and a black jacket, and Westminster in Jaeger underclothing, a <b>floriferous</b> tie, and peculiar brown cloth of his own.|$|E
6000|$|They {{came out}} of the house again by the {{prospective}} back door, and picked their way through builder's litter across the yard space to the road again. They drew nearer the junction to where a pavement and shops already open and active formed the commercial centre of Easewood. On the opposite side of the way the side door of a flourishing little establishment opened, and a man and his wife and a little boy in a sailor suit came into the street. The wife was a pretty woman in brown with a <b>floriferous</b> straw hat, and the group was altogether very Sundayfied and shiny and spick and span. The shop itself had a large plate-glass window whose contents were now veiled by a buff blind on which was inscribed in scrolly letters: [...] "Rymer, Pork Butcher and Provision Merchant," [...] and then with voluptuous elaboration: [...] "The World-Famed Easewood Sausage." ...|$|E
6000|$|Below him, {{far below}} him, shining blue, were {{the waters of}} the English Channel. Far off, a little thing in the sunshine, and rushing down as if some one was bending it hollow, was the beach and the {{irregular}} cluster of houses that constitutes Dymchurch. He could see the little crowd of people he had so abruptly left. Grubb, in the white wrapper of a Desert Dervish, was running {{along the edge of the}} sea. Mr. Butteridge was knee-deep in the water, bawling immensely. The lady was sitting up with her <b>floriferous</b> hat in her lap, shockingly neglected. The beach, east and west, was dotted with little people--they seemed all heads and feet--looking up. And the balloon, released from the twenty-five stone or so of Mr. Butteridge and his lady, was rushing up into the sky at the pace of a racing motor-car. [...] "My crikey!" [...] said Bert; [...] "here's a go!" ...|$|E
6000|$|They were ushered {{through a}} hall that resembled {{most of the}} halls in the world, it was {{dominated}} by a handsome oak staircase and scarcely gave Miss Sharsper a point, and then across a creation of the Victorian architect, a massive kind of conservatory with classical touches--there was an impluvium in the centre and there were arches hung with manifestly costly Syrian rugs, into a large apartment looking through four French windows upon a verandah and a large <b>floriferous</b> garden. At a sideways glance it seemed a very pleasant garden indeed. The room itself was like the rooms of so many prosperous people nowadays; it had an effect of being sedulously and yet irrelevantly over-furnished. It had none of the large vulgarity that Mr. Brumley would have considered proper to a wealthy caterer, but it confessed a compilation of [...] "pieces" [...] very carefully authenticated. Some of them were rather splendid [...] "pieces"; three big bureaus burly and brassy dominated it; there was a Queen Anne cabinet, some exquisite coloured engravings, an ormolu mirror {{and a couple of}} large French vases that set Miss Sharsper, who had a keen eye for this traffic, confusedly cataloguing. And a little incongruously {{in the midst of this}} exhibit, stood Lady Harman, as if she was trying to conceal the fact that she too was a visitor, in a creamy white dress and dark and defensive and yet entirely unabashed.|$|E
6000|$|My memory, as I {{write these}} things of Marxism, carries {{me to the}} dusky {{largeness}} of a great meeting in Queen's Hall, and I see again the back of Mr. Hyndman's head moving quickly, as he receives and answers questions. It was {{really one of the}} strangest and most interesting meetings I have ever attended. It was a great rally of the Social Democratic Federation, and the place--floor, galleries and platform--was thick but by no means overcrowded with dingy, earnest people. There was a great display of red badges and red ties, and many white faces, and I was struck by the presence of girls and women with babies. It was more like the Socialist meetings of the popular novel than any I had ever seen before. In the chair that night was Lady Warwick, that remarkable intruder into the class conflict, a blond lady, rather expensively dressed, so far as I could judge, about whom the atmosphere of class consciousness seemed to thicken. Her fair hair, her <b>floriferous</b> hat, told out against the dim multitudinous values of the gathering unquenchably; there were moments when one might have fancied it was simply a gathering of village tradespeople about the lady patroness, {{and at the end of}} the proceedings, after the red flag had been waved, after the [...] "Red Flag" [...] had been sung by a choir and damply echoed by the audience, some one moved a vote of thanks to the Countess in terms of familiar respect that completed the illusion.|$|E

[...] Phyllanthus is distributed in all tropical and subtropical regions on Earth.|$|E
50|$|They are {{generally}} small shrubs, climbers or trailing plants, with small to vestigial leaves arranged alternately on the stem. The flowers {{resemble those of}} pea-flowers, and are borne in racemes. They {{are generally}} pink through shades of purple to blue in colour, although yellow-flowered species are known. Although the flowers are smaller {{than those of the}} related genus Polygala, the racemes can be showy, especially of <b>floriferous</b> species such as Comesperma ericinum.|$|E
50|$|Grevillea banksii, {{known by}} various common names {{including}} Red silky oak, Dwarf silky oak, Banks' grevillea, Byfield waratah and, in Hawaii, Kahili flower or Kahili tree is a plant {{of the large}} genus Grevillea in the diverse family Proteaceae. Native to Queensland, {{it has been a}} popular garden plant for many years though has been superseded somewhat horticulturally by smaller and more <b>floriferous</b> hybrids. A white-flowered form G. banksii fo. albiflora is known as white silky oak.|$|E
50|$|Younger wood is more <b>floriferous,</b> {{so even if}} frosts do {{not kill}} the {{previous}} year's growth, the shrub is usually hard-pruned in spring once frosts have finished, to encourage new growth. The removal of spent flower panicles may be undertaken to reduce the nuisance of self-seeding and encourage further flower production; this extends the flowering season which is otherwise limited to about 6 weeks, although the flowers of {{the second and third}} flushes are invariably smaller.|$|E
5000|$|Buddleja × weyeriana ''''Sungold'''' is a {{cultivar}} which arose as a {{sport of}} 'Golden Glow' at the nursery of P. G. Zwijnenburg in the Netherlands during the 1960s. [...] 'Sungold' was accorded the Royal Horticultural Society Award of Garden Merit (record 690) http://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Plant-trials-and-awards/pdf/2013-AGMs/AGMReviewCompleteOrnamentals in 1993, reaffirmed in 2010. A particularly <b>floriferous</b> specimen of 'Sungold' {{was introduced to}} the USA from Scotland by Mike Dirr in 1995, and propagated there as 'Honeycomb'; it later came top in the public poll of 57 Buddleja species and cultivars conducted by the University of Georgia in 1997. http://www.canr.org/97002.pdf ...|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} a woody shrub or {{subshrub}} with an erect habit reaching anywhere from 0.6 to 2 m high. The ovate to elliptic leaves {{are up to}} 12 cm long with entire or wavy (sinuate) margins, and sit on 1-2 cm long petioles. The petioles and leaf undersides are covered in white hair, the upper leaf surfaces less so. The flowers appear from June to November, with plants most <b>floriferous</b> in September. The disc is yellow and bracts are white, the flower heads 2.5 to 4.5 cm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Their flowers {{last for}} about ten days, however, as not all open {{at the same time}} it is common to have a plant {{blooming}} during a whole month. Pollination has not been observed and seems to be uncommon for few plants bearing fruits have been seen in nature, however, their floral morphology indicates the possibility of Euglossini bees pollinators. When Aspasia species are used to produce artificial hybrids, the characteristic that seems to predominate is the low number of resulting flowers by inflorescence, prevailing even over the so <b>floriferous</b> Oncidium.|$|E
