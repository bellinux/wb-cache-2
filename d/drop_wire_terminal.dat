40|$|Using {{quantum dot}} {{fluorescence}} imaging, we investigated the interference of surface plasmon beams in branched silver nanowire structures. Depending on the phases and polarizations {{of the incident}} light, interferences of plasmon beams modulate the plasmon propagation in the branched structures and the output light intensity in the distal ends. The interference visibility {{is strongly dependent on}} the incident polarization at the main <b>wire</b> <b>terminal,</b> and the mechanism is revealed by quantum dot fluorescence imaging of the near field distribution of propagating plasmons. The near field distribution pattern resulting from the beating of different plasmon modes plays a critical role in the plasmon interference. The overlap of the antinode in the near field pattern with the connection junction in the nanowire structure is required for a large interference visibility, since the overlap makes the electric field intensity difference of the two plasmon beams smaller. It is found that the plasmon interference is strongly dependent on the polarization of the excitation light at the main <b>wire</b> <b>terminal,</b> but weakly dependent on the polarization at the branch <b>wire</b> <b>terminal...</b>|$|R

25|$|Had an {{invasion}} taken place, the Bf 110 equipped Erprobungsgruppe 210 would have dropped Seilbomben {{just prior to}} the landings. This was a secret weapon which would have been used to blackout the electricity network in south-east England. The equipment for <b>dropping</b> the <b>wires</b> was fitted to the Bf 110 aeroplanes and tested. It involved <b>dropping</b> <b>wires</b> across high voltage wires, and was probably as dangerous to the aircraft crews as to the British.|$|R
50|$|In modern times, most {{telephones}} are {{plugged into}} telephone jacks. The jacks are connected by inside <b>wiring</b> to a <b>drop</b> <b>wire</b> which connects {{the building to}} a cable. Cables usually bring {{a large number of}} <b>drop</b> <b>wires</b> from all over a district access network to one wire center or telephone exchange. When a telephone user wants to make a telephone call, equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same wire center, or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|R

50|$|Improper installation, or poor workmanship, includes: not {{abrading}} {{the wires}} and applying a corrosion inhibitor; not wrapping <b>wires</b> around <b>terminal</b> screws; wrapping <b>wires</b> around <b>terminal</b> screws the wrong way; and inadequate torque on the connection screws. There {{can also be}} problems with connections made with too much torque on the connection screw as it causes damage to the wire, particularly with the softer aluminum wire.|$|R
50|$|Resistors above about 1 ohm {{in value}} can be {{measured}} {{using a variety of}} techniques, such as an ohmmeter or by using a Wheatstone Bridge. In such resistors, the resistance of the connecting <b>wires</b> or <b>terminals</b> is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the connecting <b>wires</b> or <b>terminals</b> becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} NIDs {{are essentially}} just a specialized set of <b>wiring</b> <b>terminals.</b> These will typically {{take the form}} of a small, weather-proof box, mounted on the outside of the building. The telephone line from the telephone company will enter the NID and be connected to one side. The customer connects their wiring to the other side. A single NID enclosure may contain termination for a single line or multiple lines.|$|R

50|$|For indoor or campus (cordless phone equivalent) use, the IEEE P1905 {{protocol}} establishes QoS {{guarantees for}} home area networks: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G, 4G and wired backbones using AC powerline networking/HomePlug/IEEE P1901, Ethernet and Power over Ethernet/IEEE 802.3af/IEEE 802.3at, MoCA and G.hn. In combination with IEEE 802.21, P1905 permits {{a call to}} be initiated on a wired phone and transferred to a wireless one and then resumed on a wired one, perhaps with additional capabilities such as videoconferencing in another room. In this case the use of mobile VoIP enables a continuous conversation that originates, and ends with, a <b>wired</b> <b>terminal</b> device.|$|R

5000|$|Aluminum wire, {{which has}} 61% of the {{conductivity}} of copper, {{has been used}} in building wiring for its lower cost. By weight, aluminum has higher conductivity than copper, but it has properties that cause problems when used for building wiring. It can form a resistive oxide within connections that makes <b>wiring</b> <b>terminals</b> heat. Aluminum can [...] "creep", slowly deforming under load, eventually causing device connections to loosen, and also has a different coefficient of thermal expansion compared to materials used for connections. This accelerates the loosening of connections. These effects can be minimized by using wiring devices approved for use with aluminum.|$|R

50|$|A {{timing light}} {{may be a}} {{self-contained}} instrument, but is sometimes combined with a voltmeter, RPM meter, and a dwell angle meter, or may be incorporated into a more comprehensive instrument such as an engine analyser. Self-contained units used to time automotive engines have an inductive pickup that clamps around the proper spark plug wire and serves as the trigger for the strobe. Power for the strobe comes directly from the vehicle's battery. Some older timing lights require {{the removal of the}} spark plug boot in order to attach a direct pickup between the <b>wire's</b> <b>terminal</b> and the centre conductor of the spark plug.|$|R
40|$|Development of {{a series}} of "spin-polarized donors", which afford ground state triplet cation diradicals upon one-electron oxidation, {{promoted}} us to produce a hyper-structured spin-polarized donor, because it can be regarded as a unimolecular quantum spin device if it is equipped with conducting <b>wires</b> and <b>terminals</b> to access to electrodes. A pyrrole-based spin-polarized donor carrying oligothiophene molecular wires has been prepared. The magnetic coupling along the oligothiophene wire turned out to be effective as far as the number of monomer units does not exceed six. The spin-polarized molecular wire, which consists of a spin-polarized donor core, molecular <b>wires,</b> and <b>terminals,</b> is expected to operate as a spin-rectifier, demonstrating spin-polarized Coulomb oscillations...|$|R

50|$|To {{avoid the}} need for rolling-up excess length, using an {{extension}} reel or for cutting the cord to size, extension cords are sold in prefabricated lengths of 1 to 150 feet (30 cm to 45 m). Every foot of cord increases the electrical resistance, in turn decreasing the power the cord can deliver. Therefore, the longer the cord, the larger {{the diameter of the}} conductors need be to minimise voltage <b>drop</b> (<b>wire</b> gauge numbers are smaller for larger diameter wire). Because of this, it is best to use a cord that's exactly as long as needed and no more.|$|R

Tibial fractures were stabilized with an Ilizarov frame; each segment of bone was fixed either by two rings or a single ring with a <b>drop</b> <b>wire</b> or half pin on either side. Each ring was fixed by at least two tensioned 1.8 -mm wires and a 6 -mm predrilled half pin. The femoral frames comprised two femoral arches proximally and two distal rings. Three or four 6 -mm half pins fixed each arch. Two tensioned wires and half pins were fixed to the rings.|$|R

50|$|From {{early studies}} of electricity, {{electrical}} phenomena {{were known to}} travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to communications at a distance. All the known effects of electricity - such as sparks, electrostatic attraction, chemical changes, electric shocks, and later electromagnetism - were applied {{to the problems of}} detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances. In 1753 an anonymous writer in the Scots Magazine suggested an electrostatic telegraph.
