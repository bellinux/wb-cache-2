5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of iconographic elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, {{which is a very}} popular theme.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Sheaffe and {{his staff}} decided to entrust the funeral {{arrangements}} to Captain John Glegg, who had served with Brock for many years. On 16 October, a funeral procession for Brock and Colonel Macdonell went from Government House to Fort George, with soldiers from the British Army, the colonial militia, and First Nations warriors {{on either side of}} the route. The caskets were lowered into a freshly dug grave at the northeast corner of Fort George. The British fired a twenty-one gun salute in three salvos, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> respect. Later that day, the American garrison at Fort Niagara respectfully fired a similar salute. Over five thousand people attended the funeral, a remarkable number given the limited population of Upper Canada at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{independence}} of the Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into Central Asia, thus enabling {{the completion of a}} multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline forms part of Turkey's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit from the Caspian Sea basin to Europe. However, in 1993, Turkey sealed its land border with Armenia <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> support to Azerbaijan (a Turkic state in the Caucasus region) during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and it remains closed.|$|E

It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|The party {{reached the}} capital of Liaodong on July 2, left four days later on July 6, and on July 12 Choe's party finally crossed the Yalu River and entered Joseon Korea. While the Grand Canal had its post stations, canal locks, ramps, moles, and paved towpaths, the land route from Beijing to the Yalu River was less {{elaborate}} but still featured the necessary distance markers and walled stations. Within a month of Choe's return to Korea, the Joseon court under King Seongjong (r. 1469–1494) sent an embassy to the Ming court of China <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> thanks for the Ming court's cordial treatment of Choe and his crew and providing safe travel for them.|$|E
5|$|Amid the {{euphoria}} generated by Egypt's military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards {{the end of}} October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> solidarity, only for the visit to end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously {{to enter into a}} union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.|$|E

25|$|The most {{remarkable}} feature is their decorative motifs roughly divided in six groups which complement each other: social simbols, religious simbols, images of posthumous kolo, figural images, clear ornaments, and unclassified motifs (mostly simbolic, geometrical, or damaged). Many of them remain enigmatic to this day; spirals, arcades, rosettes, vine leaves and grapes, lilium, stars (often six-pointed) and crescent Moons {{are among the}} images that appear. Figural images include processions of deer, horse, dancing the kolo, hunting, chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, {{the image of the}} man with his right hand raised, perhaps <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> fealty.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} {{improvisation}} {{of the film}} occurs when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000, money Cal earned by speculating in beans before the US became involved in World War I. Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> extreme emotion, lunged forward and grabbed him in a full embrace, crying. Kazan kept this and Massey's shocked reaction in the film. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in Rebel Without A Cause. Both characters are angst-ridden protagonists and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving approval from their fathers.|$|E

Left with no options, Walter buries {{the money in the}} To'hajilee desert and hires Jack again to murder Jesse. Walter attempts to confront Jesse in the desert, but instead Hank traps and arrests him. Welker's gang arrives and engages Hank in a fierce firefight. Jack executes Hank despite Walter's pleas. Jesse is captured and forced into slavery, producing meth for the gang. Before leaving, Jack and his gang take a majority of Walter's money, leaving him with $11 million <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> good will.|$|E
25|$|At Taormina {{they check}} into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's {{employer}} Ettore {{and his wife}} Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party Sandro checks out the women—recognizing the beautiful aspiring actress Gloria Perkins. Back in the room Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro having sex with Gloria Perkins on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits down on a bench and says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she places {{her hand on his}} head <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> compassion and comfort while looking out at the snow-covered image of Mount Etna on the horizon.|$|E

The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma's secret {{to the rest of}} the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu (Chen Qiang), a former Imperial executioner. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured.|$|E
25|$|Sparrow {{had been}} sighted {{so close to}} the French ships that it came under {{immediate}} fire, which tore up the rigging, killed a petty officer and wounded another sailor. Sparrow closed with Hebrus for support, Palmer firing long-distance broadsides at the French while signalling for support from the nearby 74-gun ship of the line HMS Hannibal under Captain Sir Michael Seymour. As the fog cleared, Hannibal could be clearly seen advancing under all sail from the northwest. As a shift in the wind to the northwest at 11:00 offered the French an opportunity of escape, the frigates separated, the damaged Sultane following the wind and Etoile turning to the southeast. Recognising that only Hebrus {{was in a position to}} catch Etoile, Seymour ordered Palmer to pursue while Hannibal and Sparrow advanced on Sultane. Du Petit-Thouars' ship was in no position to evade or resist the much larger British warship and was within range of Hannibal by 15:30, Seymour firing two warning shots over Sultane. Recognising his inevitable defeat, Du Petit-Thouars fired a broadside into the sea away from Hannibal and struck his flag <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> surrender at 16:15, Seymour taking possession of the French ship.|$|E
25|$|Hatra in contrast, had {{numerous}} stone statues representing deities or local rulers {{and their family}} members. The local upper class donated the statues of the temples to the city, where they were found by the excavations. Many of these works are precisely dated by inscriptions of the donor and provide a good chronological framework. There is also sometimes even the mention of a sculptor's name, such as Aba or Schabaz. In addition to works in the classical Greco-Hellenistic tradition (especially of classical deities) they show the people sitting or standing, facing front and dressed in Parthian fashion with rich regalia. The men wear shoes, pants and a tunic over it. Over the tunic some men wear a kind of jacket. Often you can see {{on the left side}} a dagger, a sword on his right hip. Kings wear a tiara with a diadem or tiara with the image of an eagle. The right hand is usually raised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> adoration to the top, the left hand holds a sword or a palm branch. Other statues carry in both hands a statue of God. There is striking attention to detail. The patterns of the substances, weapons and jewelry are reproduced exactly.|$|E
