25|$|Fourth {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestin drospirenone; and sometimes defined as those containing drospirenone, <b>dienogest,</b> or nomegestrol acetate.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{formulations}} of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem and Cliovelle), levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone (in Indivina), <b>dienogest</b> or drospirenone.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., norethisterone, <b>dienogest)</b> and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated with androgenic or antiandrogenic effects depending on the progestin in question.|$|E

2500|$|... 19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) progestins {{that are}} not {{derivatives}} of NET that have been marketed include the following: the C17α vinyl (ethenyl) derivatives norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-NT) and norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-NT); the allyl derivatives allylestrenol (3-deketo-17α-allyl-19-NT) and altrenogest (17α-allyl-δ9,11-19-NT); the C17α alkyl derivatives normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-NT) and norethandrolone (17α-ethyl-19-NT); the C17α cyanomethyl derivative <b>dienogest</b> (17α-cyanomethyl-δ9-19-NT); and the C16β ethyl derivative oxendolone (16β-ethyl-19-NT).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> is metabolized {{mainly by}} the {{cytochrome}} P450 enzyme CYP3A4, {{and for this}} reason, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can alter the amount of exposure to <b>dienogest</b> when administered concomitantly with it. (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see here.) The strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin {{have been found to}} increase exposure to <b>dienogest</b> by up to 3-fold, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (rifampin) was found to decrease steady-state and area-under-curve concentrations of <b>dienogest</b> by 50% and 80%, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Metabolites of <b>dienogest,</b> such as 9α,10β-dihydrodienogest and 3,5α-tetrahydrodienogest, show greater {{affinity}} for the PR and AR than does <b>dienogest</b> itself (see the table to the right).|$|E
50|$|The minimum {{effective}} dose of oral <b>dienogest</b> required to inhibit ovulation is 1 mg/day. The inhibition of ovulation by <b>dienogest</b> reportedly occurs mainly via peripheral action as opposed to central action on gonadotropin secretion.|$|E
50|$|Studies with steroids {{similar to}} <b>dienogest</b> (e.g., dienolone) {{have found that}} the {{introduction}} of a double bond between the C9 and C10 positions is associated with similar/almost unchanged affinity for the PR and AR. On the other hand, the C9(10) double bond of <b>dienogest</b> appears to inhibit metabolism via 5α-reductase and/or 5β-reductase, which is the major metabolic route for other 19-nortestosterone progestins like norethisterone, norgestrel, and etonogestrel, and this may serve to improve the metabolic stability and potency of <b>dienogest.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Third generation: Approved for {{marketing}} between 1990 and 2000. Examples: <b>dienogest,</b> etonogestrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> was {{synthesized}} in 1979 in Jena, Germany {{under the}} leadership of Prof. Kurt Ponsold, was initially referred to as STS-557. It was found that its potency was 10 times that of levonorgestrel. The first product on the market to contain <b>dienogest</b> was a combined oral contraceptive pill (with ethinylestradiol), Valette, introduced in 1995 and made by Jenapharm. In 2007, <b>dienogest</b> was introduced as Dinagest in Japan for the treatment of endometriosis, and it was subsequently marketed for this indication as Visanne in Europe and Australia in December 2009 and April 2010, respectively. Qlaira was introduced in Europe in 2009 and Natazia was introduced in the United States in 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Dinagest, Natazia, Qlaira, Valette, and Visanne among others, is a {{progestin}} {{which is available}} both in combination with estrogen and by itself as an oral contraceptive and {{for the treatment of}} endometriosis. In addition to its progestogenic effects, <b>dienogest</b> has antiandrogenic activity, and as a result may improve symptoms of androgen-dependent conditions such as acne.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dienogest</b> and {{estradiol}} valerate (brand names Qlaira, Natazia) - introduced in Europe in 2009 and the United States in 2010 ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> is used {{primarily}} as a contraceptive in combination with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Valette. It is given as a tablet containing 2 mg of <b>dienogest</b> and 30 μg of ethinylestradiol. The drug is also available in a quadriphasic oral contraceptive pill combined with estradiol valerate, marketed as Natazia in the United States and Qlaira in some European countries and Russia. This formulation is also approved {{for the treatment of}} heavy menstrual bleeding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> {{is rapidly}} absorbed and has high {{bioavailability}} of approximately 90%. It is exclusively protein-bound to albumin (90%, {{with the remaining}} 10% being free), and does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. The drug is metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP3A4. Its metabolites {{are said to be}} inactive and to be rapidly excreted. The terminal half-life of <b>dienogest</b> is 10 hours. It reaches steady-state concentrations after 2 days of administration and does not accumulate in the body.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{formulations}} of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem and Cliovelle), levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone (in Indivina), <b>dienogest</b> or drospirenone.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{treatment}} of <b>dienogest</b> 2 mg/day in cyclical women reduced serum progesterone levels to anovulatory levels, however serum levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone are not significantly altered.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dienogest</b> (Visanne, Dinagest): Progestin {{with some}} AR {{antagonist}} activity. Used as an oral contraceptive (with estradiol valerate as Natazia and Qlaira and with ethinylestradiol as Valette) {{and in the}} treatment of endometriosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest,</b> {{also known}} as 17α-cyanomethyl-δ9-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-cyanomethylestra-4,9-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It {{is a member of}} the estrane subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins, but unlike other 19-nortestosterone progestins, is not a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). This is because it uniquely possesses a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position rather than the usual ethynyl group. It is also unique among most 19-nortestosterone progestins in that it has a double bond between the C9 and C10 positions. <b>Dienogest</b> is the C17α cyanomethyl derivative of the anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) dienolone, as well as the C17α cyanomethyl analogue of the AAS methyldienolone (17α-methyldienolone) and ethyldienolone (17α-ethyldienolone).|$|E
50|$|Adverse effects {{associated}} with <b>dienogest</b> {{are the same}} as those expected of a progestogen. These include weight gain, increased blood pressure, breast tenderness, and nausea. It produces no androgenic side effects and has little effect on metabolic and lipid hemostatic parameters.|$|E
5000|$|Progesterone or progestins: Progesterone {{counteracts}} {{estrogen and}} inhibits {{the growth of}} the endometrium. Such therapy can reduce or eliminate menstruation in a controlled and reversible fashion. Progestins are chemical variants of natural progesterone. An example of a progestin is <b>dienogest</b> (Visanne).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> is also {{approved}} {{under the}} brand names Visanne and Dinagest in various {{countries such as}} European countries, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Japan {{for the treatment of}} endometriosis. It {{has been shown to be}} equally effective as leuprorelin, which is a second-line medication against endometriosis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dienogest</b> has {{relatively}} low {{affinity for the}} progesterone receptor (PR) in vitro in human uterus tissue, about 10% that of progesterone. In spite of its relatively weak affinity for the PR, the drug shows strong progestogenic effects on the endometrium. <b>Dienogest</b> {{is said to be}} one of the only 19-nortestosterone derivative progestins that does not have androgenic properties. In fact, it actually has antiandrogen activity, about 30-40% of that of cyproterone acetate, and can improve androgenic symptoms such as acne and hirsutism. The drug does not interact with the estrogen, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptor, and hence has no estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. However, it has limited impact on Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone, and thus does not lower LH significantly compared to other progestins.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their progestogenic activity, some progestins are antagonists of the androgen receptor {{and can be used}} therapeutically as antiandrogens. These progestins, with varying degrees of potency as antiandrogens, include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, <b>dienogest,</b> drospirenone, medrogestone, megestrol acetate, nomegestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> is {{available}} both alone and {{in combination with}} estradiol or ethinylestradiol {{throughout much of the}} world, including (but not limited to) Canada and many European, South American, and Southeast Asian countries. It {{is available}} only in combination with an estrogen and not as a standalone drug in the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|... 19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) progestins {{that are}} not {{derivatives}} of NET that have been marketed include the following: the C17α vinyl (ethenyl) derivatives norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-NT) and norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-NT); the allyl derivatives allylestrenol (3-deketo-17α-allyl-19-NT) and altrenogest (17α-allyl-δ9,11-19-NT); the C17α alkyl derivatives normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-NT) and norethandrolone (17α-ethyl-19-NT); the C17α cyanomethyl derivative <b>dienogest</b> (17α-cyanomethyl-δ9-19-NT); and the C16β ethyl derivative oxendolone (16β-ethyl-19-NT).|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} structure-activity relationships, the C17α cyanomethyl group of <b>dienogest</b> is {{responsible}} for its unique antiandrogenic instead of androgenic activity relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins. A loss of ability to activate the AR is also seen with other testosterone derivatives with extended-length C17α substituions such as topterone (propyltestosterone) (compare to the AAS ethyltestosterone and methyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (compare to the AAS ethylestrenol).|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, <b>dienogest</b> (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|The medical uses of {{estradiol}} valerate {{are the same}} as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the drug include hormone replacement therapy and hormonal contraception. In regards to the latter, {{estradiol valerate}} is available in combination with a progestogen as an combined estradiol-containing oral contraceptive (with <b>dienogest)</b> and as a combined injectable contraceptive (with hydroxyprogesterone caproate or norethisterone enanthate).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dienogest</b> is marketed {{for use as}} an oral {{contraceptive}} in combination with estradiol valerate under the brand names Natazia and Qlaira and in combination with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Valette, and is marketed by itself under the brand names Visanne and Dinagest) {{for the treatment of}} endometriosis in Europe, Australia, and Japan. It is also marketed under a variety of other, lesser-known brand names.|$|E
5000|$|NOMAC has weak or {{moderate}} antiandrogenic activity (5 to 20 {{times less}} than that of cyproterone acetate (a strong antiandrogen), with approximately 12-31% of the [...] of testosterone for the androgen receptor). It {{is said to be a}} weaker antiandrogen than <b>dienogest</b> (another commonly used progestin with antiandrogen activity), but still may be useful in alleviating acne, seborrhea, and other androgen-dependent symptoms in women.|$|E
5000|$|Androgen {{receptor}} antagonists: {{drugs that}} bind directly to and block the AR. These drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, chlormadinone acetate, spironolactone, oxendolone, and osaterone acetate (veterinary) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, topilutamide, and enzalutamide. Aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate, {{a few other}} progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal HRT including <b>dienogest,</b> drospirenone, medrogestone, and nomegestrol acetate also have varying degrees of AR antagonistic activity.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. <b>Dienogest</b> and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 Kurt Ponsold, in {{cooperation}} with Jenapharm, synthesized a new progestin [...] - [...] <b>dienogest.</b> The combination ethinylestradiol/dienogest was efficacious as oral contraceptive. It was marketed initially as Certostat, and later as Valette). After sales debuted in 1990, within {{only a few years}} Valette become the most sold oral contraceptive on the German market. Jenapharm managed to take the top spot in German market share for oral contraceptives with 18%, compared with Schering's 13-14%. In 1996 Valette had annual sales of DM40m. This was a compelling reason to Schering to acquire Jenapharm.|$|E
