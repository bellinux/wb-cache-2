In 1991, it became a criminal offence for brokers to compensate clients for investments which had gone bad or to otherwise conceal their losses. In the late 1990s new accounting rules introduced required investment valuations to be mark-to-market, forcing losses or gains to be shown in the financial statements. Despite the tightening, a loophole involving intangible assets continued to be exploited: Japanese acquisition accounting rules allow companies to record M&A fees on their deals as part of consideration, and <b>goodwill</b> <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> may be depreciated over 20 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{suggests}} that a hypothesis in a previous paper in this journal is false. The hypothesis relates to the tax deductibility of goodwill, but the paper does not distinguish between <b>goodwill</b> <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> (which is not tax deductible) and other purchased goodwill (which is deductible in some jurisdictions). Dunne and Ndubizu [1995] (henceforth D&N) examine in this journal "the economic effects of differential international accounting and tax treatments for goodwill {{on the market for}} foreign control of U. S. target firms " (p. 362). They purport to find that "those firms that can deduct goodwill for tax pur-poses provide greater wealth to U. S. target shareholders than acquirers that cannot deduct goodwill " (p. 374). This comment paper {{suggests that}} one of their findings is wrong because their analysis of tax treatments is flawed. D&N's basic assumption in developing their tax hypothesis (H 2) is that: "Most countries that require the amortization of goodwill for financial report-ing purposes allow goodwill amortization as an expense for tax purposes [...] . which increases cash flow because of the lower taxes paid [...] . [which] leaves foreign acquirers at an advantage " (p. 365). This hypothesis is false. As will be shown below, in none of the countries considered by D&N is the relevant goodwill amortization deductible for tax purposes. The problem occurs because of a failure to distinguish between <b>goodwill</b> <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> and other purchased goodwill. The former arises when a com-pany (or group of companies) acquires another company. Such goodwill therefore arises only in consolidated financial statements. In the countries use...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{accounting}} for goodwill has caused considerable concern to accountants and academics. For over 100 years {{there has been}} diversity of views as to the nature, recognition and measurement of goodwill. Such diversity of views has contributed to the adoption of a variety of accounting practices for goodwill, which has lead to attempts to regulate practice by accounting professions in the Anglo-American world. The research conducted involves a literature review to identify the concepts and definition of goodwill and the criteria for its recognition and measurement. the investigation will then concentrate upon goodwill arising on consolidation of the financial statements of a group of companies. Major accounting practices will be examined, along with the requirements of the australian and mojor overseas professions on the issue. The findings of a study of listed Australian companies which investigated the accounting policies adopted for <b>goodwill</b> <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> before and after regulation of the issue and which sought views upon some of the conceptual issues involved are reported and discussed. Implications of the research for the Australian accounting profession will be addressed, and recommendations will be propsed together with a description of future research opportunities...|$|E
