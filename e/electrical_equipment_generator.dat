40|$|Electricity {{has become}} the most sought after amenity for all of us. Gone are the days when {{electricity}} would be only limited to cities. It is now reaching to every distant parts of the world. So we have now a complex network of power system. This power is being carried by the transmission lines. These lines travel very long distances so while carrying power, fault occurring is natural. These faults damages many vital <b>electrical</b> <b>equipments</b> like transformer, <b>generator,</b> transmission lines. For the uninterrupted power supply we need to prevent these faults as much as possible. So we need to detect faults within the shortest possible time. Microprocessors and microcontroller based systems used for these fault detection have been advancing rapidly. The proposed paper simulates Numerical Overcurrent relay that detects faults using microcontroller and ADC. These relays are more reliable and have faster response than the traditional electromechanical relays and Static relays. They have increased range of setting, high accuracy, reduced size, and lower costs, along with many other functions, such as fault event recording, auto-resetting, etc. This project is about designing the Numerical relay where the fault is detected when the input value exceeds the reference value set in the relay which then gives the trip signal to the circuit breake...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{electric}} {{tools and}} portable lighting at construction sites {{are required to}} be fed from a centre-tapped system with only 55 V between live conductors and the earth. This system is used with 110 V equipment and therefore no neutral conductor is needed. The intention {{is to reduce the}} electrocution hazard that may exist when using <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment</b> at a wet or outdoor construction site. Portable transformers that transform single-phase 240 V to this 110 V system are a common piece of construction <b>equipment.</b> <b>Generator</b> sets used for construction sites are equipped to supply it directly.An incidental benefit is that the filaments of 110 V incandescent lamps used on such systems are thicker and therefore mechanically more rugged than those of 240 V lamps.|$|R
