40|$|Several {{items on}} the {{diagnostics}} and interpretation of coronal loop observations are under debate. In this work, we analyze a well-defined loop system detected in a time-resolved observation in several spectral bands. The dataset includes simultaneous images in the TRACE 171 A, 195 A and 284 A bands, and Yohkoh/SXT, and two rasters taken with SoHO/CDS in twelve relevant lines. The loop is initially best visible in the TRACE 195 A filter band, {{and later in the}} 171 A filter band, with correspondence with the CDS raster images at log T 6 ̃. 0 - 6. 1. We have taken as pixel-by-pixel background the latest TRACE, Yohkoh and CDS images where the loop has faded out. We examine the loop morphology evolution, the light curves, the TRACE <b>filter</b> <b>ratio</b> distribution and evolution, the images and emission measure from the CDS spectral lines. Our analysis detects that, after background subtraction, the emission along the loop and its evolution are non-uniform, especially in the 171 A filter band, and that the TRACE 195 / 171 <b>filter</b> <b>ratio</b> has a moderately non-uniform distribution along the loop and evolves in time.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of various models for automated evaluation of descriptive answers by using rank based feature selection filters for dimensionality reduction. We quantitatively analyze the best feature selection technique from amongst the five rank based feature selection techniques, namely Chi squared filter, Information gain <b>filter,</b> Gain <b>ratio</b> <b>filter,</b> Relief filter and Symmetrical uncertainty filter. We use Sequential Minimal Optimization with Polynomial kernel to build models and we evaluate the models across various parameters such as Accuracy, Time to build models, Kappa, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error. Except with Relief filter, for all other filters applied models, the accuracies obtained are at least 4 % better than accuracies obtained with models with no filters applied. The accuracies recorded are same across Chi squared filter, Information gain <b>filter,</b> Gain <b>ratio</b> <b>filter</b> and Symmetrical Uncertainty filter. Therefore accuracy alone is not the determinant in selecting the best filter. The time taken to build models, Kappa, Mean absolute error and Root Mean Squared Error {{played a major role}} in determining the effectiveness of the filters. The overall rank aggregation metric of Symmetrical uncertainty filter is 45 and this is better by 1 rank than the rank aggregation metric of information gain attribute evaluation filter, the nearest contender to Symmetric attribute evaluation filter. Symmetric uncertainty rank aggregation metric is better by 3, 6, 112 ranks respectively when compared to rank aggregation metrics of Chi squared <b>filter,</b> Gain <b>ratio</b> <b>filter</b> and Relief filters.

40|$|Nanoflares, {{short and}} intense heat pulses within {{spatially}} unresolved magnetic strands, are now considered a leading candidate {{to solve the}} coronal heating problem. However, the frequent occurrence of nanoflares requires that flare-hot plasma {{be present in the}} corona at all times. Its detection has proved elusive until now, in part because the intensities are predicted to be very faint. Here we report on the analysis of an active region observed with five filters by Hinode/XRT in November 2006. We have used the <b>filter</b> <b>ratio</b> method to derive maps of temperature and emission measure both in soft and hard ratios. These maps are approximate in that the plasma is assumed to be isothermal along each line-of-sight. Nonetheless, the hardest available ratio reveals the clear presence of plasma around 10 MK. To obtain more detailed information about the plasma properties, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations assuming a variety of non-isothermal emission measure distributions along the lines-of-sight. We find that the observed filter ratios imply bi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool (log T ~ 6. 3 - 6. 5) component and a weaker (few percent) and hotter (6. 6 < log T < 7. 2) component. The data are consistent with bi-modal distributions along all lines of sight, i. e., throughout the active region. We also find that the isothermal temperature inferred from a <b>filter</b> <b>ratio</b> depends sensitively on the precise temperature of the cool component. A slight shift of this component can cause the hot component to be obscured in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently, temperature maps made in hard and soft ratios tend to be anti-correlated. We conclude that this observation supports the presence of widespread nanoflaring activity in the active region. Comment: 12 figures, accepted for publication on refereed journa...|$|E

40|$|Change {{detection}} {{in urban}} and suburban areas through remote sensing satellite imagery is an important topic. Furthermore, it is of special interest to derive information on the category of detected changes is of special interest. In (Boldt et al., 2012), a fullyautomatic change detection method based on a morphological <b>filtered</b> <b>ratio</b> image was presented. This filter step is accomplished by an alternating sequential filter (ASF), which supports the knowledge-driven analysis of the scene. For example, the focus can be set on small-scaled changes caused by vehicles or smaller construction sites. The change detection itself is performed using the automatic threshold method shown in (Sahoo et al., 2004) considering the entropies of the fore- and background of the <b>filtered</b> <b>ratio</b> image. In contrast, the presented approach makes use of morphological differential attribute profiles (DAPs) to compare changes detected in high resolution (HR) TerraSAR-X (TSX) amplitude images of Greding (Germany). DAPs are the derivatives of morphological attribute profiles (APs). APs are calculated by applying iteratively attribute openings and/or closings to an input image. Attribute openings (resp. closings) themselves are a combination of connected openings (closings) and trivial openings (closings). DAPs provide the opportunity to derive typical signatures for each pixel of the entire image (Dalla Mura et al., 2010), and, as a consequence, for each detected change segment. Aiming on the categorization of changes, it is shown in this paper that the DAPs represent a promising method for detecting changes with similar semantics automatically...|$|R

A streaming computation is a network of compute nodes connected by unidirectional FIFO channels. When these computations are mapped onto real parallel platforms, however, some computations, especially ones in which some nodes act as filters, can deadlock the system due to finite buffering on channels. In this paper, we focus on streaming computations which contain a commonly used structure called split-join. Based on our previous work, we propose two correct deadlock-avoidance algorithms, named the Propagating Algorithm and the Nonpropagating Algorithm. Our evaluation of two representative applications, biological sequence alignment and random number generation, shows that the Non-propagating Algorithm has very small communication overhead.

Methods: We analyze sequences of images in the 171 Å and 195 Å filter bands of TRACE. One background subtraction method consists of considering background values obtained by interpolating between concentric strips around the analyzed loop. Another involves a pixel-to-pixel subtraction of the final image after the loop has completely faded out, used by Reale and Ciaravella. Results: We compare the emission distributions along the loop obtained with the two methods and find that they differ considerably. We also find differences in the related <b>filter</b> <b>ratio</b> and temperature profiles. In particular, the pixel-to-pixel subtraction leads to coherent diagnostics of a cooling loop. After applying the other type of subtraction, the diagnostics are much less clear. Conclusions: The background subtraction should be treated with care when analyzing a loop.

We consider Hinode/XRT data of a the 2006 November 12 th C 1. 1 flare. We inspect the evolution of the morphology of the flaring region also with the aid of TRACE data. XRT <b>filter</b> <b>ratios</b> are used to derive temperature and emission measure maps and evolution. Results. The analyzed flare includes several brightenings. We identify a coherent sequence of tangled and relaxed loop structures before, during, and after the brightenings. Although the thermal information is incomplete because of pixel saturation at the flare peak, thermal maps show fine, evolving spatial structuring. Temperature and emission measure variations show up in great detail, and we are able to detect a secondary heating of larger loops close to the proper flaring region. Finally we estimate the amount of energy released in these flaring loops during the flare decay. Conclusions...|$|R
