50|$|The most {{important}} type of nearly neoclassical shock {{is due to}} market failure and imperfect markets. Sudden free market liberalisation {{in the absence of}} free market institutions (as was the case in post-Communist states) or in which a Western-style economy is unnecessarily liberalised (e.g. cutting police budgets, removing regulation) are both examples of <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> shocks.|$|E
40|$|The inverse productivity-size {{relationship}} has been observed the world over, yet {{there has not been}} an adequate explanation to describe why it occurs. Three hypotheses have been presented: <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets,</b> soil characteristics, and measurement error. This thesis focuses on soil quality and <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> as the cause of the relationship: smaller plots are simply more fertile and thus more productive than larger, more marginal lands. Since soil characteristics have not been considered in previous analyses, the resulting omitted variable bias induces the inverse relationship. The soil hypothesis is tested within the context of <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets,</b> including various types of labor and household or village fixed effects. Using soil and labor data from Madagascar, this thesis finds that soil characteristics do not influence the inverse relationship The inverse relationship remains even after controlling for house-hold level effects questioning <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> as a cause. Further work is warranted to ferret out the cause of the observed inverse productivity-size relationship. It may be allocative inefficiency of the household resources among the plots that gives rise to the inverse relationship...|$|R

40|$|Farmers in {{developing}} countries are confronted with <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets.</b> This {{has an impact on}} their production activities. When implementing developing projects these market imperfections should be taken into account. This paper is an attempt to discuss the impact of <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> {{in the context of an}} irrigation project in village Pata, Senegal. The first section models the production decision of the agricultural household. The second section presents the irrigation project in Pata. The third section tests for the presence of imperfections in the credit and labour markets of Pata. I conclude by discussing the implications for the project. ...|$|R
50|$|Real {{markets are}} never perfect, but range from close-to-perfect to very imperfect. Share and foreign {{exchange}} markets are commonly {{said to be}} the most similar to the perfect market. The real estate market {{is an example of a}} very <b>imperfect</b> <b>market.</b> In such markets, the Theory of the second best proves that if one optimality condition in an economic model cannot be satisfied, it is possible that the next-best solution involves changing other variables away from the values that would otherwise be optimal.|$|E
50|$|If {{the firm}} is able to sell its {{transfer}} goods in an <b>imperfect</b> <b>market,</b> then it {{need not be a}} price taker. There are two markets each with its own price (Pf and Pt in the next diagram). The aggregate market is constructed from the first two. That is, point C is a horizontal summation of points A and B (and likewise for all other points on the Net Marginal Revenue curve (NMRa)). The total optimum quantity (Q) is the sum of Qf plus Qt.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the rising field in international trade and industrial organization. A vast sample of Italian micro data is used to study the behavior of relative export prices in <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets.</b> It is shown that relative export prices, the relation of prices a firm charges on export and domestic markets, are, in general, downward biased. Moreover, relative export prices depend negatively on firm size and market concentration, but positively on the average export share of the industry. This indicates that markets are segmented and firms are able to discriminate prices.

50|$|If the {{producer}} of a good is a monopoly, the factor demand curve is also the MRPL curve. The curve is downward sloping because both the marginal product of labor and marginal revenue fall as output increases. With a competitive firm, marginal revenue is constant and the downward slope {{is due to the}} decreasing marginal product of labor. Therefore, the MRPL curve for a monopoly lies below the MRPL for a competitive firm. The implications are that a monopoly or any firm operating under <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> conditions will produce less and hire less labor than a perfectly competitive firm at a given price.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} the <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> shock depends on what {{assumption}} of the perfect market is voided. The most important assumption for all markets {{is the idea of}} property rights. The free market doesn't just depend on the exchange of commodities, but on the rights to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. Markets are institutions that organize the exchange of control of commodities, where the {{nature of the}} control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities. Property rights are the most important because they can have the most dramatic effect on the results, and are thought to be behind the most important causes of market failure.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the tension}} between, {{on the one}} hand, the undeniable costs to society caused by market failure, {{and on the other}} hand, the {{potential}} that attempts to mitigate these costs could lead to even greater costs from [...] "government failure", there is sometimes a choice between imperfect outcomes, i.e. <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> outcomes with or without government interventions. But either way, if a market failure exists the outcome is not Pareto efficient. Most mainstream economists believe that there are circumstances (like building codes or endangered species) in which it is possible for government or other organizations to improve the inefficient market outcome. Several heterodox schools of thought disagree with this as a matter of principle.|$|E
40|$|Since {{at least}} the late 1950 s, it has been {{recognized}} that multinational enterprises operate in <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> characterized by oligopoly. The dominant “transactions-cost” theory of multinational enterprises does not wholly account for why this is so. The reductio ad absurdum of this theory would predict <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> to be sure, but they would be monopolistic rather than oligopolistic. In this article, a simple model based on noncooperative game theory shows how oligopolistic markets can evolve from monopolistic ones.

40|$|Laboratory {{experimentation}} {{was used}} to assess the impacts of information disclosure in <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets.</b> A dual oligopoly market structure was designed with contract infor-mation disclosed to subjects under three treatments: no, partial, and full disclosure. Regression analysis revealed some increase in selling price with full information disclo-sure, but no discernable effects on negotiated prices with partial disclosure. Alternative specifications showed large traders earning significantly lower profits, and information on large traders significantly beneficial to both buyers and sellers. Probit analysis of information selection determinants revealed no significant economic content in trader requests for information under partial disclosure. Key words: experimental economics, grain transportation, <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets,</b> infor-mation impacts, transportation. Historically economists have looked to neoclassical economic theory, to game theory, and to the structure-conduct-performance paradigm to evaluate the performance of particular markets. Unfortunately, only some of the more relevant and interesting questions regarding market performance are addressed by these methods.

50|$|REEEP {{also works}} with {{entrepreneurs}} to perform Outcome Mapping, a critical element of any project {{that relies on}} specific actions or behavioural changes from a broad group of stakeholders amid <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> settings. The Outcome Mapping begins with an analysis of stakeholders — individuals, organisations, government bodies, etc. — who influence {{the ability of a}} project to reach an objective. In doing so, REEEP tests entrepreneurs’ understanding of the stakeholder landscape: Are they aware of existing and potential competitors? Do they understand customer needs and unique characteristics? Are they relying upon a policy change in the future for their business model to be viable, and if so what are they doing to bring the change about? We track identified behavioural changes (or non-changes) that occur throughout the project. By understanding people, relationships and behaviours we can allow for real-time reflection and rapid reaction.|$|E
50|$|Shock therapy can {{be largely}} {{understood}} by {{thinking of it}} as an artificial shock imposed by government policies. Neoclassical theory provides a very useful tool in trying to describe an artificial shock theoretically, in that neoclassical theory provides an idealised view of an economy based on certain assumptions, most of which are made true through market institutions (often but not necessarily provided by the government), law, culture or historical practise, and is very useful in explaining most situations (especially in modern Westernised economies). Even when some of the assumptions required for neoclassical theory are not in place resulting in an <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> and the results of neoclassical theory becoming distorted or failing, comparing the result with neoclassical theory can prove useful. Other, slightly different formulations of economic thought strive to describe shocks, the most important of which is economic liberalism.|$|E
5000|$|This {{approach}} to law applies theories or economics {{to identify the}} legal implications of maximizing behavior {{inside and outside of}} markets. Economics is the study of rational choice under limited conditions. Rational choice is the assumption that individual actors seek to maximize their preferences.Most of the economic theory employed here is neoclassical traditional economics. Economic techniques include price theory, which evaluates strategic interaction between actors. Transaction cost economics, which incorporates cost of identifying actors, negotiating, and costs of enforcing agreements into price theory. Game Theory can demonstrate how actors with maximizing behavior might fail to take action increase join gain. Public choice applies economic tools to problems outside of markets.These tools are used to describe and evaluate law. Using these tools, laws are tested for economic efficiency. Economic theories are also used to propose changes in the law. This approach urges the adoption of laws that maximize wealth.Potential application of this approach would begin with a text-based interpretation. A secondary concern is whether or not an actual [...] "market" [...] context is functioning well. Thirdly, ways to improve the <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> are proposed.This approach could be used to analyze general legal questions, because this approach provides highly specified rules and provides the rationale for using them.This approach relies on assumptions that perfect competition exists, and that individuals will behave to maximize their preferences. The empirical presence of these conditions is often difficult to determine.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses data envelopment {{analysis}} and new data from Burkina Faso to test the impact of intercontinental and continental migration on technical efficiency {{in the production of}} two cereals—millet and sorghum—by rural households. Econometric evidence supports our theoretical expectation that the impact of emigration varies by migrant destination. I find evidence of a positive relation between continental migration and technical efficiency and a negative relation between intercontinental migration and technical efficiency. In an <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> environment, continental migration is associated with greater efficiency because it removes a male labor surplus; explanations for the negative relationship between intercontinental migration and technical efficiency should be sought in a surplus of female labor supply. Overall, findings suggest that migration does not lead to a transformation of cereal production from traditional to modern, because in an <b>imperfect</b> <b>market</b> environment, liquidity received in the form of remittances cannot compensate for labor shortfalls.

40|$|A gap {{has existed}} between the {{relative}} space that authors of intermediate microeconomics textbooks devote to imperfectly competitive markets and their relative frequency. This gap has persisted for at least 40 years even with an almost complete turnover of authors between the decades of the sixties and the nineties. The picture portrayed in most micro textbooks gives students a distorted view {{of the presence of}} market imperfections throughout the economy. Even so, there are large differences between authors in their relative coverage of <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets.</b> It does not appear that the credibility gap exists because the concepts discussed in <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> are more difficult to explain. Nor is there any evidence that authors agree more on what to include in the competitive chapters but differ about what to include in the imperfectly competitive chapters.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} farmer cooperatives {{on the performance of}} <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> through simulation analysis. Results suggest that, in addition to restricting output or overproducing, cooperatives can contribute to the diminution of economic welfare because of the increased costs of producing raw product due to disproportionate market shares. Evaluating the Competitive Yardstick Effect of Cooperatives on Imperfect Markets: A Simulation Approach Farmer cooperatives have benefited from favorable public policies because they generally are perceived as procompetitive forces that improve the performance of <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> and increase general economic welfare (Sexon and Iskow). Central to this notion is the "competitive yardstick " concept, which maintains that the existence of a cooperative in a market will force profit-maximizing firms to behave more competitively. The logic behind the yardstick is that the cooperative will offer farmers more favorable prices because of its practice of providing members service at cost. Competing firms must match the cooperative's performance to avoid losing patrons to it. Consequently, the market will move toward competitive equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|This issue {{features}} two research articles, {{three issues}} policy articles {{and a book}} review section. The first article in the issue is by Berthold Wigger (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg). Wigger s article, Public Pensions and the Role of Real versus Financial Capital, revisits the Diamond (1965) model {{in light of the}} <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> framework of Magill and Quinzii (2003). Whereas in Diamond (1965), the introduction of a social security system can make a transition generation better off, Wigger derives an equilibrium in <b>imperfect</b> <b>markets</b> in which the outcome is different. The essential difference is that in Diamond s model capital can be changed into consumption goods whereas in the Magill and Quinzii (2003) framework the investment in capital goods such as their housing is irreversible. Though the old benefit from the introduction of social security, the value of their capital goods declines. Hence, the abnormal gains observed by transition generations in social security may be offset elsewhere. This is a potentially relevant result for the US social security debate in which a key focus is how to allocate the legacy burden of social security. ...|$|R
