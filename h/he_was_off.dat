He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing {{by a few}} feet. During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went to use the toilet during the ninth inning. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E

25|$|In William's absence, Queen Mary and her advisors – the 'Council of Nine' – {{hastened to}} take {{measures}} for the defence of the country. Carmarthen {{thought that it was}} advisable to fight, as did Nottingham and Admiral Russell, who were unconvinced that the French were as strong as Torrington reported and considered that only the admiral's pessimism, defeatism or treachery could account for his reports. As the two fleets moved slowly up the channel (with Torrington keeping carefully out of range), Russell drafted the order to fight. Countersigned by Nottingham, the orders reached the admiral on 9 July whilst <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> Beachy Head. Torrington realised that not to give battle was to be guilty of direct disobedience; to give battle was, in his judgment, to incur serious risk of defeat. Torrington called a council of war with his flag-officers, who concluded that they had no option but to obey.|$|E

25|$|Furman {{qualified}} {{from the}} semi-final at Sverdlovsk 1947, {{for his first}} Soviet Chess Championship at age 27. In the final, he performed exceptionally well, placing third, only half a point behind joint winners David Bronstein and Alexander Kotov, with a fine score of 11/18 (URS-ch16, Moscow 1948). In the Leningrad Championship of 1948, he tied for 7th-10th places, with 9½/17. He tied for first-third places at Vilnius 1949, the semi-final for URS-ch17, with 11½/17, qualifying again for the Soviet final. In the Leningrad Championship of 1949, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> form with 8½/18 to tie for 11th-13th places. Then, in the Soviet final later in 1949, again in Moscow (URS-ch17), he tied for 5th-7th places with 11½/19. In the 1950 Championship of the Spartak Club, he tied for 4th-5th places, with 6/11. Then at Gorky 1950, he was unsuccessful in qualifying for the next Soviet Championship final, as he could only score 9½/15, for fourth place.|$|E
25|$|The second Nova series Nova {{deals with}} Nova 0:0, who {{is much more}} adept at using his powers than Richard Rider. He often fights Nova {{in order to test}} him and to push Nova into using his powers in new ways. It is {{revealed}} that this Nova is in fact the alternate reality version of Richard's younger brother Robert. In that reality Robert gained the Nova Force powers instead of Richard and stayed behind to lead the Nova Corps and help Xandar rebuild after the war with the Skrulls. Robert's earth had been destroyed by the Deathstorm while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> in space. Nova 0:0 would later sacrifice his life preventing the Deathstorm from destroying the 616-version of Earth. He died and was buried on Mars. In the fourth Nova series the Robert Rider of the 616-version of Earth also becomes a member of the Nova Corps (alongside various other humans and non-humans) and again proves capable of using his powers in ways his brother Richard had not.|$|E

500|$|Miles {{was one of}} {{only three}} men (Hargest was one of the others) known to British Military Intelligence to have escaped from an Italian prisoner-of-war camp and make their way to another country prior to the {{armistice}} with Italy. In Switzerland, Miles and Hargest split up and travelled independently. As Hargest wrote in his book Farewell Campo 12, [...] "I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang up to say <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off,</b> and to suggest I should follow him later". Having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, exhausted and depressed, Miles shot himself. He was buried with military honours, and escorted to his final resting place in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery by members of the British Consulate and a party of Spanish officers. Shortly before his death, his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire was confirmed.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving in}} the Militia, Miller {{continued}} playing football for St Kilda Saints and interstate cricket for Victoria when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> duty. Miller struggled to conform to military norms and was soon fined for [...] "using insulting language towards a superior officer". In late 1941, he left the Militia and was accepted into the Royal Australian Navy, but tore up his form because his friend was rejected, before enlisting in the RAAF. After his initial training in 1942, he earned his wings and was deployed to the United Kingdom in early 1943 where he continued his training with the No. 169 Squadron RAF. Miller survived a few disciplinary incidents while training to eventually take part in combat operations in the closing stages of the European theatre of the war, and had several narrow escapes from death throughout his combat and training period. He received several campaign medals for his service.|$|E

McCrimmon routinely played {{a high number of}} minutes each game; his teammates marvelled at his stamina. In the Memorial Cup final, he played virtually every minute of the contest. [...] His total ice time was 60 minutes, 38 seconds, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the ice only to serve a two-minute penalty. [...] Peterborough won the game, 2–1 in overtime, after McCrimmon lost the puck on a play he thought was icing was not called. [...] Peterborough's Terry Bovair stole the puck from him and scored the championship winning goal. Despite the loss, McCrimmon was named a tournament all-star on defence.|$|E

500|$|On 13 March 1944, Scherf was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader and, with his operation tour at an end, was posted to Headquarters Air Defence of Great Britain as a controller of Intruder operations. By {{the time of this}} posting, Scherf had destroyed seven airborne or grounded German aircraft, with an additional shared victory. Despite his new position, Scherf's [...] "impatient spirit was far from satisfied with a staff position", and he occasionally returned to No.418 Squadron when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> duty, taking part in operational sorties with the unit. On 5 April, Scherf joined the squadron in a sortie over Northern France. During the engagement, Scherf shot down two Axis aircraft in the air and damaged three more on the ground. For his actions on the two operations in February and April, Scherf was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross.

500|$|Hargest was {{transported to}} Italy {{where he was}} {{initially}} held in a villa near Sulmona but was transferred, along with a fellow New Zealander, Brigadier Reginald Miles, who had been captured in December 1941, to Castle Vincigliata, known as Campo 12, near Florence. Campo 12 was a prison camp for officers of general and brigadier rank and the prisoners were held under more comfortable conditions than soldiers of lesser rank. In late March 1943, a group of officers, including Hargest and Miles, managed to escape using a tunnel dug from a disused chapel within the castle walls. Of the six escapees, Hargest and Miles {{were the only two}} to reach safety in neutral Switzerland, where they split up to independently try to make their way to England. As Hargest later related [...] "I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang up to say <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off,</b> and to suggest I should follow him later". Miles made it to Figueras, close to the Spanish frontier, but, overcome with depression, killed himself on 20 October. With the help of the French Resistance, Hargest travelled through France to Spain, where he reached the British Consulate in Barcelona. He flew to England in December 1943.|$|E
500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
