2500|$|Finance {{professor}} Roy Batchelor {{and researcher}} Richard Ramyar, a former Director of the United Kingdom Society of Technical Analysts and formerly Global Head of Research at Lipper and Thomson Reuters Wealth Management, studied whether Fibonacci ratios appear non-randomly {{in the stock}} market, as Elliott's model predicts.

They also said [...] "there is {{no significant difference between}} the frequencies with which price and time ratios occur in cycles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> Jones Industrial Average, and frequencies which we would expect to occur at random in such a time series".|$|E

40|$|On {{the evening}} of 30 May 1998 {{atmospheric}} conditions across southeastern South Dakota {{lead to the development}} of organized moist convection including several supercells. One such supercell is tracked by both a WSR- 88 D radar from Souix Falls, SD (KFSD) and by a Doppler On Wheels (DOW) mobile radar. This supercell remains discrete {{for an hour and a}} half before being overtaken by a developing squall line. During this time period the supercell produces at least one strong and one violent tornado, the latter of which passes through Spencer, SD despite the absence of strong low-level environmental wind shear. The two tornadoes are observed both visually and with <b>the</b> <b>DOW</b> radar at ranges between 1. 7 and 12. 9 km.
