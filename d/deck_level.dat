5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above <b>deck</b> <b>level.</b> The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|The eight 8-inch {{guns were}} mounted in pairs in four wing turrets {{placed on the}} superstructure. Their arc of fire, {{although}} big on paper, was in reality limited. Adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if the gun was trained alongside it, a defect also suffered by the 13-inch guns. The smaller 6-inch guns were mounted in twin wing casemates midships on the main <b>deck</b> <b>level,</b> with a 6-pounder in between. The other Hotchkiss 6-pounders lined the superstructure and bridge decks. Four of the 1-pounders were placed in hull casemates at the bow and stern {{of the ship and}} two more in the fighting tops of the masts. In 1908, all the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery and because ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50-caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials {{decided whether to}} replace her {{at a cost of}} $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 dollars more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E

25|$|The {{architect}} of the Burrard Street Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below <b>deck</b> <b>level,</b> while its central span is a Pratt truss placed above <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> to allow greater clearance height for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by overhead galleries, which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge’s superstructure (a V under Vancouver’s bust, a B under Burrard’s).|$|E

25|$|The {{carriers}} {{that were}} built with armoured decks {{fall into two}} distinct types – those with armour at the flight <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> protecting the hangar and those that only had armour for {{the lower levels of}} the ship, typically the hangar deck. The different thickness of armour, and how they were distributed, are described in the table below.|$|E
25|$|Three Type 96 {{searchlights}} were positioned {{along the}} outer {{edges of the}} flight deck: two {{on the port side}} and one to starboard, just aft of the island. Like the collapsible crane, these could be lowered below flight <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> to prevent interference with normal flight activity. A fourth searchlight was mounted to the starboard side of the carrier’s island on a projecting sponson.|$|E

50|$|The {{installation}} comprises a steel {{jacket with}} four main legs, supporting 36 modules arranged on 3 <b>deck</b> <b>levels.</b> 28 of these modules contain {{the equipment and}} machinery, which constitute the production, utilities, drilling systems and facilities. The remaining 8 modules situated on the southeast end of the installation contain living quarters (LQ), offices, the central control room (CCR), the helideck and workshops. The platform was installed on the jacket in 1978.|$|R
2500|$|The wreck sits in {{approximately}} , less than [...] from shore. Over time, the breakwater became a popular site for scuba diving. The ship was penetrable from many openings along both sides, and featured two submerged <b>deck</b> <b>levels</b> with heavy silting. With care and lights, {{it was possible}} to travel from stem to stern without leaving the ship. The interior of the ship has also seen use as a training course for assault swimmers. Her exposed decks were regularly used for picnics.|$|R
25|$|In May 1915 she {{was given}} the pennant number PP585 and {{converted}} into a minesweeper by Lieutenant Commander W G Rigg. This work involved having {{the end of her}} saloon cut away to main <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> and replaced with minesweeping equipment. From 14 July 1915 she was stationed at Dover under the command of Lieutenant Alexander Duff Thomson Royal Naval Reserve and from April 1916 she was stationed at Dunkirk.|$|E
25|$|Both the pusher and {{the barge}} {{suffered}} extensive damages from the accident. When the cargo shifted, {{the port side}} coamings and ramp were cut at the <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> and disappeared to the sea along with the cargo. As Finn-Baltic drifted towards the shallows, the superstructure and smoke stack of the pusher and the remaining parts of the coamings of the barge were crushed and mangled when they {{came into contact with}} the seafloor — large parts of the superstructure were later recovered for investigation along the drifting path. Some minor damage was also caused by the rightening operation.|$|E
25|$|The Dairy Goat Pavilion {{is located}} {{to the south}} of the Dairy Cattle Pavilion and to the north of Show Ring No.2. It is an {{elevated}} two-storey structure with an associated open concrete deck which overlooks the show ring and Sideshow Alley beyond. Storage areas and public amenities are located at the lower ground show ring level under the raised concrete deck while the structure itself is sited at the upper <b>deck</b> <b>level.</b> The building is of a simple rectilinear plan with a gable roof extending the full length of the building and being supported at its ends by concrete and steel columns. Both the walls and roof are clad with metal corrugated custom orb sheeting. Lining the perimeter of the concrete deck are a series of shade structures.|$|E
50|$|The Tenaka is {{a single}} ended ferry that carries 30 cars and 150 passengers. Two Caterpillar engines provide 1700 {{horsepower}} and give the Tenaka a speed of 12 knots. There are two passenger <b>deck</b> <b>levels</b> on the ferry. There are two lounges on the lower passenger level that are {{on each side of}} the overheight car lane. Another passenger lounge directly above extends across the width of the ferry. The Tenaka has a vending machine and washrooms, but no other passenger amenities. It has two outside decks astern of each passenger cabin.|$|R
50|$|At 2100, Brooklyn again came {{alongside}} {{to remove}} {{the remainder of the}} crew, while a special salvage detail boarded the ship. On 5 September 1942, towing operations commenced led by the Canadian salvage vessel Foundation Franklin and the big transport was put aground at McNab's Cove, near Halifax, at 1740 on the 8th. When fire-fighting details arrived alongside to board and commence the mammoth operation, fires still burned in three holds and in the crew's quarters on two <b>deck</b> <b>levels.</b> Four days later, the last flames had been extinguished, and the ship was re-floated on the 14th.|$|R

25|$|By 1973, {{problems}} with the estate were becoming apparent; the walkways of the <b>deck</b> <b>level</b> created dangerously isolated areas which became hotspots for crime and robbery, and provided easy escape routes for criminals. The housing was poorly maintained, and suffered badly from water leakages, pest infestations and electrical faults. More {{than half of the}} people offered accommodation in the estate refused it, and the majority of existing residents had applied to be re-housed elsewhere. In 1976, less than ten years after the estate opened, the Department of the Environment concluded that the estate was of such poor quality that the only solution was demolition. This decision was unwelcome to residents, and relations between the community and the local authority became increasingly confrontational. A process of regeneration began in 1981, but it was hampered by a lack of funds and an increasingly negative public perception of the area.|$|E

50|$|From {{the early}} 1820s, the British Navy began {{building}} {{a number of}} small steam warships, and by the 1830s many navies were experimenting with steam-powered warships. This first generation of steam warships, termed 'paddle warships' (in the categories of frigate, sloop, gunvessel or other), used paddlewheels mounted on either the sides or in the center. The ships were equipped with large guns, generally mounted on one deck (although some larger paddle warships carried guns on two <b>deck</b> <b>levels).</b> Paddlewheels were proven in a number of Admiralty trials to be less efficient than the propeller or 'screw', and more vulnerable to damage, and from the late 1840s onwards navies began to build screw-driven steam warships.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{gas line}} {{ruptured}} (the riser for the MCP-01 platform), ejecting millions of {{cubic feet of}} gas into the conflagration and increased its intensity. Huge flames shot over [...] in the air. The Tharos was driven off by the fearsome heat, which began to melt the surrounding machinery and steelwork. It was only after this explosion that the Claymore platform stopped pumping oil. [...] Personnel still left alive were either desperately sheltering in the scorched, smoke-filled accommodation block or leaping from the various <b>deck</b> <b>levels,</b> including the helideck, [...] into the North Sea. The explosion also killed two crewmen on a fast rescue boat launched from the standby vessel Sandhaven and the six Piper Alpha crewmen they had rescued from the water.|$|R
