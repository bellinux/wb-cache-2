2500|$|In England, urban middle-class {{pressure}} {{for a commercial}} curriculum was often supported by the school's trustees (who would charge the new students fees), but resisted by the schoolmaster, supported {{by the terms of}} the original endowment. Very few schools were able to obtain special acts of Parliament to change their statutes; examples are the Macclesfield Grammar School Act 1774 and the Bolton Grammar School Act 1788. Such a dispute between the trustees and master of Leeds Grammar School led to a celebrated case in the Court of Chancery. After 10 years, Lord Eldon, then Lord Chancellor, ruled in 1805, [...] "There is no authority for thus changing the nature of the Charity, and filling a School <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> of teaching Greek and Latin with Scholars learning the German and French languages, mathematics, and anything except Greek and Latin." [...] Although he offered a compromise by which some subjects might be added to a classical core, the ruling set a restrictive precedent for grammar schools across England; they seemed to be in terminal decline. However it should be borne in mind that the decline of the grammar schools in England and Wales was not uniform and that until the foundation of St Bees Clerical College, in 1817, and St David's College Lampeter, in 1828, specialist grammar schools in the north-west of England and South Wales were in effect providing tertiary education to men in their late teens and early twenties, which enabled them to be ordained as Anglican clergymen without going to university.|$|E
2500|$|In her Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven, Uta Ranke-Heinemann {{says that}} three discussions of {{marriage}} in the New Testament (Matthew 19, I Corinthians 7, and Ephesians 5:22-32) do not refer to generating children, which later became consistently emphasized in Catholic moral doctrine as {{the primary purpose of}} sexual relations, although, according to her, those texts does not indicate that conceiving children is excluded in marriage. The view that marriage is primarily <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> of procreation dominated early Christianity, and held by many Church Fathers. During the entire Middle Ages, the question of when intercourse was allowed and when it was not, was very important. Intercourse was prohibited on all Sundays and all the many feast days, as well as the 20 days before Christmas, the 40 days before Easter, and often the 20 days before Pentecost, as well as three or more days before receiving Communion (which at that time was offered only a few times a year). These forbidden days altogether totaled about 40% of each year. Some church leaders warned believers that children conceived on holy days would be born leprous, epileptic, diabolically possessed, or crippled. Penalties of 20 to 40 days of strict fasting on bread and water were imposed on transgressors. Intercourse was forbidden during the menstrual period and after childbirth, since [...] "physicians mistakenly believed that the blood of a menstruating woman or one who has just given birth was poisonous". It was also forbidden during pregnancy, with concern for protecting the fetus as the main reason. [...] "Christian theologians", including Pope Gregory I, held that abstinence should continue until a baby was weaned.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} {{the subject of}} automatic evolutionary sound matching: systems in which evolutionary algorithms are used to automatically derive the parameters of a synthesiser to produce a sound that matches a specified target sound. The paper describes prior work and identifies the principal causes of match inaccuracy, which are often due to optimiser limitations {{as a result of}} search space problem difficulty. The components of evolutionary matching systems contributing to problem difficulty are discussed and suggestions as to how improvements can be made through problem simplification or optimiser sophistication are considered. Subsequently, a novel clustering evolution strategy is presented which enables the concurrent optimisation of multiple distinct search space solutions, <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> of sound matching with standard frequency modulation (FM) synthesisers. The algorithm is shown to outperform standard multi-membered and multi-start (1 ? 1) evolution strategies in application to different FM synthesis models for static and dynamic sounds. The comparative study makes use of a contrived matching method, which ensures that results are not affected by the limitations of the matching synthesiser. ...|$|R
