Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period. For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the <b>factors</b> <b>influencing</b> sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the <b>factors</b> <b>influencing</b> its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The major <b>factors</b> <b>influencing</b> diving safety are the environment, {{the diving}} {{equipment}} {{and the performance of}} the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{relatively}} little {{was known about}} the biology of the Chittenango ovate amber snail. Studies by investigators at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) since 1981 {{have contributed to the}} base of knowledge about the biology and life history of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Aloi (1985) analyzed the population dynamics of the succineid snails at Chittenango Falls. Thomee (1986) investigated their behavioral ecology, and Molloy and Norton (1993) developed techniques for captive propagation. Molloy (1995) reported on the captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and associated field studies related to <b>factors</b> <b>influencing</b> the distribution of Succinea sp. B. Confusion on snail identification may have affected the results of Thomee's and Aloi's work, but by the time Molloy's study was initiated, the identification problems had been resolved.|$|E

40|$|Aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{are influenced by}} physical, chemical, and biological processes operating at multiple spatial scales, from landscape through microhabitats. Processes operating at the landscape level, such as watershed land use or precipitation, are external <b>factors</b> that <b>influence</b> an aquatic ecosystem. Internal factors are processes operating on an aquatic ecosystem from within the system, such as habitat. I explored how external and internal <b>factors</b> <b>influenced</b> fish community structure and function in Lake Ontario embayments. With my research, I aimed to address the following questions: (1) which internal and external <b>factors</b> <b>influence</b> how much and where biomass is distributed in the fish community (i. e., structure); (2) which <b>factors</b> <b>influence</b> energy sources utilized by the fish communities (i. e., function); (3) are structural and functional responses related to each other? Structural characteristics responded to both external and internal factors. Biomass increased with phosphorus loading (external factor) and area (internal factor), whereas abundance increased and size structure decreased with percent vegetation (internal factor).

The political repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos.

25|$|Gapes of {{juvenile}} altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, {{and these are}} believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on this, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the nest. Some species, especially in the families Viduidae and Estrildidae, have bright spots on the gape known as gape tubercles or gape papillae. These nodular spots are conspicuous even in low light. A study examining the nestling gapes of eight passerine species found that the gapes were conspicuous in the ultraviolet spectrum (visible to birds but not to humans). Parents may, however, not rely solely on the gape coloration, and other <b>factors</b> <b>influencing</b> their decision remain unknown.|$|E
