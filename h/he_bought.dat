5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. <b>He</b> <b>bought</b> a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when {{growing up in the}} 1970s, and thought it would be an interesting addition to the group's sound. <b>He</b> <b>bought</b> a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.|$|E
