40|$|Following the {{development}} of large-scale use of biomass energy in the EU, international biofuel trade is a plausible scenario and something that is already taking place in Northern Europe. This paper focuses on Swedish biofuel imports, both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>imports,</b> the latter which derive {{from the fact that}} part of the imported pulpwood and timber end up as fuel. The objective is to describe the biomass import flows, the actors involved and analyse the fundamental drivers for the trade flows. The rapid expansion of biomass energy, that has taken place in district heating since the early 1990 s in Sweden, has been met partly by imports. The direct biofuel import was estimated to 18 PJ for 2000, which corresponded to 26 % of the biofuel supply in district heating. The total indirect biofuel import was estimated to 9 PJ of which 5. 5 PJ is consumed in the district heating sector. Sawmill wood chips, decay-damaged stemwood and pellets are imported from Estonia and Latvia, whereas used wood and solid recovered fuels are imported from Germany and the Netherlands. Tall oil and pellets are imported from North America. Key factors related to the Swedish biofuel import are analysed, both from the view of Swedish demand and from the view of supply in the Baltic countries as well as supply from Germany or the Netherlands. National differences in energy policy are perhaps the most important driving force behind the seemingly strange trade flows. Structures in the different national energy systems are also discussed as well as the transformation process that has taken place in the forest sector in the Baltic countries...|$|E
40|$|Consumption-based {{emissions}} from international trade are substantial, {{but are not}} reported to the UNFCCC. In this master thesis, we have analysed the relationship between individual expenditure and the consumption-based carbon footprint in 2012, using a two-region model to account for trade. Total average per capita emissions is 10 tonnes CO 2, and <b>indirect</b> <b>imported</b> emissions accounts for 43 % of the total carbon footprint. The carbon elasticity in Norway is likely above one, as our results indicate that it is 1. 19. More specifically 1. 37 for <b>indirect</b> <b>imported</b> emissions, 1. 09 for indirect domestic emissions and 1. 1 for direct emissions. In other words, the relationship between consumption-based emissions and expenditure are increasing at the margin. Therefore, carbon emission is a luxury good, and a tax would be progressive. The cause {{appears to be the}} cheap, clean electricity in Norway. Reviewing the literature to assess unilateral policy options, we find a broad consensus in favor of a carbon tax. However, as the estimates for the current social cost of carbon ranges from 12 USD/tonne CO 2 to 900, setting a tax level is dicult. Implementing a carbon tax unilaterally also demands a border carbon adjustment (BCA) to protect the exposed industry, and avoid carbon leakage. The empirical results indicate that this is not particularly e↵ective. Levying the tax upstream would be preferred, but is impossible with most imported goods. Generalized emission intensities for product categories can be utilized, but will create adverse incentives and perhaps increase global emissions. More accurate estimates would help, but increase costs and complexity. Challenges aside, Norway are all but dependent on the e↵orts of other, larger nations, if we are to avoid potential damages to our economy caused by climate change. Setting an example for others to follow may {{be the only way to}} achieve this, and we should therefore start to pursue unilateral e↵orts in the product categories that yields the most reductions...|$|R

The information content of the import dependency matrix is expanded by information on domestic sectors (destination) which demand intermediate imports. Calculations reveal some interesting features of import dependency in Turkey, namely that policy sectors mostly coincide with destination sectors, that oil refinery emerges as a leading destination sector for all, and that raw petroleum is a leading origin sector.

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the current situation}} of solid and liquid biomass fuels in Finland. The fact that industry consumes {{more than half of}} the total primary energy, widely applied combined heat and power production and a high share of solid biomass fuels in the total energy consumption are specific to the Finnish energy system. Wood is the most important source of bioenergy in Finland, representing 20 % of the total energy consumption in 2007. Almost 80 % of the woodbased energy is recovered from industrial by-products and residues. As a member of the European Union, Finland has committed itself to the Union’s climate and energy targets, such as reducing its overall emissions of green house gases to at least 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020, and increasing the share of renewable energy in the gross final consumption. The renewable energy target approved for Finland is 38 %. The present National Climate and Energy Strategy was introduced in November 2008. The strategy covers climate and energy policy measures up to 2020, and in brief thereafter, up to 2050. In recent years, the actual emissions have exceeded the Kyoto commitment and the trend of emissions is on the increase. In 2007, the share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption was approximately 25 % (360 PJ). Without new energy policy measures, the final consumption of renewable energy would increase to 380 PJ, which would be approximately only 31 % of the final energy consumption. In addition, green house gas emissions would exceed the 1990 levels by 20 %. Meeting the targets will need the adoption of more active energy policy measures in coming years. The international trade of biomass fuels has a substantial importance for the utilisation of bioenergy in Finland. In 2007, the total international trading of solid and liquid biomass fuels was approximately 77 PJ, of which import was 62 PJ. Most of the <b>import</b> is <b>indirect</b> and takes place within the forest industry’s raw wood imports. In 2007, as much as 21 % of wood energy was based on foreign-origin wood. Wood pellets and tall oil form the majority of export streams of biomass fuels. The <b>indirect</b> <b>import</b> of wood fuels peaked in 2006 to 61 PJ. The foreseeable decline in raw wood import to Finland will decrease the <b>indirect</b> <b>import</b> of wood fuels.

In 2006 the intensity of international off-shoring was quite similar in the two countries, although slightly higher for Italian firms when only manufacturing was considered.

During {{the first years of the}} past decade the off-shoring intensity of the two economies stagnated, but in the last period under study (2004 - 06) their growth resumed at a fast pace, especially in Italy.

The new challenges posed by globalisation, by the diffusion of information and communication technologies, and by the adoption of the euro have induced the most dynamic Italian firms to rethink their organisation, including their degree of vertical specialisation.

Wood is the most important source of bioenergy in Finland, representing 21 % of the total energy consumption in 2006. Almost 80 % of the wood-based energy is recovered from industrial by-products and residues. Finland has commitment itself to maintaining its greenhouse gas emissions at the 1990 level, at the highest, during the period 2008 – 2012. The energy and climate policy carried out in recent years has been based on the National Energy and Climate introduced in 2005. The Finnish energy policy aims to achieve the target, and a variety of measures are taken to promote the use of renewable energy sources and especially wood fuels. In 2007, the government started to prepare a new long-term (up to the year 2050) climate and energy strategy that will meet EU’s new targets for the reduction of green house gas emissions and the promotion of renewable energy sources.

We provide empirical evidence on the direct and indirect channels via which importing more varieties of intermediate inputs increases export scope: (1) imported inputs may enhance productivity and thereby help the firm to overcome export fixed costs (the indirect productivity channel); (2) low-priced imported inputs may boost expected export revenue (the direct-cost channel); and (3) importing intermediate inputs may reduce export fixed costs by providing the quality/technology required in demanding export markets (the quality/technology channel). We use firm-level data on imports at the product (HS 6) level provided by French Customs for the 1996 – 2005 period, and distinguish the origin of imported inputs (developing vs. developed countries) in order to disentangle the different productivity channels above.
