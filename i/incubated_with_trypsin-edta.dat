40|$|We {{report on}} a three {{dimensional}} (3 D) -organotypic culture in vitro for selective growth and expansion of human corneal epithelial stem cells. Limbal corneal explants were cultured on porous collagen sponges submerged in Epilife medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum. The fragments were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression and distribution of a spectrum of corneal epithelium markers: p 63, CK- 19, CK- 3, Ki- 67, pan-cytokeratins and vimentin. Early in culture the epithelium began to exfoliate losing its differentiated high-zone layers into the medium, maintaining only basal and few parabasal cells (mostly both p 63 and CK- 19 positive), which had remained attached to the specimen. After 14 days a new epithelium was formed displaying an increasing prominence of basal and suprabasal cells that, sliding onto the whole explant, showed the tendency to underlay stromal tissue and infiltrate into the underlaying sponge. After 21 days, sponge and fragments were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> <b>trypsin-EDTA</b> and dispersed epithelial cells were pipetted on a feeder monolayer of mitomycin-c-treated murine NIH. 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Colonies of undifferentiated epithelial cells (p 63, CK- 19 and Ki- 67 positive, CK- 3 negative) were obtained: their cells, if seeded onto a collagen matrix containing embedded primary human corneal fibroblasts as feeder, provided the basic building blocks for reconstructing in vitro a 3 D-multilayered corneal epithelium...|$|E

To demonstrate the peptides’ binding affinity, the cells (3 [*]×[*] 105) in each sample were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> biotinylated peptides in 50  μL of PBS containing 10  % FBS and 1  mM MnCl 2 for 30  min on ice.

To determine the relative binding affinity among different peptides, 0.4  μM of each non-biotinylated peptide including LXY 1 was separately mixed first with 0.5  μM biotinylated LXY 1. The mixture was then <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> cancer cells followed by streptavidin-PE.

The relative competition effect compared to LXY 1, named as relative binding index (RBI), was evaluated with the following formulation: (MFI of positive control−MFI of the sample)/(MFI of positive control−MFI of LXY 1), where the positive control was 0.5  μM biotinylated LXY 1 only without competition. For blocking experiments, the samples were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> non-biotinylated LXY 30, anti-α 3, or anti-β 1 antibody for 30  min prior to incubation with 20  nM biotinylated LXY 30.

A chicken macrophage-cell line (HD 11) that rapidly accretes incremental amounts of MT when stimulated with increasing concentrations of Zn 2 + or Cd 2 + was studied. The maximum rate of MT accretion occurred at 50 microM-Zn 2 + or 20 microM-Cd 2 +. The absolute rate of MT accretion was less in macrophages <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> 25 microM- as compared with 50 microM-Zn 2 +, owing to decreased and increased rates of MT synthesis and degradation respectively. The absolute rate of MT accretion was less in macrophages <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> 10 microM- as compared with 20 microM-Cd 2 +, owing to a decreased rate of MT synthesis with no change in degradation. Compared <b>with</b> macrophages continually <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> 50 microM-Zn 2 +, removal of Zn 2 + from medium previously containing 50 microM-Zn 2 + decreased the absolute rate of MT accretion, owing to decreased and increased rates of MT synthesis and degradation respectively. Removal of Cd 2 + from medium previously containing 20 microM-Cd 2 + also decreased the absolute rate of MT accretion in macrophages. Unlike Zn 2 + removal, the decrease in MT accretion was due to a decreased rate of MT synthesis with no change in degradation.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of isolation and culture of PGCs from various tissues of chicken embryos at specific developmental stages including: the circulating blood of stage 14 embryos (hatched for 48 - 52 hrs), the genital ridge of stage 19 embryos (hatched for 68 - 72 hrs) and the gonad of stage 28 embryos (hatched for 128 - 132 hrs). Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation is a standard method for the purification of PGCs from fetal blood. The genital ridge and gonadal tissue contain more PGCs in total but must first be digested <b>with</b> <b>trypsin-EDTA</b> to give a single cell suspension containing a mixture of PGCs and other contaminating cell types. In these experiments, we cultured PGCs from the genital ridge and from gonadal tissue before and after Ficoll density-gradient purification. In all cases, PGCs were subsequently cultured in TCM- 199 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum. The results demonstrated that trypsin-EDTA alone of the genital ridge of stage 19 embryos yielded a total of 2. 7 × 104 per embryo of which 89. 5 % were viable. After Ficoll density-gradient purification of these cells the yield was 1. 8 × 104 of which 87. 5 % were viable. Processing of the gonadal tissue of stage 28 embryos yielded a total of 3. 1 × 104 PGCs per embryo of which 90. 0 % were viable. It was clear that the PGC yield <b>with</b> <b>trypsin-EDTA</b> alone was higher (P< 0. 01) than the yield of the full procedure which included the Ficoll density-gradient purification step. The results of PGC culture from the three developmental stages indicated that the survival time was longest (80...|$|R
