40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} randomised controlled trials (RCTs) {{published in}} the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health and to explore the contribution of these to the evaluation of public health issues. DESIGN: <b>Hand</b> <b>searching</b> of the journal by both authors with independent assessment of topics of the reports and of their relevance to the Cochrane Collaboration. Agreement was assessed using kappa scores. SETTING: All papers and letters {{published in the}} journal from the first issue to the end of 1994. SUBJECTS: Reports that might be RCTs were collected and classified into seven categories: definitely/probably/possibly RCTs or quasi-RCTs; or none of these. MAIN RESULTS: Eighty two definite RCTs were identified and a further 23 were probably/possibly RCTs or quasi-RCTs. Most reports dealt with health education, drug treatments, or "other" health service interventions. Both authors failed to identify a number of trials on <b>hand</b> <b>searching.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The journal has published many trials of importance to the development of evidence-based public health policy. <b>Hand</b> <b>searching</b> may need to be done independently by more than one person...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{interest}} in prognostic reviews is increasing, but to properly review existing evidence an accurate search filer for finding prediction research is needed. The {{aim of this}} paper was to validate and update two previously introduced search filters for finding prediction research in Medline: the Ingui filter and the Haynes Broad filter. Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on a <b>hand</b> <b>search</b> of 6 general journals in 2008 we constructed two sets of papers. Set 1 consisted of prediction research papers (n = 71), and set 2 consisted of the remaining papers (n = 1133). Both search filters were validated in two ways, using diagnostic accuracy measures as performance measures. First, we compared studies in set 1 (reference) with studies retrieved by the search strategies as applied in Medline. Second, we compared studies from 4 published systematic reviews (reference) with studies retrieved by the search filter as applied in Medline. Next – using word frequency methods – we constructed an additional search string for finding prediction research. Both search filters were good in identifying clinical prediction models: sensitivity ranged from 0. 94 to 1. 0 using our <b>hand</b> <b>search</b> as reference, and 0. 78 to 0. 89 using the systematic reviews as reference. This latter performance measure even increased to around 0. 95 (range 0. 90 to 0. 97) when either search filter was combined with the additional string that we developed. Retrieval rate of explorative prediction research was poor, both using our <b>hand</b> <b>search</b> or our systematic review as reference, and even combined with our additional search string: sensitivity ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 85...|$|E

40|$|Geomalacus maculosus is a slug species {{protected}} under EU law with a distribution {{limited to the}} west of Ireland and north-west Iberia. The species, originally thought to be limited within Ireland to deciduous woodland and peatland, has been found in a number of commercial conifer plantations since 2010. While forest managers are now required to incorporate the protection of the species where it is present, no clear species monitoring protocols are currently available. This study examines the efficacy of De Sangosse refuge traps across three habitats frequently associated with commercial forest plantations in Ireland and compares them with <b>hand</b> <b>searching,</b> a commonly used method for slug monitoring. Catch data during different seasons and under different weather conditions are also presented. Results indicate that autumn is the optimal time for sampling G. maculosus but avoiding extremes of hot or cold weather. While refuge traps placed at 1. 5  m on trees in mature conifer plantations and directly on exposed rock in blanket peatlands result in significantly greater catches, <b>hand</b> <b>searching</b> is the most successful approach for clear-fell areas. <b>Hand</b> <b>searches</b> in clear-fell preceded by rain are likely to result in greater numbers caught.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Force {{application}} to a tooth during orthodontic treatment evokes a biological {{response of the}} dental pulp. The aim of this systematic literature review {{was to investigate the}} relationship between orthodontic force level and pulp reaction in humans. METHODS: Electronic search was made of publications in PubMed/old MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library (DARE, CENTRAL) until July 21, 2012. <b>Hand</b> <b>search</b> was made of publications before 1954 and the most recent ones in main dental and orthodontic journals. Additional studies were identified by <b>hand</b> <b>search</b> of reference lists of relevant articles from both the electronic and hand searches. Search terms included biomechanics, force, orthodontic*, tooth movement, dental pulp, and pulpal reaction. Two independent observers assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted the data, applied quality indicators, and graded level of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies matched the inclusion criteria. The outcomes concerned histologic and cell biological parameters after orthodontic tooth movement in 19 studies and pulpal blood flow in 5 studies. The methodologic quality of most studies was graded moderate to low. CONCLUSIONS: Because of a lack of high-quality studies there is no conclusive scientific evidence for a relation between force level and dental pulp tissue reaction in humans. There is contradictory scientific support for a force-dependent reduction of blood flow...|$|E
