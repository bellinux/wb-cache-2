40|$|Abstract: Improving forage {{production}} for an expanding livestock population {{is essential in}} the Çukurova and GAP (South-eastern Anatolia Project) regions of Turkey. Feed shortages, especially evident during winter, can be alleviated by introducing high yielding common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) cultivars into crop rotations. The objectives of this research were to determine the genotype × environment interactions and stability parameters for <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> of 15 vetch lines and cultivars. The vetch genotypes were evaluated in the Çukurova (2 locations for 3 years) and South-eastern Anatolia (1 location for 2 years) regions. In the South-eastern Anatolia region, the rainfall limits plant growth, while the Çukurova region has much better soil and climatic conditions. Since local climatic variation is significant, each location in each year is treated as a separate environment, to give 8 environments. Linear regression techniques were used to analyse genotype × environment interactions (G × E). The <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> was significantly different between genotypes and environments, while a genotype × environment interaction was present. The variation amongst environments was highly significant, and the mean <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> ranged from 7453 kg ha- 1, in Doğankent (2002 - 03), to 2687 kg ha- 1, in Balcalı (2003 - 04).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The rapid {{expansion}} of animal production in the eastern U.

To address these environmental concerns for wastewater utilization, we installed a subsurface drip irrigation system to apply treated swine wastewater effluent for bermudagrass hay production. The overall study objective {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) for treated wastewater effluent applications. The specific objectives for the SDI system were to compare bermudagrass hay production using (1) commercial and wastewater effluent for nutrients, (2) two SDI lateral spacings (0. 6 and 1. 2 m) installed at 0. 3 m below the surface, and (3) two irrigation application rates based on calculated evapotranspiration (ETc) requirements (75 % or 100 %). The two‐year study measured <b>hay</b> <b>yields,</b> <b>hay</b> biomass, soil nutrients, and soil water nutrients.

40|$|This {{section is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of climate on various aspects of agriculture in Iceland. As discussed in the preceding section, grass growth and <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> is of fundamental importance in Icelandic farming. Because of this the greater part of this chapter is devoted to the impact of climate on <b>hay</b> <b>yield.</b> A related concern for the farmers is the impact of climate on the winter and summer grazing of animals. The farmers are thus affected by two related problems: poor <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> after cool seasons and increased need for fodder in severe winters. These two conditions often occur together, and the cumulative effect of a cold winter can be that farmers are faced in the summer with unusually little grass growth, when the fodder consumption in the preceding winter has been especially heavy. To compound matters, such severe years often tend to occur in clusters. An additional limiting factor is the carrying capacity of the summer pastures. In this respect it is therefore advisable to restrict livestock grazing to the carrying capacity of the coldest periods that can be expected in the climatic era. The question of how best to react to climatic impacts in order to avoid fluctuations in livestock numbers is also discussed. Finally, in Subsection 2. 7, it is shown that present conditions for growing trees and cereal crops are marginal in Iceland. Their sensitivity to climate and their growth under different climatic conditions are estimated here in terms of the percentage area in Iceland suitable for their growth...|$|E

Across the two zones, irrigation at 80 % ETc resulted in the highest mean hay yields in first and second harvests (7. 58 and 8. 77 t ha- 1, respectively), while irrigation at 60 % ETc resulted in highest <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> in the third harvest (8. 59 t ha- 1). By increasing the nitrogen level from 240 to 480 kg ha- 1, the cumulative <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> of the three harvests was increased from 21. 70 to 22. 18 t ha- 1 (i. e. increase of 2. 21 %) in MZ- 1 and from 22. 75 to 25. 38 t ha- 1 (i. e. increase of 11. 56 %) in MZ- 2, indicating the benefit of VRA of fertilizer nitrogen. Rhodes grass showed differential response to various combinations of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen levels. A combination of I 2 -F 2 resulted in the highest cumulative Rhodes grass <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> in both MZ- 1 (24. 70 t ha- 1) and MZ- 2 (27. 78 t ha- 1). Precision fertigation, involving deficit irrigation at 80 % ETc and adopting VRA technology for fertilizer application can be beneficial strategy for enhancing water and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency for optimal Rhodes grass production. © 2016, University of Agriculture.

40|$|In this study, {{the number}} of {{chromosome}} was determined in the wild ecotypes of Festuca ovina ssp., collected from five different natural pasture locations in Erzurum (Eastern Turkey). As a result of examinations, {{it was determined that}} the plants collected from Ispir town were diploid (2 n= 14), the plants from Tuzcu village, Koprukoy town and Uzundere town were tetraploid (2 n= 28) and those from the pasture of Ataturk University in Erzurum city were hexaploid (2 n= 42). There were no aneuploid plants in the collected ecotypes. The ecotypes (Ispir, Uzundere and University) of 3 various locations with different ploidy types were cultivated in the field for 2 years. During the cultivation period, the plant height, <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> and plant crude protein content and yield were determined during various cutting times for each of the ecotypes. Evaluations were made according to the means of two years. Plant height (15. 67 - 55. 05 cm), fresh <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> (22. 71 - 65. 52 g plant - 1) and dry <b>hay</b> <b>yield</b> (9. 12 - 31. 54 g plant - 1) and protein yield (1. 49 - 3. 47 g plant - 1) significantly increased until the cutting time of 16 June and the subsequent cutting reduced yield after this date. The crude protein content (7. 74 - 16. 42 %) reduced as the cutting time was delayed. The maximum plant yield for the hexaploid plants was reached at the end of May while the maximum plant yield for diploid and tetraploid plants {{was at the end of}} June. The effect of ploidy type was significant on plant height and crude protein content. The diploid ecotypes had longest plant height (40. 37 cm) and the highest crude protein content (12. 99 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Five alfalfa {{varieties}} (CUF 101, SW 14, SW 8210, Pioneer 5888, and a grower selection {{primarily from}} CUF 101 and noted as Baldwin Select) were planted in October, 1994, into large plots (0. 75 acres) to obtain actual field harvest data. Eight harvests were taken during 1995, and seven thus far in 1996. Varietal <b>hay</b> <b>yields</b> {{were very similar}} in 1995 until mid summer, when area soil temperatures reached above 100 °F at the four inch depth {{for a period of}} about 6 weeks. During the summer months of both years Baldwin Select significantly outyielded other varieties tested. Statistical differences in accumulated <b>hay</b> <b>yields</b> were noted beginning in August 1995 and have continued during 1996. Baldwin Select was the highest yielding variety during 1995 (103. 3 % of CUF 101), followed by CUF 101 and Pioneer 5888, both which averaged 1. 16 tons /acre per harvest. SW 14 and SW 8210 yielded about 550 total lbs /acre less than CUF 101 during 1995. Baldwin Select has also been the highest yielding variety in 1996 thus far, yielding 113. 6 % of CUF 101. SW 8210 has been second (107. 6 % of CUF 101), followed by SW 14 (102. 7 % of CUF 101), with CUF 101 and Pioneer 5888 again being almost equal in yield at 1. 14 tons /acre per harvest. For 1995 - 1996 combined, Baldwin Select has yielded 108. 2 % of CUF 101, followed by SW 8210 (101. 9 % of CUF 101). CUF 101, Pioneer 5888 and SW 14 are very similar in overall tonnage. Alfalfa varieties have been very similar in relative feed value when tested. Yellowing from Empoasca spp. leafhoppers was greatest during the 1995 - 1996 winter on varieties with fall dormancy ratings of 9 or greater. Baldwin Select has yielded $ 121 /acre more hay than CUF 101, and SW 8210 has yielded $ 44 /acre more hay than CUF 101 thus far in this trial...|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa {{irrigation}} {{is often}} withheld as a water conservation measure in Arizona. The {{objective of this}} research was to test the hypothesis that alfalfa can be permanently damaged by withholding irrigation water. Irrigation was terminated during the summer (July or August through September) or summer through winter (July or August through mid -March) on a Casa Grande sandy loam at Maricopa. Irrigation termination at Maricopa was not detrimental to stand although <b>hay</b> <b>yields</b> were depressed from 1. 47 to 1. 28 tons per acre following the second cycle of summer irrigation termination and from 1. 57 to 1. 23 tons per acre per cutting following summer through winter irrigation termination. Alfalfa water use was reduced by irrigation termination even after irrigation was resumed. Total nonstructural carbohydrates in the roots were never less than the control during irrigation termination but decreased relative to normally irrigated alfalfa when irrigation resumed...|$|R
