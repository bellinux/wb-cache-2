The high oak stool stood in its usual place beside the engraving desk, upon which lay old Deleglise's last unfinished <b>plate,</b> <b>emitting</b> a dull red glow. I paced the creaking boards with halting steps, as through some ghostly gallery hung with dim portraits of the dead and living.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) of turbulent {{thermal convection}} in a PrD 0 : 7 fluid up to RaD 1012 {{are used to}} study the statistics of thermal plumes. At various vertical locations in a cylindrical set-up with aspect ratio D width=height D 1 = 3, plumes are identified and their properties extracted. It is found that plumes are {{much less likely to}} be <b>emitted</b> from <b>plate</b> regions with large wind shear. Close to the plates, the plumes have a unimodal log–normal distribution, whereas at more central locations the distribution becomes weakly bimodal, which {{can be traced back to}} clustering of the plumes and influence of the large-scale circulation. The number of hot plumes decreases with height. The width of the plumes scales with Ra approximately as Nu indicating that it is determined by the thermal boundary layer thickness...|$|R
50|$|Security can be {{improved}} by electronic license plates because they can reduce {{the chances of a}} criminal fleeing a scene if a vehicle is in an accident or associated with a crime. In these situations, the <b>plate</b> would <b>emit</b> a signal of collision or crime, directly identifying the vehicle's involvement. If not identified at the scene, the license plate holds it in memory and displays a digital alert. Surveillance also benefits from this advanced technology because the electronic license <b>plate</b> <b>emits</b> a clear signal captured by surveillance equipment instead of a distorted image.|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} method {{for determining the}} temperature profile over the thickness of a semi-transparent plate has been investigated. The method has been analysed for polycarbonate (CD), Philips 382 cone glass and Philips 441 screen glass. The method uses a non-contacting detector which measures the infrared radiation <b>emitted</b> by the <b>plate</b> at few wavelengths. In thermal processing, a parabolic temperature profile occurs typically during stationnary cooling and heating. The programs I've built optimize 3 wavelengths to determine such a parabolic temperature profile and calculate the most likely temperature parabola and its variance from future radiance measurements at those optimized 3 wavelengths...|$|R
50|$|Eugen Goldstein in 1876 {{found that}} cathode rays were always emitted {{perpendicular}} to the cathode's surface. If the cathode was a flat plate, the rays were shot out in straight lines {{perpendicular to the}} plane of the plate. This was evidence that they were particles, because a luminous object, like a red hot metal <b>plate,</b> <b>emits</b> light in all directions, while a charged particle will be repelled by the cathode in a perpendicular direction. If the electrode was made {{in the form of a}} concave spherical dish, the cathode rays would be focused to a spot in front of the dish. This could be used to heat samples to a high temperature.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of a {{lightweight}} piezoelectric transducer is proposed for selective excitation of horizontal polarized shear (SH) waves. Based on piezoelectric fibers the transducers are flexible, i. e. show structure conformity. The novel approach allows to introduce significant surface tractions by a transducer with double layer crossed fiber arrangement without the need of heavy seismic masses. The transducer operating principles are explained {{and the performance of}} a first transducer version is demonstrated by laser vibrometric measuring of the waves <b>emitted</b> into a <b>plate.</b> Numerical modeling of the identical arrangement shows nearly perfect agreement with measurements for the main features while differences in some details helps to understand how the first transducer version can be improved. The transducer exhibits, depending on its aspect ratio, a rather high directivity and a strong mode selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{stabilization}} of a HeNe laser {{can be accomplished}} by the use of a randomly polarized laser. A laser without the Brewster <b>plates</b> <b>emits</b> light whose polarization varies with time. This variation in polarization can be used to provide feedback signal to stabilize the frequency of the laser to less than the Doppler width of the atomic neon transition. The laser undergoes thermal eXpansion that changes the frequencies of the longitudinal cavity modes, which are known to be of opposite linear polarization. By controlling the temperature around the tube, the tube length of the laser can be controlled, thus a stable polarization of the light can be maintained and therefore a stable distribution of longitudinal modes.

40|$|The {{motion of}} dislocations in {{response}} to stress dictates the mechanical behaviour of materials. However, {{it is not yet}} possible to directly observe dislocation motion experimentally at the atomic level. Here, we present the first observations of the long-hypothesized kink-pair mechanism in action using atomistic simulations of dislocation motion in iron. In a striking deviation from the classical picture, dislocation motion at high strain rates becomes rough, resulting in spontaneous self-pinning and production of large quantities of debris. Then, at still higher strain rates, the dislocation stops abruptly and <b>emits</b> a twin <b>plate</b> that immediately takes over as the dominant mode of plastic deformation. These observations challenge the applicability of the Peierls threshold concept to the three-dimensional motion of screw dislocations at high strain rates, and suggest a new interpretation of plastic strength and microstructure of shocked metals...|$|R
40|$|A {{spectrometer}} system {{includes an}} array of micro-zone plates (MZP) each having coaxially-aligned ring gratings, a sample plate for supporting and illuminating a sample, and {{an array of}} photon detectors for measuring a spectral characteristic of the predetermined wavelength. The sample <b>plate</b> <b>emits</b> an evanescent wave in response to incident light, which excites molecules of the sample to thereby cause an emission of secondary photons. A method of detecting the intensity of a selected wavelength of incident light includes directing the incident light onto an array of MZP, diffracting a selected wavelength of the incident light onto a target focal point using the array of MZP, and detecting the intensity of the selected portion using an array of photon detectors. An electro-optic layer positioned adjacent to the array of MZP may be excited via an applied voltage to select the wavelength of the incident light...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model to explain the {{decrease}} in the amplitude of the pulse profile with increasing energy observed in Geminga’s soft X-ray surface thermal emission. We assume the presence of plates surrounded by a surface with very distinct physical properties: these two regions emit spectra of very distinct shapes which present a crossover, the warm <b>plates</b> <b>emitting</b> a softer spectrum than the colder surrounding surface. The strongly pulsed emission from the plates dominates at low energy while the surroundings emission dominates at high energy, producing naturally a strong decrease in the pulsed fraction. In our illustrative example the plates {{are assumed to be}} magnetized {{while the rest of the}} surface is field free. This plate structure may be seen as a schematic representation of a continuous but very nonuniform distribution of the surface magnetic field or as a quasi realistic structure induced by past tectonic activity on Geminga.

40|$|When {{an x-ray}} beam of {{sufficient}} energy and intensity strikes a plated metal, it will excite a characteristic l ne of the substrate metal. Of the quanta excited, those properly oriented will pass through, or be absorbed by, the plating. As {{a consequence of}} the ab-sorption, x-rays will be <b>emitted</b> from the <b>plated</b> metal at intensities less than those cor-respondingly obtained from the unplated. This attenuation of x-rays can be used to measure plating thickness, as has been demonstrated for tin plate and an unresolved x-ray beam. In the present investigation, the attenuation by iron foil of a characteristic line from either silver or zirconium as substrate has been measured in a spectrograph rovided with a good collimator and with an analyzing crystal. The results, when corrected for back-ground, show that the exponential absorption law is followed closely. Furthermore, these results are in accord with the known mass absorption coefficients of iron, which in-creases confidence in the method. Comparison of this with other x-ray methods of determining film thickness indicates that its inherent advantages are great enough to warrant its extended application...|$|R
40|$|Recently, an {{acoustic}} waveguide sensor based on multiple mode conversion of {{surface acoustic waves}} at the solid—liquid interfaces has been introduced for the concentration measurement of binary and ternary mixtures, liquid level sensing, investigation of spatial inhomogenities or bubble detection. In this contribution the sound wave propagation within this acoustic waveguide sensor is visualized by Schlieren imaging for continuous and burst operation the first time. In the acoustic waveguide the antisymmetrical zero order Lamb wave mode is excited by a single phase transducer of 1 MHz on thin glass plates of 1 mm thickness. By contact to the investigated liquid Lamb waves propagating on the first <b>plate</b> <b>emit</b> pressure waves into the adjacent liquid, which excites Lamb waves on the second plate, what again causes pressure waves traveling inside the liquid {{back to the first}} plate and so on. The Schlieren images prove this multi reflection within the acoustic waveguide, which confirms former considerations and calculations based on the receiver signal. With this knowledge the sensor concepts with the acoustic waveguide sensor can be interpreted in a better manner...|$|R
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal <b>plate,</b> <b>emitting</b> bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|R
40|$|A {{possibility}} of a rigid flat plate that {{is placed in the}} wake of a square cylinder for a passive sound control is investigated numerically. The changes in the sound generation with gap distances are inspected at a Reynolds number of 150 and a Mach number of 0. 2 for a constant plate length of D. Two regimes that significantly effects the sound generation are identified. The first regime, i. e. pre-vortex regime, is for 0 G 2. 3 D and the second regime, i. e. post-vortex regime, is for 2. 4 D G 7 D. A sound reduction can be obtained in pre-vortex regime, where about 2. 9 dB sound reduction is obtained when there is no gap between the two bodies. Contrary, at least an increase 8. 0 dB sound level is <b>emitted</b> when the <b>plate</b> is placed in the post-vortex regime. Despite of that, a 6. 3 dB sound reduction is obtained when the plate length is reduced to 0. 26 D and placed at 5. 6 D downstream of the cylinder. The sound reduction is limited by the deformation in the sinusoidal signal of the plate due to the unsteady plate stall process...|$|R
5000|$|A pentode is an {{electronic}} device having five active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying vacuum tube (thermionic valve), which {{was invented by}} Gilles Holst and Bernhard D.H. Tellegen in 1926. [...] The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a cathode heated by a filament, a control grid, a screen grid, a suppressor grid, and a plate (anode). The pentode (called a [...] "triple-grid amplifier" [...] in some early literature) was developed from the tetrode tube {{by the addition of}} a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent secondary emission electrons <b>emitted</b> by the <b>plate</b> from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and parasitic oscillations in the tetrode. The pentode is closely related to the beam tetrode. Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio devices.|$|R

40|$|Today's {{textbooks}} of electromagnetism {{give the}} particular solution to Maxwell's equations involving the integral over the charge and current sources at retarded times. However, the texts fail {{to emphasize the}} role played by the choice of the boundary conditions corresponding to solutions of the homogeneous Maxwell equations. Here we discuss the role of these boundary conditions for an experimenter with a hypothetical charged harmonic oscillator as his equipment. We describe the observations of the experimenter when located near a radio station or immersed in thermal radiation at temperature T. The classical physicists {{at the end of the}} 19 th century chose the homogeneous boundary conditions for Maxwell's equation based upon the experimental observations of Lummer and Pringsheim which measured only the thermal radiation which exceeded the random radiation surrounding their measuring equipment. Today at the beginning of the 21 st century, classical physicists must choose the homogeneous boundary conditions for Maxell's equations to correspond to the full radiation spectrum revealed by the recent Casimir force measurements which detect all the radiation surrounding conducting parallel plates, including the radiation absorbed and <b>emitted</b> by the <b>plates</b> themselves. The random classical radiation spectrum revealed by the Casimir force measurements includes electromagnetic zero-point radiation, which is missing from the spectrum measured by Lummer and Pringsheim, and which cannot be eliminated by going to zero temperature. This zero-point radiation will lead to zero-point energy for all systems which have electromagnetic interactions. Thus the choice of the boundary conditions on the homogeneous Maxwell equations is intimately related to the ideas of zero-point energy and non-radiating ground states which are introduced in classes of modern physics.

40|$|The {{emitting}} {{properties of}} different building materials are obtained by measurements in environmental chambers {{of a few}} established designs. In order {{to interpret the results}} from the measurements and to predict the influence on the indoor environment, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the parameters governing the emission process. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to this understanding by focusing on the process of emission of chemicals from building materials and on the influence of a number of parameters governing the process. In emission studies reported in the literature, few investigations deal with the comparison of the VOC emission rates obtained by measurements in different test chambers. In the present study, a 1 m 3 -chamber, a CLIMPAQ and a FLEC were used for measurement of the concentrations of various compounds from surface coatings. The study focuses on parameters which could be considered to have a substantial influence on the emission rates, or which do not appear to have been thoroughly studied previously. Interest has mainly been focused on the influence of air velocity, airflow rate and sorption on the emission rate, when other parameters have been maintained constant. It was found that during the first 24 hours, by varying the airflow rate under given test conditions in a test chamber, a number of physical parameters have a direct influence on the emission process. From the start of the test until steady state has been reached, the measured concentration variations may be divided into three different phases. The results from measurements showed that the higher the airflow rates, the faster a steady state was attained. Furthermore, all the selected substances did not reach steady state at the same time during the experiments. The effect of the air velocity above the surface on the emission of VOCs was studied in the three mentioned environmental chambers. It was found that the emission rates of the compounds at 22, 23 and 24 hours after the start of the test systematically increase with increasing air velocity. It was possible to determine the magnitude of increase to 10 - 20 %. However, it was difficult to determine the exact level of increase of the emission rate, due to the uncertainty of the measurements and the low levels of increase. Finally, the characterisation of adsorption of VOCs {{on the inside of the}} empty chambers has been studied. The experimental studies for all three chambers show that the sorption of substances in the 1 m 3 -chamber was slightly lower than in the FLEC. The CLIMPAQ shows a larger capacity of sorption with material specimens than without material specimens. This indicates that the gases <b>emitted</b> from painted <b>plates</b> adsorb again onto the test materials...|$|R
