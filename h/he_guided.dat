5|$|In 2013, Australian Paralympic Alpine Head Coach Steve Graham asked Geiger {{to replace}} Eric Bickerton as Jessica Gallagher's sighted guide.

5|$|Shaughnessy {{introduced}} to Tulane the Minnesota shift, an innovation created by his former coach Henry L. Williams. By 1919, Shaughnessy had transformed Tulane into a competitor amongst Southern collegiate teams. That season, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> {{them to a}} then school record of seven consecutive wins. In 1920, Germany Schulz was hired to take over duties as athletic director, and he also aided Shaughnessy as the line coach from 1923 to 1925.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

5|$|George Graham managed Millwall from 1983 to 1986, {{and during}} that time <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> the club to a Football League Group Cup win, beating Lincoln City 3–2 in the final in the 1982–83 season. The 1984–85 season was {{particularly}} successful, Millwall reached the FA Cup quarter-finals and gained promotion to the Second Division, going unbeaten at home again in Division Three, winning 18 games and drawing five. In the FA Cup they were beaten 1–0 by First Division Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. The match is remembered for all the wrong reasons, after hooligans rioted at the game. 81 people (including 31 police officers) were injured in the disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Graham was {{dismissed}} in February 1995, {{for bringing the}} club into disrepute over his transfer misconduct. He {{was found guilty of}} financial impropriety by a league investigation, leaving the board with no other choice but to terminate his contract. Stewart Houston came in as caretaker and revitalised the squad, taking Arsenal to the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. The Arsenal board subsequently hired Bruce Rioch, on a three-year deal in June 1995. Rioch's tenure lasted just 61 weeks and in his only season at the club, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> Arsenal to fifth position, which came with a UEFA Cup spot. Rioch was sacked in August 1996, amid reports of disagreements with vice-chairman David Dein.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, he left Florida {{and became}} the line coach under Ray Morrison at Temple. In 1942, he was {{appointed}} the {{head coach of the}} Temple basketball team. In 1944, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> the Owls to their first NCAA Tournament berth, reaching the Elite Eight. One of his clinics and games at Temple in 1947 drew several hundred players, coaches, and fans. He remained Temple's basketball coach until 1952—compiling a record of 124–103—and then became athletic director.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} season as York manager, 1983–84, he signed another former teammate, {{energetic}} midfielder Sean Haslegrave. Smith was named as the division's Manager of the Month for March 1984 after York won five and drew one of their six league matches. <b>He</b> <b>guided</b> York to the Fourth Division title and promotion into the Third Division, with Walwyn scoring 25 goals and earning {{a place in the}} PFA Team of the Year alongside strike partner John Byrne, who scored 27 goals. York finished with 101 points, 16 points ahead of runners-up Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2011, Nigel Pearson {{left the}} club to return to Leicester. Nick Barmby was {{appointed}} as his successor, but was sacked in May 2012 after publicly criticising the club's owners in an interview given to a local newspaper. In the same month, the club's consultancy agreement with Adam Pearson was terminated. On 8 June 2012, Steve Bruce was appointed manager of the club on a three-year deal, and <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> Hull back to the Premier League by drawing with League champions Cardiff City {{on the final day}} of the season.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 2015, Allardyce {{was named}} the new Sunderland manager, {{replacing}} Dick Advocaat. When Allardyce was appointed, Sunderland sat 19th in the Premier League table with three points from their first eight games of the season. Signing a two-year contract, {{he became the first}} manager to have managed both Newcastle United and Sunderland. On 25 October, in his second game as manager, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> Sunderland to a 3–0 win against rivals and his former club Newcastle United. However, after a run of 5 defeats in a row in December, Sunderland headed into {{the second half of the}} season in the relegation zone with only 12 points from 19 games.|$|E

5|$|Westley {{was forced}} to largely rebuild the squad for the 2014–15 season, and brought in 15 new signings, {{including}} Dean Wells, Calvin Zola, and Charlie Lee. <b>He</b> <b>guided</b> the team to a play-off place with a sixth-place finish, before they were beaten by Southend United 4–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals after conceding two goals in extra-time of the second leg fixture at Roots Hall. On 21 May 2015, Westley was replaced as manager by ex-England striker Teddy Sheringham.|$|E
5|$|Although their league {{form was}} less {{impressive}} during the 1960s, {{the second half}} of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. In 1966, under manager Jimmy Hagan, they beat West Ham United in their first League Cup appearance, winning 5–3 on aggregate in the last two-legged final. The following year they reached the final again, the first at Wembley, but lost 3–2 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2–0 up at half-time. Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor Alan Ashman. <b>He</b> <b>guided</b> the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2–1 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final.|$|E

5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. He {{was in charge of}} West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. <b>He</b> <b>guided</b> them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic duopoly. The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them with younger talent. The 2005 Cup win was their last piece of silverware until 2014.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1984–85 York {{were beaten}} by Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in the League Cup, but Byrne {{impressed}} QPR manager Alan Mullery enough {{to earn a}} £100,000 move to Loftus Road. Smith spent half of this sum (a club record) on Aldershot forward Dale Banton, {{who went on to}} score 49 goals in 138 appearances for the club. He also released winger Brian Pollard, but found that the man he signed in his place, Gary Nicholson, was not able to replicate Pollard's form. York started the season well and another of his signings, Keith Houchen (£15,000), scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Gillingham in November 1984. On 26 January 1975, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> York to victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round. In the next round York came from behind to draw 1–1 at home with Liverpool, before losing 7–0 away at Anfield.|$|E

Westley guided the club to back-to-back promotions in his first season as a Football League manager, following Stevenage's successful 2010–11 League Two play-off campaign. At the start of 2012, Westley left Stevenage to join Preston North End. He was sacked by the club in February 2013. A month later, Westley rejoined Stevenage, his third spell at the club. He managed the club for another two years, before leaving again in May 2015. He took charge at Peterborough United four months later, before being sacked shortly before the end of the 2015–16 season. He was appointed manager at Newport County in October 2016, with the club lying bottom of the English Football League, and was sacked five months later after failing to turn around the club's poor form.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Kippenberger {{was offered}} the {{position}} of Editor-in-Chief of New Zealand's largest-ever publishing project, the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45. The New Zealand government had made initial plans for a published record of New Zealand's involvement in the war as early as 1943. Kippenberger, well respected across all branches of New Zealand's services, was championed by New Zealand's prime minister, Peter Fraser, as the person to coordinate the project. The resulting series of books, covering campaign and unit histories as well as volumes on the New Zealand people at war, was {{to be published by}} the War History Branch at the Department of Internal Affairs. By 1946, his work with the Reception Group was largely complete and he returned to New Zealand to take up his new position. Initially contracted for seven years from 1 July 1946, he would be involved with the project {{for the rest of his}} life. In his capacity as Editor-in-Chief, <b>he</b> <b>guided</b> the planning and production of volumes dedicated to specific campaigns, units and the war effort in general.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1853, Ezra and Oliver Meeker {{received}} a three-month-old letter from their father, stating {{that he and}} other family members wanted to emigrate, and would do so if Oliver Meeker could return to assist them. They immediately responded that Oliver would return to Indiana by early the following year, and put their plans on hold to prepare for and finance his journey by steamship and rail. In August 1854, Ezra Meeker received word that his relatives were en route, but were delayed and short on provisions. He quickly went to their aid, intending to guide them through the Naches Pass into the Puget Sound area. When he found his family's party close to the first Fort Walla Walla (near Richland, Washington), he learned that his mother and a younger brother had died along the Trail. <b>He</b> <b>guided</b> the survivors through the pass and to his claim on McNeil Island.|$|E
