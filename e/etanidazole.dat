40|$|Peripheral {{neuropathy}} is {{the major}} dose-limiting toxicity of the hypoxic cell sensitiser, <b>etanidazole.</b> Previous work from this laboratory using culture neuronal cell lines suggested that nitroimidazole-induced degradation of neurofilament proteins might be the critical biological event mediating this neurotoxicity. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to develop the neurofilament degradation assay in an organotypic spinal cord culture system with the goal of developing strategies for optimising sensitiser efficacy as well as ameliorating nitroimidazole-induced neurotoxicity. Spinal cord cultures were treated with <b>etanidazole</b> and neurofilament protein degradation was analysed by immunoblot analysis. Spinal cord cultures exposed to <b>etanidazole</b> exhibited a dose-dependent loss of parent neurofilament proteins, with concomitant appearance of low molecular weight degradation products. The potential neurotoxic effect of L, S-buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), a compound that enhances the radiosensitising effectiveness of 2 -nitroimidazoles, was also screened in this assay system. BSO alone, at concentrations up to 100 microM, did not promote neurofilament degradation. BSO (20 microM) enhanced the effect of <b>etanidazole</b> on neurofilament degradation by a dose-modifying factor of 1. 6 +/- 0. 5. Since 20 microM BSO is expected to enhance <b>etanidazole</b> radiosensitisation of hypoxic cells by a larger factor, this suggests that a therapeutic gain could be achieved using BSO in combination with <b>etanidazole</b> in radiation therapy...|$|E
40|$|The first {{electron}} transfer to radiosensitizer <b>etanidazole</b> (ETN) and ETN radical anion formation in buffered aqueous media was studied {{by means of}} voltammetric techniques and Electrochemical Impendance Spectroscopy (EIS). The heterogeneous {{electron transfer}} rate constant for the first reduction of ETN (radical anion production) k 0 for the redox couple and so called E 1, 7 potential were calculated. The obtained values of k 0 and E 1, 7 potential indicate that ETN compared to some other possible chemical radiosensitizers requires lower energy to accept the first electron during metabolic pathway...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the in vitro action of an hydrosoluble 2 -nitroimidazole, <b>Etanidazole</b> (EZL), against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. EZL displayed lethal activity against isolated trypomastigotes {{as well as}} amastigotes of T. cruzi (RA strain) growing in Vero cells or J 774 macrophages, without affecting host cell viability. Although not completely equivalent to Benznidazole (BZL), the reference drug for Chagas chemotherapy, EZL takes advantage in exertingits anti-T. cruzi activity for longer periods without serious toxic side effects, as those recorded in BZL-treated patients. Our present results encourage further experiments to study in depth the trypanocidal properties of this drug already licensed for use in human cancers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the computer simulation {{results on the}} delivery of <b>Etanidazole</b> (radiosensitiser) to the brain tumor and examines several factors affecting the delivery. The simulation consists of a 3 D model of tumor with poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) wafers of 1 % Etanidzole loading implanted in the resected cavity. A zero-order release device will produce a concentration profile in the tumor which increases with time until the drug in the carrier is depleted. This causes toxicity complications during the later stages of drug treatment. However, for wafers of similar loading, such release results in a higher drug penetration depth and therapeutic index {{as compared to the}} double drug burst profile. The numerical accuracy of the model was verified by the similar results obtained in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTreatment for extensive-stage {{small cell}} lung cancer (ES SCLC) or extrapulmonary small cell {{carcinoma}} (EPSC) is typically palliative. We {{set out to}} determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall long-term survival of ES SCLC and EPSC patients, physiologically aged < or = 60 years, responding to first-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose combination alkylating agents with hematologic stem cell support. Patients in first-line chemotherapy response underwent stem cell collection (marrow, peripheral blood progenitor cells, or both) followed by high-dose therapy with 1 of 2 regimens: CBP (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine) or ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) with or without <b>etanidazole.</b> Involved-field radiotherapy was given to selected patients with oligometastatic disease distributed in sites allowing for reasonable radiation ports, and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy was given upon recovery to patients in complete response (CR) or near-CR. A total of 36 patients were treated. Of 29 patients with ES SCLC, 6 (21 %) had achieved CR, 18 near-CR, and 5 partial response prior to high-dose therapy. Of 7 patients with EPSC, 3 (43 %) had achieved CR, 3 had achieved near-CR, and 1 had progression of disease prior to high-dose therapy. Thirteen ES SCLC patients received high-dose CBP. Of the remaining 23 patients with SCLC or EPSC, 17 were treated with ICE and 6 with ICE plus <b>etanidazole,</b> a hypoxic cell sensitizer. Treatment-related mortality was 11 % (4 of 36 patients). For all patients, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 5 months. The 2 - and 5 -year survivals after intensification were 12 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 5 %- 31 %) and 9 % (95 % CI, 3 %- 27 %), respectively. Of the 30 patients in or near CR prior to high-dose therapy, 5 remain continuously progression-free (2 ES SCLC, 3 EPSC) for a median of 55 months (range, 1 - 96 months) after high-dose therapy. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with more favorable EFS were {{the use of a}} more aggressive induction regimen (ICE), and the EPSC histology. These factors were also associated with more favorable overall survival. Other factors associated with more favorable overall survival were the use of short induction therapy (< or = 4 cycles) and younger age (< 50 years). Except for high-dose ICE with <b>etanidazole,</b> the use of high-dose systemic therapy in ES SCLC and EPSC was associated with low treatment-related morbidity and mortality over the past 5 years. Late complications were infrequent, and most patients returned to full-time work and activity, barring disease recurrence. Nonetheless, few patients with ES SCLC have progression-free long-term survival. We conclude that high-dose therapy is not indicated as an approach for ES SCLC, except as part of an investigative trial. Conversely, 3 of the 7 patients with EPSC remain relapse-free (range, 1 - 96 months), warranting further phase II evaluation of this approach in this population.

40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{initiated}} to quantitate the oxygen dependence of bioreductive metabolism-induced binding of EF 5, a pentafluorinated derivative of the 2 -nitroimidazole, <b>etanidazole.</b> Two different assays were compared: first, radioactive drug incorporation into cell lysates, {{which provides a}} direct measure of drug metabolism or uptake; second, monoclonal antibody detection of cellular macromolecular adducts of EF 5 after whole cell permeabilisation and fixing. The antibodies (a single clone designated ELK 3 - 51) were conjugated with the fluorescent dye Cy 3, with fluorescence determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. For the two cell lines tested (V 79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts and 9 L rat glioma), the oxygen dependence of binding {{was found to be}} the same for the two techniques. Using the antibody binding technique, the fluorescence signal was highly reproducible between experiments, resistant to light or chemical bleaching and stable over time following cell or tissue staining. Flow cytometric analysis of cells from rat 9 L tumours treated with EF 5 in vivo or in vitro showed a distribution of fluorescent signal which was very compatible, on both a relative and absolute basis, with the in vitro results. Our results indicate that immunofluorescent techniques provide a quantitative assay for bioreductive drug adducts, and therefore may be able to measure the absolute oxygen concentration distribution in cell populations and tissues of interest...|$|E
40|$|BALB/c nude mice 6 {{weeks old}} were inoculated with glioma C 6 cell-line and the {{efficacy}} of the different amount of Etanidazole-discs and Taxol-microspheres was investigated. Poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was used as the main encapsulating polymer and polyethylene glycol was added to increase the porosity. The 1 % drug loading microspheres of each drug were produced by spray drying and the discs were obtained by compressing the Etanidazole-microspheres. Intra-tumoral injection followed by irradiation resulted in high systemic dosage and thus systemic toxicity. Tumors grown for 6 days, 9 days and 16 days were implanted with 0. 5 mg or 1. 0 mg or 1. 5 mg of the drug. A radiation dosage of 2 Gy each time for a number of times was given for animals implanted with <b>Etanidazole</b> and no irradiation was given for animals implanted with Taxol. Increasing the number of doses clearly decreased the rate of tumor growth. The increase in the amount of drug on smaller sized tumors controlled the tumor better and there was agglomeration of the microspheres resulting in deviation of release profile of the drug as compared to the in vitro studies. It was observed that 1. 0 mg of Taxol given to a tumor grown for 6 days was able to suppress the tumor for a total period of approximately two months and no tumor resurrection was observed during the second month.

40|$|A {{panel of}} eight human {{pancreatic}} tumour cell lines displayed high intrinsic radioresistance, with mean inactivation doses between 2. 4 and 6. 5 Gy, {{similar to those}} reported for melanoma and glioblastoma. The radiosensitising potency of sodium nitroprusside, a bioreductive nitric oxide donor, was assessed in a model of metabolism-induced hypoxia in a cell micropellet. Sodium nitroprusside at 0. 1 mM revealed a radiosensitising effect with an overall enhancement ratio of 1. 9 compared with 2. 5 for oxygen. Radiosensitising activity correlated with the enhancement of single-strand DNA breakage caused by radiation. In suspensions with cell densities of between 3 % and 30 % (v/v), the half-life of sodium nitroprusside decreased from 31 to 3. 2 min, suggesting a value of around 1 min for micropellets. Despite this variation, the radiosensitising activity was similar in micropellets and in diluted cell suspensions. S-nitroso-L-glutathione was found to possess radiosensitising activity, consistent with a possible role of natural thiols in the storing of radiobiologically active nitric oxide adducts derived from sodium nitroprusside. As measured by a nitric oxide-specific microsensor, activation of sodium nitroprusside occurred by bioreduction, whereas S-nitroso-L-glutathione showed substantial spontaneous decomposition. Both agents appear to exert radiosensitising action through nitric oxide as its scavenging by carboxy phenyltetramethylimidazolineoxyl N-oxide (carboxy-PTI 0) and oxyhaemoglobin resulted in attenuated radiosensitisation. Sodium nitroprusside was at least 10 -fold more potent than <b>etanidazole,</b> a 2 -nitroimidazole used as a reference. Our data suggest that sodium nitroprusside, a drug currently used {{for the treatment of}} hypertension, is a potential tumour radioresponse modifier.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{non-invasive}} detection of tumor hypoxia using a [18 F]-labeled trifluorine derivative of <b>etanidazole.</b> The first part was to elaborate murine tumor models in which modification of hypoxia could be studied to confirm the detection of hypoxia with EF 5 immunofluorescence (IF). Using EF 5 IF measurements, we were able to differentiate between tumor strains and to induce hypoxia modification, according to % O 2 breathed. EF 5 flow cytometry (FC) was less reliable, being poorly correlated to EF 5 IF. Any of the two EF 5 methods was found to be correlated with Eppendorf measurements of pO 2 performed within the same models but not within the same individual tumors. Therefore, we compared EF 5 binding as assessed by IF to pO 2 measured by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance oximetry. This was performed not only in the same individual tumor but also in a specially designed in vivo tumor model where the two methods were colocalized. Our data demonstrated a highly significant relationship with most of EF 5 binding occurring under pO 2 of less than 10 mmHg in an original manner. The second part was the preclinical validation of [18 F]-EF 3. EF 5 IF was used as a standard to which [18 F]-EF 3 could be compared. We first comprehensively studied the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and metabolism of [18 F]-EF 3 in mice. We thereafter studied tumor binding of [18 F]-EF 3 at the microscopic level using autoradiography and in individual tumors using gamma counting, in animals under normoxic, hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions and in several murine tumor models and compared it to FMISO. As the third part of this thesis, the first phase I study with [18 F]-EF 3 in humans was performed in 10 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. (SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
