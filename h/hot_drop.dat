50|$|The {{process of}} the {{formation}} of quark-gluon plasma lasts little longer than the time the light takes to pass through the volume occupied by the atomic nucleus used to produce the ultra-high pressure and temperature in the highly-energetic collision. After this brief time the <b>hot</b> <b>drop</b> of quark plasma evaporates in a process called hadronization. The extremely limited duration of the plasma makes it challenging (difficult) to study free quarks in quark-gluon plasma.|$|E

50|$|The strangeness {{production}} and its diagnostic potential as signature of quark-gluon plasma {{has been discussed}} for nearly 30 years. The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark-gluon plasma {{at the time of}} breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing <b>hot</b> <b>drop</b> of quark-gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, flash x-ray {{photography}} {{as well as}} high speed regular photography was used to investigate the fragmentation process during the vapor explosion of single drops of molten metal in water. For drops heated to 700 $ sp circ$C, a vapor bubble is formed around the drop after a short induction time of about 80 $ mu$s which grows to a maximum diameter and then collapses. X-ray radiographs, which can "see through" the vapor bubble, show that filaments of metal protruding from the drop surface are produced during the bubble growth. At {{the time of the}} bubble collapse, the drop surface is highly convoluted and a second interaction is initiated producing an even larger second bubble in the case of tin drops. A mechanism based on nonuniform superheating and evaporation of the water upon unstable film collapse is proposed to describe the origin of the melt filaments. For liquid drops under isothermal conditions with the water, fragmentation occurs as mass is stripped off the surface due to relative motion of the water. For hot drops at higher flow velocities (i. e., $>$ 45 m/s) initially a vapor bubble forms but it is quickly displaced downstream. It is proposed that evaporation at the upstream surface of the bubble generates a vapor flow around the drop surface which strips the drop surface. The vapor flow carries the fragments into the bubble region behind the drop. The vapor later condenses leaving a cloud of fragments which are subsequently dispersed by the water. The dynamics of the vapor bubble produced by the explosion of a <b>hot</b> <b>drop</b> under low flow conditions is modeled using a parametric model incorporating the Rayleigh equation for bubble dynamics and an energy equation for the vapor to account for added heat transfer from the distorting drop surface. Estimates of the total heat transferred from the drop show that only 3 % of the initial drop thermal energy is converted into work done by the vapor bubble...|$|E

6000|$|He {{took her}} hand in his and held it gently, {{awaiting}} what she would say next. His heart swelled so with thankfulness that she had recognized him, he could hardly repress a sob. Gradually her eyes became softer and less intense in their gaze. The tears were slowly gathering, and presently some large <b>hot</b> <b>drops</b> rolled down her cheek. Then the flood-gates were opened, and the heart-easing stream gushed forth; deep sobs came; and for nearly an hour she lay without speaking, while the heavy icy pressure that withheld her misery from utterance was thus melting away.

And yet that man, she knew, {{suspected}} her of a base and hateful crime. It was too dreadful! She could not exculpate herself, save by blank denial--and what would that avail?

Ceridwen determines to help her son by brewing a magic potion, the first three drops of which will give him the gift of wisdom and inspiration (awen).

40|$|We study, using {{molecular}} dynamics techniques, how boundary conditions affect {{the process of}} fragmentation of finite, highly excited, Lennard-Jones systems.

This branch is absent in the free expanding case even at high energies. This effect is traced to the role played by the collective expansion motion. On the other hand, we found that the recently proposed characteristic features of a first order phase transition taking place in a finite isolated system, i. e. abnormally large kinetic energy fluctuations and a negative branch in the TRF, are present for the constrained (dilute) as well the unconstrained case. The microscopic origin of this behavior is also analyzed. PACS: 25. 70 Mn, 05. 70 Fh, 02. 70 Ns 1 I...|$|R
