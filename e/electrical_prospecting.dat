50|$|The {{midpoint}} of his scientific activity was {{the theory of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>prospecting</b> in geophysics. He {{was one of the}} first to perform a complete calculation in a realistic context (1930) of the electromagnetic field generated by a prospecting device and thus of the apparent resistivity of the ground. A series of subsequent papers (1930-1950) offered a detailed analysis of the usual DC and AC <b>electrical</b> <b>prospecting</b> methods. Later on he developed the theory of alpha media which allows an easy calculation of the electric field within a large family of models for the conductivity of the ground and facilitates the interpretation of the measured data. Another problem originating in <b>electrical</b> <b>prospecting</b> and to which he devoted for a long time his mathematical abilities was the determination of the magnetic field lines for various configurations of currents. He developed a special geometrical intuition which allowed him to integrate the complicated differential equations of the field lines of linear currents with increasingly complex arrangements. In this context he could produce explicit examples of open magnetic field lines.|$|E
50|$|A related {{geophysical}} method, induced polarization, {{measures the}} transient response. The technique evolved from techniques of <b>electrical</b> <b>prospecting</b> that predate digital computers, where layers or anomalies were sought rather than images.Early {{work on the}} mathematical problem in the 1930s assumed a layered medium (see for example Langer, Slichter). Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov who {{is best known for}} his work on regularization of inverse problems also worked on this problem. He explains in detail how to solve the ERT problem in a simple case of 2-layered medium. During the 1940s he collaborated with geophysicists and without the aid of computers they discovered large deposits of copper. As a result, they were awarded a State Prize of Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|Soil cracks, whose {{formation}} {{are associated}} to natural climate phenomena such as swelling and shrinking, {{play an important}} role in water and gas transfers. Up to now, their 3 D structure was characterised either by serial sections (Cousin, 1996) which is a destructive technique or X-ray tomography (Macedo et al., 1998) which is applicable on limited size sample. Three-dimensional <b>electrical</b> resistivity <b>prospecting</b> enables now to monitor crack development and to characterise their geometry without any destruction of the medium under study. Three-dimensional electrical resistivity surveys are commonly gathered by a network of in-line survey arrays, such as Wenner, Schlummberg, or dipole-dipole (Xu and Noel, 1993; Zhou et al., 2002). As emphasized by Meheni et al. (1996) the resulting apparent resistivity maps are often different depending on the array orientation related to an electrical discontinuity. Chambers et al. (2002) underline that in heterogeneous medium 3 D electrical resistivity model resolution was sensitive to electrode configuration orientation. Indeed asymmetric bodies or anisotropic material exhibit different behaviours depending on whether the current passes through them in one direction or in another (Scollar et al., 1990). It would be all the more true for medium having very contrasted resistivities like cracking soil. In that case the electrical current does not encounter the same resistance when it passes perpendicular or parallel to the resistant bodies. Measurements of apparent resistivity depend then on the location and orientation of the current source relative to the body under study (Bibby, 1986). Studies conducted by Habberjam and Watkins (1967) emphasized that the square array provide a measurement of resistivity less orientationally dependent than that given by a in-line array investigation. Intending to lead a more 3 D accurate inversion, we have chosen to focus our attention on a 3 D electrical resistivity data acquisition. We present here a three-dimensional electrical survey carried out by a square array quadripole for characterising the soil cracks network developing during a desiccation period...|$|R

40|$|The sun {{provides}} us daily with {{large quantities of}} energy in the form of light. With the world’s increasing demand of <b>electrical</b> energy the <b>prospect</b> of converting this solar light into electricity is highly tempting. In the strive towards mass-production and low cost solar cells, new types of solar cells are being developed, e. g. solar cells completely based on organic molecules and polymers. These materials offer a promising potential of low cost and large scale manufacturing and have the additional advantage that they can be produced on flexible and light weight substrate which opens for new and innovating application areas, e. g. integration with paper or textiles, or as building materials. In polymer solar cells a combination of two materials are used, an electron donor and an electron acceptor. The three dimensional distribution of the donor and acceptor in the active layer of the device, i. e. the morphology, is known to have larger influence of the solar cell performance. For the optimal morphology there is a trade-off between sometimes conflicting criteria for the various steps of the energy conversion process. The dissociation of photogenerated excitons takes place at an interface between the donor and acceptor materials. Therefore an efficient generation of charges requires a large interface between the two components. However, for charge transport and collection at the electrodes, continuous pathways for the charges to the electrodes are required. In this thesis, results from morphology studies by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of spin-coated blend and bilayer thin films of polyfluorene co-polymers, especially poly[(9, 9 -dioctylfluorenyl- 2, 7 -diyl) -co- 5, 5 -(4 ´, 7 ´-di- 2 -thienyl- 2 ´, 1 ´, 3 ´-benzothiadiazole) ] APFO- 3, and the fullerene derivative [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are presented. It is shown that by varying the blend ratio, the spin. -coating solvent, and/or the substrate, different morphologies can be obtained, e. g. diffuse bilayer structures, spontaneously formed multilayer structures and homogeneous blends. The connection between these different morphologies and the performance of solar cells is also analysed. The results indicate that nano-scale engineering of the morphology in the active layer may be an important factor in the optimization of the performance of polymer solar cells...|$|R
