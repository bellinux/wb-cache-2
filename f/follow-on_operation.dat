40|$|AbstractApart from {{biological}} factors, {{the bone}} healing process strongly {{depends on the}} mechanical properties of the implant applied. The stiffness of the implant influences the micro-motion, {{one of the most}} important stimuli of the healing process within the fracture gap. Both, the “ideal” stiffness of an implant as well as the alteration of the mechanical properties over the course of healing are still a topic of research. Apart from biodegradable implants or “fixateur externe”, it is not possible to alter the mechanical properties of the implants without second surgery. A “stiffness alterable” implant might have a positive impact on the healing process, e. g. a shorter healing time, an early ability to bear weight or the avoidance of a <b>follow-on</b> <b>operation.</b> In order to adapt the implant to the actual healing situation, nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA) based implants that exhibit a variable middle piece were developed. Due to contactless induction heating, the transition temperature of the SMA is reached and triggers the one-way shape memory effect (SME). This leads to a slight modification of the second moment of inertia and to an adaption of the bending stiffness of the implant, respectively. Based on laser cutting and welding, NiTi-SMA based implants were manufactured by using thin, commercially available NiTi (thickness: 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm, transition temperature Af between 55 - 65 °C) sheets. Depending on the implant design, 4 -Point-Bending measurements showed feasible bending stiffness alterations around a range of 50 %, with regard to the original stiffness. Thereby, two approaches, increasing the bending stiffness and decreasing the bending stiffness, have been realized. Currently, the implant design is being adapted in order to meet the requirements for human applications. Custom made NiTi-SMA with a transition temperature around 45 - 50 °C could continue to reduce the impact of the heating process and expand this concept to further medical applications, e. g. compression, anchoring or expansion of implants or devices...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the role of}} non-lethal weapons (NLWs) within missions conducted by special operations and general purpose forces in peacetime contingency operations referred to as "special wars. " It takes a paradigmatic approach from the emerging debate concerning the {{revolution in military affairs}} (RMA). The specific concepts employed constitute the paradigm of control warfare. We hypothesize that, the more tenets of control warfare are applied to a mission or operation, the more effective will be any application of non-lethal weapons, and the greater the likelihood of success. The thesis defines NLWs, then focuses on the comparative analysis of two different mini-case studies of <b>follow-on</b> <b>operations</b> from the war in Panama in 1989 - 1990. Missions in the case studies are first analyzed with respect to the control warfare paradigm. Then, a second analysis, using quality function deployment (QFD) techniques, is used to examine the specific applicability of types of NLWs to operational tasks within these missions. The criteria used for this analysis are measures of effectiveness (MOEs) expanded along the dimensions addressed in the theoretical discussion. The finding is that employing the concepts associated with control warfare has a direct relationship to how well suited non-lethal weapons may be to application in burgeoning "special" types of wars that we shall likely face in the future.

50|$|With {{the ground}} and {{airfield}} secured, {{the rest of the}} brigade closed quickly. In the days following the jump, 12 C-17s landed per day, bringing in another 1,200 soldiers and vehicles from the brigade's assigned and attached units. Within 96-hours, 2,160 soldiers and 381 pieces of equipment was moved from Aviano Air Base, Italy to Bashur Airfield, Iraq, led by the 62nd and 446th Airlift Wings from McChord Air Force Base, Washington and 437th Airlift Wing and 315th Reserve Airlift Wing from Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina. Task Force 1-63 Armor flew in on additional 27 C-17 sorties. Although the 173rd played a crucial strategic role by establishing a significant conventional presence in northern Iraq, it did not engage in significant combat operations prior to the end of major combat operations. The brigade first saw action when it moved on Kirkuk on April 10, 2003, following the JSOTF-North's successful efforts to evict the Iraqi Republican Guard and Regular Army from the city. Once in Kirkuk, the 173rd was vital in establishing a secure environment for <b>follow-on</b> stability <b>operations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The German {{reaction}} was rapid, and initially successful. A counterattack, code-named Operation Doppelkopf, {{was conducted on}} 16 August by XXXX and XXXIX Panzer Corps {{under the command of}} Third Panzer Army, Army Group Centre. Acting in coordination with armored formations from Army Group North, they initially cut off the Soviet troops on the coast, and re-established a tenuous 30-kilometer-wide corridor connecting Army Groups Centre and North. The main objective of the attack was to retake the key road junction of Šiauliai (Schaulen), but the German tanks ran head-on into an in-depth defense by the 1st Baltic Front, and by 20 August the German advance had stalled with heavy losses. A <b>follow-on</b> attack, code-named <b>Operation</b> Cäsar, and launched on 16 September, failed in the same manner. After a brief period of respite, STAVKA issued orders for the Baltic Strategic Offensive, which lasted from 14 September-24 November.|$|R
40|$|The hydrometallurgical {{refining}} of platinum group metals {{results in}} {{large volumes of}} liquid waste that requires suitable treatment before any disposal can be contemplated. The wastewater streams are characterized by extremes of pH, high inorganic ion content (such as chloride), significant residual metal loads and small amounts of entrained organic compounds. Historically these effluents were housed in evaporation reservoirs, however lack of space and growing water demands have led Anglo Platinum to consider treatment of these effluents. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether biological wastewater treatment could produce water suitable for onsite reuse. Bench-scale activated sludge and anaerobic digestion for co-treatment of an acidic refinery waste stream with domestic wastewater were used to give preliminary data. Activated sludge showed better water treatment at lab scale in terms of removal efficiencies of ammonia (approximately 25 %, cf. 20 % in anaerobic digestion) and COD (70 % cf. 43 % in digestion) and greater robustness when biomass health was compared. Activated sludge was consequently selected for a pilot plant trial. The pilot plant was operated on-site and performed comparably with the bench-scale system, however challenges in the clarifier design led to losses of biomass and poor effluent quality (suspended solids washout). The pilot plant was unable to alter the pH of the feed, but a two week maturation period resulted in the pH increasing from 5. 3 to 7. 0. Tests on algal treatment as an alternative or <b>follow-on</b> unit <b>operation</b> to activated sludge showed it not to be a viable process. The activated sludge effluent was assessed for onsite reuse in flotation and it was found that there was no significant difference between its flotation performance and that of the process water currently used, indicating the effluent generated by the biological treatment system can be used successfully for flotation. Flotation is the method whereby minerals refining operations recover minerals of interest from ore through the addition of chemicals and aeration of the ore slurry. Target minerals adhere to the bubbles and can be removed from the process...|$|R
