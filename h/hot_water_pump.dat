Most all HVAC equipment, which includes boiler, chiller, pumps, AHUs and exhaust fans, due to lack of maintenance, had some form of deteriorated controls, components, and operational function. For example, most of pneumatic controls were failed due to bad components, wrong settings, and disconnection before the Continuous CommissioningR (CCSM). This caused humid and hot problems of the building, and wasted energy. After maintaining and improving the pneumatic controls, the boiler and <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> is now turned off when outside air temperature is higher than 80 ?F. The chiller is now shut off when the outside air temperature is below 55 ?F, and the economizers activate to maintain discharge air temperature when the outside air temperature is below 60 ?F. The building comfort in temperature and relative humidity (RH) is improved after CCSM. For example, average space temperature of the building was above 75 ?F most of the time before CCSM and is now 73 ?F after CCSM. The relative humidity in the baggage claim area was 70 % before CCSM and is now 55 % after CCSM.

40|$|Keywords:High temperature, high pressure, ESP, {{performance}} testing, design ABSTRACT. With {{the development}} of oilfield exploration, the performance of electric submersible pump (ESP) has been enhanced very fast. It requires testing techniques develop at the same time. The most outstanding question is the testing of high temperature and pressure ESP. A testing well was drilled in Daqing in 1992. It keeps the water liquid state on 150 centigrade by high pressure. This system can simulate operational mode 3000 meters under the ground. But many new ESPs have been produced these years. The quondam testing system couldn’t meet the testing requirement. A new testing system is desiderated eagerly. This paper developed a high temperature and pressure ESP testing experimentation system. Hydraulic/thermodynamic analysis calculation has been carried on. Friction resistance from constant pressure point to the suction inlet of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> and the ESP in heating-forced cycle and experimentation primary cycle are calculated respectively. Keeping the water liquid state on 180 centigrade, constant pressure value was fixed on 2. 5 MPa. The heat load is calculated including the heat that {{the water in the}} system and the equipment need and the heat loss. In order to protect ESP from emanating too much heat to keep the temperature and pressure of the system steady, heat exchange system has been designed. Cold load and heat exchange square have been calculated. Friction resistance {{and the size of the}} cold water cistern have been calculated. These provide necessary academic foundation for the testing experimentation of high temperature and pressure ESP. ...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} testing (AET) often utilises waveguides {{to separate}} delicate sensors from hot surfaces or to facilitate access to otherwise obstructed {{materials such as}} lagged vessels. In the authors ’ work, restricted access to mechanical seals on a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> necessitated {{the use of a}} short rod to transmit acoustic emission (AE) information from the ceramic seal face. Consequently, an appreciation was required of how this waveguide altered the seal’s AE signals. This paper presents the effects of varying the material and/or shape on the temporal and frequency characteristics of pulsed acoustic emission events travelling through small cylindrical rods. 36 waveguides, fabricated from either alumina ceramic, mild steel, stainless steel (SS 316) or extruded Delrin were tested, of 3 different lengths, two diameters and four sensor face angles. The effect of a point at the source end of the waveguide was also verified. 1 RELEVANT ULTRASONIC THEORY The solutions to the general wave equation for acoustic waves travelling through isotropic cylinders are detailed in references [1]-[3]. However, there are several key points applicable to this research work that will now be summarised. Longitudinal (i. e. compressional) wave modes in a cylinder vary with radial and longitudinal distance along the cylinder but are symmetrical around the circumference. The relationship between phase velocity and frequency is known as the Pochammer-Chree equation and resembles the Lamb dispersion relationship in plates. From this equation, {{it can be seen that}} the fundamental mode approaches a constant velocity as k. a approaches zero, where k is the wavenumber and a is the cylinder radius. This limiting velocity corresponds to the longitudinal rod velocity: c...|$|E
