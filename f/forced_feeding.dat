25|$|As to the {{toxicity}} of philodendrons in cats, {{the evidence is}} conflicting. In one study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted {{in the death of}} the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, renal failure, and encephalitis. However, in another study, three cats were tube fed Philodendron cordatum and showed no signs of acute poisoning. In this study, two adult cats and one kitten were fed a puréed leaf and water mixture, observed afterward, then euthanized, and finally a necropsy was performed. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, with the highest dose administered being considerably more than any house cat could consume. The cats showed none of the symptoms found in past epidemiological studies and appeared normal. Necropsies showed nothing that would suggest toxicity. The past epidemiological studies have been suggested to be wrong, since sick cats may be inclined to eat plants to alleviate their illnesses. If this were the case, then such studies would be incorrectly attributing the sickness of the cats to the philodendrons. The <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> study may have failed to show signs of philodendron toxicity because the tube feeding bypassed the mouth and hence minimized the typical signs of irritation.|$|E
500|$|Davison {{was arrested}} again in early October 1909, while {{preparing}} {{to throw a}} stone at the cabinet minister Sir Walter Runciman; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague—Constance Lytton—threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month. Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these {{were published in the}} newspapers. Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's hard labour. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of force-feeding on prisoners. The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as [...] "extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment". Davison said that the experience [...] "will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable.... The torture was barbaric". Following the first episode of <b>forced</b> <b>feeding,</b> and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed by hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days. Davison's treatment prompted the Labour Party MP Keir Hardie to ask a question in the House of Commons about the [...] "assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways"; Davison sued the prison authorities {{for the use of the}} hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 shillings in damages.|$|E

50|$|While other wasp queens {{depend on}} {{secretions}} from larvae for food, Vespula austriaca parasites obtain their nourishment in the liquid form through solicitations and trophallaxis of host workers. They rarely solicit larvae for nourishment. The parasites will often {{use force to}} obtain what they need. During <b>forced</b> <b>feeding,</b> the parasite will grab the host worker using its forelegs to reel in the worker. More forceful behavior includes pushing the host worker against a comb of the nest. While some parasitic behavior (i.e. maulings) only occurs during early post-invasion stages, forced trophallaxis behavior occurs throughout. Towards the later stages, the intensity of <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> declined, leading to host workers escaping forced encounters. Usually forced trophallaxis encounters were short lasting from 1-5 seconds. But some encounters lasted {{for as long as}} 43 seconds.

50|$|Girls' {{education}} {{took place}} primarily {{at home and}} emphasized homemaking skills. Some girls attended Quranic schools, but their training was usually limited to learning verses from the Quran and attaining minimal literacy skills.

In recent decades, fathers were responsible for financing any formal education for their children, but a father's most important responsibility toward his daughters was {{to prepare them for}} marriage, primarily by ensuring their physical attractiveness. In Mauritania, women are considered beautiful if they are moderately to morbidly obese. A widespread practice, in order to maintain this level of obesity, was <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> (leblouh). <b>Forced</b> <b>feeding</b> usually involved psychological pressure, rather than physical force, but it often required a family to reserve substantial quantities of food—in most cases, milk--for consumption by its pre-teenage daughters, whose beauty was a measure of a father's commitment to the marriage alliances they would form. Many young women were betrothed or married by the age of eight or ten. Unmarried teenage girls were subjected to severe social criticism.|$|E

40|$|From {{the age of}} 9 weeks, 90 - 90 Kolos, Gourmaud and Babati goose breeds were force {{fed with}} 2 {{different}} types of technology and 3 types of feedstuff. <b>Force</b> <b>feeding</b> technologies were the traditional Hungarian and Israeli soft groats quick methods.
