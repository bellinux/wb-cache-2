No amplification was observed from any other porcine bacteria tested, including several closely related mycoplasmas. It was also possible to demonstrate the presence of M. hyopneumoniae in bronchial lavage samples and lung tissue samples from experimentally infected pigs. Furthermore, the PCR system was used for analysis of nasal samples obtained from pigs in a fattening herd.

40|$|Background: Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma flocculare and Mycoplasma hyorhinis live in swine {{respiratory}} tracts. M. flocculare, a commensal bacterium, is genetically {{closely related}} to M. hyopneumoniae, the causative agent of <b>enzootic</b> porcine <b>pneumonia.</b> M. hyorhinis is also pathogenic, causing polyserositis and arthritis. In this work, we present the genome sequences of M. flocculare and M. hyopneumoniae strain 7422, and we compare these genomes with the genomes of other M. hyoponeumoniae strain and to the a M. hyorhinis genome. These analyses were performed to identify possible characteristics that may help to explain the different behaviors of these species in swine respiratory tracts. Results: The overall genome organization of three species was analyzed, revealing that the ORF clusters (OCs) differ considerably and that inversions and rearrangements are common. Although M. flocculare and M. hyopneumoniae display {{a high degree of}} similarity with respect to the gene content, only some genomic regions display considerable synteny. Genes encoding proteins that may be involved in host-cell adhesion in M. hyopneumoniae and M. flocculare display differences in genomic structure and organization. Some genes encoding adhesins of the P 97 family are absent in M. flocculare and some contain sequence differences or lack of domains that are considered to be important for adhesion to host cells. The phylogenetic relationship of the three species was confirmed by a phylogenomic approach. The set of genes involved in metabolism, especially in the uptake of precursors for nucleic acids synthesis and nucleotide metabolism, display some differences in copy number and the presence/absence in the three species. Conclusions: The comparative analyses of three mycoplasma species that inhabit the swine respiratory tract facilitated the identification of some characteristics that may be related to their different behaviors. M. hyopneumoniae and M. flocculare display many differences that may help to explain why one species is pathogenic and the other is considered to be commensal. However, {{it was not possible to}} identify specific virulence determinant factors that could explain the differences in the pathogenicity of the analyzed species. The M. hyorhinis genome contains differences in some components involved in metabolism and evasion of the host’s immune system that may contribute to its growth aggressiveness.

40|$|Porcine <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumoniae</b> is {{a chronic}} disease of swine {{affecting}} herds worldwide. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the causative pathogen and disease increases susceptibility {{of the host}} to secondary pathogens. The cilium adhesin, P 97, {{has been identified as}} an important adhesin. Heparin binding domains are known to contribute to the adherence potential of P 97, but other contributing mechanisms remain unknown. In this study surface plasmon resonance was used to investigate the ability of P 97 domains to interact with plasminogen and fibronectin. Plasminogen is a proenzyme, which when activated, is capable of extracellular matrix degradation. A P 97 domain containing the R 2 region was able to interact with plasminogen (KD = 13 ± 2 nM). Plasminogen binding is often mediated by a C-terminal lysine, when the C-terminal lysine from the R 2 region of P 97 was deleted, plasminogen binding still occurred, although a decrease in the level of binding was observed. Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix component. An ability to bind fibronectin {{has been shown to be}} advantageous for pathogenic bacteria, providing a mechanism for adherence and potentially triggering cytoskeletal rearrangements. The R 2 repeat region of P 97 bound fibronectin in a physiologically manner with a KD = 18 ± 5 nM, while the R 1 + R 2 repeat regions bound with a KD of 21 ± 4 nM. P 97 is encoded by mhp 183 which is located in a two gene operon with mhp 182, encoding P 102. Although the function of P 102 is unknown, it is expressed during disease and is able to associate with cilia. The genetic linkage between P 97 and P 102 suggests that P 102 has a function related to P 97, in the M. hyopneumoniae adherence process. Here we demonstrate that as with P 97, P 102 is a fibronectin and plasminogen binding protein. P 102 undergoes proteolytical processing to generate a surface located N-terminal 60 kDa (P 60) and C-terminal 42 kDa (P 42) protein. Surface plasmon resonance was used to show that recombinant P 102 (rP 102) binds plasminogen in a physiologically relevant manner (KD ~ 76 nM) with two C-terminal tandem lysine residues contributing to binding. Recombinant proteins mimicking the natural cleavage fragments of P 102, P 60 (rP 60) and P 42 (rP 42), also bound plasminogen at physiologically significant levels. The ability of plasminogen bound to the surface of M. hyopneumoniae to be biologically functional as the protease plasmin was also demonstrated. In the presence of tissue-specific plasminogen activator (tPA) surface-bound plasminogen was activated and shown to degrade fibrinogen. The presence of plasminogen in porcine ciliated airways was also established, where it is accessible to M. hyopneumoniae during colonisation. rP 102 and rP 42 were identified as fibronectin binding proteins using surface plasmon resonance (with KDs of 26 nM and 33 nM respectively). Both P 97 (mhp 183) and P 102 (mhp 183) have six paralogs in the M. hyopneumoniae genome. Paralogs are genes which have resulted from a genetic duplication event, and often retain similar but not identical functions. There is a need to increase the understanding of this protein family and the role it plays in M. hyopneumoniae pathogenesis. Thus, we have characterised the proteins encoded by the genes mhp 107 and mhp 108 which are found in a two gene structure. Mhp 107 is a P 97 paralog encoded by mhp 107. Here we demonstrate that Mhp 107 is a surface located multifunctional adhesin. The N-terminal fragment (F 1 Mhp 107) of Mhp 107 bound heparin in a dose-dependant, physiologically relevant manner with a KD of 87 ± 9 nM. Surface plasmon resonance was used to show that the C-terminal fragment of Mhp 107 (F 3 Mhp 107) binds fibronectin at physiologically relevant concentration (KD = 174 ± 80 nM) and F 1 Mhp 107 binds plasminogen with a KD of 24 ± 2 nM with binding mediated via lysine residues. F 3 Mhp 107 mediated binding to the porcine kidney epithelial-like (PK 15) cell line, while F 1 -F 3 Mhp 107 adhered to swine respiratory cilia. Likewise we investigated the potential role as an adhesin for the P 102 paralog, P 116, encoded by mhp 108. Proteomic analyses showed P 116 is surface located and expressed as a full length protein, but that P 116 also undergoes cleavage events with P 116 fragments of 17 – 70 kDa observed. Binding studies showed that M. hyopneumoniae binds fibronectin in a dose-dependant and physiologically relevant manner. The Cterminal domain of P 116 is a fibronectin binding protein (KD = 24 ± 6 nM). M. hyopneumoniae was able to bind plasminogen in a dose-dependant and physiologically relevant manner. The C-terminal domain was also elucidated as a plasminogen binding protein (KD = 44 ± 5 nM) with a C-terminal lysine residue critical to the plasminogen binding site. P 116 fragments are also able to mediate binding to PK 15 cells and adhere to swine respiratory cilia. Here we have substantially contributed to understanding the function of the P 97 /P 102 paralog family. Together this data provides strong evidence for a family of multifunctional adhesins which are important M. hyopneumoniae virulence factors...|$|R

The pathologic lesions observed with <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> consist primarily of a lymphoid cell infiltration of the lungs. Four groups of pigs consisting of challenge control, vaccinated and challenged, vaccinated only, and nonvaccinated and non-challenged were used in this study. Lymphocytes from the peripheral blood, lung, and bronchial lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACs) to determine the populations of cells activated by M. hyo.

At one time it was presumed that the majority of chronic pneumonias were associated with a virus causing <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> or with lung worms. it now seems probable that there are many primary causal agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} forms of {{inflammation}} of the lower respiratory tract in lambs are acute <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> caused mainly by Mannheimia haemolytica, chronic <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (defined as 'atypical' in lambs), the aetiological of which is Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and viral inflammation principally caused by parainfluenza virus type 3. The authors conducted anatomopathological and histopathological studies {{of the most commonly}} encountered spontaneous lung inflammations in lambs slaughtered in the Abruzzo region of Italy, with special attention to 'atypical pneumonia'. Microbiological isolations and a histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to reveal any possible correlations between causal agents and lesion patterns. Positive results for M. ovipneumoniae were compared to those for Mycoplasma isolation to evaluate the sensitivity of the two techniques. Of a total of 156 samples, 31 (19. 8 %) demonstrated involvement of M. ovipneumoniae, 15 (9. 6 %) were positive on microbiological isolation confirmed by typing with biomolecular methods and, finally, histological lesions (atypical pneumonia) were observed in the remaining 16 cases (10. 2 %). Of these 31 samples, 23 (14. 7 % of the total) demonstrated postive antigen in alveolar macrophages and giant cells on immunohistochemical testing. These data revealed the presence of chronic <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in the Abruzzo area and the importance of immunohistochemistry (in combination with isolation and anatomopathological and histopathological examination) for the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by M. ovipneumoniae, as well as the high sensitivity shown by antigen marker expression, even in samples where bacterial load was limited.

40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} porcine <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> a commercially expensive respiratory disease of swine. Salmonella typhimurium SL 3261 {{was used as}} a live carrier of plasmid pKF 1, which encodes a 15 -kDa recombinant M. hyopneumoniae protein. This expressed recombinant protein consists of the carboxy-terminal 11 kDa of a 42 -kDa M. hyopneumoniae NrdF ribonucleotide reductase R 2 subunit protein. Rabbit anti- 15 -kDa serum was able to inhibit the growth of viable M. hyopneumoniae J in vitro. When used as a live oral vaccine, S. typhimurium SL 3261 (pKF 1) induced a significant secretory immunoglobulin A immune response in the lungs of mice orally immunized against the M. hyopneumoniae antigen. Utilization of live oral vaccines expressing potentially protective M. hyopneumoniae proteins, such as the NrdF antigen, which can stimulate a lung mucosal response against surface-accessible proteins may provide a cost-effective alternative to the present control strategies used for porcine <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2000 Dr. Stephen William DoughtyMycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the causative agent of the respiratory disease Swine <b>Enzootic</b> <b>Pneumonia,</b> a mild chronic lower respiratory tract infection that affects pig populations world wide. The disease causes decreased growth rates and poor feed conversion in infected pigs and results in significant economic losses. While several swine <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> vaccines arc available, none are totally effective. These current vaccines are based on bacterins or cell fractions. As yet, no commercial vaccines composed of recombinant subunits are available. Prior to the commencement of this study, three candidate vaccinc antigens had been identified in this laboratory, from the Australian M. hyopneumoniae field isolate Beaufort. The three proteins (48 kDa, 52 kDa and 74 kDa) reacted with antibody secreting cell probes, derived from hyper-immune swine lung tissue, indicating they are important in the local antibody response to M. hyopneumoniae infection.
