30|$|Two major {{categories}} of feature selection methods are the filter method and the wrapper method. In filter method, {{the relevance of}} features is determined {{on the basis of}} inherent properties such as distance, consistency, and correlation without involving any classifier. Hence, it may not choose the most relevant feature set for the learning algorithm. Alternatively, the wrapper method [32] has a tendency to find relevant features subset, better suited to a given learning algorithm. However, wrapper method is computationally more costly since the classifier needs to be learned for each feature subset separately. On the other hand, filter feature selection method is computationally less intensive and bias <b>free.</b> <b>Filter</b> methods have a simple structure with straightforward search strategy like forward selection, backward selection, or the combination of both.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process is}} used during a large {{continuous}} process of separating <b>free</b> <b>filtering</b> suspensions where washing is not required. Basically the filter works to separates solid-liquid mixtures {{by removing the}} water from mineral concentrates and moulding the feed slurries into pellets. This is accomplished by capillary action under low vacuum pressure. [...] The pelletizing of the slurries is done by adding some solid matter to the sewage sludge so that water can be easily removed from the mixture. Eventually, the final cake products contain very little moisture and can be deposited as sewage. This process is commonly followed by bleaching and heating the cake. The end product of this filtration is a dry cake and filtrate containing no solid product.|$|R

Microspheres were prepared by emulsification-solvent evaporation, using different amounts of 4 -MBC and characterized for morphology, encapsulation efficiency and particle size. The particles were then mixed in O/W emulsions. The in vitro sun protection factors (SPF), in vitro release and photostability were investigated and compared with emulsions containing the free sunscreen.

40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} the T 1 -spaces are {{precisely}} the maximal point spaces of conditionally up-complete algebraic posets with the Scott topology. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between the category of T 1 -spaces with a distinguished base and a certain category of so-called camps. These are conditionally up-complete, algebraic and maximized posets in which every compact element is a meet of maximal elements, and they provide essentially unique algebraic ordered models for T 1 -base spaces. A T 1 -space has a damp model (a domain model that is a camp) iff it has a base not containing any <b>free</b> <b>filter</b> base. From this, it follows that all completely metrizable spaces and, more generally, all complete Aronszajn spaces have damp models. Moreover, damp models also exist for all Stone spaces; the latter representation gives rise to an equivalence and a duality for so-called Stone base spaces, extending the classical Stone duality. Furthermore, it yields a purely order-theoretical description of clopen bases for Stone spaces and, algebraically, of finitary meet bases of Boolean lattices in terms of maximal ideals...|$|E
