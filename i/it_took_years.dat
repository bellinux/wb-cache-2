5|$|The design {{challenges}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with this}} class were considerable, as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time. The desired speed of 35knots, for example, had been previously attained only in destroyers and smaller craft. To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to careful planning by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection, even in such large ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} threat of invasion {{led to a}} major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. The RAAF and RAN were also greatly expanded, though <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> for these services to build up to their peak strengths. Due to the increased need for manpower, the restrictions which prohibited non-Europeans from joining the military ceased to be enforced from late 1941, and about 3000 Indigenous Australians eventually enlisted. Most of these personnel were integrated into existing formations, but a small number of racially segregated units such as the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion were formed. A number of small units made up of Indigenous Australians were also established to patrol northern Australia and harass any Japanese forces which landed there; the members of these units did not receive pay or awards for their service until 1992. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain the expanded military after the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 while only 53 of the 73RAAF squadrons approved by the government were ever raised.|$|E

By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{whites and}} landless former slaves {{suffered}} {{the most from}} the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief {{of the state and}} its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.|$|E
25|$|With the growth, {{the auto}} {{industry}} created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including those from the South. By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the US. Residential housing was in short supply, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> for the market {{to catch up with}} the population boom. By the 1930s, so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools, and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals. Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit's diverse urban culture, including popular music trends, such as the influential Motown Sound of the 1960s led by a variety of individual singers and groups.|$|E

25|$|The city, {{which at}} that time had about 70,000 inhabitants, saw itself {{transformed}} overnight. The additional populace, full of new requirements, imposed a new organization in the supply of food and other consumer goods, including luxury items. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> for the Portuguese to settle in, causing years of chaos in the daily life of Rio; rents doubled, taxes rose, and food was in short supply, requisitioned by the imported nobility. This soon dispelled popular enthusiasm over the prince regent's arrival. The very shape of the city began to change, {{with the construction of}} innumerable new residences, villas and other buildings, and various improvements to services and infrastructure. Likewise, the presence of the court introduced new standards of etiquette, new fashions and new customs, including a new social stratification.|$|E
25|$|A small Activated Sludge Plant was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} in 1916, one of the septic tanks was converted between 1918 and 1921 to provide a larger test bed, and a permanent installation was built at Withington Sewage Works, in south Manchester. All proved to be successful, but a full-scale plant was not built at Davyhulme until {{more than ten years}} later. A second main intercepting sewer, which would link various districts in southern Manchester to Davyhulme had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1911, and construction began soon afterwards, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> to complete. It was extended by further Acts in 1914, 1920 and 1924, and sewage finally entered the works on 22 November 1928. To cope with the new flows, the size of the inlet works detritus tanks and screening chamber was quadrupled, and a decision was made to feed half of the output from the screening plant to a new Activated Sludge Plant.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore, the Australian {{government}} and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire 8th Division, deployed to Malaya, Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{was too small to}} counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>years</b> for these services to build up to their peak strengths. The Militia was mobilised and, although a large force, it was inexperienced, and lacked modern equipment. In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the 6th and 7th Divisions of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon, where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
