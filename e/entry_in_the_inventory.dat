Thus, a total of 72 alien and 8 range-expanding species have been recorded by February 2016. Half of these species have established populations in Maltese waters while a further 10 % are considered to be invasive. The main modes of introduction for alien species in Maltese waters are ‘Shipping’ and ‘Secondary dispersal’ from elsewhere in the Mediterranean. More than half of these newcomer species were recorded since the year 2000. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{monitoring}} grocery inventory in refriger-ators. One of the main contributions is an automated approach for monitoring grocery inventory. When a grocery item enters a refrigerator, the system regis-ters its image, weight and time-stamp to an inventory list. When a grocery item exits from the refrigerator, the system re-identifies it by matching it to an <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> list and deletes the entry. In this approach, re-identification of groceries has a technical difficulty because there exist various kinds of groceries and they are stored in various ways in the refrigerator. The use of two features for this grocery re-identification, which is the other main contribution of this study, enables automated re-identification. One is Appearance Feature, which reflects {{the appearance of a}} grocery item, and the other is Load Balance Fea-ture, which reflects the weight of the grocery item and the position of it on a shelf in the refrigerator. In the experiments, twenty grocery items were stored in and taken out of the shelf in the refrigerator. The result shows all the grocery items are correctly re-identified by the proposed method. i...|$|E

It determines relations between subject, object(s) and verb in transitive, ditransitive and classifer constructions. After exploring binding, scope and nominalisation effects, thematic (deep) structure is elaborated for each construction in accordance to Binarity Principle. Then, grammatical derivations of attested word orders (surface structure or linearisation) are developed with respect to word order parameters (Head parameter) and syntactic processes (successive-cyclic Head movement). Finally, SZJ as a new <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> typological <b>inventory</b> of world's languages is presented with respect to current issues of word order research...|$|R
40|$|Wow!” is a lexical <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Language <b>Inventory.</b> It is used {{to express}} {{surprise}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of a hearer’s fresh reception of pleasant or exhilarating, and unpleasant information.

This paper has investigated the different spelling forms of this exclamation and offers some explanations for the diverse spelling patterns of this word. Data have been collected from staff and students of the faculties of Arts, Education, Social Sciences, Law, Management Sciences and Clinical Sciences, after which analysis were carried out using the calculated mean score and Standard Deviation, to authenticate the results. Interviews were also conducted on a select number of the population under study. This study shows the extent the use of indigenous languages bring about a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orthography of English, especially on exclamations and attempts to locate the spelling of this word within the mosaic of Nigerian English. It brings the attention of the reading public to these spelling forms as being varied, rather than wrongly spelt...|$|R
