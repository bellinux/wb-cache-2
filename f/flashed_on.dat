25|$|The first beam was {{circulated}} {{through the}} collider {{on the morning}} of 10 September 2008. CERN successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time. The LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> a computer screen showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit. CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in an anticlockwise direction, taking slightly longer at one and a half hours due to a problem with the cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{included}} the {{song on the}} setlist for her 2005 concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] was performed alongside the Harajuku Girls, a Japanese dance troupe; the Girls performed minimal dance moves due to the intentional intimacy of the song. During the performance, the lyrics of [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] occasionally <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the screens above Stefani. Due {{to the topic of}} interracial dating prevalent in the song, Stefani was surrounded by individuals of different races throughout the performance.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the September 11 attacks, the start of the playoffs was delayed and the season's end was {{extended}} past the usual October timeframe. The Yankees advanced to the 2001 World Series to face the Arizona Diamondbacks. Game 4 marked the first time that any non-exhibition MLB game had been played in the month of November. In extra innings, Jeter hit a game-winning home run off of Byung-hyun Kim. The words [...] "Mr. November" [...] <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the scoreboard, alluding to former Yankee Reggie Jackson's nickname, [...] "Mr. October". Despite the home run, Jeter slumped at the plate; he denied injuries were a factor, though a fall into a photographer's box trying to catch a foul ball may have aggravated an earlier hamstring injury. Jeter batted [...]148 in the World Series, as the Yankees lost in seven games.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} added to the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. It {{replaced}} the song [...] "Heartbeat" [...] from Hard Candy and was used as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson who died a week {{prior to the start of}} the second leg of the tour. As Madonna sang the song, a picture of a young Jackson appeared on stage, followed by a Jackson impersonator wearing garments in Jackson style. The music then switched to a medley of his songs, like [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", and the impersonator worked through his moves, including the moonwalk as well as the spinning and gyrating. Madonna clapped her hands, swayed from side to side and jumped up and down while images of Jackson over the years <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> a big screen. After the performance, Madonna told the crowd, [...] "Let's give it up for one of the greatest artists the world has ever known," [...] and the crowd applauded.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, [...] "American Life" [...] {{was included}} on her Re-Invention World Tour. It opened the Military-Army segment and {{started with the}} sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing the song as war footage of death and destruction <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> screens behind her. At the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license. During the performance, Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. Toronto Suns Jane Stevenson praised the performance, but called the background images [...] "sober". The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.|$|E

500|$|The concert {{began with}} a fixed {{sequence}} of six to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs, a further sign that {{they were no longer}} the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E
500|$|The first {{performance}} of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] {{was on the}} Hard Candy Promo Tour of 2008; Madonna, wearing a skintight black suit and a lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne [...] with a golden walking stick, as {{the music of the}} song started. Images of confectionery <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the television screens flanking the back of the stage as Madonna and [...] her six dancers gyrated in choreographed dance moves. That same year, the song was performed as the opening number of the Sticky & Sweet Tour. Similar to the promo tour, Madonna appeared on a M-shaped throne dressed in a Givenchy-designed dress, sitting with her legs spread apart and holding a staff in her hands and was accompanied by dancers in bondage themed costumes, while the backdrop screens depicted images of gumdrops and candies. For the 2009 extension of the tour, the backdrop video for [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was replaced by a new one by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and spitting out neon-colored icing. Madonna also wore new opening outfit designed by Riccardo Tisci. The live {{performance of}} the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|E
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was {{performed}} as the closing {{song of the}} [...] "Futuristic rave with Japanese influence" [...] section. During the last segment of the show, Madonna wore a futuristic robotic dress with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. She opened the breastplate from the previous performance, and started singing [...] "Give It 2 Me". Parts of the lyrics of the song <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the screens {{in the style of}} a shooter video game, featuring 1980s games like Space Invaders and Asteroids. Gradually, more and more dancers joined Madonna, and together they started jumping on stage. Williams appeared on the screens to sing his lines. He made a special guest appearance, for the performances of [...] "Give It 2 Me", at the Madison Square Garden stop of the tour. Near the end of the performance, Madonna asked the crowd to sing along with her while she shouted, [...] "No one is ever going to stop me". The performance ended with video backdrops showing Madonna's sweaty, unsmiling, exhausted face, as she disappeared behind the reformed cubicle-shaped screens, which showed the words, 'Game Over', and [...] "Holiday" [...] started playing in the background.|$|E

500|$|The track {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. BET writer Dominique Zonyeé {{spoke on the}} track, calling it a [...] "high energy, boastful song in which Azealia struts her stuff while reminding you that competitors have nothing on her". Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound thought that the song had [...] "the potential to a true club banger". Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a dexterous flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot of stale rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if she really wants to put her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E
500|$|During the Confessions Tour in 2006, {{the song}} was given a horse riding theme. Madonna wore a tight, black body suit, and {{performed}} the song atop a studded leather S carousel horse, while X-rays of her broken bones, {{the result of a}} horse-riding accident on her 47th birthday, <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the screens behind her. The performance was included on The Confessions Tour live album, released in 2007. In 2008's Sticky & Sweet Tour, Madonna sang the song in Rome and dedicated the song to Pope Benedict XVI, commenting [...] "I'd like to dedicate this song to the Pope, I know he loves me" [...] and saying that she is a child of God. She asked the audience to sing along with her. The song was again performed on The MDNA Tour (2012), during the third section of the show. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was stripped down to a simple Burlesque-version played on the piano, featuring elements of the soundtrack [...] "Evgeni's Waltz" [...] from the film, W.E. On the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016), a bass-heavy version of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended the second act of the show. The remix was created in 2008 by French music producer Denis Zabee, and features elements of [...] "Heartbeat" [...] and [...] "Erotica". Jim Farber of Daily News described it as the show's [...] "most stunning move". The performance was included in the live album Rebel Heart Tour recorded in Sydney, Australia, and released in September 2017.|$|E
500|$|By 1966, the group's {{repertoire}} consisted {{mainly of}} {{rhythm and blues}} songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in March 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, noticed them. Jenner {{was impressed by the}} sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend Andrew King became their manager. The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 (...) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the [...] "Sound" [...] part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink Floyd. Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in the Sunday Times which stated: [...] "At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> a huge screen behind them... apparently very psychedelic." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show had}} an expandable, five-platform stage which {{displayed}} the album's cover art. Madonna, wearing a skintight black {{suit and a}} lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick, as the music of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] started. Images of confectionery <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> the television screens flanking {{the back of the}} stage. Madonna, along with her six dancers, gyrated in choreographed dance moves. Next, Madonna strapped on an acoustic guitar, took a swig from a champagne bottle and started singing [...] "Miles Away", as images of planes taking off and landing, airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her. After that [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was performed, which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock. Then Madonna paused for a moment to thank her collaborators, including Timberlake, West, Timbaland and others. [...] "I feel like the luckiest girl in the world", she said, before dedicating the next song, [...] "Hung Up" [...] from 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, to her fans. The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It was followed by [...] "Give It 2 Me", during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Music" [...] (2000), during which her dancers emerged from a false, silver subway car door. Madonna danced across the stage, touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a score of}} 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", Season 3's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", Season 4's [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", and Season 5's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with {{different}} themes: French Baroque–Marie Antoinette Revival, Military–Army, Circus–Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. It began with [...] "The Beast Within", an ominous recitation from the Book of Revelation by Madonna and the screens displaying Madonna's X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS installations. Once the introduction had finished, Madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset (for some European shows she wore a lilac one), striking yoga poses to perform [...] "Vogue". It {{was followed by the}} energetically performed [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] on a conveyor belt with some of the words to the song appearing on the screens, then [...] "Frozen", during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny, were displayed on the backdrops. This video was directed by Chris Cunningham, who directed Madonna's original music video to the song. The military segment started with the sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing [...] "American Life" [...] as war footage of death and destruction <b>flashed</b> <b>on</b> screens behind her (at the end of the song, it showed a George W.

During the performance Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. She also twirled army rifles during a march-like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". During the latter's performances, the backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens. A remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.|$|E
