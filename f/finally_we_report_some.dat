40|$|Abstract — Satellite {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most popular next generation communication technologies for global communication networks in parallel to terrestrial communication networks. In modern age military intelligence, navigation & positioning, weather forecasting, digital video Broadcasting (DVB), and broadband internet services, are the few demanding applications of Satellite communication. Although Satellite {{communication is}} cost effective solution for such long distance communication application, However security over the link is still a major concern in satellite communication. Due to limitations such as high bit error rate, power control, large distance between end nodes, high link delays because of large round trip times, and link availability, common security techniques incorporate a lot of issues in implementation of proper secure communication over the satellite links. In this survey paper, we explore the importance of security, trivial and currently deployed security tools, and the limitations to be considered while deploying such security techniques and protocols for securing satellite communication. <b>Finally</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> <b>some</b> future research space in process to further optimize the security tools and measures for the proper security frame work over the satellite communication infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary AO systems, {{such as the}} Multi-Object Adaptive Optics system (MOAO) RAVEN {{currently}} {{associated with}} the Subaru Telescope, can suer from signicant Non-Common Path Aberrations (NCPA). These errors ultimately aect image quality and arise from optical path dierences between the wavefront sensor (WFS) path and the science path. A typical correction of NCPA involves estimating the aberration phase and correcting the system with an oset on the deformable mirror (DM). We summarize two methods used to correct for NCPA on an experimental bench. We also successfully calibrate the NCPA on RAVEN using one of these methods. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> on <b>some</b> rst science results with RAVEN, obtained after NCPA correction. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze an elastoacoustic {{vibration}} problem employing a dual-mixed formulation in the solid domain. The Cauchy stress tensor and the rotation are the primary variables in the elastic structure while the standard pressure formulation is considered in the acoustic fluid. The resulting mixed eigenvalue problem is approximated by a conforming Galerkin scheme based on the lowest order Lagrange and Arnold-Falk-Winther finite element subspaces in the fluid and solid domains, respectively. We show that the scheme provides a correct approximation of the spectrum and prove quasi-optimal error estimates. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> <b>some</b> numerical experiments. 1...|$|E

According to the formulations, we demonstrate the condition of local transition functions, which induce a global transition of well-formed QCA. Following the results, extending a natural correspondence of classical cells and quantum cells to the correspondence of classical CA and QCA, we have the condition of classical CA such that CA generated by quantization of its cells is well-formed QCA. <b>Finally</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> <b>some</b> results of computer simulations of quantization of classical CA. ...|$|E

40|$|We give an {{efficiently}} executable {{specification of}} the global constraint of lexicographic order in the Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language. In contrast to previous approaches, the implementation is short and concise without giving up on the best known worst case time complexity. It is incremental and concurrent by nature of CHR. It is provably correct and confluent. It is independent of the underlying constraint system, and therefore not restricted to finite domains. We have found a direct recursive decomposition of the problem. We also show completeness of constraint propagation, i. e. that all possible logical consequences of the constraint are generated by the implementation. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> about <b>some</b> practical implementation experiments...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the two-to-one assignment problem, {{a problem in}} between the axial three-index assignment problem and the three-dimensional matching problem, having applications in various domains. For the (relevant) case of decomposable costs satisfying the triangle inequality we provide, on the positive side, two constant factor approximation algorithms. These algorithms involve solving minimum weight matching problems and transportation problems, leading to a 2 -approximation, and a 3 / 2 -approximation. Moreover, we further show that {{the best of these}} two solutions is a 4 / 3 -approximation for our problem. On the negative side, we show that the existence of a polynomial time approximation scheme for our problem would imply P = NP. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> on <b>some</b> computational experiments showing the performance of the described heuristics...|$|R

The method is particularly well suited for calibrating stereo heads with respect to the robot on which they are mounted. We discuss the advantage of on-line (self) versus off-line hand-eye and camera calibrations. We develop two solutions for solving for the hand-eye calibration problem, a closed-form solution and a non-linear least-squares solution. <b>Finally</b> <b>we</b> <b>report</b> on <b>some</b> experiments performed with a stereo head mounted onto a 6 degrees of freedom robot arm...|$|R
