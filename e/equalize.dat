50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally <b>equalized.</b> The difference between externally and internally <b>equalized</b> valves is how the evaporator pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally <b>equalized</b> valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the evaporator, whereas in externally <b>equalized</b> valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the evaporator. Externally <b>equalized</b> thermostatic expansion valves compensate for any pressure drop through the evaporator.|$|R
40|$|Parametrically tunable audio {{equalizers}} are conventionally realized using allpass digital lter networks. They {{consist of}} rst-order shelving lters and second-order <b>equalizing</b> lters. In this paper, ladder wave digital lters (WDFs) with parametrically tunable coecients are proposed as shelving and <b>equalizing</b> lters. Similar to the allpass realization, {{the transfer function}} power complementary property of WDFs is used to obtain ecient shelving and <b>equalizing</b> lters. However, unlike the allpass structures, the transfer function and the tunable parameters of the ladder WDF are derived from the analog lter equivalent of the digital shelving and <b>equalizing</b> lters. For the shelving WDF, the cut-o frequency and gain are tunable, while for the <b>equalizing</b> WDF, the tunable parameters are the center frequency, 3 -dB bandwidth and gain.

5|$|After 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Black {{can avoid}} the {{immediate}} exchange of his Bb4 against the Nd2 in several ways. The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmaster Pavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This can be achieved via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and {{should be able to}} gradually <b>equalize.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benfica opened November with a UEFA Cup match away against German side VfB Stuttgart. They conceded {{the first}} goal by Cacau {{in the first}} half and let in two more—both headers—in the second. Trapattoni attributted the defeat to the {{superior}} physical ability of the Germans. On 7 November, Benfica hosted Vitória de Setúbal and defeated them 4–0, retaining first place in the league. Six days later, Benfica dropped two points after a 1–0 loss at the Estádio dos Barreiros to Marítimo. On 21 November, Benfica hosted Rio Ave and had a chance to regain the top spot. After building a 3–1 lead at half-time, Benfica allowed the visitors to <b>equalize</b> the game, costing them two more points. Trapattoni criticized his team for the way it conceded the 3–3 draw after a free-kick for Benfica turned into a deadly counter-attack against them. On the following Thursday, Benfica received Dinamo Zagreb for the UEFA Cup. Two first-half goals secured the second win in the group stage for Benfica. On the last match of November, Benfica visited the Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa, home of União de Leiria, where they conceded a goal in a counter-attack and were unable to <b>equalize</b> in over 70 minutes, losing the match. The loss was their first as visitors; the club slid to fourth place, having lost 12 points since the Clássico. Trapattoni said Benfica lacked composure in the conceded goal, a problem he had previously addressed but still occurred. He remained confident because the league was long and very balanced.|$|E

The suit was brought against Wilkinson's predecessor, Martha Layne Collins, and several members of the state government by a group of poor school districts as a means to <b>equalize</b> funding for all the state's school districts. An advocate for education, Wilkinson dropped the governor's office's defense in the suit and joined the plaintiffs when Corns' decision was appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court declared Kentucky's entire public school system unconstitutional and mandated that the legislature reform it.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to <b>equalize</b> risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E

40|$|The Dutch utility Nuon, in {{association}} with hardware supplier Locamation and software supplier Phase to Phase have developed a new innovative system to support the operation of Medium Voltage networks. <b>Equalizing</b> currents arise in MV networks when feeders, that are fed from different substations, are coupled. Especially in urban networks the <b>equalizing</b> currents can be significant and can be very dangerous for the people performing the manual switching operations. The described system is able to predict dynamic <b>equalizing</b> currents. Tests showed that the predicted <b>equalizing</b> current {{is very similar to}} the actual <b>equalizing</b> current. Based upon the predictions of the new system the operators can decide easily whether it is allowed to couple the MV feeders. Nuon has implemented the system for the city of Amsterdam. The system is momentarily operational and used by the operators. All the experience from this project will be used in Nuon’s new concept for substation automation in the upcoming refurbishment projects of secondary systems in Nuon’s MV installations. The new system ensures: higher reliability due to fewer unnecessary protection trips, caused by too large <b>equalizing</b> currents lower maintenance costs. Maintenance is being postponed only when there is a funded safety risk no dangerous situations caused by too large dynamic <b>equalizing</b> current...|$|R

5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to <b>equalize</b> its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of {{the state board of education}} were named as defendants in the case.|$|E

The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E

5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will <b>equalize</b> between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
