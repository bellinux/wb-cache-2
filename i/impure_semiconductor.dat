40|$|The {{transverse}} Nernst [...] Ettingshausen {{effect and}} thermopower of hot charge carriers in nondegenerate <b>impure</b> <b>semiconductors</b> placed at high electric and nonquantized magnetic {{fields in the}} nondiffusion approximation is studied. Arbitrary heating and mutual drag of electrons and long wavelength phonons interacting with electrons are considered. The spectrum of electrons {{is assumed to be}} strong nonparabolic in Kane two [...] band approximation. The case when the electron concentration is high and frequent interelectronic collisions lead to the equilibrium symmetric part of the electron distribution function with effective electron temperature is considered.
