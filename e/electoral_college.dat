5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory in the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, {{but even if the}} anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Clinton {{advocated}} for eliminating the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> {{and promised to}} co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> {{the vote}} was more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} {{constitutionality}} of such a plan. They proposed {{that a group of}} states, through legislation, form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

5|$|Ed Miliband {{subsequently}} won the election, {{the result}} of which was announced on 25 September 2010, after second, third and fourth preferences votes were counted, achieving the support of 50.654% of the <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> defeating his brother by 1.3%. In the fourth and final stage of the redistribution of votes after three candidates had been eliminated, Ed Miliband led in the trade unions and affiliated organisations section of the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> (19.93% of the total to David's 13.40%), but in both the MPs and MEPs section (15.52% to 17.81%), and Constituency Labour Party section (15.20% to 18.14%), came second. In the final round, Ed Miliband won {{with a total of}} 175,519 votes to David's 147,220 votes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} or {{resignation}} of a pope, {{members of the}} College of Cardinals who are under age 80 act as <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> meeting in a papal conclave to elect a successor. Although the conclave may elect any male Catholic as pope, since 1389 only cardinals have been elected.|$|E

5|$|It {{evolved from}} the upper house of the colonial {{assembly}} created in 1650 when Maryland was a proprietary colony controlled by Cecilius Calvert. It consisted of the Governor {{and members of the}} Governor's appointed council. With slight variation, the body to meet in that form until 1776, when Maryland, now a state independent of British rule, passed a new constitution that created an <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> to appoint members of the Senate. This <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City. In 1972, because of a Supreme Court decision, the number of districts was increased to 47, and the districts were balanced by population rather than being geographically determined.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} {{election}} results in elections other than those for the Flemish Parliament (and the Dutch-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> in the European Parliament) gives a somewhat wrong image of the party's support, given that the party only ran in Flanders, the one half of Belgium.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2012, the {{president}} and vice president were elected to second terms. The Obama-Biden ticket won 332 <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> votes to Romney-Ryan's 206 and had a 51–47percent edge in the nationwide popular vote.|$|E
50|$|The Chamber of Deputies was elected, {{but with}} a high tax qualification. The {{election}} took place in two stages, with voters choosing members of <b>Electoral</b> <b>Colleges,</b> who in turn elected Deputies. Members of <b>Electoral</b> <b>Colleges</b> had to pay 300 Francs a year in direct taxes (Article 40), while Deputies themselves had to pay a direct tax of 1000 Francs a year. As taxes were mainly levied on landed wealth, this restricted the Chamber of Deputies to {{a very small percentage}} of the richest landowners. The representative basis of the French parliament under the Charter was thus much narrower than that which had been used to elect the Estates-General under the ancient regime. Moreover, the Presidents of the <b>Electoral</b> <b>Colleges</b> were appointed by the King, giving the government the ability to influence the outcome of elections.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the Senate {{included}} an elective element, chosen by corporatist <b>electoral</b> <b>colleges,</b> including the chambers of commerce, industry, and agriculture, {{as well as}} university professors.|$|R

5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b> In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b> Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E
5|$|The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was {{ratified}} in 1961, {{granting the}} District three {{votes in the}} <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> for the election of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The current {{president}} of Pakistan is Mamnoon Hussain of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). He {{was elected president}} on 30 July 2013, winning {{a majority in the}} <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> with 432 of 702 votes, and took oath on 9 September 2013.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Policy and {{the courts}} of justice, {{controlled}} by the plantation owners, constituted the center of power in British Guiana. The colonists who sat on the Court of Policy {{and the courts}} of justice were appointed by the governor {{from a list of}} nominees submitted by two <b>electoral</b> <b>colleges.</b> In turn, the seven members of each College of Electors were elected for life by those planters possessing twenty-five or more slaves. Though their power was restricted to nominating colonists to fill vacancies on the three major governmental councils, these <b>electoral</b> <b>colleges</b> provided a setting for political agitation by the planters.|$|R
