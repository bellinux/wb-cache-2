5|$|Like its predecessor, CryoSat-2 was {{constructed}} by EADS Astrium, with its main instrument being built by Thales Alenia Space. Construction {{and testing of}} the spacecraft's primary instrument was completed by February 2008, when it was shipped for integration {{with the rest of}} the spacecraft. In August 2009, the spacecraft's <b>ground</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> which had been redesigned since the original mission, was declared ready for use. Construction and testing of the spacecraft had been completed by mid-September. The Project Manager for the CryoSat-2 mission was Richard Francis, who had been the Systems Manager on the original CryoSat mission.|$|E
25|$|An airline {{provides}} {{scheduled service}} with aircraft between airports. Air travel has high speeds, but incurs large waiting times {{prior to and}} after travel, and is therefore often only feasible over longer distances or in areas where a lack of <b>ground</b> <b>infrastructure</b> makes other modes of transport impossible. Bush airlines work more similarly to bus stops; an aircraft waits for passengers and takes off when the aircraft is full.|$|E

Additionally, the service sells merchandise and holds regular fund raising events, such as public open days at its Symonston base. Additionally, the <b>ground</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is jointly funded by both the ACT Government and NSW Health who provide 24hour medical staff as well as training facilities.|$|E
25|$|One {{obstacle}} that {{conventional and}} hybrid airships face is {{their inability to}} control buoyancy without venting helium. Another operational challenge faced by airships and hybrid airships is the inability to control or adjust static lift during operations. Traditional airships' requirement for external ballast exchange and existing <b>ground</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has significantly limited their cargo utility. Once the cargo is off-loaded, traditional helium-dependent airships become extremely light, and this static lift causes them to float away. To combat these forces, they require external ballast exchange, using rocks, ice, water, or lead bags, to keep the airship anchored to the ground.|$|E

40|$|As routine space {{operations}} {{extend beyond}} earth orbit, {{the ability for}} <b>ground</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to take on new launch vehicle systems and a more complex suite of spacecraft and payloads has become a new challenge. The U. S. Vision for Space Exploration and its Constellation Program provides opportunities for our space operations community to meet this challenge. Presently, as new flight and ground systems add to the overall groundbased and space-based capabilities for NASA and its international partners, specific choices are being made {{as to what to}} abandon, what to retain, as well as what to build new. The total <b>ground</b> and space-based <b>infrastructure</b> must support a long-term, sustainable operation after it is all constructed, deployed, and activated. This paper addresses key areas of engineering concern during conceptual design, development, and routine operations, with a particular focus on: (1) legacy system reusability, (2) system supportability attributes and operations characteristics, (3) ground systems design trades and criteria, and (4) technology application survey. Each key area explored weighs the merits of reusability of the infrastructure in terms of: engineering analysis methods and techniques; top-level facility, systems, and equipment design criteria; and some suggested methods for making the operational system attributes (the "-ilities") highly visible to the design teams and decisionmakers throughout the design process...|$|R
