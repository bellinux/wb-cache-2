40|$|Following their <b>harvest,</b> <b>cut</b> roses are {{generally}} stored dry {{prior to and}} during transport and only rewetted once they {{near the end of}} the chain. This treatment results in overall dehydration of the rose shoots and to the development of emboli within the xylem of the stems. A major consequence of this dehydration event will be stomatal closure as a result of the water stress that develops in the leaves. In addition to reducing water loss from the leaves, stomatal closure will also have major effects on leaf photosynthesis. Quantitative chlorophyll fluorescence imaging of leaves (or any other photosynthetic tissue) permits the visualisation of how efficiently light is being used to drive photosynthetic electron transport. Stomatal closure affects photosynthesis and thus photosynthetic electron transport. So, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging can be used to visualise the responses of leaves to the water stress imposed by cutting and the relief of water stress by rewetting. Results show that the degree of recovery of stomatal opening is generally only partial and that in addition to a persistent limitation of stomatal opening, there is an effect on photosynthetic electron transport due to processes acting at the level of the mesophyll. The results obtained illustrate the usefulness of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to rapidly and effectively visualise and measure the effect of water stress on cut flowers and to quantify their recovery from this stres...|$|E
40|$|Two {{field trials}} were {{conducted}} at Crop Research Division, D. S. I. R., Lincoln, in the 1971 / 72 and 1972 / 73 seasons to examine ways {{of reducing the}} cost of establishing lucerne and reducing the loss of production in the first year. Trial I examined {{the effect of a}} spring sown barley (cv Zephyr) cover crop at three seeding rates, 0, 56 and 112 kg/ha, on lucerne sown at the same time at three seeding rates, 2. 9, 3. 8 and 5. 8 kg/ha with and without irrigation. The 1971 / 72 season was drier than normal but lucerne establishment was unaltered by a cover crop regardless of seeding rate or irrigation treatment. The overall establishment was high with 73 % of viable seeds being present as plants after the first winter at a seeding rate of 2. 9 kg/ha. Lucerne production at the <b>harvest</b> <b>cut</b> was reduced by barley sown at 56 kg/ha to 21 % and 49 % non-irrigated and irrigated respectively and remained depressed for two further cuts non-irrigated but yield was restored by the following cut irrigated. Irrigation increased the first season lucerne yield by 100 % clear seeded and 194 % with 56 kg/ha of barley and lucerne seeding rate had no effect on lucerne yield. Undersown lucerne at all seeding rates reduced barley grain yield by 20 % at the low barley seeding rate but lucerne at the high seeding rate only reduced grain yield at the high barley seeding rate. Trial II examined the effect of a winter sown wheat (cv Arawa) and a spring sown barley (cv Research) on the establishment and early yield of lucerne sown in the spring at three seeding rates (2. 25, 9. 0, 35. 0 kg/ha). The influence of cover crop competition was further examined by sowing the cover crops at three seeding rates (56, 112 and 224 kg/ha), and by simulated grazing of the wheat and the use of a herbicide on the barley and clear seeded lucerne. The 1972 / 73 season was drier than normal and although percentage lucerne establishment decreased as the lucerne seeding rate increased, no cover crop treatments effected lucerne establishment. Overall establishment was low with 36. 5 % of viable seed being present as plants after harvest at the 2. 25 kg/ha seeding rate. Lucerne production at the <b>harvest</b> <b>cut</b> was low and was reduced markedly by cover crop treatments and height, root weight and root weight distribution data suggested that wheat had a greater effect than barley. No further cuts w. ere taken in the establishment season but cover crops continued to reduce lucerne yields in four cuts, in the following season. The use of spring sown cereal cover crops for lucerne establishment can be justified on the basis of providing a more profitable return, provided the establishment year production of clear seeded lucerne is low but cannot be justified on the basis of weed suppression. Lucerne seeding rates of 2. 25 and 2. 9 kg/ha produced stands with at least 30 plants/m² which was a density sufficient for maximum production...|$|E

Measurements of greenhouse microclimate and production and quality characteristics of a gerbera crop were carried out under two irrigation frequency regimens in soilless cultivation in a greenhouse located in Arta, Greece. Irrigation scheduling was based on solar radiation and performed whenever accumulated solar radiation energy outside the greenhouse reached 1650 kJ. m(- 2) [high irrigation frequency (HIF) ] or 3300 kJ. m(- 2) [low irrigation frequency (LIF) I.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : Our {{objective}} was to find habitat associations at a microhabitat level for two endemic birds in a Chilean temperate forest (biodiversity “hotspots”), in order to integrate biodiversity into forest planning. Area of study : Nahuelbuta Range, Chile. Material and methods : The two birds studied were Scelorchilus rubecula (Chucao Tapaculo) and Scytalopus magellanicus (Magellanic Tapaculo), both belonging to the Rhinocryptidae family. Presence or absence of the two species was sampled in 57 census spots. Habitat was categorized according to presence/absence results. We assessed the influence of abiotic variables (altitude, exposure, slope) and vegetation structure (percentage of understory cover, number of strata) using a statistical cluster analysis. Main results : The two bird species selected the habitat. Most frequent presence was detected at a range of 600 - 1100 masl, but Magellanic Tapaculo was associated to more protected sites in terms of vegetation structure (50 - 75 % for understory cover and 2 - 3 strata). Slope was the most relevant abiotic variable in habitat selection due to its linkage to vegetation traits in this area. Research highlights : Our results can help managers to integrate biodiversity (endemic fauna species) into forest planning by preserving certain traits of the vegetation {{as part of a}} habitat (at a microhabitat level) selected by the fauna species.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of cutting frequency, harvest season and nitrogen fertilization on yield and floristic composition of the herbage harvested from a mountain meadow. The meadow was divided into 22 plots, each receiving a different N P K fertilization treatment. The study lasted seven years, and during the first three years (1985 - 1987) each plot was harvested twice per year (June and September) according to a traditional harvest system, whereas in the years 1989 - 1991 each plot was harvested three times per year (spring, summer and autumn) following a more intensive harvest system. Nitrogen fertilizer favoured the development of the grasses in spring, thus reducing the proportion of legumes in the two <b>cut</b> <b>harvest</b> system, whereas grasses reached an advanced stage of maturity before the first cut in late June. However, the three <b>cut</b> <b>harvest</b> system entailed an earlier first cut in spring.

40|$|Abstract Background Strictly {{intravascular}} {{approaches for}} the treatment of postangioplasty restenosis are effective in the intima and the inner parts of the media but may be insufficient to control redundant pathways in the more outer parts of the media and the adventitia. An inverse situation may occur subsequently to a strictly extravascular approach, like the recently suggested pericardial approach in pigs. We hypothesized that simultaneous intra/extravascular administration of anti-restenotic agents inhibits restenosis by blocking all stimulatory pathways in the entire arterial wall. Methods Fresh hearts of 25 domestic pigs were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Left anterior descending coronary arteries (LAD) were <b>harvested,</b> <b>cut</b> into cylindric 5 mm segments, and cultured as ex vivo porcine organ cultures (POCs). After 9 bar ballooning simultaneous intra/extravascular administration of high dose diltiazem (50 μg/mL) was carried out for a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the agreement between the opinions of specialists in fetal medicine with ex vivo observations on the potential influence of the angle of needle insertion on the fluid leak through the created defect in human fetal membranes. STUDY DESIGN: Membranes from placentas of women who were delivered by elective cesarean were <b>harvested,</b> <b>cut</b> in pieces, and secured {{to the bottom of}} plastic tubes filled with Hartmann solution. They were punctured with 18 -, 20 -, or 22 -gauge needles, with an angle of insertion of 90 degrees (group 1) or 45 degrees (group 2), and the flow rate (in milliliters per minute) through the created defect at a constant pressure of 150 mm H(2) O was measured. Fifty physicians performing amniocentesis at fetal medicine reference centers were interviewed about their impression and clinical attitude with respect to the angle of needle insertion at the time of amniocentesis. RESULTS: In the ex vivo study, puncture with a 45 degrees angle was associated with a significantly lower flow of fluid through the membrane defect for all needle sizes tested. Regarding survey answers, 82 % of physicians try to perform amniocentesis with a given angle (ie, 90 degrees {{in the vast majority of}} cases). Among the reasons for doing so, minimizing membrane damage was mentioned in more than half of cases. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that the angle of needle insertion influences the type of defect and therefore the flow rate through human membranes.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Surgical {{preparation}} of coronary conduits for {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting may affect their early and long-term patency; one mechanism may involve endothelial damage. We investigated the effect of 3 commonly used solutions—Ringer's solution, normal saline solution, and heparinized whole blood—on in vitro endothelial and contractile functions of the human radial artery. Methods: Radial artery segments were <b>harvested,</b> <b>cut</b> into 3 -mm rings, and stored in unoxygenated Ringer's solution, normal saline solution, or heparinized whole blood for 45 minutes. Rings stored in Krebs solution were used as controls. The rings were then mounted and stretched to an optimal resting tension in oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 °C. Contraction responses to potassium, norepinephrine, and serotonin and relaxation responses to acetylcholine, verapamil, and nitroprusside were evaluated. Results: Fifty-six radial artery ring segments from 14 patients (n = 7 rings for each contaction-relaxation curve) were studied. Equilibrated resting tension was 9. 6 ± 0. 3 mN (5. 9 ± 0. 2 g), and resting internal circumference was 6. 4 ± 0. 2 mm. Absolute maximum contraction to potassium was significantly less in rings stored in normal saline solution than in rings stored in control solution (10. 7 ± 0. 6 g vs 14. 5 ± 0. 6 g, P <. 01; 95 % confidence intervals, 0. 9 - 6. 9). There {{was no difference in}} the contraction to norepinephrine (P =. 11) and serotonin (P =. 25) among the 3 solutions compared with the control solution.
