25|$|On 6 December 2011, ROC Vice President Vincent Siew commended {{members of}} Taiwanese Muslim delegates for {{completing}} their 2011 Hajj pilgrimage in November 2011. The delegation was headed by Chu Yun-ching, former Chairman of the Chinese Muslim Association. In his remark, Siew said that Islam {{is one of}} the most influential religion in the world with 1.7 billion of followers. Its main principle is respecting God, helping the poor, doing good, preventing evil and practicing respect and tolerance. All of these teachings have made indelible contributions to civilizations. According to Siew, King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia had reassured the oil supply to Taiwan during the 1973 oil crisis. Saudi Arabia also has helped Taiwan in providing interest-free loans to help Taiwan completed its Ten Major Construction Projects during the 1970s. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that the caring and peace-loving spirit of Islam is an important asset for all mankind, and that the Taiwanese should not forget their deep friendship with the Muslim world.|$|E
500|$|<b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of the statement's final sentence: [...] "That's {{honestly}} {{the best}} Philip Morris and Big Tobacco {{can come up}} with — We've {{spent a lot of money}} and have a lot of investors so please don't mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits ... It's an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them — or live in the same house with them." ...|$|E
500|$|The Eagles {{finished}} the 2004 {{season with a}} 13–3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they were to play the AFC Champion New England Patriots. During the week {{leading up to the}} game, Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick. [...] Asked to identify the members of the Patriots' secondary, Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly. <b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "had something" [...] for safety Rodney Harrison. Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a [...] "jerk." [...] Normally tight-lipped coach Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell, [...] "ll he does is talk. [...] He's terrible, and you can print that. [...] I was happy {{when he was in the}} game." [...] Mitchell caught only one pass for 11yards in the 24–21 loss. After the Super Bowl, Mitchell continued to sound off in interviews in which he criticized the Patriots, as well as Belichick, saying that the way the Patriots reacted reminded him of [...] "little girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marmaduke looked foolish, {{and then}} sulky. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> brightened, and <b>said,</b> [...] "Look here. Youre {{angry with me}} for {{bringing}} your brother last night. But upon my soul I had no idea--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kelley {{considered}} for a breath or two; his brain was sluggish. [...] "Open the door, Rosie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> and backed against the wall.|$|R
25|$|At this time, the Thai Royal Family {{was not yet}} {{interested}} in meditation. When Ajaan Lee <b>finally</b> left Bangkok, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> eventually the royals would be {{interested in}} meditation, and a forest monk would come back at that time to teach.|$|R
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. <b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper on the {{television}} show Ebert & Roeper said, [...] "If you love classic and stylish mood Westerns such as McCabe and Mrs. Miller and The Long Riders, this is your film." [...] Roger Ebert noted the [...] "curiously erotic dance of death" [...] between James and the [...] "mesmerized" [...] younger Ford. <b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If Robert cannot be the lover of his hero, what would be more intimate than to kill him?" [...] He notes that it has the [...] "space and freedom" [...] of classic Western epics, where [...] "the land is so empty, it creates a vacuum demanding men to become legends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men {{arrested for}} the crime have vehemently denied {{involvement}} in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators {{tried to get him}} to testify falsely against Zach Adams. The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that [...] "hey kept him up all night, would not give him anything to eat or drink and <b>finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'What do you want me to say? According to family members, Dylan has some ability to read, but cannot perform other tasks such as telling time, and they believe that Dylan is being manipulated.|$|E
6000|$|He {{waited so}} long that I {{supposed}} it {{for the purpose of}} repudiating the assumption on which my action had been founded; but what <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> was: [...] "Do you mean now--here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Swede wavered. [...] "Ay tank yes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> and {{the last}} Rasmunsen saw of him his {{vocabulary}} was going to wreck in a vain effort to explain the mistake to the other fellows.|$|R
5000|$|That {{same year}} O'Horgan would also direct the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar that became popular with audiences and that, like Hair, {{would later be}} made into a movie. Superstar was notable for the {{performance}} of Ben Vereen as Judas Iscariot.- whom O'Horgan directed previously on Broadway in the role of Hud in Hair. According to playwright Robert Patrick, O'Horgan didn't want to accept the job but relented <b>finally</b> because <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Bob ... You wouldn't believe the money they just offered me." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse {{trying to get rid of}} a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. <b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Mark LeVine {{noted that}} the events in Tunisia could spiral {{into the rest of}} the Arab world as the {{movement}} was [...] "inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate." [...] He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted [...] "Kefaya" [...] and [...] "We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;" [...] and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as [...] "the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution." [...] He pointed to an article in al-Nahar that talked of an [...] "inhuman globalisation" [...] that had been imposed on the Arab world, however a [...] "human" [...] nationalism had not taken place. LeVine then accused the Obama administration in the United States of double standards when Clinton was in the region meeting with political and civil society leaders; however, she responded to a question about the protests, saying [...] "We can't take sides", which was read as a failure to seize the [...] "reins of history" [...] and [...] "usher in a new era" [...] to [...] "defeat the forces of extremism" [...] without the violent conflict in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area. Pointing out Clinton's remarks about regimes whose [...] "foundations are sinking into the sand" [...] and needed [...] "reform", LeVine argued that US foreign policy in the Middle East and the Muslim world was [...] "equally in danger of sinking into the sands if the President and his senior officials are not willing to get ahead of history's suddenly accelerating curve." [...] He added, [...] "It is the US and Europe, as much as the leaders of the region, who in Clinton's words are in need of 'a real vision for that future.'" [...] <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> there were two scenarios that could play out: [...] "a greater democratic opening across the Arab world," [...] or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the democratic election was annulled and the Algeria went into a civil war.|$|E
60|$|Peter blinked very hard. He {{was trying}} to {{understand}} and he couldn't. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> so.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph {{appeared}} {{to allow that}} there was a good deal in this, and he surrendered to thought while his companion watched him askance. [...] "If I should invite Mr. Goodwood," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "it would be to quarrel with him." ...|$|R
60|$|Sam {{could not}} content himself with sitting down, and so lounged around {{in one place}} and another, and <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would go inside and write a letter to the folks at home. He was still writing when Tom came in to join him.|$|R
25|$|Alexei Navalny, {{greeted with}} a ovation when <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> spoke, <b>said</b> there were enough people present at the protest to march to and overrun the Kremlin, but that they were {{committed}} to remaining peaceful, {{at least for the}} moment.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was silent}} for a time, staring at the ceiling. She held some water to his lips and he drank eagerly. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in a faint voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|Aubrey {{was looking}} at Ethel all the time Gertrude was triumphing; and <b>finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I've no {{absolute}} faith in disinterested philanthropy to a younger brother--whatever I had before I went to the Tyrol.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{loath to}} let me have it even, for such a purpose, though I told him that you were once a monk of the order. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that his {{conscience}} would not allow him to lend it, but that he would sell it to me for six pennies, which I gladly gave him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} {{if they wanted to}} know what there is below here," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> half to himself. [...] "I mistrusted them from the minute they got into the yawl without takin' the trouble to shove her bow off, an' if I ain't mistaken there'll be {{mischief}} done before this 'ere brig reaches port!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is an {{adventure}} I {{would like to}} have," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> {{in a tone of}} enthusiasm. [...] "I can't understand why it shouldn't be possible to hit upon some hiding place within half a mile of the city, and on a stormy night, for instance, lug away precious metal enough to make ourselves rich." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bermuda {{roads are}} made by cutting down a few inches into the solid white coral--or a good many feet, where a hill intrudes itself--and {{smoothing}} off {{the surface of the}} road-bed. It is a simple and easy process. The grain of the coral is coarse and porous; the road-bed has the look of being made of coarse white sugar. Its excessive cleanness and whiteness are a trouble in one way: the sun is reflected into your eyes with such energy as you walk along that you want to sneeze all the time. Old Captain Tom Bowling found another difficulty. He joined us in our walk, but kept wandering unrestfully to the roadside. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> explained. <b>Said</b> <b>he,</b> [...] "Well, I chew, you know, and the road's so plagued clean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Cheeko's brother kept {{creeping}} nearer and {{nearer to}} the edge of the thorns, looking back at me every once in a while, as if believing I'd be scared out of my wits because he was so venturesome; but I never opened my mouth and <b>finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with a flirt of his tail: ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Percy again {{tried to}} smother that {{tiresome}} little yawn, which seemed most distressing, when he desired {{to be most}} polite. Then he flicked off a grain of dust from his immaculate lace ruffle and buried his long, slender hands in the capacious pockets of his white satin breeches; <b>finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with the most good-natured of smiles: ...|$|E
60|$|Waldron {{seemed to}} hesitate. Though {{he was a}} very active-minded and {{intelligent}} boy in respect to what he saw and heard, he was somewhat backward in respect to knowledge of books and skill in writing. <b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he should be willing to tell Mr. George what he saw, but he did not think that he could write it.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegraph}} operator mused for a moment. Then {{he asked}} Earl {{who he was}} and where <b>he</b> lived, and <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> guessed it would be all right. The message was again written out, and ten minutes later it was on its long journey westward, by way of Boston. The business finished, Earl thanked the operator and started on his return home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have a good}} mind to {{stay with}} you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The idea that I have been where silver could be had for the labor of {{carrying}} it away, and didn't get any, makes me angry with myself. Now that Mr. Walters has concluded to try his hand at it I believe I'll do the same thing." ...|$|R
2500|$|These early-morning telegrams from Bethmann Hollweg {{were given}} by Tschirschky to Berchtold {{while the two}} men lunched on Thursday, 30 July. Tschirschky {{reported}} to Berlin that:"Berchtold listened pale and silent while they {the Bethmann telegrams} were read through twice; Count Forgach took notes. <b>Finally,</b> Berchtold <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would at once lay the matter before the Emperor." ...|$|R
6000|$|Papa {{has just}} begun to play chess, and he is very fond of it, so he [...] has engaged to play with Mrs. Charles Warner every morning from 10 [...] to 12, he came down to supper last night, full of this {{pleasant}} [...] prospect, but evidently with something on his mind. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] to mamma in an appologetical tone, Susy Warner and I have a plan.|$|E
6000|$|... "In Charlottetown I {{consulted}} a doctor. He punched and pounded me, and poked things {{at me and}} listened {{at the other end}} of them; and <b>finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> I must stop work 'immejutly and to onct' and hie me straightway to a climate not afflicted with the north-east winds of Prince Edward Island in the spring. I am not to be allowed to do any work until the fall. Such was his dictum and Mrs. Williamson enforces it.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{not able}} to suggest anything; indeed, I had to be {{swallowing}} and swallowing, all the time, and did not like to trust myself to speak. Thompson fell to maundering, in a desultory and low-spirited way, about the miserable experiences of this night; and he got to referring to my poor friend by various titles,--sometimes military ones, sometimes civil ones; and I noticed that as fast as my poor friend's effectiveness grew, Thompson promoted him accordingly,--gave him a bigger title. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Mrs. Cooper, of Los Angeles, could advance {{no reason}} for his suicide, but told police he had been morose over alleged snubs he had {{received}} in Washington when he sought to inform officials of German activities <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> discovered in Mexico. <b>Finally,</b> she <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> had conferred with his close friend and writing collaborator, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, {{but she did not}} know the result of their conferences. Mrs. Cooper said her husband had made an exhaustive investigation in Mexico several months earlier and unearthed details of German conditions and propaganda there.|$|R
5000|$|When Casper Christensen {{was first}} {{appointed}} postmaster and bishop, a postal inspector found him {{working in the}} field and tried to make him understand that he wanted to inspect his postal records. <b>Finally</b> in desperation <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You don't seem to know who I am. I am a postal inspector." [...] Brother Casper indignantly replied, [...] "And YOU don't know who I am. I'm the Bishop on the Creek!" [...] Town residents have continued to use this phrase when dealing with someone who was self-important.|$|R
60|$|Tregarthen {{took the}} captain by the hand, {{and gave his}} hand {{to each of the}} young men, but {{positively}} and <b>finally</b> answered No. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> they trusted to his word, and he was glad of it, and at rest in his mind; but there was no proof, and the money must remain as it was. All were very earnest over this; and earnestness in men, when they are right and true, is so impressive, that Mr. Pettifer deserted his cookery and looked on quite moved.|$|R
