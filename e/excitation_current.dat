The diesel-driven direct current (DC) double-armature generators supplied electricity to three 1,335hp Strömberg DC motors, two driving fixed-pitch propellers in the stern and the third coupled to a single forward-facing propeller in the bow, through a Ward Leonard drive system.

2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the <b>excitation</b> <b>current</b> in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E

40|$|In recent times, {{researchers}} show {{a growing}} interest in the control of permanent magnet synchronous motor, which is superior to conventional induction motor in several performance and efficiency aspects. Particular attention {{is given to the}} brushless dc motor (BLDC), as it is gaining popularity in low to medium power applications including adjustable speed drive and electric vehicle. Most works pertaining to BLDC control focus on dynamic performance improvement. However, limited works have been reported for BLDC efficiency optimisation. From an energy perspective, maximum efficiency operation is desired, as energy saving closely ties to the operating capacity and thermal dissipation, particularly for battery powered systems. This dissertation presents a comprehensive motor modelling and analytical power loss modelling in the Matlab/Simulink environment that account for major loss mechanisms in a three phase inverter-fed BLDC motor through closed form equations. To explore the change in motor power losses under variable <b>current</b> <b>excitation,</b> two well-known <b>current</b> <b>excitation</b> schemes, namely sinusoidal and square <b>current</b> <b>excitations,</b> have been implemented to facilitate comparison of efficiencies of the resulting motor operations. Key power loss components are identified and examined, for both <b>current</b> <b>excitation</b> schemes, under the context of variable motor operating speed. The closed-loop system model is simulated under MATLAB/Simulink environment. Power losses under two <b>current</b> <b>excitation</b> schemes are investigated across different speed regions under nominal load. The complete motor drive has been experimentally implemented using digital signal processor based control board for a low power BLDC. The experimental results validate the higher efficiency due to sinusoidal <b>current</b> <b>excitation</b> across a wide speed region, compared to square wave <b>current</b> <b>excitation.</b> The resulting work contributes methodologically to the broader problem of efficiency optimising control.
