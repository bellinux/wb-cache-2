To assess wood quality in energy terms, studies have focused more on the holocellulose and lignin content than on the role of extractives. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the relationship between the extractive content in cold water, in dichloromethane and total on energy properties of wood and charcoal, from six trees species. The extractives were removed with different solvents to be recorded and <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value of wood was determined. The wood was carbonized at 1. 67 °C/min heating rate until maximum of 450 °C and residence time of 30 min. The extractive content was correlated with the gravimetric yield, apparent relative density, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon and <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value of charcoal. The removal of total extractives and extractives soluble in dichloromethane reduced the <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value of wood of most species evaluated.

30|$|In this study, an {{investigation}} {{on the effects}} of compaction pressure, drying temperature and binder ratio on briquette combustion and physical properties was done. Mathematical models for predicting <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value, ash content, relaxed density, moisture content and shatter index as function of input factors were determined. It was established that molasses mass fraction had predominant effects on all properties investigated. As molasses amount were increased, ash content, moisture content, relaxed density and shatter index were significantly increased while fixed carbon and <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value were significantly reduced. Drying temperature did not have major influence on shatter index, relaxed density, ash content and <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value. However, drying temperature had a dominating influence on the moisture content. Compaction pressure had negligible influences on all briquette properties. Therefore, such high pressure which involves energy consumption is not necessary during production of charcoal dust briquettes.

30|$|Physical {{and thermal}} {{properties}} of briquettes produced by recycling charcoal dust under different processing conditions {{have been reported}} in this study. The main aim was to investigate the effects of the binder and processing conditions on the properties of briquettes. The effect of adding molasses binder on combustion properties of the briquette was first assessed. Then by fitting experimental data, mathematical models to predict <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value, ash content, moisture content, relaxed density and shatter index with respect to binder mass fraction, drying temperature and compaction pressure were developed. All briquettes properties were predominantly affected by amount of molasses used.

Drying temperature did not have major influence on briquette properties except moisture content.

40|$|The {{climate change}} has driven towards {{transformation}} {{from the high}} energy dependence on fossil fuel to inexhaustible renewable energy such as solar, wind, mini hydro and biomass. In Malaysia, abundant of palm biomass residues are produced during the processing of fresh fruit bunch. Therefore it is inevitable to harness these bioenergy sources {{in order to prevent}} waste accumulation at adjacent to palm mills. In order to utilize such bioenergy sources and to cope with the fast growing demand of energy, combination technique of densification and torrefaction is one of the potential ways to be practised. In the present study, the physical and combustion properties of torrefied empty fruit bunch (EFB) briquettes were investigated experimentally with constant nitrogen flow rate of 1 l/min, for various torrefaction temperatures (225 °C- 300 °C). Before torrefaction process, EFB briquettes were initially produced under controlled condition with compaction pressure of 7 MPa and briquetting temperature of 150 °C. In general, the torrefied EFB briquettes were successfully produced in the present study. The results show that an increase in torrefaction temperature from 225 °C to 300 ℃ causes a significant increase in <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value (from around 17400 kJ/kg to 25000 kJ/kg), fixed carbon content (from 16. 2 % to 46. 2 %) and ash content (from 2. 4 % to 17. 2 %). On the other hand, relaxed density and volatile matter decrease, from 1017 kg/m 3 to 590 kg/m 3 and from 73. 1 % to 29. 7 %, respectively. As a conclusion, the <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> value and fixed carbon content are improved due to torrefaction.
