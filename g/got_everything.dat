5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't {{necessarily}} think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

25|$|Following Bale's {{two goals}} against Norwich City on 27 December 2011, manager Harry Redknapp said:If we sell him, we've had it haven't we? It {{would only be}} a Barcelona, a Man City or a Real Madrid who {{would be able to}} pay for him. He's an amazing player. He's <b>got</b> <b>everything,</b> there's not a {{weakness}} in his make-up. He can head the ball, he's as strong as an ox, he can run, dribble and shoot. Most important of all, he's a smashing lad.|$|E

25|$|As {{the days}} pass, Maggie {{develops}} bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She asks a favor of Frankie: {{to help her}} die, declaring that she <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly {{in an attempt to}} bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. The priest Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.|$|E
500|$|Chris Broderick {{compared}} {{some parts}} of the album specifically to Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? (1986), Rust in Peace, or Countdown to Extinction (1992), but also stated [...] "I've been likening it to a very diverse CD. It's not one of those ones that you'll put it on and every song sounds like the last one. It's <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> from anthems to more radio friendly stuff to hard-hitting thrash and some cool, dark-sounding stuff." [...] In a later interview, Broderick again touted the sonic diversity of the album, noting that it is [...] "like a cut in time from each CD of the past Megadeth discography".|$|E
500|$|Reactions to {{his death}} came from many quarters, many paying tribute to his {{scientific}} prowess. His father recalled that [...] "he always <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> the first time. He always excelled." [...] Greg Sampson, Dirks' math teacher at Lewis and Clark, remembered when his student had finished an advanced class in trigonometry in just two weeks, something no other student of his has ever done, saying [...] "he was just an amazing, amazing student." [...] Niles Pierce recalled how Dirks {{was willing to take}} a chance on working with a younger professor. His former postdoc was, he said, [...] "an unusual student, even for Caltech... He did remarkable things." [...] D. E. Shaw Research, his employer, called him [...] "a brilliant scientist who made tremendous contributions to our own research, and to the broader scientific community." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his personal connections to the city, Coyle said filming took place in Minneapolis because it was relatively inexpensive to shoot there and hire local actors. He said, [...] "Shooting in Uptown is a filmmaker's paradise. You've <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> here." [...] Into Tempation was produced and shot on a very low budget of less than $1million. Cinematography was provided by David Doyle, who made extensive use of the Red Digital Cinema Camera. The church scenes were filmed at the Incarnation Church in the city. Sisto and Chenoweth both attended mass services at the church {{as part of their}} research for the roles. Exterior car scenes were shot in the Uptown district. During one scene in particular, a police car with a siren passed by the actors during a shot. The actors continued uninterrupted, and the final shot was used in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Shawn Roberts was {{originally}} going {{to audition for}} Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role. He went to audition {{for the role of}} Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, [...] " [...] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> going for him—he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate—it's all the elements from the game. That was one thing we all agreed on from the start: this character has to be for the fans." [...] Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine, who was last seen in Resident Evil: Apocalypse.

500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E

2500|$|After filming, further editing was {{undertaken}} at the U.K.'s Twickenham Film Studios, {{with the production}} moving back to the U.S. in November 2010. Kahn also said of {{his work on the}} film: [...] "We put together here in Hollywood. It worked well ... Those English actors are awfully good and so were the horses. The horses were beautifully trained. For an editor {{there were a lot of}} match [...] problems with the horses but the shooting was so good that I <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> I needed.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Devo {{recorded}} {{a new version}} of [...] "Whip It" [...] to be used in Swiffer television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted. During an interview with the Dallas Observer, Gerald Casale said, [...] "It's just aesthetically offensive. It's <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> a commercial that turns people off has." [...] The song [...] "Beautiful World" [...] was also used in a re-recorded form for an ad for Target stores. Due to rights issues with their back catalog, Devo has re-recorded songs for films and ads.|$|E

[...] by saying that [...] "I'm not really looking for any sort of recognition. The process was a huge learning experience and I <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> I wanted out of it. But [...] deserves the recognition. She worked really hard." [...] Sarah Lane's involvement in Black Swan was also mentioned in two other dance magazines and in an article on The New York Times website.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an essay}} for the Wall Street Journal, Nathan Rabin wrote that Leno had [...] "raced past the reviled likes of Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia {{on the list}} of popular stand-ups hated by comedians and comedy writers." [...] Bill Zehme, the {{co-author}} of Leno's autobiography Leading with My Chin, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently. He'll be viewed as the bad guy." [...] Joe Queenan from the Wall Street Journal went further in his criticism of Leno, jokingly comparing the controversy to Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
2500|$|In Raleigh, {{the lawyer}} for North Carolina's Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) issued a {{preliminary}} opinion that said [...] "that state law allows people to be sworn in using a Quran rather than a Bible". This was refuted by Guilford County's Senior Resident Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright who sets policy for the county's nine Superior Court courtrooms. Judge Albright stated flatly [...] "An oath on the Quran is not a lawful oath under our law." [...] He maintained that the statute means the Bible and that if {{that is to be}} changed {{it is up to the}} North Carolina Legislature, [...] "It's gotten way out there: They've <b>got</b> <b>everything</b> from the Book of Mormon to the Book of Wicca on the list. Our position is that the statute governs not only the type of oath, but the manner and administration of the oath, and that it's now a legislative matter to straighten out." ...|$|E
