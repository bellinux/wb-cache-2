50|$|Jack's {{death was}} {{announced}} on Facebook:It is with tears that I {{must tell you}} that Jack has gone over the rainbow bridge. (continued in 1st comment) He was with Karen yesterday, and his condition was worsening. He was treated overnight, and she (and I) both had extensive conversations with the vets at Blue Pearl (BluePearl Veterinary Partners) regarding his condition. Jack had extensive wounds {{on the back of his}} body, and the wounds were unable to heal because his skin had deteriorated due to the malnutrition that occurred while he was lost. Despite antibiotics, the infections were worsening, and his skin was continuing to deteriorate. He needed surgery to treat the wounds, but there was not enough available skin to close the wounds after the surgery. The vet compared his skin condition to having severe burns over 50-60% of his body. The vet was very clear that she had conferred with every possible doctor regarding options for Jack, but none of them left him with a substantial chance of survival and all of them involved him suffering. Jack had been through so much, and the last thing anyone wanted was for him to suffer more. Jack was bathed in love and crossed over <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Having <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> sworn on the Holy Book, I {{intend to}} keep my oath and serve as President to all Nigerians. I belong to {{everybody}} and I belong to nobody. A few people have privately voiced fears that on coming back to office I shall go after them. These fears are groundless. There will be no paying off old scores. The past is prologue. Furthermore, we as Nigerians must remind ourselves that we are heirs to great civilizations: Shehu Othman Dan Fodio’s caliphate, the Kanem Borno Empire, the Oyo Empire, the Benin Empire and King Jaja’s formidable domain. The blood of those great ancestors flow in our veins. The most immediate challenge is Boko Haram’s insurgency. Progress {{has been made in}} recent weeks by our security forces but victory can not be achieved by basing the command and control Centre in Abuja. It will be relocated to Maiduguri and remain until Boko Haram is completely subdued. But we can not claim to have defeated Boko Haram without rescuing the Chibok girls and all other innocent persons held hostage by insurgents. This government will do all it can to rescue them alive. Boko Haram is a mindless, godless group who are as far away from Islam as one can think of. It is a national shame that an economy of 180 million people generates only 4,000 MW, and distributes even less. Muhammadu Buhari ...|$|E
50|$|Set at the Ponkwasset Hotel in Boston, {{the first}} act begins with Bartlett and his friend Cummings having a {{conversation}} about Bartlett’s love life. Bartlett is depressed and {{has turned into a}} misanthrope because a girl he went on a date with was not interested in him anymore. As Bartlett is cursing all women and voicing his anger toward the entire female race, Cummings tries to cheer his friend up. He tells him the story of a girl who is still miserable about a break up that happened two years ago in hopes to prove to Bartlett that women do, indeed, have hearts. While they are speaking, General Wyatt, barges in yelling and cursing at Bartlett, ordering him to leave the hotel immediately. Then, when Constance and her mother enter the room, Constance faints at first sight of Bartlett. However, as General Wyatt approaches Bartlett he realizes that he has made the terrible mistake of yelling at a man he has never met before. Nevertheless, Bartlett is very upset and disturbed at the entire situation and storms out of the hotel. Cummings stays to speak with General Wyatt and realizes the general is terribly sorry for his earlier behavior. Once they are alone, General Wyatt tells Cummings the reason why he acted the way he did. Two years ago, Mrs. Wyatt brought Constance to Paris and Constance fell in love with an American man. However, when General Wyatt met the man he was very skeptical about him and soon found out that he was actually married. As a result of this unfortunate discovery, General Wyatt forced this man to end all relations with Constance, leaving her absolutely miserable and harboring a great deal of resentment towards her father, which has lasted for the past two years. Ironically, this was the same exact story that Cummings was telling Bartlett about <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Although General Wyatt initially insisted that Bartlett leave the hotel premises to protect Constance, when Bartlett returns the general begs him to stay at Constance’s request. Despite some initial skepticism, Bartlett agrees to stay.|$|E
