40|$|<b>Isoproturon</b> is {{a widely}} used herbicide[1]. Its first {{metabolite}} is mono-demethyl-isoproturon (D 1 M-Ipo) in environmental condition. Both of them may accumulate and achieve intolerable concentrations in drinking water [2]. The maximum admissible concentration in drinking water set by the European Union is 0. 1 μg/L. Thus, a sensitive and selective method could be preferred for trace analysis of <b>isoproturon</b> and D 1 M-Ipo in water. Two kind of monoclonal anti-isoproturon antibodies were entrapped in a sol-gel matrix, respectively. Depending on their affinity to <b>isoproturon,</b> the two immunoaffinity columns were named LIAC and HIAC. The LIAC can concentrate the <b>isoproturon</b> in 25 mL water with 90 % recovery using 40 % (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) as our previous described [3], but only with 9 % recovery for D 1 M-Ipo. The HIAC can concentrate D 1 M-Ipo in 25 mL water with 95. 6 % recovery using 40 % ACN and <b>isoproturon</b> with 70 % ACN. However, the capacity of HIAC after one time elution of 70 % ACN decreased from 120 ng to 50 ng, that mean the HIAC can’t be reused for the concentration of <b>isoproturon.</b> After ensuring that <b>isoproturon</b> in 40 % ACN will not bind on the HIAC, the LIAC was connected with HIAC by a SPE column adaptor to establish the tandem immunoaffinity extraction method. The LIAC-HIAC was combined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry to determine <b>isoproturon</b> and D 1 M-Ipo simultaneously in surface water, and the linear range was up to 2. 2 μg/l with correlation coefficient higher than 0. 99 and more than 88 % recoveries (n = 8). All of these data proved that tandem immunoaffinity columns were effective and reusable tool for extraction of <b>isoproturon</b> and D 1 M-Ipo from aqueous matrix with good reliability and high selectivity.

The descriptive and moment analyses of the experimental breakthrough curves of bromide and herbicides demonstrated a similar degree of physical non-equilibrium transport for the cropped and grassland soil columns, with transport ranging from a less intense physical non-equilibrium status to the complete physical equilibrium state for the forest soil columns. Chemical non-equilibrium transport was shown for the three situations. Degradation occurred in some columns as demonstrated by the elution of a metabolite of <b>isoproturon.</b> Previous data on sorption and degradation of <b>isoproturon</b> on the same soils were used to explain the differences observed in the analysis of the elution curves between grassed strip, forest and cultivated soil. Averaging Kd values from individual soil layers of each profile gave a satisfying understanding of <b>isoproturon</b> retardation factors. Sorption on soil organic matter was the main factor in herbicide mobility. However, other phenomena such as degradation and formation of non-extractable residues were involved in the differences observed in leached masses of <b>isoproturon</b> between the three situations...|$|E
40|$|Concern {{about the}} {{environmental}} impact in terms of surface and ground water contamination due to excessive use of <b>isoproturon</b> herbicide prompted us to evaluate its leaching behaviour on soil in terms of Groundwater Ubiquity Score (GUS). A spectrophotometric methodology based on the microwave assisted hydrolysis of the herbicide with potassium tert. -butoxide to corresponding aniline and its subsequent deamination and nitration into acidic nitro phenol showing maximum absorbance at 370 nm has been developed. Beers law is obeyed up to 41. 26 ppm of <b>isoproturon</b> solution and the determination {{can be made with}} a maximum RSD of 1. 26 %. GUS has been determined by using experimentally determined soil organic carbon partition coefficient for soil with literature reported half-life of <b>isoproturon.</b> GUS value of 2. 73 classifies it a lecher herbicide representing a serious hazard to surface and groundwater contamination. With a view to reduce contamination risk the effect of farmyard manure on the adsorption of <b>isoproturon</b> on soil and consequently on GUS value has also been studied. The manure amendment not only reduced GUS value to 2. 34 but also served as a source of nutrients, thus improving the soil fertility...|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{assess the}} {{physiological}} effects induced by environmental concentrations of pesticides in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Oysters were exposed for 14 d to trace levels of metconazole (0. 2 and 2 mu g/L), <b>isoproturon</b> (0. 1 and 1 mu g/L), or both {{in a mixture}} (0. 2 and 0. 1 mu g/L, respectively). Exposure to trace levels of pesticides {{had no effect on}} the filtration rate, growth, and energy reserves of oysters. However, oysters exposed to metconazole and <b>isoproturon</b> showed an overactivation of the sensing-kinase AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha), a key enzyme involved in energy metabolism and more particularly glycolysis. In the meantime, these exposed oysters showed a decrease in hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities, whereas 2 -DE proteomic revealed that fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (F- 1, 6 -BP), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, was upregulated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were higher in oysters exposed to the highest pesticide concentrations. Both pesticides enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity of oysters. <b>Isoproturon</b> enhanced catalase activity, and metconazole enhanced peroxiredoxin activity. Overall, our results show that environmental concentrations of metconazole or <b>isoproturon</b> induced subtle changes in the energy and antioxidant metabolisms of oysters...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of <b>isoproturon</b> 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 dimethylurea photoinduced by Fe(III) {{in aqueous solution}} has been investigated. The rate of degradation depends on the concentration of Fe(OH) 2 +, the most photoreactive species in terms of. OH radical formation. These. OH radicals are able to degrade <b>isoproturon</b> until total mineralisation. The formation  of  Fe(II) in the irradiated solution was monitored. The sonophotochemical {{degradation of}} <b>isoproturon</b> {{has been found to}} be dependent on the intensity of sonication. The combination of ultrasound and photochemistry has been used to degrade an aqueous solution of <b>Isoproturon</b> (IP). The degradation of IP in aqueous solution was investigated under sonolysis at          500 kHz and in the presence of Fe(III), as well as under simultaneous sonolysis and photoinduced Fe(III). Coupling photolysis with ultrasound for degradation of IP has been developed. The photosonochemical decomposition rate constant is greater than the additive rate constants of the two processes. Degradation products were analysed by CG/MS performed in the electron-impact (EI) mode, at 70 eV potential using full scan mode. Degradation photoproducts were identified and a mechanism of degradation is proposed for two processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{nature and}} in {{industrial}} musts, pollutants {{are available in}} a complex mixture where some specific microorganisms are able to mineralize or degrade them in more basic and less harmful compounds to the environment. <b>Isoproturon,</b> a phenylurea herbicide, is an environmental contaminant poorly degraded in soils and aquifers, reaching levels considered toxic by European legislation. Thus, it is urgent to discover microorganisms able to degrade or eliminate these pollutants in situations of accidental or systematic contamination, establishing the best culture conditions. Therefore, in this work {{it was intended to}} evaluate if peptone, a nitrogen source, essential for yeast growth, amends the extension of fermentative phase of a wild-type strain S. cerevisiae UE-ME 3 caused by <b>isoproturon.</b> The results show that this wild-type yeast grown in peptone starvation conditions, in presence of 100 µM <b>isoproturon,</b> started early the fermentative-respiratory transition...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{variability}} in sensitivity and pollution induced community tolerance (PICT) to atrazine, <b>isoproturon</b> and diuron and {{a mixture of}} these three herbicides to natural algal assemblages in mesocosms was determined. The specificity of PICT was examined by evaluating co-tolerance pattern for these photosystem-II (PSII) inhibitors. Phytoplankton communities were constantly exposed to equipotent concentrations of atrazine, <b>isoproturon,</b> diuron namely the 30 % hazard concentration (HC 30) obtained from species sensitivity distributions and an equitoxic mixture (3 × 1 / 3 ×HC 30 of each herbicide) for five weeks in outdoor mesocosms. Induction of tolerance to the various herbicides was investigated by photosynthetic efficiency measurements of the algal assemblages in short-term laboratory tests. The composition of the algal communities in the various treatments was determined and ordination techniques such as the principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to log-transformed data to compare the seasonal community structure development. Temporal variation in sensitivity of the control algal assemblage to atrazine and <b>isoproturon,</b> but less to diuron was observed. The results further demonstrated that the control communities were in general more sensitive than the treated ones over the whole period tested indicating an enhanced tolerance of pre-exposed phytoplankton in the mesocosms. Co-tolerance was also observed for atrazine pre-exposed algal community to <b>isoproturon,</b> however, not vise versa. A pre-exposure to diuron induced similar tolerance to all three herbicides. A pre-exposure to the mixture treatment also lead to tolerance to <b>isoproturon</b> and diuron, less to atrazine. Overall, the observed co-tolerance pattern indicates that co-tolerance was not comparable between the herbicides with strong similarity in their biochemical mode of action...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of the phenylurea {{herbicide}} <b>isoproturon</b> by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS 2 {{was significantly}} enhanced when the strain was grown in coculture with a soil bacterium (designated strain SRS 1). Both {{members of this}} consortium were isolated from a highly enriched isoproturon-degrading culture derived from an agricultural soil previously treated regularly with the herbicide. Based on analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene, strain SRS 1 {{was assigned to the}} β-subdivision of the proteobacteria and probably represents a new genus. Strain SRS 1 was unable to degrade either <b>isoproturon</b> or its known metabolites 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1 -methylurea, 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) -urea, or 4 -isopropyl-aniline. Pure culture studies indicate that Sphingomonas sp. SRS 2 is auxotrophic and requires components supplied by association with other soil bacteria. A specific mixture of amino acids appeared to meet these requirements, and it was shown that methionine was essential for Sphingomonas sp. SRS 2. This suggests that strain SRS 1 supplies amino acids to Sphingomonas sp. SRS 2, thereby leading to rapid metabolism of 14 C-labeled <b>isoproturon</b> to 14 CO 2 and corresponding growth of strain SRS 2. Proliferation of strain SRS 1 suggests that <b>isoproturon</b> metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. SRS 2 provides unknown metabolites or cell debris that supports growth of strain SRS 1. The role of strain SRS 1 in the consortium was not ubiquitous among soil bacteria; however, the indigenous soil microflora and some strains from culture collections also stimulate <b>isoproturon</b> metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS 2 to a similar extent...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of the herbicides <b>isoproturon,</b> dichlorprop-p and bifenox via surface runoff was investigated on small plots with simulated erosive rainfall. <b>Isoproturon</b> and dichlorporp-p with water solubilities of 65 and 700 mg/l respectively, were transported {{mainly in the}} water phase and bifenox with a water solubility < 1 mg/l was transported by the sediment phase. <b>Isoproturon</b> and dichlorprop-p concentrations in the runoff mainly depended on the preceding cumulative rainfall. Total <b>isoproturon</b> and dichlorprop-p losses in runoff depended {{on the time of}} runoff initiation as well as on water flux and sediment loss. Factors like soil type, vegetation, or rainfall intensity affected total herbicide losses by influencing the time of runoff initiation as well as total water and soil loss. The <b>isoproturon</b> and dichlorprop-p concentrations in runoff water decreased with increasing cumulative rainfall according to a power function at the beginning of rainfall event. However during the experiment the concentrations may increase due to the occurence of interflow. The bifenox concentration in the sediment phase depend on the amount of preceding soil loss. The time of runoff initiation does not influence the bifenox losses. Experiments on large plots with natural rainfall of high intensity showed that the herbicide losses were comparable to the small plots with simulated erosive rainfall. An decisive fact is that runoff starts relative soon after irrigation. (orig.)

40|$|The {{biomonitoring}} {{of pesticide}} pollution in {{streams and rivers}} using algae such as diatoms remains difficult. The responses of diatomcommunities to toxic stress in streamwater are disturbed by the variations of environmental parameters. In this study, periphytic algae collected in situwere exposed under controlled conditions to two major herbicides used in French agriculture (<b>isoproturon</b> and s-metolachlor). Three exposure regimes were tested: 5 and 30 gL− 1 for 6 days and 30 gL− 1 for 3 days followed by a recovery period of 3 days. The algal biomasses were assessed from pigment concentrations (chlorophyll a and c) and from live cell density. The highest concentration (30 gL− 1) of <b>isoproturon</b> inhibited the biomass increase statistically significantly. In periphyton exposed to 5 and 30 gL− 1 of s-metolachlor, chlorophyll c concentration and live cell densitywere also statistically significantly lower than in the control. Periphyton left to recover after reduced exposure duration (3 days) showed higher growth rates after treatment with s-metolachlor than with <b>isoproturon.</b> Taxonomic identifications showed that species like Melosira varians, Nitzschia dissipata and Cocconeis placentula were not affected by the herbicide exposure. Other species like Eolimna minima and Navicula reichardtiana were more sensitive. Studying diatoms according to their trophic mode showed that facultative heterotroph specieswere statistically significantly favoured by <b>isoproturon</b> exposure at the highest concentration. Results obtained with s-metolachlor exposure showed a disturbance of cell multiplication rather than that of photosynthesis. These results suggest that photosynthesis inhibitors like <b>isoproturon</b> favour species able to survive when the autotroph mode is inhibited...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCompost {{amendments}} and {{tillage practices}} can modify soil structure and create heterogeneities {{at the local}} scale. Tillage affects soil physical properties and consequently water and solute transport in soil, while compost addition to soil influences pesticide sorption and degradation processes. Based on the long-term field experiment QualiAgro (a INRA–Veolia partnership), a modeling study was carried out using HYDRUS- 2 D to evaluate how two different compost types combined {{with the presence of}} heterogeneities due to tillage affect water and <b>isoproturon</b> dynamics in soil compared to a control plot. A municipal solid waste compost (MSW) and a co-compost of sewage sludge and green wastes (SGW) have been applied to experimental plots. In each plot, wick lysimeters, TDR probes, and tensiometers were installed to monitor water and solute dynamics. In the plowed layer, four zones differing in their structure were identified: compacted clods, non-compacted soil, interfurrows, and the plow pan. From 2004 to 2010, the unamended control (CONT) plot had the largest cumulative water outflow (1388 mm) compared to the MSW plot (962 mm) and SGW plot (979 mm). After calibration, the model was able to describe cumulative water outflow for the whole 2004 – 2010 period with a model efficiency value of 0. 99 for all three plots. The CONT plot had the largest <b>isoproturon</b> cumulated leaching (21. 31 μg) while similar cumulated <b>isoproturon</b> leaching was measured in the SGW (0. 663 μg) and MSW (0. 245 μg) plots. The model was able to simulate <b>isoproturon</b> leaching patterns except for the large preferential flow events that were observed in the MSW and CONT plots. The timing of these preferential flow events could be reproduced by the model but not their magnitude. Modeling results indicate that spatial and temporal variations in pesticide degradation rate due to tillage and compost application {{play a major role in}} the dynamics of <b>isoproturon</b> leaching. Both types of compost were found to reduce <b>isoproturon</b> leaching on the 6 year duration of the experiment...|$|E
