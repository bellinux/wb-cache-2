25|$|The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 {{models were}} {{released}} in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was also shorter (from front to rear), and the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> reduced. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), {{as opposed to}} black in previous models.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their B-series of bus chassis, {{with the engine}} mounted above the front-axle, giving a short <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and the door behind the front-axle. The first generation consisted of the B15/B16, the B20/B21/B22 and the B31, primarily divided by weight class, and then by wheelbase. The latter became upgraded in 1948 and renamed 2B20/2B21/2B22 and 3B31. The T31/T32 trolleybus chassis was also available from 1947. In 1950, the next generation was introduced, with the B41/B42, the B61/B62/B63/B64 and later the B83. From then, Scania-Vabis also offered the BF-series chassis, available as BF61/BF62/BF63, which had the engine more conventionally mounted before the front-axle, leaving room for the door on a longer <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> From 1954, the B-series came as B51 and B71, and the BF as BF71 and later BF73. In 1959, the B55, B65 and B75, plus the BF75 were introduced, and were from 1963 available as B56, B66 and B76, plus the BF56 and BF76.|$|E
25|$|The Railway Gazette, {{cited in}} Ahrons, {{suggests}} {{that there was an}} even earlier design for Cornwall, as a 2-2-2 with single 4' wheels both forward and back. It's uncertain if Cornwall was ever built in this form. The drawing does show a considerable <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> with a high load placed on the front axle. If constructed like this, the likelihood is that it would suffer the same problems as its contemporary, Gooch's first 2-2-2 Great Western class of 1846, where a broken front axle led to re-design as a 4-2-2.|$|E
50|$|Large {{overhangs}} {{contribute to}} large vehicle dimensions, {{and the associated}} advantages of size. On front-engined saloon/sedans, measuring rear overhang is helpful in predicting {{the size of the}} trunk. For these same vehicles, large <b>front</b> <b>overhangs</b> can accommodate larger engines. The Porsche 911, produced since 1964, has always contained its entire flat-6 engine within its rear overhang, with the center of mass of the engine outside of the wheelbase. Large overhangs also contribute to safety due to increased bulk, as well as space for crumple zones that provide defense for passengers in frontal and rear collisions. In the case of the 911, the rear-mounted engine allows for increased practicality {{in the form of a}} small rear row of seats that would be impossible with a mid-engined sports car.|$|R
50|$|Kia Motors {{presented}} the fourth generation Rio at the 2016 Paris Motor Show. The new car was designed in Kia's California and Germany design centers, and features longer <b>front</b> <b>overhangs,</b> a bigger hood, {{and a more}} upright C-pillar. The hatchback model is 15 mm longer, 5 mm wider and 5 mm shorter in height than its predecessor. Production began {{by the end of}} 2016. In European markets, the car is only offered in hatchback form while the U.S. market will receive both hatchback and sedan forms. For the North American market, the Rio will be manufactured alongside the Kia Forte at the Pesquería plant in Mexico. Unlike the previous generations, the fourth generation Rio will not be offered in the South Korean market; instead, the Rio-based Stonic crossover will take its place.|$|R
50|$|The Bertone-designed {{exterior}} featured short <b>front</b> {{and rear}} <b>overhangs,</b> rode on 22-inch aluminum wheels, and was painted in Canyon Mist metallic tricoat.|$|R
500|$|A {{lightweight}} steel (not aluminium) {{structure and}} a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front crumple zone, {{in order to}} meet current safety legislation requirements without compromising interior space. With no powertrain in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and lengthen the wheelbase to , giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable kei cars whose wheelbase is typically [...] less. The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.|$|E
2500|$|Designed by Christopher Weil under design chief Adrian Van Hooydonk (till March 1, 2009), the F30/F31 {{has grown}} in all {{dimensions}} compared to its predecessor. The styling is similar to previous generations with a sweeping bonnet, short <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and long wheelbase typical. Headlamps now connect to a wide kidney grill. [...] Tail lamps sport a wide [...] "L" [...] shape design seen in many BMW models.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{lacked the}} funds {{to come up with}} a {{separate}} platform for a sub-compact car, so it did something different with an existing model and [...] "although car snobs make fun of the chop-tailed Gremlin, it was a huge sales hit." [...] The authors of the book 365 Cars You Must Drive [...] "that any self-respecting auto enthusiast just has to know and experience from the driver's seat" [...] describe that [...] "driving a Gremlin isn't about the drive; it's about being seen in one, making a statement that you dig the mid-1970s, and also wouldn't be caught dead in something normal." [...] An article published by Time in 2007 included the Gremlin as one of [...] "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time", describing it as an AMC Hornet with the rear end whacked off, and criticizing its exterior proportions, with a long low snout, long <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and a truncated tail, [...] "like the tail snapped off a salamander".|$|E

50|$|A {{recharging}} {{system that}} avoids {{the need for}} a cable is Curb Connect, patented in 2012 by Dr Gordon Dower. In this system, electrical contacts are fitted into curbs, such as angle parking spaces on city streets. When a suitably authorized vehicle is parked so that its <b>front</b> end <b>overhangs</b> the curb, the curb contacts become energized and charging occurs.|$|R

The first level is clapboard, and the second shingle, reminisant of the earlier Shingle style. Two shed dormers <b>front</b> the <b>overhang</b> roof. There is a pedimented entry porch on the front, and door with entry porch on the west facade. The south facade has a one story {{enclosed}} porch with ribbon windows...|$|R
5000|$|... "The key to {{the look}} of the Trailhawk," [...] said Nick Vardis, Principal Exterior Designer, [...] "is the vehicle's {{distinctive}} proportions, due in part to its 116 in wheelbase. The dash-to-front-axle dimension is dramatically long, giving the vehicle a sense of forward motion, while the <b>front</b> and rear <b>overhangs</b> are tight and abbreviated." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, {{there were}} changes {{to improve the}} axle load, length and {{wheelbase}} remained unchanged with <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> also the engine power increased to 260 hp in the E120H. BU35 is added with 6 m wheelbase.|$|E
50|$|Walsall Corporation {{specified}} some non-standard short-wheelbase Fleetlines, {{the first}} of which, 1 UDH https://www.flickr.com/photos/54957550@N00/384166514/https://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/2334860070/, was only 25 ft 7 in long, had no <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and had its entrance behind the front axle. The next 29 vehicles were 27 ft 6 in long with a short <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and again only an entrance behind the front axle. The remaining 69 were 28 ft 6 in long, with a narrow entrance in the usual position along with the entrance behind the front axle. 1 UDH had Northern Counties bodywork with wrap-around windscreens on both decks, similar to that specified by Barton Transport on AEC Regents and a Dennis Loline.|$|E
50|$|Payload is 2 300 kg in {{terrain and}} 4 000 kg on road. The <b>front</b> <b>{{overhang}}</b> is 1 300 mm and rear overhang 1 000 mm. The turning radius is 7.6 metres and top speed 90 km/h.|$|E
50|$|Rostral hooks {{occur when}} the {{dominant}} upper <b>front</b> premolars <b>overhang</b> the lower premolars. They can be hereditary or developmental meaning that the horse can have an overbite at birth or can have another malocclusion that forces the disalignment of the jaw. Rostral hooks can result in improper and extreme molar wear especially to the opposing lower premolar. Other problems include bit problems and soft tissue damage. Fixing Rostral hooks requires that you reduce the dominant portion of the upper premolar and round the unopposed portion smoothly towards the gum. Preventive maintenance is required to prevent recurring Rostral hooks.|$|R
50|$|When Chrysler {{discontinued}} the Eagle brand after 1998, the Chrysler 300M {{was introduced}} {{as a replacement}} for the Vision. All models again shared a wheelbase of 113 in. The 300M was several inches shorter than Concorde, Intrepid, & LHS, due to shorter <b>front</b> and rear <b>overhangs</b> in order to bring the car's length under 5 meters.|$|R
50|$|Long <b>front</b> {{and rear}} <b>overhangs</b> {{on the body}} were to assist with {{crossing}} crevasses up to 15 ft wide. The front wheels were to be retracted so the front could be pushed across the crevasse. The front wheels were then to be extended (and the rear wheels retracted) to pull the vehicle {{the rest of the}} way across. This process required a complicated, 20-step procedure.|$|R
50|$|Overhangs are {{the lengths}} {{of a car}} which extend beyond the {{wheelbase}} at the front and rear. They are normally described as <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and rear overhang. Practicality, style, and performance {{are affected by the}} size and weight of overhangs.|$|E
5000|$|The K9 is {{slightly}} {{shorter than the}} Equus, and has a longer wheelbase with shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> dimensions. The K9 features Kia's [...] "Tiger nose" [...] grill as well as blind spot detection, head-up display and an adaptive front lighting system.|$|E
50|$|Volvo B7F and Volvo B7FA were {{a series}} of front-engined single-decker bus chassis {{manufactured}} by Volvo. While the B7FA was a more conventional front-engined chassis, the B7F had the engine mounted {{on top of the}} front axle, giving the buses very little <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Luce County Jail and Sheriff's House is {{a three-story}} {{structure}} built with three wings in an irregular plan. Two side wings adjoin the main front section, {{with a third}} two-story wing, housing the jail, attached at the rear. The structure sits on a split fieldstone foundation. The first story is faced with Jacobsville sandstone, the second is faced with red, sand-molded brick, while the upper story is covered with fishscale shingles. The roofing was originally wood shakes but is now asphalt shingling. A metal-roofed cupola is on {{one corner of the}} building. Romanesque detailing on the building include the cut stone, arches over the windows and doors, and the polished granite columns supporting the <b>front</b> porch <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Schwebeklasse {{came with}} a strikingly more {{streamlined}} silhouette than its predecessor, with longer <b>front</b> and rear <b>overhangs.</b> Timber frame construction was at this stage retained, {{but there was no}} further increase in the wheelbase length, and the body was more rigid than that of the earlier model, though durability remained an issue. [...] The choice of bodies was now between a four-seater “limousine” (sedan/saloon) and a soft-topped four seater “cabrio-limousine”: a two-seater cabriolet was no longer offered.|$|R
50|$|Siding is clapboard, {{with wide}} plain belt courses marking {{the top and}} bottom of the large one-over-one double-hung sash window in the center of the first story. Wood {{shingles}} are used on the section of the north (<b>front)</b> facade that <b>overhangs</b> the walkway on the east side to the front entrance. The oriel window on the second story has two smaller versions of the first-floor window with a sunburst design on the two panels above, topped by fishscale shingles in the gable apex. Vergeboard decorated with geometric patterns runs along the roofline.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Wrightbus {{unveiled}} the Wright StreetCar {{which is a}} tram-like articulated bus built with modified B7LA chassis.

50|$|The {{first two}} Grenadiers were a Reliance 590 for Harris of Greys and a Leopard PSU3 for Grey Green, {{both of which}} were shown at the 1962 Earls Court Commercial Motor show. In the initial season a further 36 ft Reliance 590 went to Abbott of Blackpool, two Leopards to Gliderways of Smethwick, five to Northern General (the only BET order) and a unique 33 ft Grenadier went to Hawkey of Newquay on a Reliance 590 with {{specially}} reduced <b>front</b> and rear <b>overhangs,</b> it was registered 900SAF and sat 47.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} Proton Saga measures 4,331 mm long, 1,689 mm wide and 1,491 mm tall. The wheelbase length at 2,465 mm has remained unchanged since the Saga BLM, but both <b>front</b> and rear <b>overhangs</b> have been extended by 44mm and 30mm respectively. The boot volume is rated at 420 litres, 7 litres {{larger than the}} outgoing model. The {{third generation}} Saga is approximately 74mm longer, 9mm wider and 11mm shorter than the Saga BLM and 53mm longer, 9mm wider and 29mm shorter than the Saga FL and Saga FLX family.|$|R
5000|$|The '675' in the 675LT {{model name}} {{refers to the}} power output of 675 PS, {{following}} the naming scheme started by the McLaren 650S.
