5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> almost always walks around town.|$|E

5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran {{notice that}} {{something}} is wrong between them. Imran later reassures his friends that everything is okay. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. After Laila and Nuria do not answer their calls to bail them out, Imran reluntantly proceeds to call Salman Habib. Salman bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to Imran, Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> never contacted Imran. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He earnestly apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug.|$|E
5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily {{arranges}} a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept {{in a safe place}} and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E

25|$|Later, however, Cuff {{realizes that}} in {{approaching}} and deactivating Hickey's device, he himself {{must have gotten}} a full dose of radiation, damaging his own germ plasm. Hence he can never risk having children for fear of producing monsters, and that, as he will ultimately tell his son Peter, <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> chose to adopt.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{felt that}} the rhythmically closer camera view {{technique}} would feel gimmicky just by itself, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> introduced the high school girl as a secondary character whose perspective the camera is seeing. By placing a school girl into the video, Tanaka felt that this established that the video {{was shot in the}} present, emphasizing the oddness of the performance troupe Sakanaction play.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Brandon {{visits the}} sisters and reveals to Elinor that Willoughby's aunt disinherited him after {{she learned that}} he had seduced Brandon's fifteen-year-old ward, Miss Williams, then {{abandoned}} her when she became pregnant. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> chose to marry for money rather than love. Brandon {{was in love with}} Miss Williams' mother as a young man, when she was his father's ward, but she was forced into an unhappy marriage to Brandon's elder brother that ended in scandal and divorce; Marianne strongly reminds him of her.|$|E

The {{conditions}} were the worst that they had been in the three years that Buka had competed in the event. That year, Buka trained, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> claims he broke his own record. Wayne Urina, claiming second place, is currently the 2nd fastest man to complete the crossing of the Kokoda Trail with a time of 18:34:06. Cyprian Aire came third with 19:11:40.|$|E
25|$|The basic case made by Ern's {{defenders}} {{was that}} his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued {{on behalf of all}} the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> continues to haunt our culture.|$|E
25|$|Beowulf {{and his men}} {{celebrate}} in Heorot to lure Grendel out. When {{the beast}} attacks, Beowulf engages him unarmed and naked. During the fight, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has hypersensitive hearing, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> interrupts Hrothgar's celebrations – the noise they make is physically painful to him. After his left eardrum is ruptured by Beowulf, Grendel shrinks in size and attempts to escape. Beowulf restrains Grendel and severs his left arm with the door. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty dragon Fafnir.|$|E

25|$|Galen {{believed}} {{there to be}} no distinction between the mental and the physical. This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties. He believed {{that this could be}} scientifically proven. This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent. Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> spoke so strongly against them.|$|E
25|$|The case {{focuses on}} an Amish man, Daniel Zehr, who is seeking an {{exception}} to a law which requires that a photo be taken for one to receive legal residence in the United States. A lawsuit filed by the Amish is highly unusual in nature since the Amish hold a steadfast view {{that they should be}} non-confrontational. The lawsuit relates to a first amendment argument centered on freedom of religion. Zehr is a Canadian citizen. He is a member of an Old Order Amish sect that takes literally the Bible's prohibition of graven images, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> has refused to consent to an immigration photo.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Nomura {{denied that}} he knew {{beforehand}} of the attack. Reportedly Nomura and Kurusu had to personally decode the radioed message of Japan's breaking off the negotiations with the United States (which given the circumstances practically meant war), {{as it had been}} sent from Japan on Monday, December 8 and was received when the embassy's technical support staff was still on Sunday holiday. Nomura stated that this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had been unable to deliver the message until after the actual attack had taken place. In his memoirs, Hull credited Nomura with having been sincere in trying to prevent war between Japan and the United States.|$|E

25|$|On St. Martin's Day, {{children}} in Flanders, the southern and north-western {{parts of the}} Netherlands, and the Catholic areas of Germany and Austria still participate in paper lantern processions. Often, a man dressed as St. Martin rides on a horse {{in front of the}} procession. The children sing songs about St. Martin and about their lanterns. The food traditionally eaten on the day is goose, a rich bird. According to legend, Martin was reluctant to become bishop, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> hid in a stable filled with geese. The noise made by the geese betrayed his location to the people who were looking for him.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an {{opportunity}} to do so. However, {{there is no question that}} Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E
25|$|Frank Miller's Superman, the Superman of All Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, is not {{the same}} as the Superman of All-Star Superman. The artist of All-Star Batman, Jim Lee, has stated that he is based on the Golden Age Superman, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> is shown running on water instead of flying. However, they make no mention of this in the actual comic. Conversely, Frank Miller's Superman is seen flying in his other comics about Batman. This is notionally the same Superman who will evolve to the jingoistic {{government}} agent seen in The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, at least from Miller's authorial point of view, as there is no official canonical link between the All-Star and Dark Knight continuities yet.|$|E
