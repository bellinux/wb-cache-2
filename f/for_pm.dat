50|$|The {{effective}} {{radius of}} the polonide ion (Po2−) can be calculated from the Shannon (1976) ionic radii of the cations: 216 <b>pm</b> <b>for</b> 4-coordination, 223 <b>pm</b> <b>for</b> 6-coordination, 225 <b>pm</b> <b>for</b> 8-coordination.

25|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} 26 March 1989. Naama Maheu Latasi was elected to represent the constituency of Nanumea {{and was the first}} woman elected to the Parliament of Tuvalu. Puapua chose not the offer himself as a candidate <b>for</b> <b>PM</b> after the 1989 election.

25|$|The sieges {{ended when}} the Constitutional Court banned the People's Power Party {{and two of}} its {{coalition}} allies. During the critical period that followed the rulings, it is alleged that Army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, coerced former PPP MPs, mainly those of the Friends of Newin Group, to endorse a Democrat Party-led coalition, which secured enough parliamentary votes to allow Abhisit to be elected Prime Minister. These MPs, along with MPs of 4 other former PPP-coalition parties, crossed the aisle to endorse a Democrat-led coalition government. In a December 2008 parliamentary session, the Democrat-led coalition government was voted upon, with 235 to 198 votes in favor of Democrat Party leader and candidate <b>for</b> <b>PM</b> Abhisit Vejjajiva.|$|E

30|$|The {{rankings of}} the {{different}} approaches {{show that they are}} almost in agreement with our proposed approach. The result shows that except <b>for</b> <b>PMs</b> 6, 7, 10, 13 and 15, the failure modes <b>for</b> other <b>PM</b> obtained by our proposed method are different from those obtained using the conventional RPN method. However, the difference is {{as a result of the}} limitation in FMEA method as mentioned in “Background” section.|$|R

25|$|As a consequence, the governor-general {{dissolved}} {{the parliament}} on 22 September and a further election {{took place on}} 25 November 1993. Tomasi Puapua chose not the offer himself as a candidate <b>for</b> <b>PM.</b> The subsequent parliament elected Kamuta Latasi as prime minister on 10 December 1993, with a 7:5 majority over the group a members of parliament headed by former prime minister Bikenibeu Paeniu. The deputy prime minister was Otinielu Tausi and Tomasi Puapua was appointed {{the speaker of the}} parliament. Kamuta Latasi was the prime minister until 17 December 1996. As the result of the vote on a motion of no confidence Kamuta Latasi resigned and Bikenibeu Paeniu was elected as prime minister for the second time on 23 December 1996. He remained as prime minister until the 1998 general elections.|$|E
2500|$|The {{locomotives}} {{remained on}} the roster through the PM's merger into Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C) in 1947; class N locomotives were renumbered to 2685–2699, class N-1 to 2650–2661, and class N-2 to 2670–2681. [...] Part of the merger agreement, however, included the stipulation that locomotives that were acquired and fully paid for by PM would remain painted <b>for</b> <b>PM</b> after the merger. Although all the Berkshires received new numbers, only class N engines were repainted into standard C livery and renumbered. The majority of the class N locomotives were scrapped between 1954 and 1957, but class N-1s 1223 and 1225 were both preserved.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study Probability Measures (PM) from a {{functional}} point of view: {{we show that}} PMs {{can be considered as}} functionals (generalized functions) that belong to some functional space endowed with an inner product. This approach allows us to introduce a new family of distances <b>for</b> <b>PMs,</b> based on the action of the PM functionals on `interesting' functions of the sample. We propose a specific (non parametric) metric <b>for</b> <b>PMs</b> belonging to this class, based on the estimation of density level sets. Some real and simulated data sets are used to measure the performance of the proposed distance against a battery of distances widely used in Statistics and related areas.
