After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Harry; kiss me, Harry. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> {{you sent}} a word. Promise me, Harry, {{not to think}} that I don't agree with you in every thing." ...|$|R

60|$|MARGARET (jigging about). <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> I {{am not a}} shade. How awful {{it would}} be, Daddy, {{to wake up and}} find one wasn't alive.|$|E

I'm afraid I'm a [...] terribly clumsy fellow.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, the Mexican {{appeared}} on the trail, leading my horses. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> to see Hal that <b>I</b> forgot <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a prisoner. But Greaser's sullen face and glittering eyes reminded me of it quickly enough. I read treachery in his glance.|$|R

'Not in the least. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> {{to hear it}} was Holt's! for {{you must}} know that I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> very angry at his beating our old hound, for, as he thought, {{worrying}} his sheep; not that Dart ever did, though.|$|R
6000|$|...
