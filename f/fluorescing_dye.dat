The DOE has been tasked to deactivate and/or decommission nearly 10, 000 buildings at 3314 EM release sites, and new analytical characterization tools are necessary in order to assist in the segregation of contaminated and non-contaminated scrap metal and concrete materials via the identification of the type and extent of radionuclide and heavy metal contamination apparent on these building materials.

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} an {{original}} experimental approach for mapping the droplets Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of a hollow-cone water spray using the SLIPI-LIF/MIE technique. Water {{mixed with a}} non-toxic <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> is continuously injected at 20 bars injection pressure and the formed hollow-cone spray is illuminated using a continuous wave laser. The illumination wavelength is carefully chosen (here, 447 nm) to excite the injected dye/water mixture, which generates a significant Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) signal peaking at 514 nm. The LIF and Mie signals are recorded using a CCD camera and their intensity ratio is used to extract a two-dimensional distribution of the droplets SMD. In this article, we show that even for {{the case of a}} dilute hollow-cone spray, where single scattering events are in majority (OD~ 1), the LIF/Mie measurement of droplets SMD still remains strongly affected by multiple light scattering.

40|$|The {{selection}} of nanoparticles for achieving efficient contrast for biological and cell imaging applications, {{as well as}} for photothermal therapeutic applications, is based on the optical properties of the nanoparticles. We use Mie theory and discrete dipole approximation method to calculate absorption and scattering efficiencies and optical resonance wavelengths for three commonly used classes of nanoparticles: gold nanospheres, silica-gold nanoshells, and gold nanorods. The calculated spectra clearly reflect the well-known dependence of nanoparticle optical properties viz. the resonance wavelength, the extinction cross-section, and the ratio of scattering to absorption, on the nanoparticle dimensions. A systematic quantitative study of the various trends is presented. By increasing the size of gold nanospheres from 20 to 80 nm, the magnitude of extinction as well as the relative contribution of scattering to the extinction rapidly increases. Gold nanospheres in the size range commonly employed (40 nm) show an absorption cross-section 5 orders higher than conventional absorbing dyes, while the magnitude of light scattering by 80 -nm gold nanospheres is 5 orders higher than the light emission from strongly <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dyes.</b> The variation in the plasmon wavelength maximum of nanospheres, i. e., from 520 to 550 nm, is however too limited to be useful for in vivo applications.

A novel optical technique, based on internal illumination of the liquid jet through the jet nozzle by a laser pulse, which excites a <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> introduced in the atomizing liquid, was used to obtain instantaneous measurements of the breakup length and the three dimensional location of the liquid core of the continuous liquid jet. The latter was achieved by simultaneously imaging the liquid jet from two directions normal to each other. Such measurements are usually prevented by droplets surrounding the liquid jet at the dense spray near the nozzle exit. The measurements showed that the break-up length of the liquid jet scaled well with the air to liquid momentum ratio. The standard deviation of the temporal fluctuations of the break-up length was around 10 % of the mean breakup length for each considered flow condition. The instantaneous jet surface does not develop axi-symmetric wave structures but the time-averaged liquid jet is axi-symmetric around the nozzle axis, while the maximum deflection of the liquid jet occurs close to the breaking point...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Our goal is {{to develop}} {{intelligent}} molecular diagnostic systems (IMDS) that can analyze liquid samples that contain a variety of biochemical compounds. In order to analyze the liquid samples we use dedicated microarrays. At this stage, these are basically miniaturized micro titer plates. Typical dimensions of a well are 200 x 200 x 20 µm 3. These dimensions may be varied and {{the shape of the}} wells can be modified with a result that the volume of a wells can be from 0. 5 to 1. 6 nl. For our experiments, we have used wells with the shape of a truncated pyramid. These wells are fabricated in silicon by a wet etching process. For testing purposes the wells are filled with a <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> (e. g. rhodamine) of various concentrations. To avoid evaporation, glycerol-water 1 : 1 v/v with a viscosity of 8. 3 times the viscosity of water is used as solvent.

We have, in particular, studied the effects of lens magnification and numerical aperture, NA. on the detection capabilities. From these experiments we have found that for this configuration the detection limit is on the order of nanomolar concentrations of fluorescing particles. This translates to 100, 000 molecules per well. Further, we have used the digital analysis of images of the evaporation process to understand how fluorescing particles move during the evaporation process. Using digital images analysis of the interference fringes produced in this dynamic process, we have obtained an axial resolution of 70 water molecules...|$|E

Dual excitation 488 nm/multiline UV (351 – 364 nm) flow cytometry was used to confirm ABCG 2 -specific inhibition of dye efflux using Fumitremorgin C. Transporter gene expression, assayed by qRT-PCR, confirmed higher expression of ABCG 2 versus ABCB 1, reiterated in a cloned subline. Coexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenase genes ranked as aldehyde dehydrogenase class 1 A 1 (ALDH 1 A 1) > ALDH 3 A 1 > ALDH 3, relative expression of all genes was again reiterated in a cloned subline. Permeabilized cells were used to create red:violet (660 : 405 nm Em wavelengths) ratiometric references for mapping temporal changes in Hoechst 33342 –DNA fluorescence in live cells. A live cell “kinetic SP gate” tracked progressive dye loading of the whole population and coapplication of the far red (> 695 nm wavelength) <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> DRAQ 7 enabled viable cell gating. Kinetic gating revealed a continuum for dye accumulation suggesting that SP enumeration is critically dependent upon the nonlinear relationship of the spectral shift with progressive dye–DNA binding and thus requires accurate definition. To this end, permeabilized cell reference samples permit reproducible instrument setup, guide gate boundaries for SP and compromised cells, and offer a simple means of comparing SP enumeration across laboratory sites/platforms. Our approach reports the dynamic range for the spectral shift, revealing noninformative staining conditions and explaining a source of variability for SP enumeration. We suggest that live cell kinetic sorting of all cells with the same dye:DNA load but with differences in efflux capacity can be used to explore drug resistance capability without prejudice.

40|$|The {{membrane}} {{integrity of}} a cell is a well-accepted criterion for characterizing viable (active or inactive) cells and distinguishing them from damaged and membrane-compromised cells. This information is of major importance in studies of the function of microbial assemblages in natural environments, in order to assign bulk activities measured by various methods to the very active cells that are effectively responsible for the observations. To achieve this task for bacteria in freshwater and marine waters, we propose a nucleic acid double-staining assay based on analytical flow cytometry, which allows us to distinguish viable from damaged and membrane-compromised bacteria and to sort out noise and detritus. This method {{is derived from the}} work of S. Barbesti et al. (Cytometry 40 : 214 - 218, 2000) which was conducted on cultured bacteria. The principle of this approach is to use simultaneously a permeant (SYBR Green; Molecular Probes) and an impermeant (propidium iodide) probe and {{to take advantage of the}} energy transfer which occurs between them when both probes are staining nucleic acids. A full quenching of the permeant probe fluorescence by the impermeant probe will point to cells with a compromised membrane, a partial quenching will indicate cells with a slightly damaged membrane, and a lack of quenching will characterize intact membrane cells identified as viable. In the present study, this approach has been adapted to bacteria in freshwater and marine waters of the Mediterranean region. It is fast and easy to use and shows that a large fraction of bacteria with low DNA content can be composed of viable cells.

40|$|Current {{experimental}} and computational techniques must be improved {{in order to}} advance the prediction capability of the longitudinal vortical flows shed by underwater vehicles. The generation, development, and breakdown mechanisms of the shed vortices at high Reynolds numbers are not fully understood. The ability to measure hull separated vortices associated with vehicle maneuvering does not exist at present. The existing point-by-point measurement techniques can only capture approximately the large 'mean' eddies but fail to meet the dynamics of small vortices during the initial stage of generation. A new technique, which offers a previously unavailable capability to measure the unsteady cross-flow distribution in {{the plane of the}} laser light sheet, is called Particle Displacement Velocimetry (PDV). PDV consists of illuminating a thin section of the flowfield with a pulsed laser. The water is seeded with microscopic, neutrally buoyant particles containing imbedded <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> which responds with intense spontaneous fluorescence with the illuminated section. The seeded particles in the vortical flow structure shed by the underwater vehicle are illuminated by the pulse laser and the corresponding particle traces are recorded in a single photographic frame. Two distinct approaches were utilized for determining the velocity distribution from the particle traces. The first method is based on matching the traces of the same particle and measuring the distance between them. The direction of the flow can be identified by keeping one of the pulses longer than the other. The second method is based on selecting a small window within the image and finding the mean shift of all the particles within that region. The computation of the auto-correlation of the intensity distribution within the selected sample window is used to determine the mean displacement of particles. The direction of the flow is identified by varying the intensity of the laser light between pulses. Considerable computational resources are required to compute the auto-correction of the intensity distribution. Parallel processing will be employed to speed up the data reduction. A few examples of measured unsteady vortical flow structures shed by the underwater vehicles will be presented...|$|E

For this therapy, the biocompatibility and viability of collagen foils as scaffolds for RPE-Cells in the subretinal space of rabbit eyes was evaluated. The series of experiments included a total of 12 animals with one operated eye each. ARPE- 19 cells were cultivated on collagen foils, which have been stained with the <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> DTAF. After accessing the operating area via pars plana vitrectomy, a bleb was created by subretinally injecting balanced salt solution. Using a retinotomy on the ablated retina, the collagen foil was transplanted into the subretinal space. The observation period varied between 3 to 35 days. The enucleated rabbit eyes were evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. After processing the histological slices with paraffin, the morphological examination was done natively, by using fluorescing light and {{with the aid of}} HE-staining. Being easily dyeable with DTAF, the sheet proved to be sturdy before and after cultivation, as well as during cutting and transplanting. Postoperative, the transplanted sheets with ARPE- 19 showed minor to none degradation after 2 weeks. Partial degradation was detectable after 3 weeks, almost complete degradation after 5 weeks. Up to 2 weeks after transplanting there was no gliotic or fibrotic reaction present in the surrounding tissue. After 3 weeks an increase of cells within the area of the degradation process could be witnessed while the retina remained intact. During the following period a reduction of outer photoreceptor segments and a narrowing of the nuclear layer were detectable. The collagen foils proved to be a reliable carrier for ARPE- 19 cells during the scope of this work, specifically standing out by its specific material characteristics which, while allowing for easy handling, fast degradation when cultivated and high biocompatibility in the subretinal space of the rabbit eye, also did not trigger a toxic or rejection reaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Since {{real time}} PCR was first developed, several {{approaches}} to estimating the initial quantity of template in an RT-PCR reaction have been tried. While initially only the early thermal cycles corresponding to exponential duplication were used, lately {{there has been}} an effort to use all of the cycles in a PCR. The efforts have included both fitting empirical sigmoid curves and more elaborate mechanistic models that explore the chemical reactions taking place during each cycle. The more elaborate mechanistic models require many more parameters than can be fit from a single amplification, while the empirical models provide little insight and are difficult to tailor to specific reactants. Results We directly estimate the initial amount of amplicon using a simplified mechanistic model based on chemical reactions in the annealing step of the PCR. The basic model includes the duplication of DNA with the digestion of Taqman probe and the re-annealing between previously synthesized DNA strands of opposite orientation. By modelling the amount of Taqman probe digested and matching that with the observed fluorescence, the conversion factor between the number of <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> molecules and observed fluorescent emission can be estimated, along with the absolute initial amount of amplicon and the rate parameter for re-annealing. The model is applied to several PCR reactions with known amounts of amplicon and is shown to work reasonably well. An expanded version of the model allows duplication of amplicon without release of fluorescent dye, by adding 1 more parameter to the model. The additional process is helpful in most cases where the initial primer concentration exceeds the initial probe concentration. Software for applying the algorithm to data may be downloaded at [URL] Conclusion We present proof of the principle that a mechanistically based model can be fit to observations from a single PCR amplification. Initial amounts of amplicon are well estimated without using a standard solution. Using the ratio of the predicted initial amounts of amplicon from 2 PCRs is shown to work well even when the absolute amounts of amplicon are underestimated in the individual PCRs. </p...|$|E

40|$|Transporting DNA and {{metabolites}} {{across the}} cell membrane {{is a fundamental}} mechanism to achieve a controlled, quantitative understanding of the complex processes occurring {{in the human body}} at the cellular level. However, the thin, cell membrane forms an effective barrier to foreign molecules and alternative means are required to coerce entry. One method capable of overcoming this barrier is single cell electroporation (SCE) via microcapillary, which can be applied to cells directly in culture, or tissue. SCE induces reversible pores in the membrane by applying an electric field at the cell surface. Membrane-impermeable molecules enter these pores by electrophoresis and diffusion. The tip of the microcapillary can be fabricated with micrometer size geometries allowing extraordinary cell selectivity and access to small cell features with sparing quantities of molecules. However, the technical complexity of SCE limits the use to highly trained operators. Operators must carefully position a microcapillary tip on cells only several micrometers in height and must perform the technique using conventional microscopy methods that lack depth-perception. Additionally, knowledge of the electrical characteristics of SCE influencing the rate and efficiency are required. These broad technical requirements and the fragile nature of thin cell structures limit the efficiency of manual throughput. Furthermore, the sequence of tasks have not been adequately achieved by automated efforts, thus the true potential of SCE has not been realized. In this thesis, a versatile system and methods are described for an infrastructure designed completely for automated SCE. The intent of the system is to abstract the technical challenges and exploit the accuracy and repeatability of automated instrumentation leaving only the focus of the experimental design to the operator. In addition, new milestones within automated cell manipulation have been achieved.

40|$|DLE (Dry Low Emission) {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in land based gas turbines due to the increasing demands on low NOx levels. One of the key aspects in DLE combustion is achieving a good fuel and air mixing where the desired flame temperature is achieved without too high levels of combustion instabilities. To experimentally study fuel and air mixing it is convenient to use water along with a tracer instead of air and fuel. In this study fuel and air mixing and flow field inside an industrial gas turbine burner fitted to a water rig has been studied experimentally and numerically. The Reynolds number is approximately 75000 {{and the amount of}} fuel tracer is scaled to represent real engine conditions. The fuel concentration in the rig is experimentally visualized using a <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> in the water passing through the fuel system of the burner and recorded using a laser along with a CCD (Charge Couple Device) camera. The flow and concentration field in the burner is numerically studied using both the scale resolving SAS (Scale Adaptive Simulation) method and the LES (Large Eddy Simulation) method as well as using a traditional two equation URANS (Unsteady Reynolds Average Navier Stokes) approach. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the differences and similarities between the URANS, SAS and LES models when applied to industrial geometries as well as their capabilities to accurately predict relevant features of an industrial burner such as concentration and velocity profiles. Both steady and unsteady RANS along with a standard two equation turbulence model fail to accurately predict the concentration field within the burner, instead they predict a concentration field with too sharp gradients, regions with almost no fuel tracer as well as regions with far too high concentration of the fuel tracer. The SAS and LES approach both predict a more smooth time averaged concentration field with the main difference that the tracer profile predicted by the LES has smoother gradients as compared to the tracer profile predicted by the SAS. The concentration predictions by the SAS model is in reasonable agreement with the measured concentration fields while the agreement for the LES model is excellent. The LES shows stronger fluctuations in velocity over time as compared to both URANS and SAS which is due to the reduced amounts of eddy viscosity in the LES model as compared to both URANS and SAS. This study shows that numerical methods are capable of predicting both velocity and concentration in a gas turbine burner. It is clear that both time and scale resolved methods are required to accurately capture the flow features of this and probably most industrial DLE gas turbine burners...|$|E

Emulsifying properties of basil seed gum (BSG) were evaluated in terms of emulsion droplet size distribution (d 32 and d 43), rheological properties (apparent viscosity and viscoelasticity), droplet charge (zeta potential), visual phase separation (at 20 oC for 1 month period), and adsorption properties (surface/interfacial tensions). Soya oil-in-water emulsions (30 % wt/wt) were formulated and stabilised by BSG containing < 1. 2 % (wt/wt) protein and a major glucomannan fraction. Different BSG concentrations (0. 1 - 1 % wt/wt) were tested, {{as well as the}} effect of pH (1 - 12), salt (5 - 70 mM NaCl), heating (80 oC, 30 mins) and purification (removal of proteins from gum) on 0. 3 % (wt/wt) BSG-stabilised oil-in-water emulsions. Emulsions with monomodal droplet distributions and with oil droplet size below 1. 0 μm (d 32) were formed with as little as 0. 3 % (wt/wt) BSG. The emulsifying properties of BSG were sensitive to changes in pH and salt. Generally, small emulsion droplets were formed at pH above 6. 0 and low ionic strength. However, larger droplets were formed and zeta potential values decreased at low pH and high ionic strength. Microstructures confirmed the occurrence of coalescence over time. BSG appeared to exhibit strong hydrophobic character as <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> (usually for proteins) was detected at the interface, as well as polysaccharide inclusions were trapped within coalescing droplets after homogenisation, suggesting its strong adsorption. Heating and purification reduced the emulsifying properties of BSG. Nevertheless, the emulsions remained stable against phase separation. The rheological properties of BSG emulsions appeared to be dependent on gum concentration and purification, but independent on pH, salt, and heating, which suggests the resistance of BSG to processing conditions, and thereby it could provide strong emulsion stability. Surface/interfacial tension measurements confirmed the adsorption of BSG at the oil-water interfaces. All gum preparations (crude, purified and protein-free) exhibited an ability to lower the tensions at the interface. However, purification of the gum reduced its adsorption activity, indicating that (i) protein {{plays an important role in}} gum adsorption, but it is not an absolute driving force for adsorption and (ii) gum itself becomes altered by the purification process. BSG (0. 17 % wt/wt carbohydrate purity) demonstrated excellent emulsifying and stabilising properties when compared to some other polysaccharides. Protein-free BSG produced larger droplets than crude BSG, but still it produced stable emulsions, comparable to other gums, such as sugar beet pectin. This suggests that the emulsifying and stabilising mechanism of the gum is not only ascribed to the surface-active protein moiety, but could also be attributed to the hydrophobic character of the polysaccharide itself. Overall, BSG is a promising gum, which can be considered as a novel hydrocolloid emulsifier...|$|E

In its free form, RiboGreen exhibits little fluorescence and possesses a negligible absorbance signature. When bound to nucleic acids, the <b>dye</b> <b>fluoresces</b> with an intensity that, according to the manufacturer, is several orders of magnitude greater than the unbound form. The fluorescence can be detected by a sensor and the nucleic acid can be quantified. The presence of protein contaminants in the sample of nucleic acids to be tested does not make significant contributions to the absorbance, and thus allows for the addition of deoxyribonucleases to the protocol in order to degrade DNA, in the instances where one is only interested in detecting or quantifying RNA.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGeneration of {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This study examined pro-apoptotic mitochondrial cell death signals in an H 9 C 2 myocyte rat cell line and in isolated rat heart mitochondria exposed to doxorubicin. Mitochondrial and cellular viability were assessed using an MTT viability assay (formazan product formed by functional mitochondrial dehydrogenases) and calcein AM <b>dye</b> (<b>fluoresces</b> upon cleavage by cytosolic esterases). Mitochondrial dysfunction followed by cell death was observed using nM concentrations of doxorubicin. Significant doxorubicin-induced cell death was not apparent until after 6 h following doxorubicin exposure using the calcein AM assay. The involvement of apoptosis is evidenced {{by an increase in}} TUNEL (terminal (TdT) -mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) -positive nuclei following doxorubicin treatment. Furthermore, doxorubicin administered to isolated mitochondria induced a rapid increase in superoxide production, which persisted for at least 1 h and was followed by increased cytochrome c efflux. In addition, caspase- 3 activity was increased with doxorubicin administration in the H 9 C 2 myocyte cell line. An oxidant-mediated threshold of mitochondrial death may be required for doxorubicin-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial {{laboratory}} experiments studying various fluid dynamical processes are constrained, {{by being in}} an Earth laboratory, to have a gravitational body force which is uniform and unidirectional. Therefore fluid free-surfaces are horizontal and flat. Such free surfaces must have a vertical solid boundary to keep the fluid from spreading horizontally along a gravitational potential surface. In atmospheric, oceanic, or stellar fluid flows that have a horizontal scale of about one-tenth the body radius or larger, sphericity {{is important in the}} dynamics. Further, fluids in spherical geometry can cover an entire domain without any sidewall effects, i. e. have truly periodic boundary conditions. We describe spherical body-force {{laboratory experiments}} using ferrofluid. Ferrofluids are dilute suspensions of magnetic dipoles, for example magnetite particles of order 10 nm diameter, suspended in a carrier fluid. Ferrofluids are subject to an additional body force in the presence of an applied magnetic field gradient. We use this body force to conduct laboratory experiments in spherical geometry. The present study is a laboratory technique improvement. The apparatus is cylindrically axisymmetric. A cylindrical ceramic magnet is embedded in a smooth, solid, spherical PVC ball. The geopotential field and its gradient, the body force, were made nearly spherical by careful choice of magnet height-to-diameter ratio and magnet size relative to the PVC ball size. Terrestrial gravity is eliminated from the dynamics by immersing the "planet" and its ferrofluid "ocean" in an immiscible silicone oil/freon mixture of the same density. Thus the earth gravity is removed from the dynamics of the ferrofluid/oil interface and the only dynamically active force there is the radial magnetic gravity. The entire apparatus can rotate, and waves are forced on the ferrofluid surface by exterior magnets. The biggest improvement in technique is in the wave visualization. <b>Fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> is added to the oil/freon mixture and an argon ion laser generates a horizontal light that can be scanned vertically. Viewed from above, the experiment is a black circle with wave deformations surrounded by a light background. A contour of the image intensity at any light sheet position gives the surface of the ferrofluid "ocean" at that "latitude". Radial displacements of the waves as a function of longitude are obtained by subtracting the contour line positions from a no-motion contour at that laser sheet latitude. The experiments are run by traversing the forcing magnet with the laser sheet height fixed and images are frame grabbed to obtain a time-series at one latitude. The experiment is then re-run with another laser-sheet height to generate a full picture of the three-dimensional wave structure in the upper hemisphere of the ball as a function of time. We concentrate here on results of laboratory studies of waves that are important in Earth's atmosphere and especially the ocean. To get oceanic scaling in the laboratory, the experiment must rotate rapidly (4 -second rotation period) so that the wave speed is slow compared to the planetary rotation speed as in the ocean. In the Pacific Ocean, eastward propagating Kelvin waves eventually run into the South American coast. Theory predicts that some of the wave energy should scatter into coastal-trapped Kelvin waves that propagate north and south along the coast. Some of this coastal wave energy might then scatter into mid-latitude Rossby waves that propagate back westward. Satellite observations of the Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperature and height seem to show signatures of westward propagating mid-latitude Rossby waves, 5 to 10 years after the 1982 - 83 El Nino. The observational data is difficult to interpret unambiguously owing to the large range of motions that fill the ocean at shorter timescales. This series of reflections giving eastward, north- ward, and then westward traveling waves is observed cleanly in the laboratory experiments, confirming the theoretical expectations...|$|E
40|$|Emulsions are kinetically stabilised {{mixtures}} of two immiscible fluids (e. g. oil and water). They are encountered in many industrial applications including cosmetics, food, road, drug delivery and paint technology. Despite their wide spread use, {{the formulation of}} emulsions remains largely empirical. The nature {{of the relationships between}} ingredients, composition, emulsification method and energy input, defining the microstructure (e. g. droplet size distribution and surfactant packing at the oil/water interface), the dynamics (e. g. interdroplet exchange) and the lifetime of emulsions, is still poorly understood. In particular, little work has focused on the mutual interactions between emulsifier and oil molecules and how these affect the properties of the interfacial domain and emulsion dynamics. The emulsion system oil/Triton X- 100 /water was investigated, where Triton X- 100 is a commercially available non ionic surfactant and the oil is one of toluene, p-xylene or octane. The microstructure and the dynamics of these oil/Triton X- 100 /water emulsions were monitored upon varying oil type, oil concentration, emulsion age and ionic strength while maintaining the oil-to-surfactant weight ratio, temperature, energy input and emulsification method constant. For this purpose, laser scanning confocal microscopy, cryo scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR), macroscopic phase separation and light scattering techniques were used as experimental techniques. The occurrence of an oil exchange between oil droplets that is not coupled to droplet growth and emulsion destabilization is reported for the three oil systems: toluene, p-xylene or octane. The mixture of two separately stained emulsions, using green and red <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> molecules, leads to all droplets emitting yellow fluorescence under the confocal microscope within ∼ 10 min of mixing due to the interdroplet exchange of the two water insoluble dyes. Furthermore, the PFG-NMR data for both toluene and p-xylene systems indicate that, for long observation times, Δ, the echo attenuation of the oil signal decays as a single exponential upon increasing the diffusion parameters. In other words the individual motions of the droplets and oil molecules are described by a unique diffusion coefficient belying the system polydispersity and indicative of a dynamic process occurring on a time scale faster than the observation time. One way to explain this outcome is to consider a motional averaging of the oil diffusion arising from either oil permeation upon droplet collision or reversible coalescence of the droplets. These two mechanisms are supported by the extensive droplet contact observed by cryo-SEM. Such an oil transfer occurring in three distinct oil systems, independently of emulsion destabilization, has not been reported previously. Upon decreasing the NMR observation time below a specific value, Δswitch, a switch of the echo attenuation data was detected between a single exponential and a multiexponential decay, the latter indicative of the emulsion droplet size distribution. The time scale of the oil transfer, Δswitch, was probed upon varying oil type, oil concentration, emulsion age and ionic strength. In particular, the time scale of the oil exchange is an increasing function, spanning from ~ 300 ms to ~ 3 s, of droplet concentration in toluene emulsions despite the concomitant increase of the droplet collision frequency. Upon increasing the toluene content and decreasing the mean interdroplet spacing, the oil droplets are kinetically stabilized by the enhancement of the surfactant packing at the oil/water interface. In addition to the surfactant packing at the surface of the oil droplets, ionic strength and droplet size, the rate of oil exchange is controlled by the mutual interactions between oil and Triton X- 100 molecules. The rate of oil transfer is a decreasing function from toluene to p-xylene to octane. The increase of the mean droplet size in the same order cannot solely account for the observed slowdown of the oil exchange. The macroscopic phase separation data indicate that the Triton X- 100 layer is increasingly robust with respect to oil transfer from toluene to p-xylene to octane. This can be compared with the oil exchange process and explained in terms of oil penetration effects into the surfactant layer and energy cost for hole nucleation...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{results of}} this work can be {{separated}} in two parts – the experimental and theoretical assessment of the fluorescence {{in the vicinity of}} a flat gold interface, and the surface modification and synthesis of gold nanoparticles and gold nanowires. At the end first steps to a more complex study on the fluorescence intensity near more complex objects as gold nanoparticles were done. A defined multilayer architecture at the nanometer scale {{for the study of the}} fluorescence in the presence of a metal interface was designed and precisely experimentally implemented. An ultrasmooth gold film was used in combination with self-assembled monolayers and layer-bylayer deposition of polyelectrolytes allowing for the separation of fluorescing dyes from a gold interface in a controlled and precise manner. The characteristics (thickness, roughness, optical constants) of the layers were fully analysed by a variety of techniques (Small Angle X-ray Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy, Surface Plasmon Spectroscopy). In Chapter 4 the behaviour of fluorescing dyes at a planar metal-dielectric interface was investigated in Kretschmann configuration. The fluorescence intensity, angular distribution of the emission, and photobliching rate of fluorescing molecules placed at different separation distance to the gold interface were experimentally and theoretically evaluated. A perfect correlation between theory and experiment was found for a separation distance larger than 15 nm. Surprisingly, a clear discrepancy between measurement and experiment was determined at very close proximity to the gold layer, though experiments on the excitation lifetime of europium complex conducted by other researchers showed very good correlation to the theory. In order to clarify that, the problem was addressed on single molecule level which confirmed the results with an ensemble of molecules. One speculation on the reason for the discrepancy between the results described here and others results may imply that this is due to the stronger oscillator strength of fluorophore used in the current study (compared to the Europium complex which is phosphorescent) which leads to stronger interaction with the gold interface. Another reason could be the ultrasmooth gold interface used in experiments described here, since it is known that rough metal surfaces can lead to enhancement of the fluorescence. Moreover, it is known that the very elegant Langmuir-Blodgett deposition technique used in the experiments before, often leads to films with pinholes, defects and domains which will be a reason for inhomogeneous distribution of the dye in vertical direction. Although, the complete understanding of the effects described above might need further experimental and theoretical attention, this study is a significant contribution to the application of Surface Plasmon Fluorescence Spectroscpy as an analytical tool for detection of surface recognition reactions as well as in all processes were a <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> is used with a metal interface. The second part of this work was dedicated to gold nanoparticles and gold nanowires (Chapter 5). Firstly, the undefined shell of physically adsorbed ions on the surface of citrate reduced gold nanoparticles was exchanged by a self-assembled monolayer of 2 -mercaptosuccinic acid. Series of comparative tests unambiguously proved a successful surface modification expressed in a better pH stability and cyanide dissolution resistance. Then a new route for the synthesis of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles with size above 10 nm was established. The syntheses were conducted in aqueous medium as only HAuCl 4 and 2 -MSA were used, without employing any additional reduction agent. This new synthesis can be very useful in cell imaging, DNA labels, catalysts or optical sensors, applications where narrow size distribution is not required. At a particular molar ratio between the reagents this new synthesis resulted in gold nanowires. The synthetic procedure is simple, one step, conducted in aqueous medium and without the use of any additional surfactants. The length of the gold wires is in the order of micrometers and the cross section down to 15 nm. Surface analytical techniques such as SEM, TEM and AFM were used in order to clarify the structure and morphology of the wires. Conductivity measurements of a single wire proved its metallic properties. The suitability of the wires for nanomanipulation as well as the very high current density suggests their usefulness for application in nanoelectronic devises. The synthesis of nanowires in solution is also interesting from a point of view to reaching the gram scale production and their use as fillers, since the production of a composite conducting material will require 10 times less material if metal particles are exchanged with wires. Pursuing the ultimate goad, or the behaviour of fluorescing dyes near more complex metal objects, a multilayered architecture involving a gold interface and gold nanoparticles, which were separated by a well defined polymer spacer was constructed. The properties of the system were fully characterized by surface and optical analytical techniques. The optical constants of the gold nanoparticles were found to be strongly dependent n the separation distance to the gold interface. In an outlook, a next step of research involving the multilayered system described in Chapter 6 could be the deposition of fluorescing dyes around the gold nanoparticles. The plasmon field of the gold nanoparticles, excited by the surface plasmon field of the flat gold interface could lead to a modification of the emission rate of the fluorophore expressed in an enhanced emission. The direct consequence of that could be an improved sensitivity of the instrument. Another possible variation could be the deposition of a polymer spacer around the gold nanoparticles. This could happen in solution or on surface. Then the influence of the separation distance between the curved interface of the gold nanoparticles and a <b>fluorescing</b> <b>dye</b> can be investigated. Another approach can be the deposition of fluorophore between two gold nanoparticles or a gold nanoparticle and a flat gold interface. In this case the enhanced electromagnetic field between the two metal surfaces will impact on the radiative emission of the dye. This work is to be understood as a small step toward the understanding of the behaviour of fluorescing species in the vicinity of a metal interface. For complete revealing of the corresponding phenomena more work should be done in the future. Due to its complexity, the research should involve the efforts of interdisciplinary teams composed of scientists with diverse background. Zusammenfassung Heutzutage ist die Fluoreszenz-Spektroskopie eine verbreitete Methode in der biomedizinischen Forschung und die am meisten genutzte Methode in der medizinischen Diagnose, der DNA-Sequenzanalyse und der Genomforschung. Die Grundlagen der Fluoreszenz sind einschließlich der Faktoren, die die Emission beeinflussen, wohlverstanden (z. B. Quenching, Umwelteinflüsse, Resonanzenergietransfer und Rotationsenergie). Die Fluoreszenz-Spektroskopie wird zur Untersuchung der Struktur und Dynamik von Makromolekülen und deren Wechselwirkung untereinander eingesetzt. Die Intensitäts-, Energietransfer- und Anisotropiemessung sind weit verbreitete Methoden in der DNAHybridisierungsmessung, der Arzneimittelentwicklung und der HIV-Analyse. Es ist bekannt, daß sich das Verhalten fluoreszierender Verbindungen in der Umgebung von metallischen Objekten verändert. Dies kann zur Abschwächung (ebene Metallgrenzfläche) oder Verstärkung (rauhe Metalloberfläche, Metallpartikel) der emittierten Fluoreszenz führen. Das Ziel dieser zukunftsweisenden Arbeit ist die Erforschung des Verhaltens eines Fluorophores in der direkten Umgebung einer Metalloberfläche, da das Verständnis des zugrunde liegenden Phänomens sehr wichtig für alle Prozesse ist, in denen fluoreszierende Farbstoffe an Metalle angrenzen (Solarzellen, LED´s) insbesondere für Anwendungen in der Sensorik. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit können in zwei Abschnitte eingeteilt werden: Die experimentelle und theoretische Untersuchung der Fluoreszenz an ebenen Goldgrenzflächen und die Synthese und Oberflächenmodifizierung von Goldnanopartikeln und – nanodrähten. Abschließend wurden erste Untersuchungen zur Fluoreszenzintensität in der Umgebung komplexer Objekte durchgeführt. Zur Untersuchung der Fluoreszenz in Gegenwart metallischer Grenzflächen wurde ein definiertes Mehrlagensystem im nm-Maßstab dargestellt und experimentell untersucht. Eine sehr glatte Goldschicht wurde zusammen mit einer sich selbst anordnenden Monolage und einer schichtweisen Anordnung von Polyelektrolyten benutzt, um einen fluoreszierenden Farbstoff in einem kontrollierbaren Abstand von der Goldoberfläche anzuordnen. Die charakteristischen Eigenschaften (Schichtdicke, Rauhigkeit, optische Eigenschaften) dieser Schichten wurden mit verschiedenen Techniken (Kleinwinkel-Röntgenreflektivität, Raster- Kraft-Mikroskopie, Oberflächen-Plasmonenspektroskopie) untersucht. In Kapitel 4 wird das Verhalten fluoreszierender Farbstoffe auf einer flachen metallischdielektrischen Oberfläche in Kretschmann-Anordnung untersucht. In diesem Kapitel wurde die Intensität der Fluoreszenz, die Winkelverteilung der Emission und die Bleichungsquote von fluoreszierenden Molekülen, die sich in unterschiedlichen Abständen von der Goldoberfläche befinden experimentell und theoretisch untersucht. Die Ergebnisse der theoretischen und experimentellen Versuche stimmen ab einem Abstand von 15 nm überein. Überraschenderweise kommt es aber bei kürzeren Abständen zu Abweichungen zwischen der Theorie und dem experimentellen Ergebnis, obwohl Experimente mit den entsprechenden Europium-Komplexen über die Lebensdauer im angeregten Zustand eine gute Übereinstimmung zur Theorie ergeben. Um dieses Problem zu klären wurden auch einzelne Moleküle untersucht, die das vorherige Ergebnis aber bestätigten. Eine mögliche Ursache für die Diskrepanz zwischen den hier beschriebenen und den bisher bekannten Ergebnissen kann die stärkere Oszillator-Kraft der hier verwendeten Fluorophore (im Vergleich zu den phosphoreszierenden Europium-Komplexen) sein, die zu stärkeren Wechselwirkungen mit der Goldoberfläche führt. Eine weitere Ursache für die Abweichung von den bekannten Ergebnissen ist möglicherweise die hier benutzte sehr glatte Goldoberfläche, da bekanntermaßen rauhe Metalloberflächen zu einer Steigerung der Fluoreszenz führen. Ferner ist es bekannt, daß die früher benutzte Langmuir-Blodgett-Abscheide-Methode zu Oberflächen mit Löchern, Fehlern und Bereichen mit inhomogener Verteilung der Farbstoffe in senkrechter Richtung führt. Obwohl es zum vollständigen Verständnis der hier beschriebenen Effekte weiterer experimenteller und theoretischer Anstrengungen bedarf, ist diese Arbeit ein wichtiger Beitrag zur Anwendung der Oberflächen-Plasmonen- Fluoreszenzspektroskopie als Analysenmethode für Reaktionen auf Oberflächen und für Vorgänge bei denen ein fluoreszierender Farbstoff an einer metallischen Grenzfläche benutzt wird. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit Goldnanopartikeln und – nanodrähten (Kapitel 5). Zunächst wurde die physisorbierte Citrat-Hülle von Citrat-reduzierten Goldnanopartikeln gegen eine selbstorganisierte Monolage von 2 -Mercaptobernsteinsäure ausgetauscht. Eine Reihe von Versuchen hat eindeutig bewiesen, daß diese Oberflächenmodifikation zu einer besseren pH - und Cyanidstabilität der Goldnanopartikellösung führt. Weiterhin wurde ein neuer Syntheseweg zur Darstellung monolagen-geschützter Goldnanopartikel (< 10 nm) gefunden. Die Darstellung erfolgt ohne Zugabe weiterer Reduktionsmittel im wäßrigen Medium aus Chlorgoldsäure und 2 -Mercaptobernsteinsäure. Dieser neue Syntheseweg kann sich in der Zellabbildung, der DNA-Analyse, der Katalyse oder bei optischen Sensoren als nützlich erweisen, da hier keine engen Größenverteilungen benötigt werden. Bei einem bestimmten Molverhältnis zwischen den beiden Edukten erhält man bei dieser Synthese auch Goldnanodrähte. Die Synthese der Drähte verläuft im wässrigen Medium ohne Zugabe weiterer Detergentien in einem Reaktionsschritt. Die so entstandenen Drähte sind einige Mikrometer lang und der Querschnitt beträgt ca. 15 nm. Verschiedene Oberflächenanalysenmethoden wurden zur Aufklärung der Struktur und Morphologie der Drähte angewandt. Leitfähigkeitsmessungen an einem einzelnen Draht bestätigten seine metallischen Eigenschaften. Diese Drähte eignen sich aufgrund ihrer hohen Stromdichte sowohl für verschiedene Anwendungen in der Nanoelektronik als auch zur „Nanomanipulation“. Die Darstellung der Nanodrähte in wäßriger Lösung im Grammbereich bietet interessante Möglichkeiten für leitende Füllstoffe, da eine Mischung aus leitenden Materialien 10 mal weniger Material benötigt, falls Metallpartikel mit Drähten wechselwirken können. Zur Erforschung des Verhaltens von fluoreszierenden Farbstoffen in der Umgebung von komplexeren Metallobjekten wurde auf einer Goldoberfläche eine Schicht Goldnanopartikel aufgebracht, die aber von dieser Goldoberfläche durch eine Lage eines Polymers wohldefinierter Größe abgetrennt waren. Die Eigenschaften dieses neu synthetisierten Systems wurden durch Oberflächen- und optische Analysenmethoden charakterisiert. Die optischen Eigenschaften der Goldnanopartikel sind stark abhängig von der Distanz zur Goldoberfläche. Der nächste Schritt der Erforschung des in Kapitel 6 beschriebenen mehrschichtigen Systems wäre die Auftragung von fluoreszierenden Farbstoffen auf den Nanopartikeln. Das Plasmonenfeld der Nanopartikel, angeregt durch das Oberflächenplasmon der flachen Goldfläche, könnte zu einer Veränderung der Emissionsrate der Fluorophore führen, was sich durch eine verstärkte Emission ausdrücken würde. Die direkte Konsequenz hieraus wäre eine erhöhte Sensitivität dieses Systems. Eine weitere mögliche Variation dieses Systems wäre die Auftragung eines Polymers als Abstandshalter um die Goldnanopartikel, was sowohl in Lösung als auch direkt auf der Oberfläche möglich ist. Dann wäre es möglich, den Einfluß des Abstandes zwischen der Oberfläche der Goldpartikel und des fluoreszierenden Farbstoffes zu untersuchen. Möglich wäre auch eine Abscheidung der Fluorophore zwischen zwei Goldpartikeln oder zwischen einem Goldpartikel und der Goldoberfläche. In diesem Fall würde die Verstärkung des elektromagnetischen Feldes zwischen den beiden Metalloberflächen die Lichtemmision des Farbstoffes beeinflussen. Diese Arbeit soll ein kleiner Schritt zum Verständnis des Verhaltens von fluoreszierenden Verbindungen in der Nähe von metallischen Grenzflächen sein. Zum vollständigen Verständnis dieser Phänomene ist zukünftig noch viel Arbeit notwendig. Aufgrund ihrer Komplexität erfordert die Erforschung dieses Phänomens die Zusammenarbeit von Wissenschaftlern, die in ein interdisziplinäres Team sowohl chemische als auch physikalische Erfahrung einbringen...|$|E

Herein is disclosed the first small molecule allowing their selective imaging and monitoring {{in the form of}} a diazaoxatriangulene fluorophore, 1 a (hexadecyl side chain). The compound is prepared in three steps from a simple carbenium precursor. In nanospheres, this pH-sensitive (pKa = 7. 3), photochemically stable <b>dye</b> <b>fluoresces</b> in the red part of visible light (601 and 578 nm, acid and basic forms, respectively) with a quantum yield between 14 and 16 % and an excited-state lifetime of 7. 7 - 7. 8 ns. Importantly, the protonated form 1 a·H+ provokes a specific staining of late endosome compartments (pH 5. 0 - 5. 5) after 5 h of incubation with HeLa cells. Not surprisingly, this late endosome marking depends on the intra-organelle pH, and changing the nature of the lipophilic chain provokes a loss of selectivity. Interestingly, fixation of the fluorophore is readily achieved with paraformaldehyde, giving the possibility to image both live and fixed cells. © 2016 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Rhodamine WT was used in order to test for the travel time of the water from the Monson Channel inflow to the Nature Preserve outflow to the Las Vegas Wash. The initial hypothesis was that the water would stay in the system for approximately 8 days. Residence time was tested using an ISCO sampling machine along with a Sequoia-Turner model 450 fluorimeter to test for the <b>fluoresce</b> of the <b>dye</b> in the water. All samples collected were taken immediately to UNLV where they were run through the fluorimeter. Precautions were taken in keeping the samples from being degraded by several factor, including temperature and sunlight. Results were input into Microsoft Excel and statistical values were calculated. The results show that there is a difference in the calculated time and the actual mean residence time. The calculated residence time was 188 hours and the actual mean residence time was 109 hours...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{are done}} using a smooth solid rigid {{homogeneous}} acrylic sphere rolling on an inclined plane which is submerged in water. The motivation for these experiments {{comes from a}} need to understand a class of solid-fluid interaction problems that include sediment transport, movement of gravel on ocean floor and river bed due to water currents. Experiments are performed in a glass water tank 15 cm wide by 14 cm deep by 61 cm long which can be tilted to desired angle. The sphere is released from rest on the inclined false bottom of the tank in quiescent water. Our experimental study has twofold aim: (1) to study the boundary layer separation, the three-dimensional eddying motion in the wake and the near-wake structure and(2) to establish hydrodynamic force coefficients by analyzing kinematical data of the sphere motion from start to till it attains terminal velocity. Experiments are carried out at moderate Reynolds number Rearound 1500. Previous studies on the first problem {{exist in the literature}} for Reup to 350. Previous studies on the second problem do not clearly define the added-mass coefficient and the influence of the water tank side-walls on the drag coefficient. In the first study, the characterization of the wake is done using flow visualization methods (<b>fluoresce</b> in <b>dye</b> visualization and particle streak visualization) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Laser light sheet obtained from an argon ion continuous laser beam is taken in different orientations to illuminate the <b>fluoresce</b> in <b>dye</b> or 14 m silver-coated hollow glass spheres. These experiments show that the wake behind the rolling sphere up to 1. 6 diameters (or 1. 6 D) downstream is confined within height 1. 2 Dand width 1. 2 D. At about 1. 8 Ddownstream, the wake sways alternately {{on either side of the}} equatorial plane, moving in lateral-vertical direction and moving out of the confining region; this gives zigzag appearance to the wake. Also in these experiments, we observe that the flow separations from the surface of the rolling sphere show three separation zones. The eddies shed from the primary separation surface on the upper hemisphere are symmetrical about the equatorial plane with Strouhal number St= 1. 0. The primary separation is affected by the symmetrical secondary separations on the rear surface in the piggyback region — it is the region near the upper rear surface of the sphere behind the transverse equatorial plane and below the primary separation surface. The lower eddies below the primary separation zone are shed alternately on either side of the equatorial plane with shedding frequency St= 0. 5. Our experiments show that there is a viscous blockage of width 0. 4 Dat the crevice near the point of contact. On either side of the viscous blockage at the crevice, we see weak symmetric eddies. Based on our experimental observations, we proceed to build a simple physical model of the separated flow on the surface of the rolling sphere. In the second study, the motion of the sphere is photographed and paired data of the displacement and time is obtained for the sphere motion from the start of motion till terminal velocity is reached at about 4. 5 sphere diameters from the point of release of the sphere. Equation of motion of the sphere is solved numerically treating added-mass coefficient Ca and drag coefficient Cd as parameters. Experimental data is fitted on these solutions and the best fit gives the values of the force coefficients. Theoretical value of Ca equal to 0. 621 is confirmed experimentally. Value of Cd is found to be 1. 23 at Re= 990 and it is 1. 06 at Re= 1900. Side-wall effects become important for ratio of diameter of sphere to width of tank greaterthan 0. 20...|$|R
