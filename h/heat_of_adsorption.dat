50|$|Multiple {{advantages}} of solid sorbents have been reported. Unlike amines, solid sorbents can selectively adsorb CO2 without {{the formation of}} chemical bonds (physisorption). The significantly lower <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>adsorption</b> for solids requires less energy for the CO2 to desorb from the material surface. Also, two primary or secondary amine molecules are generally required to absorb a single CO2 molecule in liquids. For solid surfaces, large capacities of CO2 can be adsorbed.

50|$|Scientists {{have found}} that the gas-phase {{enthalpy}} (<b>heat)</b> <b>of</b> <b>adsorption</b> on zeolites increases as follows: H2 < CH4 < N2 < CO2. It is generally accepted that CO2 has the largest adsorption energy because it has the largest quadrupole moment, thereby increasing its affinity for charged or polar zeolite pores. At low temperatures, zeolite adsorption-capacity is large and the high concentration of adsorbed CO2 molecules blocks the flow of other gases. Therefore, at lower temperatures, CO2 selectively permeates through zeolite pores. Several recent research efforts have focused on developing new zeolite membranes that maximize the CO2 selectivity by taking advantage of the low-temperature blocking phenomena.|$|E
