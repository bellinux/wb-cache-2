50|$|The {{physiological}} tube is one-piece vertical feature {{without any}} crossing {{part of the}} pipettes. Any types of pipette with the cross segment included in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal line are required to adjust to circular.Delivering tips of the genre 1 and genre 2 are different. For the genre 1, the capacities of the delivery tips is constructed at the gradual taper between 15 to 30 mm for 5 ml, and  20 to 40 mm for 10 to 50 ml. The genre 2 has a longer distance between  50 to 65 mm from the tip end. The tip end of the pipettes are perpendicular construction to the axis. A unexpected constricted orifice is not acceptable for the genre 2 pipettes. The beveling and fire polishing from the external margin of the tip is essential {{at the end of}} the tube. The position of zero <b>graduation</b> <b>line</b> is important for determining of initiating scale of the pipettes. The requirement for the scale of the <b>graduation</b> <b>line</b> is not less than ninety mm due to the capacities.This includes from the top stop following to all of graduated pipettes. The exception presents only for 0.5 ml pipettes that require not less than eighty mm.The period of the extensions and the discharge have some limitations. Unplugging the pipettes, the out-flowing time is vertically flow according to the utilizing 256 5°C of the distilled water together with the stopwatch. The determination of the discharge time depends on the unrestrained outflow liquid from the zero calibration to the final base. The abstaining of the flowing time can be observed during this period.The standard of marking of all pf is  irreparable and comprehensible.The tracing mark of the graduation is required not to greater than 0.40 mm from the elevation.

50|$|A thick ring-like shell object {{found with}} four slits each in two margins {{served as a}} compass to measure angles on plane {{surfaces}} or in the horizon in multiples of 40 degrees, up to 360 degrees. Such shell instruments were probably invented to measure 8-12 whole sections of the horizon and sky, explaining the slits on the lower and upper margins. Archaeologists consider this {{as evidence that the}} Lothal experts had achieved something 2,000 years before the Greeks: an 8-12 fold division of horizon and sky, as well as an instrument for measuring angles and perhaps the position of stars, and for navigation. Lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear (others found in Harappa and Mohenjodaro). An ivory scale from Lothal has the smallest-known decimal divisions in Indus civilisation. The scale is 6 millimetres (0.2 inches) thick, 15 mm broad and the available length is 128 mm, but only 27 graduations are visible over 46 mm, the distance between <b>graduation</b> <b>lines</b> being 1.70 mm (the small size indicates use for fine purposes). The sum total of ten graduations from Lothal is approximate to the angula in the Arthashastra. The Lothal craftsmen took care to ensure durability and accuracy of stone weights by blunting edges before polishing.|$|R

40|$|The graduator {{is a very}} {{important}} standard device in the optical angular measuring instrument, which determines the measure precision of the measuring instrument. A new graduator test method is discussed in this paper. This test method is a dual dynamic imaging measurement method with dual digital microscope system, which acquires the images of the graduator rotated by a rotating motor. Here is the introduction of this method with more detail. At first, fix a graduator to be measured on a rotary stage, this stage will be driven by a high precision programmable motor. Make the stage rotate with a constant angular velocity ω. Then place the digital microscope system upon the graduator. The digital microscope system includes two digital microscopes, which placed in the opposite diameter direction. Each digital microscope is made up of optical lens and a CMOS electro-ocular. The sampling frequency f can be set in the control software of the elector-ocular. The two digital microscopes make up a dual dynamic image acquire system. This system can acquire two images of the moving graduator at the same time with the sampling frequency f. Then, a serial of the graduator images can be acquired after a period of rotation, and there is a constant angular difference ω/f between every adjacent image. Each image of the graduator includes several <b>graduation</b> <b>lines,</b> identify these lines and get the position of the lines with image processing method. The measuring value of the rotate angle can be calculated from the adjacent line positions. Use the angular difference ω/f as a standard value of the rotate angle. Compare the measuring value and the standard value with the "comparing method of graduator measurement" formula. A compare result will be given to judge the graduator is good or not at last. The whole system is divided into four functional units: l,the motion control unit; 2,the dual dynamic imaging unit; 3, the image processing unit; 4,the data analysis unit. The measurement principle is introduced {{in the first part of}} the paper. In this part, the background of graduator measurement and the theories of graduator measurement are referred. According to the measurement principle a system design is made in the second part of the paper. In this part, the whole measure system is described: the structure of the system, the function of each component and the specifications for the key components. An experiment system is build up under the design, and some measurement data is obtained, the error analyses of the measure data is given at the last of the paper. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Graduation</b> date: 1971 <b>Line</b> {{balancing}} {{is concerned}} with the optimal assignment of work elements to individual operators in an assembly tine of a mass producing system. This paper summarizes the assembly line balancing terminology, the computational methods, and objective functions applicable {{to a wide variety of}} assembly lines. Single and mixed-model situations for both constant and variable work element times are examined. A Back Tracking Method of Assembly Line Balancing (BALB) is developed and programmed in FORTRAN IV. BALB, as a manual procedure was able to find an optimal solution to problems that other existing methods such as Helgeson and Birnie's positional weight technique, could not yield. In general, BALB was also found to be simple and more efficient than the heuristic methods by Tonge, Hoffman, Mansoor and Arcus. The computer program, *BALB, accepts data for both single and mixed-model ALB problems and considers both constant and variable work element times. This program uses production shift time as the criterion for balancing the mixed-model lines. Numerical examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate the steps of various methods...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{light of}} global {{concerns}} about insufficient numbers of doctors, midwives, and nurses, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the scale-up {{of the production}} of medical professionals who are competent and responsive to community needs as urgent and necessary. Coincident with this imperative, South African medical schools have also had to consider redressing apartheid-era inequities in access to medical education and changing the racial and gender profile of medical graduates to {{be representative of the}} population. In this article, we explore progress and challenges with regard to transformation, defined as intentional and planned changes aimed at addressing historical disadvantages, in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive analysis was conducted using data on medical school admissions and graduations from the Health and Education Departments for the period 1999 &#x 2013; 2011. Admission and graduation statistics of 1999, 2005, 2008, and 2011 were analysed according to race and gender. Results: The results show that there has been progress in transforming the race and gender composition of medical students and graduates, in line with the transformation strategies of the South African government. In 1999, black African enrolments and graduates were conspicuously low in two of the three medical schools in the Gauteng province. By 2011, an almost six-fold increase in black African student enrolments was seen in one medical school that was previously designated as a white institution. In contrast, at the historically black medical school, whites only represented 0. 40 % of enrolments in 1999 and 7. 4 % in 2011. Since 1999, the number and proportion of female medical enrolments and graduates has also increased substantially. Conclusion: While there has been progress with redressing historical disparities and inequities in terms of race and gender, further efforts are needed to ensure that student intakes and <b>graduations</b> are in <b>line</b> with the South African population profile...|$|R
