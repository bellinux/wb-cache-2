5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very}} little volume that is <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters were <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> succession.|$|E

5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, were <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North German Confederation.|$|E

5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E
5|$|After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona {{signed the}} English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, {{but the team}} could not achieve success, as Schuster was <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> team. Terry Venables was {{subsequently}} fired {{at the beginning of}} the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.|$|E
5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, were <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to {{interact}} with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues {{to interact with}} the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E

On three occasions the county progressed to {{the third round of}} the competition: in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Minor counties teams were <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> competition from the 2006 season; Cornwall's last match was against the Netherlands {{in the first round of}} the 2004 competition.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} of selecting a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last attestation on 26 January) and late 1307. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vote, perhaps because of his known pro-English tendencies.|$|E

50|$|Art. 2(1)(a) ECC is {{inspired}} by article 2(a) CISG. Both provisions aim at <b>excluding</b> consumers' transactions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scope of application of the respective conventions.

Art. 2(2) ECC <b>excludes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scope of application of the convention electronic transferable records. These are electronic records that entitle the entity controlling them to the delivery of goods or the payment of a sum, as evidenced in the record.
