Using RCA in fresh concrete is one way to address both of these issues. However, there has long been a concern that RCA may negatively affect the properties of new concrete in which it is included.

40|$|International audienceTo better {{understand}} the hydro-mechanical behavior of dual porosity expansive clays, three groups of tests were carried out. First, isotropic <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> and free wetting tests were performed to determine both branches of the soil water retention curve of a silt–bentonite mixture and its parameters. Next, constant suction oedometer tests at different matric suctions were employed using osmotic method. Finally, wetting–drying cycles were imposed on the samples in oedometric condition. At the end of wetting–drying tests, different suction values were enforced on the specimens and consolidation tests were performed, while the suction values were regulated through the samples using the osmotic method. Cross-examination of results indicates good consistency between the observed behaviors from different tests: Results of constant suction oedometer tests confirm the hardening phenomenon at low suctions indicated by the <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> test.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on setting the behavior and shrinkage properties of high-performance pavement concrete and the effect factors, such as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), chemical admixtures, and temperature. The thesis consists of two papers: (1) the relation between setting behavior and the maturity of pavement concrete materials and (2) a simple statistical model to predict the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete containing supplementary cementitious materials. In paper 1, setting behaviour and maturity of six different concrete mixtures under three different curing temperatures (18. 3, 23. 9, and 29. 4 C, corresponding to 65, 75 and 85 oF) were investigated. The mixtures were made with two different retarders (ASTM Types B and D) and with 0 or 20 % Class C fly ash replacement for Type I cement. The initial and final set times of these mixtures were measured by the penetration resistance method according to ASTM C 403. The temperature rise of the mixtures was monitored using a thermal couple, and the concrete maturity was then computed based on the time- temperature factor (TTF). A new approach is introduced for predicting concrete set time (penetration resistance) based on the concrete maturity (time-temperature factor). The results indicate that concrete penetration resistance well correlates with maturity measurements. This relationship enables engineers to assess setting behaviour of field concrete on site. In paper 2, autogenous shrinkage and <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage of nine different high performance concrete mixtures used for bridge decks and bridge overlays constructions were measured, and the total shrinkage (defined as autogenous shrinkage plus <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage) was studied. The mixtures were systemically designed for evaluating effects of class C fly ash and ground granulated blast-furance slag replacement on shrinkage proporties. A simplified exponential model ɛauto/drying(t) =a+b*e(c*t) was introduced for describing and predicting shrinkage in high-performance concrete when different types and amounts of supplementary cementitious materials were used. This model fits for both autogenous and <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage and is validated and proved by comparing measured value with predicted shrinkage value of an independent group of mixtures. The results indicate that compare to GGBF slag, fly ash performs much better to reduce the total shrinkage. Additionally, <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage increases linearly with autogenous shrinkage between 0 and 14 days. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the concrete maturity method successfully describes the concrete setting behavior; and the exponential model successfully predicts the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete with SCMs. Additionally, the results indicate Class C fly ash replacement can reduce the total shrinkage and extend the setting time of high-performance concrete. The addition of Class C fly ash should be considered if extending concrete setting time and reducing the risk of shrinkage cracking are needed...|$|E
40|$|High Performance Concrete (HPC) {{overlays}} {{have been}} used as a cheap and effective method of repair for bridge deck structures from wearing from traffic loadings. These HPC mixes usually consist of high amounts of cementitious materials and tend to have high tendency towards cracking induced by shrinkage. Accelerated corrosion of reinforcing steel and deterioration of deck surface are potential threats in bridge decks where cracks have occured. Cracking potential of a mix under restraint is currently evaluated by ASTM C 1581. The method looks into {{the rate at which the}} strain develops in a restrained condition to evaluate cracking potential. But a mix that develops shrinkage at a high rate may also develop strength at a higher rate, compensating the potential to cracking. This study involves investigating the use of simpler shrinkage measurements and strength characteristics to determine the cracking potential of a concrete mix. For this investigation 11 HPC mixtures selected by the Iowa DOT which were composed of 3 cements, Type I, I/II and IP. Supplementary cementitious materials class c fly ash, slag and metakaolin were replaced by 20 %, 15 % and 5. 6 % respectively. Limestone coarse aggregate was used in 10 mixes and 1 mix with quartzite. Two gradations of coarse aggregate were used for limestone aggregates.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute to the characterization and the understanding of shrinkage of SCCs where Portland cement is partially substituted by slag, fly ash or metakaolin. The shrinkage from casting to 360 days of aging of four SCC mixtures based on CEM I 52. 5 N, CEM III/A 52. 5 L (slag cement), CEM V 42. 5 N (blended cement containing fly ash and slag) and CEM I + 15 % of metakaolin is investigated. Experimental tests include plastic, autogenous, <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> and restrained shrinkage.

The use of CEM III instead of CEM I involves an inverse behavior. In restrained conditions, mineral admixtures seem to reduce the age of crack initiation.

40|$|High-performance {{concrete}} (HPC) overlays {{have been}} used increasingly as an effective and economical method for bridge decks in Iowa and other states. However, due to its high cementitious material content, HPC often displays high shrinkage cracking potential. This study investigated the shrinkage behavior and cracking potential of the HPC overlay mixes commonly used in Iowa. In the study, 11 HPC overlay mixes were studied. These mixes consisted of three types of cements (Type I, I/II, and IP) and various supplementary cementitious materials (Class C fly ash, slag and metakaolin). Limestone with two different gradations was used as coarse aggregates in 10 mixes and quartzite was used in one mix. Chemical shrinkage of pastes, <b>free</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage, autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete, and restrained ring shrinkage of concrete were monitored over time. Mechanical properties (such as elastic modulus and compressive and splitting tensile strength) of these concrete mixes were measured at different ages. Creep coefficients of these concrete mixes were estimated using the RILEM B 3 and NCHRP Report 496 models. Cracking potential of the concrete mixes was assessed based on both ASTM C 1581 and simple stress-to-strength ratio methods. The results indicate that among the 11 mixes studied, three mixes (4, 5, and 6) cracked {{at the age of}} 15, 11, and 17 days, respectively. Autogenous shrinkage of the HPC mixes ranges from 150 to 250 microstrain and free dying shrinkage of the concrete ranges from 700 to 1, 200 microstrain at 56 days. Different concrete materials (cementitious type and admixtures) and mix proportions (cementitious material content) affect concrete shrinkage in different ways. Not all mixes having a high shrinkage value cracked first. The stresses in the concrete are associated primarily with the concrete shrinkage, elastic modulus, tensile strength, and creep. However, a good relationship is found between cementitious material content and total (autogenous and <b>free</b> <b>drying)</b> shrinkage of concrete...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Room {{temperature}} drying {{tests on}} silt slurry with free and constrained boundaries, reveal an initial phase {{with a significant}} shrinkage at full saturation. Hence, this shrinkage is linked to a mass loss of pore fluid through the external boundary. Shrinkage in the unsaturated phase is much smaller. A simultaneous porosimetry reveals a bi-modal pore size distribution with a distinct evolution. In a microscopic model a bundle of deformable capillary vessels represent the modal size pores. Larger mode pores dominate the deformation, the smaller ones contributing little. A transition to an unsaturated phase occurs when the negative pore fluid pressure at the vessel exit reaches the pressure of fluid cavitation in large, then small vessels. Further desaturation is a result mainly from migration of the evaporation interfaces. Cracking arises due to an excess of radial tensile stress due to a constrained kinematics, which is three times higher than during <b>free</b> <b>drying.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|Drying {{shrinkage}} can {{be defined}} as the volumetric change due to the drying of concrete. This change in volume of the concrete is not equal to volume of the water lost. The loss of free water occurs first; this causes little to no shrinkage. As the drying of the concrete continues, the adsorbed water held by hydrostatic tension in the small capillaries (< 50  nm) is removed. The shrinkage due to this water loss is significantly larger than that associated with the loss of free water. The loss of water produces tensile stresses, which lead the concrete to shrink (Guneyisi et al. 2010). <b>Free</b> <b>drying</b> shrinkage of the SCCs specimens after drying was assessed at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 91  days.

Besides the measurement of length changes, three-point bending fracture tests at the age of 3 and 28 days were also performed. The modulus elasticity, effective fracture toughness and specific fracture energy values were determined from load versus deflection diagrams recorded during fracture experiments on the specimens with dimensions 40 × 40 × 160 mm...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{change can}} alter the spatial {{variance}} of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (C, N, P) delivery across a watershed and lead to altered nutrient limitation and export patterns. We tested the effects of land-use on C, N, and P limitation in 13 tributary and 3 mainstem locations in the Portneuf River watershed, Idaho using nutrient diffusing substrates. Impacted and nonimpacted sites were paired based on sub-basin size, impact type (minimal, agro-urban), location within the watershed, and discharge. Across all sites, regardless of impact, mean chlorophyll a was significantly stimulated (p 3 ̆c 0. 002) by N and N+P addition and suppressed (p 3 ̆c 0. 000) by C addition. Ash <b>free</b> <b>dry</b> mass (AFDM) had varying responses to treatment. Chlorophyll a response ratios (treatment/control) were 20...|$|R
40|$|The red {{microalga}} Porphyridium cruentum is a {{new source}} for eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AA) fatty acids of potential pharmaceutical value. The conditions leading to a high content of either fatty acid were investigated. The highest EPA content was obtained under conditions resulting in high growth rate (2. 4 % of ash <b>free</b> <b>dry</b> weight in Strain 1380 - 1 d). High AA content was obtained under slow growth conditions and was maximal in the stationary phase or under nitrogen starvation (2. 9 %). Strain 1380 - 1 a had the highest content (1. 9 %) of arachidonic acid under exponential growth conditions. By imposing nitrogen starvation, {{it was possible to}} obtain a lipid mixture which may be separated into AA and EPA rich fractions...|$|R
40|$|Growth, oxygen uptake, {{swimming}} activity, feeding {{ability and}} energy content were investigated in cod larvae from several groups under different experimental conditions. At yolk absorption the larvae consumed 0. 090 - 0. 120 ul O 2 /larva/hour {{depending on the}} larval group examined. The larval energy consumption either measured as oxygen uptake or calculated from larval weight decrement, was of the same magnitude. The oxygen uptake was 20 - 30 % higher under 100 lux illumination than in darkness, a difference which was of the same magnitude (20 %) as the difference in weight decrement between larvae held at a constant 500 lux and larvae held in constant darkness. Light-adapted larvae showed a 6 - 10 times higher swimming frequency (bursts of swmming per min) than dark-adapted ones. The overall utilization of yolk for somatic growth varied between 65 and 70 % depending on the larval group examined. The utilization seemed independant of temperature and light intensity when these parameters were kept within the natural range observed during hatching in the Lofoten area. The specific energy content of eggs and larvae showed a steady decrease through the experimental period from 5. 8 cal/ mq ash <b>free</b> <b>dry</b> weight in newly fertilized eggs to 4. 8 cal/ mg ash <b>free</b> <b>dry</b> weight in larvae 12 days after hatchlng. The larvae showed maximum swimming speeds at days 5, 6 and 7 post-hatching (10 - 20 cm/min). There was a significant correlation between mean swimming speed (cm/min) and mean swimming frequency (number of swimming bursts/min) throughout the experimental period. The larvae showed maximum feeding success (22 %) at day 7 post-hatching. The results are discussed in relation to larval prey density requirements {{at the onset of}} feeding...|$|R
