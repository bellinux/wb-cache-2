25|$|Psychosis {{may involve}} {{delusional}} beliefs, {{some of which}} are paranoid in nature. Put simply, delusions are false beliefs that a person <b>holds</b> <b>on</b> to, without adequate evidence. It can be difficult to change the belief, even with evidence to the contrary. Common themes of delusions are persecutory (person believes that others are out to harm them), grandiose (person believing that they have special powers or skills), etc. Persons with Ekbom syndrome may have delusional beliefs of an imaginary parasite infestation, whereas depressed persons might have delusions consistent with their low mood (e.g., delusions that they have sinned, or have contracted serious illness, etc.). Karl Jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity; also religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).|$|E

Victoria persuades Olivia's servant to disguise himself as her rich uncle, the original owner of the land that Laura now holds.
