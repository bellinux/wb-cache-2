Mankind still struggles for an efficient molecular system that mimics this natural process. In order to harvest light energy and to trans-form it into chemical energy, photochemical reactions must be studied and optimized for synthetic applications. Two major reaction paths that use electronic excitation are photocycloaddi-tions and photochemical rearrangements. These reactions have been intensively investigated {{in recent decades}} in terms of regio-, stereo-, spin- and (electronic) configurational selectivi-ties. Prior to every photochemical reaction, an electronically excited state is generated either by direct light absorption or by energ...|$|E

The pyridinylidene–benzimidazolylidene and imidazolylidene–benzimidazolyli-dene {{hybrid systems}} {{were designed to}} be the first super electron donors to convert iodoarenes to aryl radicals at room temperature, and indeed both show evidence for significant aryl radical formation at room temperature. The stronger pyridinylidene–imidazolyli-dene donor converts iodoarenes to aryl anions efficiently under appropriate conditions (3 equiv of donor). The presence of excess sodium hydride base has a very important and selective effect on some of these electron-transfer reactions, and a rationale for this is proposed...|$|E
