Agricultural land was divided into large fields surrounded by <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> <b>dykes</b> and equipped with intake and exit canals. The basins were flooded and then closed for about 45 days to saturate the soil with moisture and allow the silt to deposit. Then the water was discharged to lower fields or back into the Nile. Immediately thereafter, sowing started, and harvesting followed some three of four months later. In the dry season thereafter, farming was not possible. Thus, all crops had to fit into this tight scheme of irrigation and timing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnder {{embankment}} <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> <b>dykes,</b> horizontal {{groundwater seepage}} prevails. If the subsoil is layered, and if some coarse layers are not appropriate filters for finer layers, {{there can be}} contact erosion at the interface between fine and coarse soils. In order to study contact erosion threshold, some base-soil and coarse-soil combinations were submitted to a flow parallel to the interface between the coarse soil and the base soil. Critical velocities and critical hydraulic gradients were measured for various base soils. Using effective base-soil grain diameter, an empirical expression for critical velocity was proposed that is well adapted for silts or sand/clay mixtures {{as well as for}} sands. The mass of eroded soil was measured relative to the flow velocity for each base-soil/coarse-soil setup. The shear stress applied to the interface between base soil and coarse soil was derived from the hydraulic gradient. Using an empirical relationship between applied shear stress and measured eroded mass, erosion rate was estimated for each base-soil/coarse-soil setup...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInternal erosion by piping {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes {{responsible}} of accidents and failures of earth structures such as embankment <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> <b>dykes.</b> This phenomenon occurs when concentrated leak develop in pre-existing defects in the earth fill such cracks and micro fissures, discontinuities, hydraulic fracture, channels, roots and burrows. It involves the removal of soil particles from the subsurface of these defaults to an exit point, leading to the formation and the evolution of a continuous “pipe” between the upstream and the downstream side. A new experimental device has been developed to carry out hole erosion tests in laboratory in order to better understand the mechanism of internal erosion process of soil. A series of hole erosion tests were carried out under constant flow rate in order to quantify the critical shear stress (Tau_c) and the coefficient of piping erosion (ker) of soils. Parametric studies were conducted on Kaolinite and Hostun sand/Kaolinite mixture. The key parameters investigated in this study were effects of moisture content, compaction energy and percentage of fines. The experimental results show that these parameters play a key role on the erosion characteristics (Tau_c and ker). A numerical piping model has been developed from equations of diphasic flow with diffusion and the equation of jump with erosion to interpret the hole erosion tests...|$|E
2500|$|Large {{volumes of}} {{tailings}} are {{a byproduct of}} bitumen extraction from the oil sands and managing these tailings {{is one of the}} most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry. Tailings ponds are engineered <b>dam</b> <b>and</b> <b>dyke</b> systems that contain solvents used in the separation process as well as residual bitumen, salts and soluble organic compounds, fine silts and water. The concentrations of chemicals may be harmful to fish and oil on the surface harmful to birds. These settling basins were meant to be temporary. A major hindrance to the monitoring of oil sands produced waters has been the lack of identification of individual compounds present. By better understanding the nature of the highly complex mixture of compounds, including naphthenic acids, it may be possible to monitor rivers for leachate and also to remove toxic components. Such identification of individual acids has for many years proved to be impossible but a breakthrough in 2011 in analysis began to reveal what is in the oil sands tailings ponds. Ninety percent of the tailings water can be reused for oil extraction. By 2009 as tailing ponds continued to proliferate and volumes of fluid tailings increased, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board issued Directive 074 to force oil companies to manage tailings based on new aggressive criteria.

40|$|International audienceA {{process called}} piping, which often {{occurs in the}} soil at <b>dams,</b> levees, <b>and</b> <b>dykes,</b> {{involves}} the formation and development of a continuous tunnel between upstream and downstream ends. The hole erosion test is commonly used to quantify the critical stress {{and the rate of}} piping erosion progression. The aim {{of this study is to}} draw up a model for interpreting the results of this test. A characteristic internal erosion time is defined and expressed as a function of the initial hydraulic gradient and the coefficient of surface erosion. It is established here that the product of the coefficient of erosion and the flow velocity is a significant dimensionless number: when this number is small, the kinetics of erosion are low, and the particle concentration does not have any effect on the flow. This finding applies to most of the available test results. Theoretical and experimental evidence is presented showing that the evolution of the pipe radius during erosion with a constant pressure drop obeys a scaling exponential law...|$|R
50|$|Placed {{into service}} in 1919, the {{reservoir}} {{was created by}} two large earth filled <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> two smaller <b>dykes</b> spanning gaps between hills. From 1920 to 1950 it was the main water storage facility for the western San Fernando Valley, primarily serving agricultural irrigation needs. During that period, dam improvements increased water capacity from the initial 7,400 acre-feet to 9,840 acre-feet. As the West San Fernando Valley shifted away from agriculture toward suburban housing, reservoir use shifted toward domestic water supply, requiring reservoir improvements to address water quality issues related to: storm water runoff, algae and aquatic plant growth in shallow bays, and wind-propelled waves which stirred up mud. Construction related to these improvements began in Spring of 1969.|$|R

The present work includes also appreciation of the volumes of materials from gravel pit, water regime in the additional accumulation for different extreme years and different hydraulic solutions of regulation of flows with calculations. On the other side there is also a problem of the water organisms’ migrations after the hydro power plants at the lower stream of Sava are constructed. The solution would be fish-ways, which do not function as they should in Slovenia as they represent a waste of energy for hydro power plants.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} constraining and enabling contextual factors of implementing flood risk measures. Eight case studies are researched in four categories. Two green measures, two grey measures, two hybrid measures and two early warning systems are researched. Green measures flood risk mitigation measures that {{make use of}} environmental services. Grey measures are infrastructural measures like <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> <b>dykes.</b> Hybrid measures are measures that combine grey and green structures, for example a salt marsh {{in front of a}} dyke to slow down the waves. Early warning systems are systems to predict high water levels that can be translated by the appropriate authorities into warnings. Three phases of implementation, the design of the plan, the actual implementation and the phase of the endurance have been researched of each of the case studies. Also, the economic, political, cultural, social and legal circumstances that could have had an effect on the implementation have been researched. From these, cross case patterns have been distilled. It has been found that technical capacity, institutional capacity, economic capacity, local stakeholder engagement, institutional embeddedness of flood risk reduction techniques, the presence of the issue on the international agenda, political willingness, cultural preferences and efficient rules and regulations are all contextual factors that {{play a role in the}} implementation of flood risk measures. The data did not clearly indicate that corruption also played a role, but it can be assumed that this is also a relevant factor. These contextual factors all have been linked to already existing global indicators. This is done because the results of this studie will be used by Deltares, an independent research institute in the field of water and subsurface. The data will be used to built a model on the implementation of flood risk measures. These will be visualized in an interactive global map that can function as a tool for policymakers. The model is not going to represent the absolute truth, since that is not possible, but it is supposed to help understand the implementation feasibility of flood risk measures in different parts of the world...|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{scatterer}} interferometry (PSI) {{has matured}} to an established {{method for detection}} of large-scale and small-scale deformation phenomena in urban areas and of man-made infrastructure. Deformation regimes originating from oil, gas, or water extraction, storage of gas underground, CO 2 sequestration, loading of <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> <b>dykes,</b> and mining activities are prominent examples for investigations that {{have been carried out}} successfully applying the PSI technique to ERS or ENVISAT data stacks. Due to the sparse spatial distribution of persistent scatterers (PSs) and the moderate resolution of the mentioned satellites it has usually not been possible to track down the source of scattering in detail. The use of PSs was also opportunistic, that is, the PSI monitoring of individual buildings or specific parts of infrastructure was not always been guaranteed. This situation changes dramatically if PSI is applied to very high resolution data obtained from modern radar satellites like TerraSAR-X or COSMO-Skymed. For example, TerraSAR-X is able to deliver images with a resolution of up to 1 m in azimuth and 0. 6 m in slant range when operated in the so-called high-resolution spotlight mode with 300 MHz bandwidth. This kind of data provide much more details of single objects {{and at the same time}} much higher PS densities. Compared to ERS or ENVISAT type data, the PS density can increase by factors of 100 - 200 on the same area. This is caused by the physical fact that at higher resolution and shorter wavelength, small scatterers (e. g., trihedrals) show higher signal-to-clutter ratio. Often, several tens to more than a hundred PSs can be found on a single large building facade or roof. Thus, individual buildings and infrastructure can be monitored in terms of structural stress and seasonal deformation, which is also supported by the short revisiting time of only 11 days of TerraSAR-X. Besides on resolution, the density of these points also depends on additional acquisition parameters like incidence angle or polarization and also on the three-dimensional (3 D) structure of the given scene, as regions of layover areas and shadow are closely related to the geometrical configuration. The dependence of PS density on these parameters is discussed in this article utilizing results of PSI analysis of different high-resolution TerraSAR-X spotlight data stacks. In addition to this increase of resolution, TerraSAR-X products benefit from a high absolute slant range georeferencing accuracy of 0. 5 - 1 m, which supports a very precise absolute 3 D localization of the PSs on the same order. Hence, the physical nature of a PS can be investigated in more detail helping the understanding of the scattering source of the man-made infrastructure. Results of 3 D localization and deformation assessment on several test sites are presented in this article...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEnsuring {{the safety}} of {{hydraulic}} embankment structures, including embankment <b>dams,</b> levees <b>and</b> <b>dykes,</b> {{is a major concern}} all over the world. Still today, about one to two large dams fail every year in the world and hundreds, probably thousands, of <b>dykes</b> <b>and</b> levees fail every year in the world. Embankment hydraulic structures can be subject to three potential failure modes: instability, internal erosion and external erosion. The physical parameters driving instability are the pore pressures inside the embankment and its foundation. This failure mode covers both general slope sliding and instabilities due to seismic loadings. Statistics show that 6 % of the failure of large embankment dams are due to that process. Internal erosion can be initiated in the embankment and/or in its foundation by four several types of processes: crack erosion, contact erosion, regressive erosion and suffusion. Crack erosion and regressive erosion can lead {{to one of the most}} sudden and dangerous failure mode: piping. Statistics show that 46 % of the failures of large embankment dams are due to that process. External erosion is due to the detachment of the embankment material by the overtopping flow. Erosion of the upstream toe of <b>dykes</b> <b>and</b> levees can also lead to failures. Statistics show that 48 % of the failures of large embankment dams are due to these processes of external erosion. Study of real cases of embankment <b>dam</b> failures <b>and</b> researches performed in the last two decades on hydraulic embankments erosion both show that breach parameters (such as the breach peak outflow, the final breach length or the breach opening duration) can not be correctly predicted only by geometrical parameters of the embankment and the upstream reservoir. Taking into account the behaviour of the embankment and foundation material under the flow stress, that is called the material erodibility, is now considered essential for safety assessments of that type of structures. Different experimental devices, called erodimeters, have been developed for sediment transport or embankment issues. Their use is always based on an assumption of an erosion law, which is the relation between the rate of erosion (i. e. quantity of eroded material per time unit per surface unit) and parameters characterizing the flow and the soil material. Two erodimeters have been selected for the assessment of the erodibility of hydraulic embankment structures, based on the physical processes they are representing and their practical characteristics. These two erodimeters are the Jet Erosion Test and the Hole Erosion Test. After presenting the physical principles of these two tests and the modelling upon which they are based, their engineering application is illustrated as well as the research needs that remain...|$|R
