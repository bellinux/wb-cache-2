40|$|Areas {{which require}} {{high-temperature}} MOS circuits are instrumentations for geothermal and petroleum well-logging, space exploration, aero-propulsion systems, and other hostile environments. MOS digital circuits at high temperature are examined {{as well as}} the maximum operating temperature of MOS devices. Factors affecting high-temperature operation of these devices, including threshold voltage sensitivity, mobility degradation, leakage current characterization and interactions, zero-TC current in analog applications and reliability considerations, are discussed. Methods to reduce threshold voltage sensitivities, process modifications to reduce leakage current density at high temperature, circuit techniques to eliminate the leakage current effects, <b>diode</b> <b>compensation,</b> CMOS thermal latch-up and MOS scaling rules at high temperature are investigated. Experimental results of epitaxial diodes to verify the leakage current reduction effect are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn {{investigation into the}} effect of radiation from a linear accelerator on two types of integrated circuit operational amplifiers was made. Dielectric isolation, thin film resistors and <b>compensation</b> <b>diodes</b> were used in one amplifier (μA 744). The other amplifier (μA 709) was fabricated using standard methods. The μA 744 amplifier, in its current stage of development, {{was found to be}} more susceptible to the effects of accumulated dose from high energy electrons than the μA 709 amplifier.

40|$|The {{plasma etching}} damage in p-type GaN has been characterized. From current-voltage and capacitance-voltage {{characteristics}} of Schottky diodes, {{it was revealed}} that inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching causes an increase in series resistance of the Schottky <b>diodes</b> and <b>compensation</b> of acceptors in p-type GaN. We investigated deep levels near the valence band of p-type GaN using current deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and no deep level originating from the ICP etching damage was observed. On the other hand, by capacitance DLTS measurements for n-type GaN, we observed an increase in concentration of a donor-type defect with an activation energy of 0. 25 ?eV after the ICP etching. The origin of this defect would be due to nitrogen vacancies. We also observed this defect by photocapacitance measurements for ICP-etched p-type GaN. For both n- and p-type GaN, we found that the low bias power ICP etching is effective to reduce the concentration of this defect introduced by the high bias power ICP etching...|$|R
50|$|ECL {{is based}} on an emitter-coupled (long-tailed) pair, shaded red in the figure on the right. The left half of the pair (shaded yellow) {{consists}} of two parallel-connected input transistors T1 and T2 (an exemplary two-input gate is considered) implementing NOR logic. The base voltage of the right transistor T3 is held fixed by a reference voltage source, shaded light green: the voltage divider with a <b>diode</b> thermal <b>compensation</b> (R1, R2, D1 and D2) and sometimes a buffering emitter follower (not shown on the picture); thus the emitter voltages are kept relatively steady. As a result, the common emitter resistor RE acts nearly as a current source. The output voltages at the collector load resistors RC1 and RC3 are shifted and buffered to the inverting and non-inverting outputs by the emitter followers T4 and T5 (shaded blue). The output emitter resistors RE4 and RE5 do not exist in all versions of ECL. In some cases 50 Ω line termination resistors connected between the bases of the input transistors and −2 V act as emitter resistors.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is he {{realisation}} of the colour control and brightness control of white organic light-emitting <b>diodes</b> and the <b>compensation</b> of the change of the chromaticity coordinates and the luminous density fort he lifetime of the OLED. The ageing behaviour of different OLED types was analysed and it was verified {{that it is possible}} to control the colour by adjusting the current amount. As well an independent control of the average luminous density by the pulse with modulation of the OLED current is possible. Under use of a colour sensor a device for the regulation of the life time compensation was developed. The ability of the device to control and regulate colour and brightness was proved. Furthermore the efficiency of the control device and the integration of the sensor in the OLED-Panel was examined...|$|R
