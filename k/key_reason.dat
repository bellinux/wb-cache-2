5|$|Squire {{later said}} a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> {{for the success}} {{was that there was}} a postal strike which {{prevented}} chart returns being sent, and reducing the available ones to a few retailers in London.

5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
5|$|He made five appearances, scoring {{twice on}} loan at Rochdale before signing {{permanently}} on an 18-month contract on 1 January 2009. McEvilly made 10 more appearances, starting just once and scoring three goals, before joining Barrow on loan in March, citing {{his friendship with}} joint-manager David Bayliss as a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> for his move. He scored seven his debut on 21 March at home against Lewes, which finished as a 2–0 victory. In Barrow's next match on 29 March, he was sent off against Weymouth {{for the second time}} that season after he received two yellow cards in the 3–0 away win, picking up the first for kicking the ball away {{in the first half and}} then a second in the 69th minute for a foul on Gavin Hoyte, resulting his dismissal. He made six appearances in the Conference National for Barrow, scoring once. On 2 May, McEvilly made one last appearance for Rochdale in their 1–0 home defeat to Gillingham, replacing Adam Rundle as a substitute in the 75th minute. Rochdale terminated his contract by mutual consent at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the Cook Islands, and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E

5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{has been referred to}} as Syria's most radical government in history. He initiated rash and radical policies internally and externally, and tried to overturn Syrian society from the top to the bottom. While Assad and Jadid agreed ideologically, they did not agree on how to implement these beliefs in practice. The Military Committee, which had been the officers' key decision-making process during 1963–66, lost its central institutional authority under Jadid because the fight against the Aflaqites was over – the <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> for the committee's existence in the first place. While Jadid never acquired, or took the offices of Prime Minister or President, instead opting to rule through the office of Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command, he was the undisputed ruler of Syria from 1966 to 1970. Before the 1966 coup, Jadid had controlled the Syrian armed forces through his post as Head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, but from 1966 onwards Jadid became absorbed with running the country, and in his place, Assad was given the task of controlling the armed forces. This would later prove to be a mistake, and lead to Jadid's downfall in the 1970 Corrective Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{is married}} to Lainya, whom he met whilst a Southampton player. The couple lived locally with her parents during Shearer's second year at the south coast club, and were married on 8 June 1991 at St. James' Church in the city. In {{contrast}} to the portrayal of some WAGs (wives and girlfriends) of later players by the media, Lainya is described by Shearer as a quiet and reserved person, not comfortable in the spotlight her husband's fame sometimes brought. The couple have three children. Shearer cited not wanting to uproot his family as a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> for remaining in England during his career, having {{had the chance to}} move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn. Shearer's family accompanied him onto the pitch following the striker's testimonial in May 2006 as he performed a lap of honour at St James' Park.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} {{withdrawal}} of the RAAF's Vengeances from combat. Odgers judged that a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> behind the decision was the poor performance of the Vengeance compared to other available aircraft in the region. USAAF units equipped with superior types were arriving in New Guinea during early 1944, and Kenney wanted to free up scarce space at forward airfields so that he could launch attacks on the important Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia; these targets were beyond the range of the Vengeance. In particular, No. 77 Wing was required to vacate Nadzab so that its airfields could accommodate a group of long-ranged Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighers. Odgers also argued that the Vengeances had proven to be mechanically unreliable, and had difficulty taking off while carrying a full bomb load: in practice it was found that they could carry only the same bomb load as Kittyhawk fighters. The Kittyhawks were also superior at strafing targets and {{did not need to be}} escorted. A 2008 paper written by staff of the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre disputed Odgers' views on the reliability of the aircraft, stating that No. 77 Wing had a good serviceability rate. This paper instead argued that difficulties in supplying the wing may have been a more important factor.|$|E

A {{lack of public}} awareness is a <b>key</b> <b>reason</b> why {{there has not been}} significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>key</b> <b>reasons</b> behind the decision by the firm management of Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) listed firms to cross-list in East African Exchanges. The study employed a descriptive research design. A Likert type questionnaire was administered to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) or the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of the target firms. The study conducted factor analysis to identify the <b>key</b> <b>reasons</b> for the cross-listing in the East African region. The <b>key</b> <b>reasons</b> identified were investor recognition, expansion of business, boosting of sales and desire to lower the cost of capital. The factor analysis did not provide evidence that legal bonding is a motivation for the cross-listing by NSE firms. The findings from the study appear to indicate that there may exist contextual differences in the decisions to cross-list, consequently generalizations may not suffice. </p...|$|R
