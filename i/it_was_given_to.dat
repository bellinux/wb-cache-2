5|$|After the war, Bockscar {{returned}} to the United States in November 1945. In September 1946 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The aircraft was flown to the Museum on 26 September 1961, and its original markings were restored (noseart was added after the mission). Bockscar is now on permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, next to a replica of a Fat Man.|$|E
5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E

5|$|In September 2004, Monster paid $6 {{million in}} an {{agreement}} with the San Francisco 49ers and the city of San Francisco to rename the football team's home stadium from Candlestick Park to Monster Park for four years. $3 million of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the football team and the other $3 million to the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. Critics of local politician Matt Gonzales said it was inappropriate for the city to sell the name of a public facility to a corporation and a ballot was passed ensuring that the name of the park reverted to Candlestick Park in 2008.|$|E
5|$|It derives {{its name}} from Alexandria where it resided {{for a number of}} years before it was brought by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Cyril Lucaris from Alexandria to Constantinople. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Charles I of England in the 17th century. Until the later {{purchase}} of Codex Sinaiticus, it was the best manuscript of the Greek Bible deposited in Britain. Today, it rests along with Codex Sinaiticus in one of the showcases in the Ritblat Gallery of the British Library. A full photographic reproduction of the New Testament volume (Royal MS 1 D. viii) is available on the British Library's website.|$|E
5|$|Richard II {{inherited}} Berkamsted Castle in 1377; {{initially the}} use of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> his favourite, Robert de Vere and, after de Vere's fall from power and exile in 1388, to John Holland. Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard in 1400, and he used the property to detain rival applicants to the throne. During this period Geoffrey Chaucer, later famous for his Canterbury Tales, oversaw renovation work on the castle {{in his role as}} a clerk. Both Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until his overthrow in 1461.|$|E

The NSS first bestowed the award in 2007 on lunar entrepreneur and former astronaut Harrison Schmitt. In 2008, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> physicist John Marburger.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in royal hands until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> John Dudley in 1553. Dudley came to prominence under Henry VIII {{and became the}} leading political figure under Edward VI. Dudley was a patron of John Shute, an early exponent of classical architecture in England, and began the process of modernising Kenilworth. Before his execution in 1553 by Queen Mary for attempting to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, Dudley had built the new stable block and widened the tiltyard to its current form.|$|E
5|$|The house {{started as}} a small {{farmhouse}} in 1630 but was enlarged into its current form in the 18th century. The house was {{the property of the}} Napper family for centuries. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the National Trust in 1954. The Arts and Crafts style garden is modeled on that at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire. It was originally laid out by Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} homestead block {{faced an}} uncertain future for many years, until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the Department of Agriculture in 1924. Initially intended {{for the production of}} pure seed wheat and oats, very little was produced for several years. Avondale was used as an assembly and holding ground for dairy cattle, prior to them being sent to group settlers in the state's South West. During this period, the silo was built with a capacity of 100 tonnes; the silo is now heritage listed.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{obtained}} {{one more}} benefice during this period. On 20 December 1348, {{he was made}} Dean of Aberdeen Cathedral, a high-ranking office which Walter was not technically eligible to hold without a papal grace, being only a sub-deacon in orders. The deanery had been made vacant {{by the death of}} the long-serving Gilbert Fleming. Although in July the Pope had given it as an extra prebend for Annibald de Ceccano, Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum, this had been cancelled by 20 December, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Walter instead.|$|E
5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Henry II was {{successful}} in quelling the Great Revolt, imprisoning William the Lion until a peace treaty was agreed, extending Henry's authority north into Scotland. In the subsequent years the security situation {{in the north of}} England improved significantly. King John gave control of Bowes Castle to Robert de Vieuxpont, an important administrator in the north, in 1203 and he retained control of the fortification until 1228. John stayed there himself in 1206 and in 1212, and the castle was also used briefly to hold John's niece Eleanor of Brittany, who had been placed under the custody of Vieuxpont. Henry III granted it briefly to William de Blockley and Gilbert de Kirketon, until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Duke Peter of Brittany in 1232, and then to William de Valence. In 1241 Peter II, the Count of Savoy was made the Earl of Richmond and was then given Bowes by the king.|$|E
5|$|In 1661 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Stefan Czarniecki as {{a reward}} for his service in the victory over the Swedes during the Deluge. Four years later, it was given as a dowry of his {{daughter}} Aleksandra, who married Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki, thus passing {{into the hands of the}} Branicki family. In 1692, Stefan Mikołaj Branicki, the son of Jan Klemens Branicki (Marshal of the Crown Court), obtained city rights for Białystok from King John III Sobieski. He constructed the Branicki Palace on the foundations of the castle of the Wiesiołowski family. In the second half of the eighteenth century the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. It was he who transformed the palace built by his father into a magnificent residence of a great noble.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{a treaty}} was {{negotiated}} between {{several of the}} British colonies and the Iroquois. The Iroquois sold their territorial claims to the colonies {{as part of the}} treaty. The company created to hold that claim was named the Indiana Land Company, the first recorded use of the word Indiana. The claim was disputed by the colony of Virginia, which did not participate in the treaty because it already laid claim to the land through its royal charter. In 1773, the territory of Indiana was brought under the administration of Province of Quebec to appease its French population. The Quebec Act was listed as one of the Intolerable Acts the Thirteen Colonies cited as a reason for the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The thirteen colonies thought themselves entitled to the territory for their support of Great Britain during the French and Indian War, and were incensed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the enemy the colonies had been fighting.|$|E

5|$|Kenyon's next rise {{came about}} {{as a result of}} his {{introduction}} to the Duke of Richmond, who was struggling with Sir James Lowther for the control of several Parliamentary constituencies. Kenyon went with Richmond to Carlisle and Cockermouth as his lawyer, and secured the constituencies for Richmond; as a result, Richmond chose to employ Kenyon as his lawyer from then onwards. In 1780 he successfully defended Lord George Gordon for high treason, assisted by Thomas Erskine, and the resulting fame was enough to propel him further up the ranks of his profession and within the political sphere. At the same time he became friends with Lord Thurlow, and when the holder of the Chief Justiceship of Chester died that year, Thurlow ensured that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Kenyon. The rise of Kenyon's work in the Court of Chancery was also attributed to his friendship with Thurlow, who as Lord Chancellor was the head of the Court.|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the right}} of the main altar and {{sanctuary}} is the side altar of St. Joseph. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the cathedral by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and the donation was facilitated by Joseph Mary Sala, an expatriate living in Hong Kong who was from the nobility of Italy. It is adorned by the royal coat of arms of the House of Savoy; this conspicuous symbol of Italy was said to have helped the cathedral identify itself as Italian rather than British, and thus, remain untouched throughout the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, as the Kingdom of Italy and Empire of Japan were both signatories to the Tripartite Pact.|$|E
5|$|Situated on the River Medway and Watling Street, Rochester {{served as}} a {{strategically}} important royal castle. During the late medieval period it helped protect England's south-east coast from invasion. The first castle at Rochester was founded {{in the aftermath of}} the Norman Conquest. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Bishop Odo, probably by his half-brother William the Conqueror. During the Rebellion of 1088 over the succession to the English throne, Odo supported Robert Curthose, the Conqueror's eldest son, against William Rufus. It was during this conflict that the castle first saw military action; the city and castle were besieged after Odo made Rochester a headquarters for the rebellion. After the garrison capitulated, this first castle was abandoned.|$|E
