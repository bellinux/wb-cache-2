5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, the Analytical Review lay dormant {{until it was}} briefly revived as The Analytical Review (New Series) {{during the first six}} months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have <b>initialled</b> signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.|$|E
5|$|The {{restored}} east range measures around 31m by 10m, with a {{pitched roof}} and crow-step gables. It is entered through a richly carved doorway, dated 1622 and <b>initialled</b> SWS for Sir William Sinclair, which gives {{access to the}} third floor. The three lower floors are cut into the rock, and each has four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower. These lower levels were used for service rooms, with the principal rooms in the two upper floors. At the lowest level was a kitchen, with a bakehouse above. On the exterior, gunloops are found on the south wall, with several shot-holes on the east.|$|E

25|$|In November 1914, the British had {{occupied}} Basra. According {{to the report}} of the de Bunsen Committee, British interests in Mesopotamia were defined by the need to protect the western flank of India and protect commercial interests including oil. The British also became concerned about the Berlin-Baghdad Railway. Although never ratified, the British had also <b>initialled</b> the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913.|$|E
25|$|With Hugh Bromley-Davenport, {{he shares}} {{the record for}} the longest 'supposed' surname among Test cricketers. However, Sivaramakrishan is not his surname at all. He started out as L. Sivaramakrishnan but, as is typical with {{expanding}} <b>initialled</b> south Indian names, turning the L to Laxmanan caused Sivaramakrishnan to appear to be his surname. Sivaramakrishnan is his given name and his father's given name was Laxmanan and hence he started out as L. Sivaramakrishnan as is common with Tamils to keep the first letter of one's father's first name as initial.|$|E
25|$|Seely, {{assisted}} by Viscount Morley, later added two paragraphs, {{stating that the}} Crown {{had the right to}} use force in Ireland or elsewhere, but had no intention of doing so “to crush political opposition to the policy or principles of the Home Rule Bill”. This was <b>initialled</b> by Seely, French and Ewart and then given to Gough. It is unclear whether this – amending a Cabinet document without Cabinet approval – was an honest blunder on Seely’s part or whether he was encouraged to do so and then made a scapegoat.|$|E

25|$|The issue {{came about}} through mischance. An {{anticipated}} delivery of stamps by ship did not arrive so the local postmaster, E.T.E. Dalton, authorised printers Joseph Baum and William Dallas, {{who were the}} publishers of the Official Gazette newspaper in Georgetown, to print an emergency issue of three stamps. Dalton gave some specifications about the design, but the printer chose to add a ship image of their own design to stamps. Dalton was not pleased with the end result, and as a safeguard against forgery ordered that all correspondence bearing the stamps be autographed by a post office clerk. This particular stamp was <b>initialled</b> E.D.W. by the clerk E.D. Wight.|$|E
25|$|Brogdens {{had other}} difficulties. They owned the Bwllfa Colliery in the Aberdare Valley (see above) {{and since the}} {{beginning}} of 1870 had supplied coal weekly to the Metropolitan Railway at favourable prices. A draft contract had been <b>initialled</b> by Alexander but never formally completed and Alexander decided to cease deliveries without notice. The Metropolitan held that the draft contract was valid and had been breached. A case was tried at the Surrey Spring Assizes (1873), The Court of Common Pleas and the House of Lords (1877), each of which held for the Metropolitan. This case is an important precedent in the law of contract.|$|E

He serves as the founder {{and chief operating officer}} of CEGID (Compagnie Européenne de Gestion par l'Informatique Décentralisée). After ridding the club of its debt, Aulas restructured the club's management and reorganised the finances and, in a span of two decades, transformed the club from a second division team into one of the richest football clubs in the world. However, Aulas has been lambasted by critics for running the club as if it were a business. The club currently operates on the European Stock Exchange under the name OL Groupe, <b>initialled</b> OLG.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} {{the categories of}} the zhao-series <b>initials</b> of Middle Chinese. Particularly, the present study tries to examine whether the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging {{to one or two}} groups of <b>initials,</b> using both dialectal and historical data. The first part of the thesis is an overview on what is being said about the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in previous studies. The second part of the thesis discusses the merge and the split of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> based on their historical development and in conjunction with ancient Chinese and Modern Chinese Phonology. The third part of the thesis uses the data of the distribution of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in present day Northern Mandarin to discuss the categories of these two groups of <b>initials</b> in Middle Chinese. Combining the observations made from both dialectal data and historical studies, the conclusion of the present study is that the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging to two different groups of <b>initials,</b> which will be the fourth part of the thesis...|$|R

25|$|In Congo-Brazzaville, abbé Fulbert Youlou led {{the country}} to {{independence}} which was <b>initialled</b> on 15 August 1960. Stéphane Tchitchellé {{was a member of}} the Congolese delegation on 28 July 1960, which signed the agreements, ensuring the transfer of powers from the French authorities to the Congolese authorities. He also became vice President of the Republic. This short-lived euphoria makes way for the takeover of Power by the revolutionary MNR (National Revolution Movement) during the days of 13, 14 and 15 August 1963, which establish the courts of exception and the witch hunt. Personalities like Stéphane Tchitchellé or Victor-Justin Sathoud,for instance were put in prison. The first President of the Supreme Court of the Congo Joseph Pouabou, the director of the Congolese Information agency Abbé Anselme Massouémé, both Vili and native of the Pointe-Noire region and the first Prosecutor of the Republic Lazare Matsocota, originally from the Pool, are abducted and murdered on the night of 14–15 February 1965. Above the horror, the body of Joseph Pouabou was never found. The perpetrators of these crimes have never been identified to date.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} print Hogarth {{introduces}} Tom Nero, whose surname {{may have been}} inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of [...] "No hero". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An <b>initialled</b> badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him.

500|$|Byrne was {{at first}} {{reluctant}} but later agreed, and delivered the merchandising contract to Jacobs's office on 4 December 1963, leaving blank the percentages. Jacobs asked Byrne what percentage rate he should write down to which Byrne ambiguously replied: [...] "Oh, look, just put in 10%." [...] A typical percentage would have been 75% or 80% for NEMS, and Byrne expected Epstein would begin to negotiate. However, the contract came back <b>initialled</b> (meaning Epstein had read it) and signed by Epstein and Jacobs. Jacobs's advice to Epstein was, [...] "10% is better than nothing". This lapse of shrewdness set the scene for what would later become a legal battleground which deprived the Beatles and Brian Epstein of such {{large sums of money}} they would have easily overshadowed any royalties they would receive in the medium term from the sale of records. Byrne later said: [...] "They couldn't wait to get somebody else to do this, because they were in a mess themselves." [...] Epstein would later realise that he had made a colossal error of judgment, as Byrne charged 10% commission to the merchandisers for a licence (receiving $10 out of every hundred) and then giving 10% of that to NEMS, which was $1.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected <b>initial</b> positions and velocities compared to random <b>initial</b> positions and velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for <b>initial</b> positions and the use of <b>initial</b> velocities that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{complete}} dynamic model includes the {{equations of motion}} {{as well as the}} <b>initial</b> conditions, many of the learning dynamics in the literature do not entail a serious theory of <b>initial</b> conditions.

We find that (1) the <b>initial</b> period’s fit is sensitive to the model of <b>initial</b> conditions chosen, with some <b>initial</b> condition models consistently superior to others over games. (2) Looking at periods 2 onward, leading dynamic models are robust to <b>initial</b> condition models according to one-period-ahead goodness-of-fit criteria.
