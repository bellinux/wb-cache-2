40|$|One of {{the best}} fruits of the Western Hemisphere, and yet one that is {{relatively}} unknown, is the mamey sapote, Calocarpum sapota (Jacq.) Merr. Widely distributed in Central America before Columbus, the encroachment of civilization has actually reduced the availability of this fruit. Those who know it well {{believe that there is}} no better fruit. Its creamy texture and rich flavor are unmatched. The mamey sapote is a large-spreading tree commonly propagated from seeds, but this method leads to trees of variable quality. Selected trees can be propagated by the tedious method of <b>inarching.</b> Other propagation techniques have not given satisfactory results. Trees are grown {{in a wide variety of}} soils, chiefly in regions of heavy rainfall (the humid Tropics). Trees can be established first in containers and then transplanted at the beginning of the rainy season. Regular fertilization, weeding, and supplemental irrigation are desirable. Cover crops are useful, especially during the period of establishment of the orchard. Pruning is done to shape the tree and remove dead wood. A few insect and disease problems occur, but these can be avoided or treated. Fruits are first borne in grafted trees at 3 years of age, and on seedlings at 7 years. When the fruit begins to redden, it is ready for harvest, which should be done carefully to avoid damage and maintain fruit quality. After harvest the fruit ripens in a few days.

Raf. ] {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as a rootstock in several citrus growing regions of the World, including Southern Brazil where `Rangpur` lime (Citrus limonia Osbeck) is still the predominant variety despite being affected by several important pathogens. in this case, `Swingle` citrumelo is used to produce nursery trees to establish new orchards or to be inarched in adult and healthy groves in order to change the rootstock. We report herein a system to produce trees on `Swingle` citrumelo more rapidly by budding onto non-rooted cuttings, as well as assessing potential to rapidly multiply `Swingle` through rooting of non-budded cuttings. Therefore, two potential products are described: budded trees and rooted rootstock cuttings. `Valencia` sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] was budded at different heights on cuttings derived from eight-month old rootstocks. Grafted and additional non-budded cuttings were then treated with indole- 3 -butyric acid (500 mg L(- 1)) or left untreated before rooting. Three types of cuttings were evaluated: softwood, semi-hardwood and hardwood. The use of nursery trees derived from pre-budded hardwood cuttings of `Swingle` citrumelo is an alternative grafting method on this cultivar. Softwood cuttings with one leaf pair were considered the most adequate material for rapid multiplication of `Swingle` citrumelo by cutting. This could be particularly useful for <b>inarching</b> production or conventional budding after transplant of cutting-derived rootstocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Grafting is a centuries-old {{technique}} used in plants to obtain economic benefits. Grafting increases nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency {{in a number}} of plant species, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals. Selected rootstocks of the same species or close relatives are utilized in grafting. Rootstocks absorb more water and ions than self-rooted plants and transport these water and ions to the aboveground scion. Ion uptake is regulated by a complex communication mechanism between the scion and rootstock. Sugars, hormones, and miRNAs function as long-distance signaling molecules and regulate ion uptake and ion homeostasis by affecting the activity of ion transporters. This review summarizes available information on the effect of rootstock on nutrient uptake and utilization and the mechanisms involved. Information on specific nutrient-efficient rootstocks for different crops of commercial importance is also provided. Several other important approaches, such as interstocking (during double grafting), <b>inarching,</b> use of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, use of plant growth substances (e. g., auxin and melatonin), and use of genetically engineered rootstocks and scions (transgrafting), are highlighted; these approaches can be combined with grafting to enhance nutrient uptake and utilization in commercially important plant species. Whether the rootstock and scion affect each other’s soil microbiota and their effect on the nutrient absorption of rootstocks remain largely unknown. Similarly, the physiological and molecular bases of grafting, crease formation, and incompatibility are not fully identified and require investigation. Grafting in horticultural crops can help reveal the basic biology of grafting, the reasons for incompatibility, sensing, and signaling of nutrients, ion uptake and transport, and the mechanism of heavy metal accumulation and restriction in rootstocks. Ion transporter and miRNA-regulated nutrient studies have focused on model and non-grafted plants, and information on grafted plants is limited. Such information will improve the development of nutrient-efficient rootstocks...|$|E

40|$|A subenxertia com porta-enxerto tolerante à morte súbita dos citros (MSC), como o citrumeleiro 'Swingle', é atualmente a única indicação para o controle da doença em pomares já instalados. Assim, o plantio de mudas subenxertadas para a formação de novos pomares pode ser uma estratégia interessante onde a doença ainda não se instalou, minimizando a obrigatoriedade de irrigação suplementar demandada com o uso do 'Swingle'. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o crescimento e o estado nutricional da laranjeira 'Valência' sobre porta-enxertos múltiplos e simples de 'Cravo' e 'Swingle', em fase de formação. Um pomar {{experimental}} foi instalado em espaçamento 7, 0 m x 4, 0 m, em Cordeirópolis (SP), em outubro de 2005 em delineamento experimental de blocos casualizados com quatro repetições. Avaliaram-se cinco tratamentos: (1) porta-enxertos simples de 'Cravo' e (2) de 'Swingle'; (3) porta-enxerto duplo com subenxertia no porta-enxerto principal ou (4) na copa, e (5) porta-enxerto quádruplo. Determinaram-se o diâmetro do caule dos porta-enxertos e da copa, número e comprimento dos ramos em diferentes quadrantes, diâmetro, altura e volume de copa aos 8 e 14 meses após o plantio. Ainda, foram avaliados os teores de nutrientes nas folhas nos quadrantes norte e sul da copa aos 14 meses. As plantas de 'Valência' sobre porta-enxertos duplos cresceram mais do que aquelas sobre porta-enxertos simples de 'Swingle', sendo essas diferenças mais marcantes no período de maior deficiência hídrica. O uso de mais de um porta-enxerto alterou também o estado nutricional da laranjeira 'Valência' que revelou teores foliares mais elevados de P, K, Cu e Zn, do que as sobre porta-enxertos simples de 'Cravo' e 'Swingle'. Control {{of citrus}} sudden death (CSD) {{has been only}} achieved by <b>inarching</b> affected trees in the field with tolerant rootstocks such as the 'Swingle' citrumelo. Therefore, the use of nursery trees inarched before planting appears as an interesting strategy for establishing new citrus groves where the CSD has not been yet detected, with the advantage of reducing irrigation needs of trees grafted on 'Swingle'. This research was carried out with the objective to evaluate growth and nutrition status of non-bearing 'Valencia' sweet oranges grafted on multiple and single rootstocks. An experimental grove was planted at 7, 0 m x 4, 0 m in Cordeirópolis, SP, in October 2005 under a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates. Five treatments were tested in order to compare the performance of trees on single rootstocks of (1) 'Rangpur' lime and (2) ''Swingle' Citrumelo, double rootstock with inarch of 'Rangpur' lime {{in the trunk of}} (3) 'Swingle' rootstock or of (4) the canopy and (5) quadruple rootstock (two double rootstocks). Trunk diameters of rootstocks and canopy were evaluated, as well as the number and length of twigs in different canopy quadrants, plant height, canopy diameter and volume at 8 and 14 months after planting in the field. Nutrient concentrations were also evaluated on leaf samples collected in the south and north parts of the canopy after 14 months. Double rootstock trees of Valencia sweet oranges presented more vigorous growth compared to others on single 'Swingle' citrumelo rootstocks, being such difference more evident definite during the high water deficit period of the study. The use of an additional rootstock changed the nutritional status of Valencia sweet orange trees, that presented higher concentration of P, K, Cu and Zn in the leaves than 'Swingle' or 'Rangpur' lime single rootstock plants...|$|E
40|$|Algumas regiões citrícolas, especialmente no continente europeu, ainda não foram, ao que parece, atingidas pela moléstia {{tristeza}} dos citros. Os conhecimentos adquiridos durante as investigações feitas sôbre a moléstia permitem indicar como identificá-la e prevenir suas desastrosas conseqüências nos laranjais. Os sintomas gerais nas plantas afetadas são semelhantes aos causados pela podridão do pé (gomose), podendo-se distinguí-la da tristeza examinando as raízes. Há combinações cavalo-enxêrto tolerantes e não tolerantes ao vírus. É, porisso, muito importante o reconhecimento da espécie cavalo, o que se pode fazer no pomar examinando a sua brotação ou observando o grau de congenialidade entre cavalo e enxerto. O teste colorimétrico feito com a casca da raiz também auxilia o reconhecimento. Os sintomas chamados "pitting" das limas ácidas e pomelos, permitem identificação da tristeza no pomar. O teste de Schneider, Wallace & Dimitan combinado com observações de campo, pode substituir, nas regiões onde a moléstia já foi constatada, os testes de transmissibilidade, mais rigorosos porém demorados, feitos no viveiro ou em estufas. A transmissão por enxertia ou por insetos vetores é feita da planta suspeita para plantas sadias de combinações não tolerantes ao vírus (laranjeira doce sobre azeda) ou para pés francos do limoeiro galego. É de interesse conhecer qual a estirpe do vírus predominante na região, para orientação dos citricultores quanto aos métodos de contrôle da moléstia. A identificação da espécie de afídios predominante na região permite prever a velocidade da disseminação da tristeza, porquanto umas são vetores muito eficientes, outras pouco. O contrôle da tristeza é obtido por métodos indiretos. Nas novas plantações evitam-se as combinações não tolerantes, empregando-se como variedade-cavalo as laranjeiras doces, as tangerineiras, os limoeiros Cravo (Rangpur) e Rugoso. Ãs vezes é possível o emprego de pés francos provenientes dos embriões nucelares. Nas plantações já existentes pode-se fazer a substituição total ou parcelada (individual) das plantas, conforme se constate predominância de afídios muito ou pouco eficientes e de estirpes fortes ou fracas do vírus. A sub-enxertia ("inarching"), a sôbre-enxertia ("topworking") e o afrancamento do enxerto são outras tantas modalidades de controle da tristeza, as quais podem ser vantajosamente empregadas em determinadas condições. Medidas de quarentena podem retardar a invasão das zonas ainda livres da tristeza, -sendo de interesse o esclarecimento do público quanto ao perigo representado pela importação de plantas ou suas partes vivas, exceto as sementes. The tristeza {{disease of}} citrus {{has not yet}} been reported from European countries nor from various other citrus growing areas of the world. Investigations on the disease have been carried out in various countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, and United States. Knowledge obtained from these investigations enables citrus experts from areas not invaded by tristeza to recognize its presence in the orchards and to prevent disastrous losses for the industry. General decline symptoms of tristeza resemble those caused by foot rot, but root examination permits the differentiation of the two diseases. Presence of pitting symptoms in trees of West Indian limes or of grapefruits permits easy diagnosis of tristeza in the orchards. Stock-scion combinations may be tolerant or intolerant to tristeza. Thus, it be comes important to determine the rootstock in case of plants showing decline symptoms. This fact can be established by direct examination of sprouts from the rootstock or by observing the degree of congeniality of rootstock and scion. The colorimetric tests made with bark of the rootstock may help to determine it. Field observation of symptoms complemented by Schneider's histological tests may replace the transmission tests for field surveys of the disease in areas where tristeza is already known to be present. Transmission tests are usually carried out by methods of tissue union or by means of the vectors. Young plants of non-tolerant combinations (such as sweet orange on sour orange rootstock) or seedlings of West Indian limes may be used as test plants in these tests. A knowledge of the predominance of the various strains of the tristeza virus complex in the invaded areas is very important in regard to the application of control measures. Also the determination of the aphid vector or vectors in the areas concerned will permit forecasting the rate of spread of tristeza because efficiency varies considerably according to the vector species. Control of tristeza in citrus orchards is obtained by indirect methods. In new plantings made in invaded areas, non-tolerant stock-scion combinations should be avoided. Only tolerant rootstocks such as sweet oranges, mandarins, rangpur lime, and rough lemons should be used for most commercial tops. In some instances {{it may be possible to}} use unbudded trees originated from nucellar embryos. In established orchards, where a non-tolerant rootstock was employed, individual affected trees may be replaced or the whole planting may be interplanted with trees of a tolerant stock-scion combination. The first method is used in areas where the disease is disseminated by a poor vector, whereas the second method is more advisable in areas where spread of the disease is very rapid. <b>Inarching</b> or rooting the scion (by mounding the soil around its base) are used to control tristeza under some conditions. Top working with lemon may also be used. Quarantine barriers may prevent the introduction of tristeza in uninvaded areas. It is highly desirable to inform travellers about the risk represented by the introduction of citrus budwood material or cuttings from areas where the disease is known to be present...|$|E

[...] There is no more reason to think that species have been specially [...] endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing [...] and breeding in Nature, than to think that trees have been [...] specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of [...] difficulty in being grafted together, in order to prevent them [...] becoming <b>inarched</b> in our forests.|$|R
40|$|The aniline was <b>inarched</b> on {{the surface}} of the carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) by a series of organic chemistry reactions. Then, the aniline {{on the surface}} of the CNTs was polymerized to polyaniline (PANI) by the in situ chemical polymerization. At last, a nanometer composite named as the CNTs/PANI composite was obtained. Constitution and morphology of the obtained CNTs/PANI composite were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscope and scanning electron microscope. And the electrochemical performances of the obtained materials were tested by the cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charging/discharging, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the obtained CNTs/PANI composite has excellent electrochemical capacitance used as the electrode material of the electrochemical super capacitor (about 152 F/g in organic electrolyte), which is much more than those of the pure PANI, pure CNTs and the PANI/CNTs composite made by normal in situ chemical polymerization (about 65, 25 and 80 F/g in organic electrolyte). And the materials have appeared excellent application foreground in electrochemical energy field...|$|R
60|$|They {{had started}} on the 10th of November. The Boers were then {{steadily}} advancing, and so great did the danger appear, that Durban had been strongly fortified by the blue jackets, aided by Kaffir labour. On the 25th Sir Redvers Buller had arrived, and by this time a considerable force was gathered at Estcourt. The British advance began from that town on the following day. The place had been entirely cut off, Boers occupying the whole country {{as far as the}} Mooi river. General Hildyard, who commanded at Estcourt, had been obliged to <b>inarch</b> out several times to keep them at a distance from the town, and one or two sharp artillery engagements had taken place, the Boers being commanded by General Joubert in person. They had always retired a short distance, but their movements were so rapid that it was useless to follow; and the troops had each time fallen back to Estcourt. On the 28th the Boers had blown up the bridge across the Tugela, and our army was moving forward, and a great battle was expected shortly. On landing Chris rode at once to the address given by his mother, and found that she had sailed for Cape Town a week before. Riding then to the railway, he found that the line was closed altogether to passenger traffic, but that a train with some troops and a strong detachment of sailors was going up that evening. Learning that a naval officer was in command, as the military consisted only of small parties of men who had been left behind, when their regiments left, to look after and forward their stores, he went to him. He had, before landing, donned his civilian suit.|$|R
