5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{had also}} become President of the Museums Association, {{and in a}} presidential address given in Belfast talked {{on the topic of}} {{preserving}} museum collections in war time, believing that Britain's involvement in a second European conflict was imminent. In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples; Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed.|$|E

25|$|In {{political}} terms he is a partisan {{of his native}} Northumbria, amplifying its role in English history over and above that of Mercia, its great southern rival. He takes greater pains in describing events of the seventh century, when Northumbria was the dominant Anglo-Saxon power, than the eighth, when it was not. The only criticism he ventures of his native Northumbria comes <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> the death of King Ecgfrith in fighting the Picts at Nechtansmere in 685.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> the {{property}} rights of peasant women during medieval times, for instance, Levett described {{the sale of}} land completed while a distraught wife sobbed in court—described in the Latin of medieval records as lacrimentem in pleno halimoto. The transfer was later voided by the court after the husband's death because of the wife's protests, but it was accepted by the court at the time. By focusing on such particular incidents in the old records, Levett limned the societal rights (or lack of them) of medieval women, who were seen as subordinate tenants.|$|E

25|$|Interactionism {{had become}} popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a {{politically}} radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing {{society as a}} system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions. The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused {{on the process of}} law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> law and crime.|$|E
25|$|The play {{is set in}} 1950s America, in an Italian American {{neighborhood}} {{near the}} Brooklyn Bridge in New York. It employs a chorus and narrator {{in the character of}} Alfieri. Eddie, the tragic protagonist, has an improper love of, and almost obsession with, Catherine, his wife Beatrice's orphaned niece, so he does not approve of her courtship of Beatrice's cousin Rodolfo. Miller's interest <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> the world of the New York docks originated with an unproduced screenplay that he developed with Elia Kazan in the early 1950s (entitled The Hook) that addressed corruption on the Brooklyn docks. Kazan later directed On the Waterfront, which dealt with the same subject. Miller said that he heard the basic account that developed into the plot of A View from the Bridge from a lawyer who worked with longshoremen, who related it to him as a true story.|$|E
25|$|Transpersonal art {{is one of}} the {{disciplines}} considered by Boucovolas, in listing how transpersonal psychology may relate to other areas of transpersonal study. <b>In</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> transpersonal art, Boucovolas begins by noting how, according to Breccia and also to the definitions employed by the International Transpersonal Association in 1971, transpersonal art may be understood as art work which draws upon important themes beyond the individual self, such as the transpersonal consciousness. This makes transpersonal art criticism germane to mystical approaches to creativity. Transpersonal art criticism, as Boucovolas notes, can be considered that which claims conventional art criticism has been too committed to stressing rational dimensions of art and has subsequently said little on art's spiritual dimensions, or as that which holds art work has a meaning beyond the individual person. Certain aspects of the psychology of Carl Jung, as well as movements such as music therapy and art therapy, may also relate to the field. Boucovolas' paper cites Breccia (1971) as an early example of transpersonal art, and claims that at the time his article appeared, integral theorist Ken Wilber had made recent contributions to the field. More recently, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, in 2005, Volume 37, launched a special edition devoted to the media, which contained articles on film criticism that can be related to this field.|$|E

500|$|On the contrary, one of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of his philosophical outlook was an unwavering insistence on a series of points that may seem obvious but which are nevertheless all-too-frequently neglected: that moral or ethical thought is part of human life; that <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> it, philosophers are writing about something of genuine importance; that {{it is not easy to}} say anything worth saying about the subject; that what moral philosophers write is answerable to the realities of human history, psychology, and social affairs; and that mere cleverness is indeed not the relevant measure of value." ...|$|E
