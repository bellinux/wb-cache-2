25|$|Feeding {{intensity}} varies {{throughout the}} year, and is strongly correlated {{to changes in}} the precipitation and wind during cyclical shifts in the climate. Young fish tend to feed intensively throughout the year, but show a peak in the spring and autumn months, while adults intensify their feeding during the dry and rainy seasons, with feeding declining during intermediate periods (winter and early summer). Daily intakes during the period of <b>intensive</b> <b>feeding</b> reach 3–7% of the fishes body weight, and during the periods of decline to 0.5–2%, with the annual intake being 1000–1500% of the body weight. In a 1993 paper, Troy Baird reported a foraging association between bar jacks and puddingwife wrasse, Halichoeres radiatus, in which a jack followed a single wrasse while it foraged for food. These associations were initiated by both jacks and wrasse, with apparently little pilfering of uncovered items, suggesting a beneficial relationship to both parties. While foraging with the wrasse, the jack increases its prey detection levels, which is useful for a species which is more adept at pelagic hunting, allowing it to be more efficient at this less common mode of food gathering.|$|E

40|$|Low {{survival}} rate, {{slow growth}} and developmental abnormalities during the larval stage are challenges related to aquaculture of marine species. Several {{studies have shown}} that feeding the larvae their natural feed source, zooplankton, improves these factors significantly compared to <b>feeding</b> them <b>intensive</b> <b>feeds</b> like rotifers. The nutritional quality of the feed is likely to play a crucial role. Components suggested to have an impact are, for instance, the typical marine fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosehexaenoic acid (DHA). A high content of free amino acids (FAA) and peptides are also believed to be of importance due to limited differentiation of the digestive system in the larvae. In addition, the content of some minerals is believed to be crucial. The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine whether there were differences in biochemical composition between zooplankton and two <b>intensive</b> <b>feeds</b> (A and B) that could, at least in part, explain the increased growth when feeding on zooplankton at Lofilab AS (Steine, Norway). Natural rotifers are deficient or low in several nutritional components required for fish and thus they are normally enriched prior to feeding. A secondary aim was to compare the biochemical composition of the rotifers prior to and after enrichment. Three commercial enrichment media were also analysed and two underutilised marine sources of nutrients (krill and calanus) were included. The results showed large differences in biochemical composition between zooplankton and the <b>intensive</b> <b>feeds,</b> in particular in components of typical marine origin. The sum of the most typical marine fatty acids, EPA+ DHA, in zooplankton was 38. 5 % of the total lipid fraction, corresponding to 3. 1 % of the diet. In the <b>intensive</b> <b>feeds</b> the EPA+DHA were 21. 7 % (A) and 20. 5 % (B) respectively, corresponding to 2. 6 % and 2. 4 % of the diets. The relative amount of FAA in zooplankton was 15. 7 %, while the equivalent amounts in the <b>intensive</b> <b>feeds</b> were 10. 4 % and 12. 1 % in feed A and B respectively. Zooplankton was rich in taurine, 8. 4 mg/g dry weight (DW), while the two <b>intensive</b> <b>feeds</b> were almost devoid of it, reflecting the composition of the enrichment media. Except for phosphorus, zooplankton was richer in all of the minerals analysed. The main effect of the enrichment of rotifers was an increase of the amount of EPA and DHA in two out of three enrichment protocols. The existing enrichment protocols were ineffective if the target was to increase the content of the other nutritional components. The biochemical compositions of krill and calanus were more similar to zooplankton, as the content of taurine and EPA+DHA was higher than in the commercial enrichment media, thus supporting the idea of utilising these marine resources as new and improved enrichment media...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{multi-phase}} {{feeding of}} broiler chickens was evaluated to optimize broiler nutrition and minimize environmental impact related to excess nitrogen in poultry manure. Four experiments were conducted. Experiments 1 and 2 studied effects of continuous multi-phase feeding during a 3 -week starting period using battery brooders while experiments 3 and 4 evaluated multi-phase feeding during a traditional 7 -week growing period using both battery brooders and floor pens. In {{the first and}} second experiments, the nutrient content of the multi-phase diets was changed every 24 hours in comparison to single-phase feeding. Results indicated that during the starter period, continuous multi-phase feeding had no significant influence on feed consumption, daily gain, feed to gain ratio or fecal nitrogen. In the third and fourth experiments, a four phase industry type broiler feeding program was compared to <b>intensive</b> multi-phase <b>feeding</b> programs created by linearly blending three different diets based on typical industry nutrient values and a commercial nutrient modeling computer program (EFG Natal?). In both <b>intensive</b> multi-phase <b>feeding</b> programs, the diets were changed every three days over a 7 -week growth period. Broilers in experiment 3 were raised in Petersime battery brooders to primarily access nitrogen balance while birds in experiment 4 were raised in a floor pen on pine shaving litter to resemble commercial broiler production. The results indicated that <b>intensive</b> multi-phase <b>feeding</b> improved body weight gain and feed to gain ratio only in weeks 5 and 6 but not during the overall 7 -week period. Nitrogen excretion and nitrogen retention were unaffected by the <b>intensive</b> multi-phase <b>feeding</b> systems. Economic analysis indicated that <b>intensive</b> multi-phase <b>feeding</b> programs could potentially lower feed costs per kilogram of gain. However, the high cost of implementing a continuous multi-phase feeding system may not justify the relatively small gain in lower feed cost per kilogram of gain. In conclusion, continuous multi-phase feeding of broiler chickens using corn-soy diets {{does not appear to be}} justified by either increased performance or reduced nitrogen excretion...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{for this study}} were first to understand and estimate energy consumption in each stage of production and processing of milk using regional data and second, suggesting improvement opportunities. A cradle to gate assessment of market milk was performed by separating the system into three stages: agronomy, animal farm and processing plant. Data were collected from multiple sources e. g. questionnaire, published papers, national and international databases, and the processing plant database. Throughout the study, ISO framework and International Dairy Federation guideline on life cycle assessment were used. The functional unit (FU) was one liter of pasteurized milk packaged in plastic pouch at the processing plant gate. The average energy demand for producing 1 kg of fat-protein corrected milk at farm-gate was 10. 8 MJ, although for the final packaged milk, it was 12. 5 MJ. Main stages in overall energy use of FU were agronomy 68 %, animal farm 19 % and processing plant 13 %. The average energy use for raw milk production was 2 - 5 times higher than previous European reports.

50|$|Because yellow-bellied sapsuckers feed {{on up to}} 250 {{species of}} living trees and woody plants, they are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be a}} pest.

Sapsucker feeding can kill a tree by girdling, which occurs when a ring of bark around the trunk is severely injured. Certain tree species are particularly susceptible to dying after being damaged by yellow-bellied sapsuckers. For example, a USDA forest study that examined trees injured by yellow-bellied sapsuckers noted a mortality of 67% for gray birch (Betula populifolia), 51% for paper birch (Betula papyrifera), and 40% for red maple (Acer rubrum). In other tree species, injuries inflicted by yellow-bellied sapsuckers can result in significantly less mortality.

40|$|To the {{distinguished}} {{members of the}} Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee; Poor nutrition is {{a risk factor for}} four of the six leading causes of death in the US: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. The obesity crisis is receiving public attention but cannot be successfully addressed without addressing the food system that underlies the epidemic. Our current food system provides easy access to highly refined, energy dense and nutrient deficient foods. It is based heavily on animal products rather than on the high fiber, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables recommended for the prevention of disease. An industrialized food system dominates and makes available inexpensive, high fat, sugary food. The current health crisis is providing the opportunity to re-examine our current approach to food and nutrition from an ecological perspective in order to ensure the survival of a nutritious food system as well as to improve the health of our population. Suggestions for Key Recommendations � Support your local food system: increase purchases of produce, dairy and other foods direct from farmers, regional farmers markets, and year-round CSAs, as well as those products produced by season extension methods such as greenhouses and hoop houses. Purchase beef with the USDA “grass fed ” label in place of other beef, to ensure consumption beef without produced without antibiotics and energy <b>intensive</b> <b>feed</b> grains.

Different agricultural practices such as vast fields of monocultures, forests of exotic timber, and large <b>intensive</b> <b>feed</b> lots of livestock, will be evident. The need to provide food for an increasing population particularly in Africa {{is the driving force}} behind the intensification of agriculture. The production of increased food supply is often considered without knowledge of the impacts on the environment. The North East District of Botswana is a small district compared to other districts of Botswana but unlike these large districts the population density is comparably high with a demand for agricultural space. Botswana is a desert margins area under threat of desertification with many signs of desertification being evident throughout the country. The main agricultural activity in the North East District is livestock farming with horticulture being practiced on the banks of sandy river beds. The district provided an ideal area to compare the impacts of different livestock farming techniques. Four different approaches of livestock farming were examined with the number of livestock cattle in particular, being a noticeable difference and the grazing intensity of these cattle being another important difference. This study examined the impacts of these different grazing techniques on the environment with a particular reference to birds. Data was collected using a point count system with 28 points evenly spaced in a grid across the different land uses. Each point was subject to a total of six surveys with summer and winter having three surveys each. It was expected that bird numbers and species would be impacted by the grazing intensity while the different feeding and nesting guilds may also respond to grazing intensity. Statistical analysis included geostatistical analysis, uni-variant, mult-variant and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling. The results show that birds were impacted by grazing intensity with species richness and bird numbers being negatively affected. However, feeding and nesting guilds were impacted differently.
