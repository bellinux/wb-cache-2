5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.|$|E

Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them.

40|$|Use of diplotypes – matched {{haplotype}} pairs from {{homologous chromosomes}} – in gene-disease association studies •Research corner• Summary: Alleles, genotypes and haplotypes (combinations of alleles) {{have been widely}} used in gene-disease association studies. More recently, association studies using diplotypes (haplotype pairs on homologous chromosomes) have become increasingly common. This article reviews the rationale of the four types of association analyses and discusses the situations in which diplotype-based analyses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the other types of association analyses. Haplotype-based association analyses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than allele-based association analyses, and diplotype-based association analyses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than genotype-based analyses. In circumstances where there are no interaction effects between markers and where the criteria for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) are met, the larger sample size and smaller degrees of freedom of allele-based and haplotype-based association analyses make them <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than genotype-based and diplotype-based association analyses, respectively. However, under certain circumstances diplotype-based analyses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than haplotype-based analysis...|$|R

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is mostly}} unchanged {{from the previous}} games; the player controls the main character from an overhead perspective, and the controls are largely {{the same as those}} of previous games. As with previous games, the main objectives are to catch all of the Pokémon in the games and defeat the Elite Four (a group of Pokémon trainers); also like their predecessors, the games' main subplot involves the main character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles and Pokémon abilities along with 135 new Pokémon, have been added. As the Game Boy Advance <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than its predecessors, four players may be connected at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can be connected to an e-Reader or other advanced generation Pokémon games.|$|E

He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan and become the world's most {{powerful}} sorcerer, exposing Aladdin's identity and exiling him, Abu and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. However, they escape {{and return to the}} palace. There, Jafar wishes Genie for his final wish to make Jasmine fall in love with him, but the Genie refuses to grant the wish. Upon noticing Aladdin, Jasmine pretends to be interested to distract Jafar and Aladdin tries to retrieve the lamp, but Jafar stops Aladdin and traps Jasmine inside an hourglass. Jafar transforms into a giant cobra and tells Aladdin that he is the most powerful being in the world. However, Aladdin replies that the Genie <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than him.

25|$|The act {{of killing}} oneself is not {{applicable}} to an omnipotent being, since, despite {{that such an}} act does involve some power, it also involves a lack of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) is {{a method}} {{that in some ways}} <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than GC, but can be coupled to mass spectrometry just as easily. In LC, the concerns involving sample preparation can be minimal. In LC, both the stationary and mobile phase can affect the separation, whereas in GC only the stationary phase should be influential. This allows for the sample preparation to be minimal if one is willing to adjust the stationary phase or mobile phase before running the sample. The primary concern is the concentration of analyte. If the concentration is too high then separation can be unsuccessful, but mass spectrometry as a detection method does not need complete separation, showing another benefit of coupling LC to a mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride {{is widely}} used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the related reagent sodium borohydride owing to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. Often as a solution in diethyl ether and followed by an acid workup, it will convert esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, aldehydes, and ketones into the corresponding alcohols (see: carbonyl reduction). Similarly, it converts amide, nitro, nitrile, imine, oxime, and azide compounds into the amines (see: amide reduction). It reduces quaternary ammonium cations into the corresponding tertiary amines. Reactivity can be tuned by replacing hydride groups by alkoxy groups. Due to its pyrophoric nature, instability, toxicity, low shelf life and handling problems associated with its reactivity, it has been replaced in the last decade, both at the small-industrial scale and for large-scale reductions by the more convenient related reagent sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, which exhibits similar reactivity but with higher safety, easier handling and better economics.|$|E

There, she becomes {{intrigued}} by a student, Edward Cullen. When Edward saves her life, he exhibits super-human qualities. Bella learns from her family friend Jacob Black that Quileute legends say the Cullen family are vampires. Edward eventually admits to this truth, though his family hunts only animals, not humans, through moral choice. Edward constantly warns Bella against being with him, perceiving her life to be at constant risk if she continues to associate with him because the scent of her blood <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> to him than that of any other human he has ever encountered. Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint is such that his warnings go unheeded, and on an outing with the Cullens she becomes the target of a sadistic vampire, James. With his family's help, Edward is able to save Bella from James' predations, but Edward is still unwilling to change Bella into a vampire himself.|$|E
