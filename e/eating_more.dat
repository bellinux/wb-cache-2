5|$|Males {{tend to take}} tits, finches, sparrows and buntings; females {{often take}} thrushes and starlings. Larger quarry (such as doves and magpies) may not die {{immediately}} but succumb during feather plucking and <b>eating.</b> <b>More</b> than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks in the nest and carrion are sometimes eaten. Small mammals, including bats, are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only very rarely.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> fruit.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that higher CO2 levels lead to reduced plant uptake of {{nitrogen}} (and a smaller number showing the same for trace elements such as zinc) resulting in crops with lower nutritional value.

25|$|Water is {{required}} by most tinamou species, with some needing a good source within their home territory. Solitary tinamous can withstand an extended period without water by <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> succulent plants. However, species that live in arid or semi-arid climates rarely need any water additional to that ingested with their diet. When tinamous drink, unlike most other birds, they do so by sucking and swallowing, instead of lifting their heads and letting gravity do the work.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the city's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) {{issued an}} {{advisory}} warning against <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> than one reservoir-caught smallmouth bass per month after mercury levels of 1.3 part per million (ppm), slightly above the federal standard of 1.0 ppm, were confirmed in three {{caught in the}} reservoir.

25|$|Including fish as {{a regular}} part of a {{balanced}} diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis – a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility. Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff and sore in the morning if they keep their fish oil intake topped up. Recent research has also found a link between omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> fish could help prevent the disease.|$|E
25|$|Among adults, {{the known}} causes are natural and {{artificial}} ionizing radiation, a few viruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus, and some chemicals, notably benzene and alkylating chemotherapy agents for previous malignancies. Use of tobacco {{is associated with}} a small increase in the risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia in adults. Cohort and case-control studies have linked exposure to some petrochemicals and hair dyes to the development of some forms of leukemia. Diet has very limited or no effect, although <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> vegetables may confer a small protective benefit.|$|E
25|$|Boyd's lack {{of first}} team {{appearances}} prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During {{his time at}} Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine pounds overweight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed {{that he had been}} <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around £5,000.|$|E

50|$|On Lewis's account, {{the truth}} of this {{statement}} consists in the fact that, among possible worlds where I <b>ate</b> <b>more</b> for breakfast, {{there is at least one}} world where I am not hungry at 11am and which is closer to our world than any world where I <b>ate</b> <b>more</b> for breakfast but am still hungry at 11am.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, {{the guts}} of female crabs {{contained}} more brown non-branched algae and unknown substances than male crabs, {{although there was no}} apparent difference in the amount or variation of food consumed. Types of foods consumed also varied {{by the size of the}} crab. Smaller male crabs <b>ate</b> <b>more</b> gastropods, isopods, and amphipods, while larger males <b>ate</b> <b>more</b> algae and decapods. Similarly, smaller female crabs <b>ate</b> <b>more</b> isopods and larger females <b>ate</b> <b>more</b> algae. These differences are likely due to the impact of size on the crab’s ability to process foods. Both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals were consumed, as well as a wide range of algae. Seaweed crabs use their claws to tear apart their food, and predation techniques vary based on the mobility of the prey. Larger mature crabs have a greater ability to process foods because they have more powerful claws and larger mouths.|$|R
25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through {{behavioral}} change, as mentioned above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people {{to make changes in}} their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} trainers {{also had}} to ensure that {{not only do the}} actors look like soldiers before filming, but they had to remain that way throughout the shoot. In addition, Stapleton and Winchester had to lose and gain weight, respectively. Winchester had to be on a diet of 4,000 calories a day, which included taking protein shakes between meals. The actor described the diet as [...] "a workout in itself," [...] having found it [...] "exhausting" [...] <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> food than he was used to.

500|$|The story {{focuses on}} a family of {{anthropomorphic}} rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit cautions her young against entering the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, telling them: [...] "your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor". Her three daughters obediently refrain from entering the garden, going down the lane to pick blackberries, but her rebellious son Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> than is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's scarecrow. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, while his well-behaved sisters receive a sumptuous dinner of milk and berries as opposed to Peter's supper of chamomile tea.|$|E

2500|$|... 10–12% of {{the human}} brain is {{composed}} of lipids, including the omega-3 fat DHA. Recent studies suggest that older people can boost their brain power by <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> oily fish, what with regular consumers being able to remember better and think faster than those who don't consume at all. Other research has also suggested that adding more DHA to the diet of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder can reduce their behavioural problems and improve their reading skills, while there have also been links suggested between DHA and better concentration. Separate studies have suggested that older people who eat fish {{at least once a week}} could also have a lower chance of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
2500|$|In insulin-dependent persons, {{blood glucose}} levels have been roughly {{controlled}} using insulin alone. [...] The number of grams of carbohydrate is estimated by measuring foods, and the measurement {{is used to}} determine the amount of insulin necessary to cover the meal. [...] The calculation is based on a simple open-loop model: an insulin to carbohydrate ratio (adjusted based on past success) is multiplied by the grams of carbohydrate to calculate the units of insulin needed. [...] That quantity of insulin is then adjusted based on a pre-meal blood glucose measurement (insulin bolus increased for a high blood sugar or insulin bolus delayed and reduced for a low blood sugar). [...] Insulin is injected or infused under the skin, and enters the bloodstream in approximately 15 minutes. [...] After the insulin has acted in the bloodstream, the blood glucose level can be tested again and then adjusted with injection of more insulin, or <b>eating</b> <b>more</b> carbohydrates, until balance is restored. Assuming the design requirement is to truly mimic normal pancreatic delivery of insulin to the liver in order to achieve proper hepatic stimulation, and to cause normal insulin induced functions, until another system is available to deliver portal vein concentrations of insulin, an intravenous infusion device will be needed.|$|E

Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} <b>eating</b> <b>more.</b> You're too thin.' But when {{you look in the}} mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny.
