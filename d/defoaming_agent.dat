Hemoglobin values were always higher {{in the line of}} the aspirator and defoaming chamber than in any other part of the system. Sampling immediately proximal and distal to the defoaming chamber revealed significant increases in plasma hemoglobin values {{as a result of the}} defoaming process. Studies of the hematological effects of the <b>defoaming</b> <b>agent,</b> polymethylsiloxane, which coats the disposable stainless steel sponge in the defoaming chamber, showed it greatly reduced the resistance of red cells to lysis by mechanical trauma. Similar studies of plasma showed the hemolytic effects of the <b>defoaming</b> <b>agent</b> are to some extent mediated by the plasma. It is concluded that the widely used <b>defoaming</b> <b>agent,</b> polymethylsiloxane, contributes to the hemolytic action of the bubbling, suctioning, and defoaming processes during open heart surgery.

ScCO 2 extraction and fractionation was carried out prior to hydrolysis and fermentation of maize stover. Fractionation of the crude extracts by scCO 2 resulted in wax extracts having different compositions and melting temperatures, enabling their utilisation in different applications.

40|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{mixtures}} of solid, saturated hydrocarbons mainly branched and {{characterized by a}} carbon number over C 60. They are used as food additives for the surface treatment of confectionery and some fruit varieties, in chewing gum base, protective coatings, <b>defoaming</b> <b>agents,</b> and surface finishing agents. Commission Regulation No 231 / 2012 established physical and chemical specifications for microcrystalline waxes to use in food, and posed a limit of 50 μg/kg for benzo(a) pyrene. Due to the low solubility of microcrystalline waxes in organic solvents and matrix interferences, analytical determination of benzo(a) pyrene represents a difficult task. The official method for indirect determination of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons uses unspecific spectrophotometric detection and a quite laborious, time- and solvent-consuming extraction method.

40|$|A new {{improved}} {{investment casting}} technology (IC) {{has been presented}} and compared with the existing IC technology such as lost foam casting (LFC). The effect of thermophysical property and coating thickness on casting solidification temperature field, microstructure and hardness has been investigated. The {{results show that the}} solidification rate decreases inversely with the coating thickness when the coating contains silica sol, zircon powder, mullite powder and <b>defoaming</b> <b>agent.</b> In contrast, the solid cooling rate increases as the coating thickness increases. However, the solidification rate and solid cooling rate of the casting produced by the existing IC and the improved IC are very similar when the coating thickness is 5 mm, so the microstructure and hardness of a container corner fitting produced by the improved IC and the existing IC are similar. The linear regression equation for the grain size (d) and cooling rate (v) of the castings is d= – 0. 41 v+ 206. 1. The linear regression equation for the content of pearlite (w) and solid cooling rate (t) is w= 1. 79 t + 6. 71. The new improved IC can greatly simplify the process and decrease the cost of production compared with the existing IC. Contrasting with LFC, container corner fittings produced by the new improved IC have fewer defects and better properties.

40|$|Signifi cant {{deterioration}} of concrete structures {{can be attributed}} to corrosion of reinforcement. Large portions of Highway Department budgets are directly or indirectly spent on the evaluation, repair, or replacement of concrete elements. This is especially true in marine environments or regions where de-icing salts are used on roadways. Several methods are currently employed to reduce corrosion activity and/or increase the time to corrosion. Methods tend to focus on either reducing the transport mechanisms through the concrete (usually through decreased concrete permeability or membrane application), or directly interfering with the corrosion process (corrosion inhibitors). Specifi cally, concrete cover can be increased, lower water to cementitious material ratios (w/c) can be used (including the use of pozzolonic materials), overlays can be used, reinforcement can be coated or made of materials less susceptible to corrosion (stainless steel, microcomposite steel, or fi ber reinforced polymers), corrosion inhibiting admixtures can be included, or structures can include cathodic protection systems. Typically a combination of several of these methods is employed in severe corrosive environments. And yet corrosion problems are still common (Figure 1). Engineers now have a new tool for reducing corrosion in structures, with some unique advantages over other methods. DSS (Hycrete) A new concrete admixture (DSS, sold as Hycrete) has recently been developed. It is an extremely promising new tool in preventing corrosion in concrete structures. Testing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass) and the University of Connecticut (UConn) have found signifi cant improvement in concretes including DSS over those with other single admixtures. DSS comes as a liquid admixture and has an optimum dosage of percent DSS by weight of cement. DSS provides stable air entrainment, though it can also include a <b>defoaming</b> <b>agent</b> to negate this effect. The latter may be advantageous to allow for standard methods of air entrainment, providing fewer changes to standard mix designs...|$|E

40|$|Background, aim, and scope: The {{chemical}} substance 2, 4, 7, 9 -tetramethyl- 5 -decyne- 4, 7 -diol (TMDD) is a non-ionic surfactant {{used as an}} industrial <b>defoaming</b> <b>agent</b> and in various other applications.

TMDD and its ethoxylates offer several advantages in waterborne industrial applications in coatings, inks, adhesives {{as well as in}} paper industries. TMDD and its ethoxylates can be expected to reach the aquatic environment due its widespread use and its physico-chemical properties. TMDD has previously been detected in several rivers of Germany with concentrations up to 2. 5 [*]µg/L. In the United States, TMDD was also detected in drinking water. However, detailed studies about its presence and distribution in the aquatic environment have not been carried out so far. The aim {{of the present study was}} the analysis of the spatial and temporal concentration variations of TMDD in the river Rhine at the Rheingütestation Worms (443. 3 km). Moreover, the transported load in the Rhine was investigated during two entire days and 7 weeks between November 2007 and January 2008. Materials and methods: The sampling was carried out at three different sampling points across the river. Sampling point MWL 1 is located in the left part of the river, MWL 2 in the middle part, and MWL 4 in the right part. One more sampling site (MWL 3) was run by the monitoring station until the end of 2006, but was put out of service due to financial constrains. The water at the left side of the river Rhine (MWL 1) is influenced by sewage from a big chemical plant in Ludwigshafen and by the sewage water from this city. The water at the right side of the river Rhine (MWL 4) is largely composed of the water inflow from river Neckar, discharging into Rhine 14. 9 km upstream from the sampling point and of communal and industrial wastewater from the city Mannheim. The water from the middle of the river (MWL 2) is largely composed of water from the upper Rhine. Water samples were collected in 1 -L bottles by an automatic sampler. The water samples were concentrated by use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) using Bond Elut PPL cartridges and quantified by use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The quantification was carried out with the internal standard method. Based on these results, concentration variations were determined for the day profiles and week profiles. The total number of analyzed samples was 219. Results: The results of this study provide information on the temporal concentration variability of TMDD in river Rhine in a cross section at one particular sampling point (443. 3 km). TMDD was detected in all analyzed water samples at high concentrations. The mean concentrations during the 2 days were 314 ng/L in MWL 1, 246 ng/L in MWL 2, and 286 ng/L in MWL 4. The variation of concentrations was low in the day profiles. In the week profiles, a trend of increasing TMDD concentrations was detected particularly in January 2008, when TMDD concentrations reached values up to 1, 330 ng/L in MWL 1. The mean TMDD concentrations during the week profiles were 540 ng/L in MWL 1, 484 ng/L in MWL 2, and 576 ng/L in MWL 4. The loads of TMDD were also determined and revealed to be comparable in all three sections of the river. The chemical plant located at the left side of the Rhine is not contributing additional TMDD to the river. The load of TMDD has been determined to be 62. 8 kg/d on average during the entire period. By extrapolation of data obtained from seven week profiles the annual load was calculated to 23 t/a. Discussion: The permanent high TMDD concentrations during the investigation period indicate an almost constant discharge of TMDD into the river. This observation argues for effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants as the most likely source of TMDD in the river. Another possible source might be the degradation of ethoxylates of TMDD (Surfynol® series 400), in the WWTPs under formation of TMDD followed by discharge into the river. TMDD has to be considered as a high-production-volume (HPV) chemical based on the high concentrations found in this study. In the United States, TMDD is already in the list of HPV chemicals from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, the amount of TMDD production in Europe is unknown so far and also the biodegradation rates of TMDD in WWTPs have not been investigated. Conclusions: TMDD was found in high concentrations during the entire sampling period in the Rhine river at the three sampling points. During the sampling period, TMDD concentrations remained constant in each part of the river. These results show that TMDD is uniformly distributed in the water collected at three sampling points located across the river. ‘Waves’ of exceptionally high concentrations of TMDD could not be detected during the sampling period. These results indicate that the effluents of WWTPs have to be considered as the most important sources of TMDD in river Rhine. Recommendations and perspectives: Based also on the occurrence of TMDD in different surface waters of Germany with concentrations up to 2, 500 ng/L and its presence in drinking water in the USA, more detailed investigations regarding its sources and distribution in the aquatic environment are required. Moreover, the knowledge with respect to its ecotoxicity and its biodegradation pathway is scarce and has to be gained in more detail. Further research is necessary to investigate the rate of elimination of TMDD in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants in order to clarify the degradation rate of TMDD and to determine to which extent effluents of WWTPs contribute to the input of TMDD into surface waters. Supplementary studies are needed to clarify whether the ethoxylates of TMDD (known as Surfynol 400 ® series) are hydrolyzed in the aquatic environment resulting in formation of TMDD similar to the well known cleavage of nonylphenol ethoxylates into nonylphenols. The stability of TMDD under anaerobic conditions in groundwater is also unknown and should be studied...|$|E
