His breads and pastries are unconsciously inspired by Newt's creatures and Queenie visits him in his shop.|$|E
5|$|Chef François Massialot wrote Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois in 1691, {{during the}} reign of Louis XIV. The book {{contains}} menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. <b>His</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a marinade is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} part of <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{about the nature of}} genius.

25|$|<b>His</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> highly {{regarded}} among Sunni Muslims, {{and considered the}} most authentic collection of hadith, even ahead of the Muwatta Imam Malik and Sahih Muslim of Bukhari's student Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. Most Sunni scholars consider it {{second only to the}} Quran in terms of authenticity. He also composed other books, including al-Adab al-Mufrad, which is a collection of hadiths on ethics and manners, as well as two books containing biographies of hadith narrators (see isnad).|$|E
25|$|Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler is {{similarly}} introspective.

On the surface, {{it appears to be}} in the tradition of other guide books (several of which appeared in the Restoration, including Charles Cotton's The Compleat Gamester, {{which is one of the}} earliest attempts at settling the rules of card games), but, like Pilgrim's Progress, its main business is guiding the individual.|$|E

25|$|Diogenes Laertius, {{who lived}} in the third century AD, wrote Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, a voluminous {{collection}} of biographies of nearly every Greek philosopher who ever lived. Unfortunately, Diogenes Laertius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable. Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers. <b>His</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved. His biography of Epicurus, for instance, is of particularly high quality and contains three lengthy letters attributed to Epicurus himself, at least two of which are generally agreed to be authentic.|$|E
25|$|Swift's {{explanation}} {{for the title of}} the book is that the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes) and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). <b>His</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> intended to be a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). Hobbes was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift's invocation of Hobbes might well be ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift's narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the Leviathan, or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes's critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.|$|E
25|$|The Colditz Story (Hodder & Stoughton, 1952) was Reid's {{memoir of}} his time in Colditz, which later became the basis for the 1955 film The Colditz Story, {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton, with John Mills playing Reid. Although focusing mainly upon life inside Colditz and the development of an 'escape academy', the final chapters of the book are devoted to Reid's own escape. The book chronicles everyday prison life, in which characters such as Douglas Bader and Airey Neave appear with no special mention, reporting events in an anecdotal and almost comical style. On 14 October 1942 Reid, along three other British officers, escaped and made their way to neutral Switzerland. What Reid does not mention in <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> that he escaped using Hans Larive's Singen route. Larive, a Dutch naval lieutenant, attempted his first escape from Oflag VI-A in Soest in 1940, but was caught at the Swiss border. The interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border. Larive memorized the information, and many prisoners later escaped using this route.|$|E

500|$|The first {{primary source}} {{is the book}} written by Churches, who was {{decorated}} for {{his involvement in the}} planning and conduct of the escape and raid. Churches' book, titled A Hundred Miles as the Crow Flies, was written after he was relieved of his obligation to secrecy by the Australian Army. The book details the events prior to the escape and the course of escape and evacuation. <b>His</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> also translated in Slovenian as Vranov let v svobodo (Crow's Flight into Freedom). Churches was known by the nickname [...] "Crow" [...] as he was the only soldier from the Australian state of South Australia in the camp, and South Australians are colloquially known in Australia as [...] "crow eaters". Churches' version of events has been published, in part, by several secondary sources, including Australian television programs aired in 1985 and 2003, and newspaper articles in 1944, 2009 and 2011.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Doniger O'Flaherty was {{critical}} of Dreamtime, commenting that [...] "Duerr is attempting to hunt with the hounds and run with the hare, and <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> likely to infuriate both ordinary readers and scholars." [...] Although initially appearing suitable for the average reader, she felt that most would be {{put off by the}} [...] "daunting scholarly apparatus" [...] he had employed, and the [...] "heaviness of the argument". Believing that the book was difficult to read, she felt that Duerr had hidden his arguments in the footnotes, and that reading the first third of the book was akin to [...] "wandering stoned through the stacks of a very fine European library, browsing in the sections devoted to witchcraft, hallucinogens and orgiastic cults. It is good fun, but it is not for all tastes." [...] She equally felt that the book would be criticized by academics and other scholars working in the fields of witchcraft history and the history of religion, who would recognize that the book not only contained multiple factual errors, but also that many of Duerr's arguments were unoriginal, having previously been made by Mircea Eliade and Victor Turner.|$|E

500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> not easy to read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
500|$|Villani was a Guelph, but <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{much more}} {{taken up with}} an inquiry into what is useful and true than with {{factional}} party considerations. In a departure from Guelph politics, he favored republicanism over monarchy, praising the philosopher Brunetto Latini as [...] "the master and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them skilled in good speaking and in knowing how to guide and rule our republic according to political science." [...] However, Villani admitted in his writing that republicanism bred factional strife, that benevolent rulers like Robert of Naples were sometimes needed to keep order, and republicanism could become tyrannical {{if it came to}} represent only one class (such as exclusive favoring of aristocrats, merchants, or artisans). When detailing the construction of the Florence Cathedral and the artist Giotto di Bondone as the designer of the new bell tower, Villani called him [...] "the most sovereign master of painting in his time." [...] Villani's Cronica also provides the first known biography of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321), author of the Divine Comedy, who Villani described as haughty, disdainful, and reserved. In his revised Cronica of 1322, Villani shortened Dante's biography and the amount of quotations taken from his Divine Comedy. Villani's actions are explained by Richard H. Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, who write: [...] "Evidently two decades after the poet's death a conservative writer closely identified with the Florentine state still felt obliged to distance himself from the most outspoken critic of the basis of that state's prestige." ...|$|E
