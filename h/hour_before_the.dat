5|$|The savage hand-to-hand {{fighting}} in the railway buildings and sidings lasted {{for more than an}} <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> light horsemen captured the area. Over 20 Ottoman and German soldiers were killed in the station buildings alone during the fighting. At the same time, 'C' Squadron, of the 11th Light Horse Regiment, and/or one squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment, moved up into the village of Samakh and captured the town during less severe fighting.|$|E
5|$|Matt {{looks for}} {{information}} about his sister Lisa and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.|$|E

5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one <b>hour</b> <b>before)</b> <b>the</b> content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{race has}} been won 42 times by Cambridge and 30 times by Oxford, with Cambridge leading Oxford in {{cumulative}} wins since 1966. The reserves race has been won 25 times by Cambridge and 20 times by Oxford, with Cambridge leading in cumulative wins since {{the inception of}} the race. The 2017 race took place on Sunday 2 April at 16:35 British Summer Time, an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> men's race. Cambridge won {{for the first time in}} five years after Oxford caught a crab at the start. They set a record on the new course, beating the time first set on this course in 2015 by over a minute. The time was faster, in different conditions, than the Cambridge men's Blue Boat in 2016 and the Oxford men's in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Turner only {{learned that}} Stacey was Archie's killer half an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> episode aired, {{in a bid}} by the {{production}} team to maintain the storyline's secrecy. 51 EastEnders cast members appeared in the episode, with several expressing trepidation about performing live prior to the broadcast. Cast members had two weeks to rehearse the episode, with one rehearsal filmed in case of any serious problems during transmission. When Turner fell ill with the flu {{on the day of}} broadcast, it was feared the producers may have needed to use the pre-recorded tape, but in the event she recovered enough to appear.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the odds}} against him, the Batavian captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship {{alongside}} Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Batavian captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining Batavian ships making progress eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eigerøya and the Norwegian mainland in which the Batavian ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying in kind. Argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24-pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the Batavian persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eigerøya before Alms could intercept them.|$|E
5|$|The Director Task Force's commander—Brigadier General Julian W. Cunningham—issued {{orders for}} the landing on 4December. He {{directed}} that the Task Force would initially capture the Arawe Peninsula and its surrounding islands and establish an outpost on the trail leading to the Pulie River. The {{main body of the}} Director Task Force was to land at House Fireman Beach on the Arawe Peninsula at about dawn. Two troop-sized forces would conduct separate operations about an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> main landing. One troop was to capture Pitoe Island to the peninsula's south, as it was believed that the Japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded the entrance to Arawe Harbor. The other troop was to land at Umtingalu and establish a blocking position on the coastal trail east of the peninsula. Once the beachhead was secure, amphibious patrols would be conducted {{to the west of the}} peninsula in an attempt to make contact with the Marines at Cape Gloucester. U.S.Navy personnel on the planning staff were concerned about these subsidiary landings, as a night-time landing conducted at Lae in September had proven difficult.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{returns to}} Enterprise, {{which has been}} taken over by the Gorn. Kirk and Spock space dive to {{engineering}} and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board. They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance, and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar. Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes; in their closing logs, Kirk and Spock state T'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan, and that they have been ordered to Nibiru.|$|E

5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he {{was placed in a}} vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, the French {{units were}} warned an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> German bombers took off, but owing to equally poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the {{scramble}} signal {{when it was}} radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught on the ground. In the end, only eighty took off to intercept the incoming German formations. German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez 631s, {{one of which was}} shot down. The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force (USAAF) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign. Along with French AAA defences, the fighters shot down ten German aircraft, including four bombers. One of these machines was piloted by Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war. Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender. He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser, commander of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain.Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Fighter Flying Leader 3) Oberst Gerd von Massow was also shot down. He was replaced by Oberst Werner Junck, until the former's release by German forces on 12 June 1940. German formations attacked twenty-eight railways and marshalling yard centres. All damage inflicted was light. None were out of action for more than 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|The 2010–11 season saw {{virtually}} no {{change to the}} structure of the season or league. All teams from the previous season remained in the league, and the number of games remained at 36. The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011. After two years of leading the league, Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points. Shunhei Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals, while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists. However, with a couple of second-place finishes, Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59. The League also maintained the number of play-off teams at four. Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku. Halla managed to take two of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance. The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team came back with two straight wins to advance to the final {{for the first time in}} their short time in the league. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals. Halla had already in Japan just an <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> disaster struck the area. Fortunately, both teams survived, but the League felt the final could not go on. On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co-champions. Though shortened, Masato Domeki of Oji led the playoffs with four goals, Bruce Mulherin led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad Farynuk had eights points overall.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{soldiers}} at outpost number 3 called on supporting artillery units at Khâm Đức to fire directly {{at their own}} position {{in an attempt to}} hold off the North Vietnamese, but they too were defeated a few moments later. Before sunrise, all seven outposts were firmly in North Vietnamese hands, so U.S. and allied soldiers were placed in a perilous position. The North Vietnamese had occupied all the high ground, from which they could fire down on any support aircraft that tried to resupply the camp or to evacuate people from it. By sunrise, the North Vietnamese moved closer to the Special Forces Camp under the cover of the early morning fog. About one <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> fog was lifted, an additional 24 B-52 bombers flew in and dropped several hundred tons of bombs on suspected North Vietnamese positions south of Khâm Đức. At 08:20, General Burl W. McLaughlin – commander of the 834th Air Division – was ordered by the U.S. 7th Air Force to make an all-out effort to evacuate the besieged Special Forces Camp at Khâm Đức. By 09:35, the B-52 strikes had clearly failed to stop the North Vietnamese advance, when the camp's south-eastern perimeter was subjected to a massive ground assault.|$|E
