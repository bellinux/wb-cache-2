40|$|The 2 P domain K+ channel TREK- 1 {{is widely}} expres sed in the nervous system.

This activation can be reversed by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. The C-terminal domain of TREK- 1 is critical for its polymodal function.

40|$|Block of {{the human}} two-pore domain {{potassium}} (2 -PK) channel TREK- 1 by fluoxetine (ProzacR) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, was investigated using whole-cell patch-clamp recording of currents through recombinant channels in tsA 201 cells. Fluoxetine produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of TREK- 1 current that was reversible on wash. The IC 50 for block was 19 [*]μM. Block by fluoxetine was voltage-independent. Fluoxetine (100 [*]μM) produced an 84 % inhibition of TREK- 1 currents, but only a 31 % block of currents through a related 2 -PK channel, TASK- 3. Norfluoxetine was a more potent inhibitor of TREK- 1 currents with an IC 50 of 9 [*]μM. Block by norfluoxetine was also voltage-independent. Truncation of the C-terminus of TREK- 1 (Δ 89) resulted {{in a loss of}} channel function, which could be restored by intracellular acidification or the mutation <b>E</b> <b>306</b> A. The mutation <b>E</b> <b>306</b> A alone increased basal TREK- 1 current and resulted in a loss of the slow phase of TREK- 1 activation.

40|$|The {{neuronal}} mechano-gated K 2 P channels TREK- 1 and TRAAK show pronounced desensitization within 100 ms of membrane stretch. Desensitization {{persists in}} the presence of cytoskeleton disrupting agents, upon patch excision, and when channels are expressed in membrane blebs. Mechanosensitive currents evoked with a variety of complex stimulus protocols were globally fit to a four-state cyclic kinetic model in detailed balance, without the need to introduce adaptation of the stimulus. However, we show that patch stress can be a complex function of time and stimulation history. The kinetic model couples desensitization to activation, so that gentle conditioning stimuli do not cause desensitization. Prestressing the channels with pressure, amphipaths, intracellular acidosis, or the <b>E</b> <b>306</b> A mutation reduces the peak-to-steady-state ratio by changing the preexponential terms of the rate constants, increasing the steady-state current amplitude.

40|$|Retinoic acid (RA) causes HL- 60 human {{myeloblastic leukemia}} cell myeloid {{differentiation}} that {{is dependent on}} MAPK signaling. The process is propelled by c-Cbl, which binds the CD 38 receptor {{as part of a}} signaling complex generating MAPK signaling. Here we report that the capability of c-Cbl to do this is lost in the G <b>306</b> <b>E</b> tyrosine kinase-binding domain mutant. Unlike wild-type (WT) c-Cbl, the G <b>306</b> <b>E</b> mutant c-Cbl fails to propel RA-induced differentiation, and disrupts the normal association with CD 38. The G <b>306</b> <b>E</b> mutant does, like WT c-Cbl, co-immunoprecipitate with Vav, Slp- 76, and p 38. But unlike WT c-Cbl, does not cause MAPK signaling. In contrast, the C 381 A Ring finger domain mutant functions like WT c-Cbl. It binds CD 38 and is part of the same apparent c-Cbl/Slp- 76 /Vav/p 38 signaling complex. The C 381 A mutant causes MAPK signaling and propels RA-induced differentiation. In addition to HL- 60 cells and their WT or mutant c-Cbl stable transfectants, the c-Cbl/Vav/Slp- 76 complex is also found in NB 4 cells where c-Cbl was previously also found to bind CD 38.

40|$|The {{protooncogene}} product Cbl {{has emerged}} as a negative regulator of tyrosine kinases. We have shown previously that Cbl binds to ZAP- 70 through its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of Cbl in Jurkat T cells decreases the TCR-induced phosphorylation of ZAP- 70 and other cellular phosphoproteins. Coexpression of Cbl with ZAP- 70 in COS cells reproduced the Cbl-induced reduction in the level of phosphorylated ZAP- 70. The effect of Cbl was eliminated by the TKB-inactivating G <b>306</b> <b>E</b> mutation in Cbl as well as by a phenylalanine mutation of Tyr 292 within the TKB domain binding site on ZAP- 70. Notably, the oncogenic Cbl- 70 Z/ 3 mutant associated with ZAP- 70, but did not reduce the levels of phosphorylated ZAP- 70. Overexpression of Cbl, but not Cbl-G <b>306</b> <b>E,</b> in Jurkat T cells led to a decrease in the TCR-induced NF-AT luciferase reporter activity. Overexpression of the TKB domain itself, but not its G <b>306</b> <b>E</b> mutant, functioned in a dominant-negative manner and led to an increase in NF-AT reporter activity. Cbl- 70 Z/ 3 -overexpressing cells exhibited an increase in both basal and TCR-induced NF-AT luciferase reporter activity, and this trend was reversed by the G <b>306</b> <b>E</b> mutation. Finally, by reconstituting a ZAP- 70 -deficient Jurkat T cell line, p 116, we demonstrate that wild-type ZAP- 70 is susceptible to the negative regulatory effect of Cbl, whereas the ZAP- 70 -Y 292 F mutant is resistant.

Perceived energy expenditure, perception of effort, fatigue and pleasure were also assessed after sexual activity.

40|$|Bestrophins are a {{recently}} discovered family of Cl 2 channels, {{for which no}} structural information is available. Some family members are activated by increased intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. Bestrophins feature a well conserved Asp-rich tract in their COOH terminus (Asp-rich domain), which is homologous to Ca 2 +-binding motifs in human thrombospondins and in human big-conductance Ca 2 +- and voltage-gated K+ channels (BKCa). Consequently, the Asp-rich domain is also a candidate for Ca 2 + binding in bestrophins. Based on these considerations, we constructed homology models of human bestrophin- 1 (Best 1) Asp-rich domain using human thrombospondin- 1 X-ray structure as a template. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify Asp and Glu residues binding Ca 2 + and to predict the effects of their mutations to alanine. We then proceeded to test selected mutations in the Asp-rich domain of the highly homologous mouse bestrophin- 2. The mutants expressed in HEK- 293 cells were investigated by electrophysiological experiments using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Based on our molecular modeling results, we predicted that Asp-rich domain has two defined binding sites and that D 301 A and D 304 A mutations may impact the binding of the metal ions.

Among five group cross-reactive epitopes, amino acids located in domains I, II and III were involved in one, five and three epitopes, respectively. Recognition by six JEV serocomplex cross-reactive mAbs was reduced by amino acid substitutions in domains II and III.

40|$|Paternal-Sex-Ratio (PSR) is a B {{chromosome}} {{that causes}} all-male offspring in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. It is only transmitted via sperm of carrier males and destroys the other paternal chromosomes {{during the first}} mitotic division of the fertilized egg. Because of haplodiploidy, the effect of PSR is to convert diploid (female) eggs into haploid eggs that develop into PSR-bearing males. The PSR chromosome was previously found to contain several families of repetitive DNA, which appear {{to be present in}} local blocks. PSR chromosomes with irradiation-induced deletions have decreased rates of transmission and increased variation in transmission. This study investigates whether these differences in transmission of deletion chromosomes are due to mitotic instability. Two deletion chromosomes (<b>E</b> <b>306</b> and F 316) and the wild-type PSR chromosome were examined. A cytogenetic assay of testes revealed that wild-type PSR males contained the chromosome in 98 %- 100 % of their spermatocytes.

One F 316 male did not contain the chromosome in any of its spermatocytes although the chromosome was present in somatic tissues based on hybridization to PSR-specific repetitive DNA. A molecular analysis of males found the wild-type PSR chromosome to be present in all somatic tissues. Tissue specific differences in the presence of PSR were found in several males from the two deletion lines.

Previous {{studies suggest that the}} volume of these side-chains, situated facing the side of the C-terminal Y 308 catalytic residue not stacking the flavin isoalloxazine ring, may be directly involved in the fine-tuning of the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Wild-type pea FNR as well as single and double mutants of C 266 and L 268 residues were analysed by fast transient-kinetic techniques and their midpoint reduction potentials were determined. For the C 266 A, C 266 M and C 266 A/L 268 A mutants a significant reduction in the overall hydride transfer (HT) rates was observed along with the absence of charge-transfer complex formation. The HT rate constants for NADPH oxidation were lower than those for NADP+ reduction, reaching a 30 -fold decrease in the double mutant. In agreement, these variants exhibited more negative midpoint potentials with respect to the wild-type enzyme. The three-dimensional structures of C 266 M and L 268 V variants were solved. The C 266 M mutant shows a displacement of <b>E</b> <b>306</b> away from the relevant residue S 90 to accommodate the bulky methionine introduced.

The value of other optical properties namely refractive indices, extinction coefficient, effective mass and dielectric constant was also being determined and were found to be 2. 55 - 2. 85, 0. 1 x 10 - 2 â€“ 1. 1 x 10 - 2, 1. 42 x 10 - 33 kg and 0. 006 - 8. 094, respectively.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the evolutionary history of the Kuroshio Current (KC) and other extensions. However, the history of the KC intrusion into the South China Sea (SCS) through the Luzon Strait has been little studied. Here we trace the Holocene developmental history of the KC intrusion and its impact on environmental transformation in the northern SCS. This study involved a comprehensive analysis of planktonic foraminifera, clay minerals and geochemical elements of core 05 <b>E</b> <b>306</b> sediments from the northeastern SCS. AMS C- 14 dates indicated that the sedimentation rate at the core site was most rapid (> 1000 cm/ka) before similar to 6. 0 ka, relatively rapid (similar to 65 cm/ka) between 6. 0 and 4. 6 ka and slow (similar to 24 cm/ka) since 4. 6 ka. The Pulleniatina minimum event (PME) occurred between 4. 6 and 2. 7 ka, together with high percentages of Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Globorotalia menardii. Planktonic foraminifera indicated that the KC intrusion experienced three significant changes at 6. 0, 4. 6 and 2. 7 ka in turn. Depositional environments, including input of terrigenous materials and development of biogenic materials, similarly underwent three important transformations at 6. 0, 4. 1 and 3. 0 ka, respectively. Abrupt changes in sedimentary records at the study core are contemporary with records from the tropical Pacific during the Holocene. This indicates that development of the KC intrusion and its impact on depositional environments in the SCS can be correlated with tropical factors from the low-latitude oceans. This study was jointly funded by the Basic Research Project of State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China (2013 CB 956102), National Nature Science Foundation of China (40976028), the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (SQ 201201), the State Key Program of National Natural Science of China (91128206, 91228207), the National Special Project on Basic Research of Science and Technology (2008 FY 110100) and the Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Marginal Sea Geology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (MSGL 12 - 09) ...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} micro and nanostructured metals are {{important}} {{for the construction of}} plasmonic devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMs). The fabrication of individual metallic, pyramidal shells as well as ultra-smooth metal films with grooves, bumps, pyramids and holes has previously been demonstrated 1, 2, as has direct raster milling with 5 nm machining precision in 100 nm thick gold films 3. Routine fabrication of micro and nanostructured thin films is desirable. In this work, the fabrication of arrays of nanoscale pyramidal structures in free-standing gold films is demonstrated, and single nanopores are milled into the nanostructures for DNA translocation. Silicon Klarite® pyramidal micro-structured substrates are an effective tool for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments, owing to the strong field enhancement within the pyramids. Here, the substrates are used as moulds for creating pyramidal structured gold as free-standing thin films. The silicon substrates contain an array of pyramids etched into a 4 mm x 4 mm square region on the substrate's surface. These pyramids are 1. 5 µm x 1. 5 µm square and 1 µm deep on a pitch of 2 m. An Edwards <b>E</b> <b>306</b> A Thermal Evaporator is used to coat silicon samples in a 50 nm layer of Teflon® and then a 100 nm layer of gold. Epoxy is then deposited on top of the gold layer using a pipette. Once the epoxy has cured, the epoxy together with the gold is mechanically lifted from the Teflon® coated substrate. The gold-coated epoxy is then placed over a micron-sized aperture and the epoxy dissolved away using acetone. Initial imaging is performed using a Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc., Evo® scanning electron microscope (SEM), while the subsequent imaging and milling of 50 nm holes through the free-standing gold is carried out using an Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc., Orion® Plus helium ion microscope (HIM). These films are suspended over micron-sized apertures for integration into platforms already proven for DNA translocation, and to optically interrogate the structures using Raman based techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of electron binding to sodium chloride dimers in the gas-phase was {{studied at the}} coupled cluster level with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations using aug-cc-pVDZ+ 6 s 6 p 4 d basis sets. It was found that three kinds of anions can be formedsquasi-linear dipole-bound, nearly rhombic quadrupole-bound, and linear solvated-electron anions. In contrast to the earlier results, {{it was found that}} the rhombic neutral dimer (which is the neutral global minimum) does bind an excess electron to form an electronically stable anion of quadrupole nature. The global minimum on the ground-state anionic potential energy surface corresponds to the dipole-bound anion of quasi-linear structure (NaClâââNaCl) - whose vertical electron binding energy is 12 051 cm- 1. It was also found that solvated-electron structure (ClNaâââNaCl) - is considerably higher in energy than the anionic global minimum but its vertical electron detachment energy is significantly larger (i. <b>e.,</b> 21 <b>306</b> cm- 1). The nearly rhombic (NaCl) 2 - lies only 0. 181 eV above the anionic global minimum but below the global minimum of the neutral species. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{mammalian}} proto-oncoprotein Cbl and its homo-logues in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila are evolutionarily conserved negative regulators of the epi-dermal {{growth factor}} receptor (EGF-R).
