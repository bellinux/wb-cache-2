50|$|Rawidowicz was {{a critic}} of zionism. In his essay {{entitled}} Between <b>Jew</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arab,</b> he suggested that early Arab refugees in Israel were treated differently from Jews as early as 1948. In The Ever-Dying People, he argued that each generation of Jews was afraid of extinction.|$|R
25|$|Besides <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> from Palestine, {{in total}} by mid-1944 the British had {{assembled}} a multiethnic force consisting of volunteer European Jewish refugees (from German-occupied countries), Yemenite Jews and Abyssinian Jews.|$|E

25|$|Polls {{show that}} if the two-state {{solution}} were taken off the table, a strong majority of Americans would favor a one-state solution in which <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> would have equal citizenship and rights.

50|$|In June 1946 Hyamson {{added his}} name to a letter to The Times {{with a number of}} Indian Civil Servants to say that the {{situation}} in Palestine and the possibility of reconciliation between <b>Jew</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arab</b> had been made more difficult by the conclusions of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. They proposed self-government for all Palestinians, <b>Jew</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arab,</b> within a single state before goodwill is established between the parties. Once the status of each community was assured, cooperation would follow. Practical efforts should be made {{along the lines of the}} Cabinet Mission to India, which they say worked in a vastly more complicated situation. In April 1948 he wrote his final letter to The Times which called for a bi-national or federal solution to the situation in Palestine.|$|R
25|$|In 1947, the {{population}} was reported as 1,845,000, consisting of 608,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 1,237,000 <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> others.|$|R

25|$|The mission {{aimed at}} {{establishing}} an intelligence-gathering base in Mandatory Palestine, radioing information back to Germany, and recruiting and arming anti-British Palestinians by buying their support with gold.

25|$|Wilson was pro-Zionist after {{a meeting}} with Chaim Weizmann in May 1919, believing that Jews could police the area for Britain. He wanted to {{withdraw}} from the British Mandate of Palestine (which at that time included the Emirate of Transjordan), as Britain did not have the troops to keep both <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> under its thumb.|$|E

25|$|Already {{in these}} early works, Loevy focused on two themes that would {{dominate}} his laterprojects: the tense relationship between Arabs and Jews in Israel, {{and the role of}} education and art in shaping a society. His next documentary would introduce another key theme: the inequities of class disparity and discrimination between <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> in Israel, and between Jewish Israelis.|$|E
25|$|In the film, What I Saw in Hebron the {{survivors}} – now very elderly – describe pre-massacre Hebron {{as a kind}} of paradise surrounded by vineyards, where Sephardic <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> lived in idyllic coexistence. The well-established Ashkenazi residents were also treated well, but the Arabs' anger was roused by followers of the Jerusalem Mufti as well as local chapters of the (Arab) Muslim-Christian Societies.|$|E

He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.|$|E

25|$|Nineteen {{men were}} arrested. The next day, Jabotinsky protested {{to the police}} that he was their {{commander}} and therefore solely responsible, so they should be released. Instead, {{he was arrested and}} joined them in jail. The nineteen were sentenced to three years in prison and Jabotinsky was given a 15-year prison term for possession of weapons. In July, a general pardon was granted to <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> convicted in the rioting.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{the city}} absorbed {{thousands}} of Jews, who immigrated from the Soviet Union, and later from Russia and Ukraine. Within several years, however, the population balance between <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> shifted backwards, as northern neighbourhoods were abandoned {{by many of}} its Jewish residents in favour of new housing projects in nearby Nahariya, while many Muslim Arabs moved in (largely coming from nearby Arab villages). Nevertheless, the city still has a clear Jewish majority; in 2011, the population of 46,000 included 30,000 Jews and 14,000 Arabs.|$|E
25|$|Gort {{ended the}} war as High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan. He served at this office only one year. In 1945 he {{nominated}} William James Fitzgerald, Chief Justice of Palestine, to enquire into the Jewish-Arab conflict in Jerusalem. Chief Justice Fitzgerald issued his report in which he proposed to divide the city into separate Jewish and Arab Quarters. Despite growing tensions in Palestine, Gort strove to cultivate good personal relations with both <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs,</b> and was greatly admired and respected by the Jewish and Arab communities.|$|E

25|$|Morris {{says that}} by the end of March 1948, the Yishuv had {{suffered}} about a thousand dead. Ilan Pappé estimates that 400 <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 1,500 <b>Arabs</b> were killed by January 1948. In December the Jewish death toll was estimated over 200 and, according to Alec Kirkbride, by 18 January 333 <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 345 <b>Arabs</b> were killed while 643 <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 877 <b>Arabs</b> were injured. The overall death toll between December 1947 and January 1948 (including British personal) was estimated at around 1,000 people, with 2,000 injured. According to Yoav Gelber, by the end of March there was a total of 2,000 dead and 4,000 wounded. These figures correspond to an average of more than 100 deaths and 200 casualties per week in a population of 2,000,000.|$|R
5000|$|Some Mizrahi <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Jews</b> report {{exclusion}} <b>and</b> {{discrimination by}} the Ashkenazi LGBT community in Israel.

[...] Prejudice against Arab Americans in the U.S. can also {{take the form of}} Islamophobia.|$|R
25|$|He {{has been}} {{critical}} of U.S. involvement in the Israel–Palestine conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement. Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant {{that is home to}} both <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs.</b> However, acknowledging the realpolitik of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms. As a result of his criticisms of Israel, Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.|$|E

Sindhi and Punjabi were the languages used by Indians in Afghanistan. Some Afghan cities including Kabul have places of worship for Hindus and Sikhs. Local citizenship has been obtained in Afghanistan by Hindu and Sikh traders.|$|E
25|$|As the {{tensions}} between <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arabs</b> in the Palestinian Territories increased, these companies started to make arrests and conveyance of Palestinians, contrary to their original designations. As a result, following {{the onset of the}} Second Intifada, Sayfan and Sirpad were disbanded {{due to the lack of}} operational necessity (many of their missions were taken up by the Ofer and Ktzi'ot prisons, and the Israel Border Police), while Sahlav continued working until December 2005. The Sahlav company was the first IDF unit to provide combat training for female soldiers, long before the Caracal Battalion and similar units were founded.|$|E
