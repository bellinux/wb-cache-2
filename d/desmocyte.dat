40|$|Hydroids form {{symbiotic}} {{relationships with}} a range of invertebrate hosts. Where they live with colonial invertebrates such as corals or bryozoans the hydroids may benefit from the physical support and protection of their host 2 ̆ 7 s hard exoskeleton, but how they interact with them is unknown. Electron microscopy was used to investigate the physical interactions between the colonial hydroid Zanclea margaritae and its reef-building coral host Acropora muricata. The hydroid tissues extend below the coral tissue surface sitting in direct contact with the host 2 ̆ 7 s skeleton. Although this arrangement provides the hydroid with protective support, it also presents problems of potential interference with the coral 2 ̆ 7 s growth processes and exposes the hydroid to overgrowth and smothering. Desmocytes located within the epidermal layer of the hydroid 2 ̆ 7 s perisarc-free hydrorhizae fasten it to the coral skeleton. The large apical surface area of the <b>desmocyte</b> and high bifurcation of the distal end within the mesoglea, as well as the clustering of desmocytes suggests that a very strong attachment between the hydroid and the coral skeleton. This is the first study to provide a detailed description of how symbiotic hydroids attach to their host 2 ̆ 7 s skeleton, utilising it for physical support. Results suggest that the loss of perisarc, a characteristic commonly associated with symbiosis, allows the hydroid to utilise desmocytes for attachment. The use of these anchoring structures provides a dynamic method of attachment, facilitating detachment from the coral skeleton during extension, thereby avoiding overgrowth and smothering enabling the hydroid to remain within the host colony for prolonged periods of time...|$|E
40|$|The {{anchoring}} {{devices of}} hydranths to their thecae {{have been studied}} in various Thecata families by means of histochemical, histological and electron microscope techniques. In all the genera examined have been observed joints fastening the mesoglea to the theca or an expansion thereof. These joints of <b>desmocytes</b> appear as stiff stalks with broadened extremities. The one included in the mesoglea is massive, spread out and in intimate contact with the mesoglean fibers. The other, ending in the perisarc, is largely opened and has numerous digitations ensuring its efficient anchoring. The axis of the <b>desmocytes</b> is solid. The joints are not chitinous nor constituted by mesoglean or muscular fibers. Their proteinaceous nature seems to relate them rather to the "tonofibrils". © 1971 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|The {{exoskeleton}} is {{an important}} source of characters for the taxonomy of Hydroidolina. It originates as epidermal secretions and, among other functions, protects the coenosarc of the polypoid stage. However, comparative studies on the exoskeletal tissue origin, development, chemical, and structural characteristics, as well as its evolution and homology, are few and fragmented. This study compares the structure and composition of the exoskeleton and underlying coenosarc in members of “Anthoathecata” and some Leptothecata, but does so mainly in bougainvilliid polyps histological analyses. We also studied the development of the exoskeleton under experimental conditions. We identified three types of glandular epidermal cells related to the origin of the exoskeleton and the secretion of its polysaccharides component. The exoskeleton of the species studied is either bilayered (perisarc and exosarc, especially in bougainvilliids) or corneous (perisarc). The exoskeleton varies in chemical composition, structural rigidity, thickness, extension, and coverage in the different regions of the colony. In bilayered exoskeletons, the exosarc is produced first and appears to be a key step {{in the formation of the}} rigid exoskeleton. The exoskeleton contains anchoring structures such as <b>desmocytes</b> and “perisarc extensions. ...|$|R
40|$|White {{syndrome}} {{has been}} described {{as one of the most}} prolific diseases on the Great Barrier Reef. Previously, apoptotic cell death {{has been described}} as the mechanism driving the characteristic rapid tissue loss associated with this disease, but the molecular mechanisms controlling apoptotic cell death in coral disease have yet to be investigated. In situ methods were used to study the expression patterns of 2 distinct regulators of apoptosis in Acropora hyacinthus tissues undergoing white syndrome and apoptotic cell death. Apoptotic genes within the Bcl- 2 family were not localized in apparently healthy coral tissues. However, a Bcl- 2 family member (bax-like) was found to localize to cells and tissues affected by white syndrome and those with morphological evidence for apoptosis. A potential up-regulation of pro-apoptotic or bax-like gene expression in tissues with apoptotic cell death adjacent to disease lesions is consistent with apoptosis being the primary cause of rapid tissue loss in coral affected by white syndrome. Pro-apoptotic (bax-like) expression in <b>desmocytes</b> and the basal tissue layer, the calicodermis, distant from the disease lesion suggests that apoptosis may also underlie the sloughing of healthy tissues associated with the characteristic, rapid spread of tissue loss, evident of this disease. This study also shows that in situ hybridisation is an effective tool for studying gene expression in adult corals, and wider application of these methods should allow a better understanding of many aspects of coral biology and disease pathology...|$|R
