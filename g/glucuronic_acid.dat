5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid</b> to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E

50|$|Capsulan {{has been}} found to be mostly {{carbohydrate}} (70%) with some protein and sulfur. The main sugars making up the carbohydrate are galactose and glucose while other sugars such as xylose, arabinose and mannose are also present in smaller quantities. Sugar acids are common in plant and algal polysacchride but there is disagreement in the literature concerning capsulan's sugar acid content. Kurano claims that capsulan contains none, while Myklestad maintains that both galacturonic and <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids</b> are present.|$|R

In addition one of the most intriguing aspects thereof is the capability of O-glycosylation to extend half life, decrease clearance, and improve PK/PD thereof the active peptide beyond increasing CNS penetration. The innate utilization of sugars as solubilizing moieties in Phase II and III metabolism (<b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids)</b> has remarkably allowed an evolutionary advantage in that mammalian enzymes are not directly evolved to degrade O glycosylated products on larger moieties.|$|R

30|$|Lignocellulosic biomass {{represents}} the {{largest source of}} renewable energy, which is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. It forms {{the basis for the}} production of various value-added products by microbial conversion (Saha 2003; Kumar and Gummadi 2011; Kumar et al. 2008). For bioconversion, pre-treatment of lignocelluloses is important and the resulting hydrolysate contains high amount of hexoses and pentoses (Moiser et al. 2005; Saha 2003; Saha et al. 2005). Hemicelluloses are heteropolysaccharides composed of short chains of sugar units such as xylose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, galactose and <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids</b> which can be acetylated or methylated (Chandel et al. 2010; Saha 2003; Saha et al. 2005).|$|R

25|$|The {{first pass}} through the hepatic portal vein results {{in some of the}} drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active {{metabolite}} of dextromethorphan called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid</b> and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to scar-inducing factors, like those discussed above, astrocytes up regulate {{the production of}} chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Astrocytes are a predominant type of glial cell in {{the central nervous system}} that provide many functions including damage mitigation, repair, and glial scar formation. The RhoA pathway is involved. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) {{have been shown to be}} up regulated in the central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Repeating disaccharides of <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid</b> and galactosamine, glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs), are covalently coupled to the protein core CSPGs. CSPGs have been shown to inhibit regeneration in vitro and in vivo, but the role that the CSPG core protein vs. CS-GAGs had not been studied until recently.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} pro-moieties 8 a - e {{designed}} for prodrug preparation have been synthesized (chart 2). The pro-moieties, containing a glucuronyl carbamate group {{linked to a}} spacer possessing a terminal carboxylic acid group, have been synthesized from isocyanates 6 and anomerically unprotected <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids</b> 10 (chart 2). The requisite isocyanates had to be prepared using the Curtius rearrangement. Glucuronyl carbamates proved to be excellent substrates for human beta-glucuronidase. The pro-moieties 8 a - e can be coupled to hydroxy- or amino group containing drugs. The resulting prodrugs {{are designed to be}} activated by beta-glucuronidase (chart 1) and to be used in ADEPT. Application is demonstrated with the synthesis of daunomycin prodrugs 12 a - e (chart 3) ...|$|R
50|$|AGPs {{contains}} {{protein backbone}} of varied length (5-30kDa) with N-terminal secretory peptide followed by AGP, Fasciclin domains and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor site. In some plant cells, {{the length of}} the mature protein backbone is only 10-13 residues long and they are therefore called as Arabinogalactan peptides. The protein backbone contains domain rich in hydroxyproline/proline, serine, alanine and glycine amino acids. The repeated occurrence of Alanine/Serine/Threonine-Proline stretch (glycomodules) and the presence of hydroxyproline suggests the sites for O-linked glycosylation and arabinogalactan modification. The O-linked glycan chains predominantly contain galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, mannose, galacturonic <b>acid</b> and/or <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids</b> and have a relatively high degree of polymerization, with a structure similar to arabinogalactan II.|$|R
40|$|Colonial {{aggregates}} of Methanosarcina (= Methanococcus) mazei {{were examined}} with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Cells are irregular and grouped into multicellular sarcinal colonies, which may disaggregate in older cultures. The protoplast is bounded by a typical trilaminar plasma membrane, outside {{of which is}} a matrix of loose fibrils. The presence and compactness of matrix material are responsible for the close packing of cells, and colony disaggregation seems {{to be the result of}} matrix shedding and degradation. The cell envelope contains complex hetero polysaccharides of N-acetylgalactosamine and galacturonic and <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids.</b> Polymers extruded by M. mazei are likely quite adhesive in nature, accounting for its strong adherence to surfaces and hardiness compared with many other methanogens...|$|R
25|$|Pethidine {{is quickly}} {{hydrolysed}} {{in the liver}} to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of pethidine but a longer elimination half-life (8–12 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in renal failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of pethidine compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid</b> and excreted into the urine.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, {{have been created}} for therapeutic use. They differ in both pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and pharmacodynamics (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na+) and water; renal physiology). Because they permeate the intestines easily, they are administered primarily per os (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. More than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. In the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and are secreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} polysaccharides {{have been found}} in the {{extracellular}} and intracellular compartments of M. plumbeus including fucose, glucose, galactose and mannose. <b>Glucuronic</b> <b>acid,</b> a carbohydrate with a similar structure to glucose, is located specifically in the extracellular region of M. plumbeus. The monosaccharide glucosamine was found only in the intracellular regions of M. plumbeus. Mucor plumbeus has the ability to detoxify pentachlorophenol and has been used in the biotransformation of other products. Incubation of M. plumbeus with the natural product maalioxide produces three metabolites (1,7 and 9 β-hydroxymaalioxide). Mucor plumbeus activity towards camphorquinone is stereoselective. Extracts of Mucor plumbeus have shown acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition activity. Mucor plumbeus is able to biocatalyze the hydroxylation of terpenes and steroids by cytochrome p450 enzymes in the presence of O and cofactor NADPH. Mucor plumbeus also transforms sesquiterpene into a series of 12 degradation products of 10,15-epoxidation. As well, squamulosone (aromadendr-1(10)-en-9-one) is biotransformed by M. plumbeus to yield an array of terpenes.|$|E

Production of slime by excised root tips is {{stimulated by the}} addition of 40 mM sucrose or fucose and half-strength Hoagland's solution to the incubation medium. Secreted slime was recovered from aqueous solution by precipitation with ethanol. The polymer has a molecular weight greater than 2 × 10 − 6 daltons and a density of 1. 63 g cm− 3. Protein is not present in material purified by density gradient centrifugation with cesium chloride. Fucose (39 %) and galactose (30 %) are the principle neutral sugars found in the purified polymer.

40|$|Members of the {{bacterial}} genus Sphingomonas {{are known}} to produce highly viscous polysaccharides in solution. The exopolysaccharide PS-EDIV was produced by Sphingomonas pituitosa strain DSM 13101, purified using centrifugation, and precipitation and its structure was elucidated by 1 D and 2 D NMR techniques and chemical microderivatization combined with various mass spectrometric techniques. The following repeating unit of the polysaccharide could be identified: [formula: see text]. In addition, the polysaccharide also contains acetyl and glyceryl groups whose exact positions were not determined. PS-EDIV is similar in structure to a known exopolysaccharide but differs in being the first bacterial polysaccharide in which two different <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acids</b> are combined.

25|$|Cholesterol is {{oxidized}} by {{the liver}} into {{a variety of}} bile acids. These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid,</b> or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation, which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones (lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently). Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. A cholesterol-reducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces.|$|E
25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with <b>glucuronic</b> <b>acid</b> and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E

The article concluded that [...] "the polysaccharides from these mushrooms may constitute {{a new source of}} compounds with action on coagulation, platelet aggregation and, perhaps, on thrombosis". Another study reported that the species may be effective in stopping platelet binding in vitro, with possible uses regarding hypercholesterolemia. Research has shown that A.auricula-judae can be used to lower cholesterol levels generally, and, in particular, is one of two fungi shown to reduce the level of bad cholesterol.|$|E
40|$|K polysaccharides (KPSs) of Sinorhizobium meliloti strains are strain-specific surface polysaccharides {{analogous}} to the group II K antigens of Escherichia coli.

This behavior is in apparent contradiction with basic thermodynamics, as usually {{the higher the}} pH the more cations bind. Our combined titration, circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering study indicated that the change observed in Cu bond strength relates to a conformational change {{of the structure of}} xanthan, which generates more chelating sites at pH 3. 5 than at pH 5. 5.
