In this paper, hemp <b>cellulose</b> ethers of <b>Methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (MC) ether and <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methyl</b> (HPMC) <b>cellulose</b> ether further were used as a kind of textile sizing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Noninvasive breath tests {{may have}} {{significant}} utility for {{the measurement of}} gastric emptying in mice, but the tests' sensitivity for detection of changes in gastric emptying has not been evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> was incorporated into a liquid meal to delay gastric emptying, and mice were injected with erythromycin to accelerate emptying of a liquid or solid meal. All test meals were labelled with (13) C-acetic acid or (13) C-octanoic acid. Breath samples collected at intervals were analysed for (13) CO(2) content, and gastric emptying rates were calculated from the resultant (13) CO(2) excretion curves. RESULTS: As predicted, <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> slowed emptying compared with water (14. 21 +/- 0. 94 min vs. 9. 17 +/- 0. 47 min, P < 0. 001), while erythromycin treatment accelerated emptying of liquids (10. 96 +/- 0. 78 min vs. 16. 41 +/- 1. 94 min, P < 0. 05) and solids (108. 81 +/- 18. 06 vs. 157. 95 +/- 12. 01 min, P < 0. 05) compared with the saline injected controls.
