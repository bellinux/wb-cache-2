500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2011, the {{director}} {{announced plans to}} reissue the film which had initially been finalized with the title Black Gold and released in early months of 2011. According to Amata, the film was [...] "out of date": [...] "It {{had to be more}} current. It had to adhere strictly to what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> now – the Arab spring and all that". This change resulted in approximately 60% part of Black Gold being reshot, but still sewn into the original plot of Black Gold. Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger and Anne Heche who were not part of Black Gold were also added to the cast line-up of Black November. Akon and Wyclef Jean also later joined the set during the last lap of shoot in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} then {{revealed}} to be a double album on December 17, 2013, with the second disc containing unreleased tracks and recording sessions from the duo's second studio album, The Infamous. Prodigy stated that the album would be released during March 2014 and it would now be titled The Infamous Mobb Deep. He later said the whole project would be getting back to their original gritty New York sound. Prodigy explained to XXL; [...] "I would just say, our signature sound is a dark, sinister-type of sound. There's certain things we're going through in our lives right now, and the lyrics are just up to date. Everything that we're saying is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> now. Each album is like that, it's a time capsule of that time period. So now in 2014, you’re gonna hear what we’re going through in our lyrics, what's going through our head as grown men." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the album's release T.I. {{decided to}} release a mixtape titled Fuck a Mixtape; the move was {{somewhat}} controversial due to its title, with many feeling he was insulting the Mixtape format. T.I. has addressed the issue by stating {{that it was a}} response to all the people who told him to just focus on an album and not on a mixtape. T.I. further defended his decision {{to release a}} mixtape by saying: [...] "I already have 60, 70 songs. A lot of these songs are period pieces that speak volumes to what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> now. If I hold onto them next year or the year after, they'll be dated, because my life will be in another direction. If I'm not gonna put it on the album — and they all can't make the album — then they might as well have another platform to present it to the world".|$|E
2500|$|Once the FBI {{discovered}} through Selbold that Duquesne {{was again}} in New York operating as a German spy, director J. Edgar Hoover provided a background briefing to President Franklin Roosevelt. FBI agent Raymond Newkirk, {{using the name}} Ray McManus, was now assigned to DUNN and he rented a room immediately above Duquesne's apartment near Central Park and used a hidden microphone to record Duquesne's conversations. But monitoring Duquesne's activities proved to be difficult. As Newkirk described it, [...] "The Duke had been a spy {{all of his life}} and automatically used all of the tricks in the book to avoid anyone following him... He would take a local train, change to an express, change back to a local, go through a revolving door and keep <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> around, take an elevator up a floor, get off, walk back to the ground, and take off in a different entrance of the building." [...] Duquesne also informed Sebold that he was certain he was under surveillance, and he even confronted one FBI agent and demanded that he stop tracking him, a story confirmed by agent Newkirk.|$|E

60|$|This place {{affected}} me so strangely, so irresistibly that I remained {{there a long}} time. Something terrible had happened there to men. I felt that. Something tragic was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> then--the wearing down, the devastation of the old earth. How plainly that could be seen! Geologically it was more remarkable to me than the Grand Canyon. But it was the appalling meaning, the absolutely indescribable beauty that overcame me.

60|$|These early birds came {{scattering}} along {{after each}} other, about one {{every five minutes}} in our vicinity, during half an hour. They brought no armor of offense but their swords; as a rule, they carried the sword ready in the hand, and put it forward and found the wires with it. We would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us; but we knew what had happened, all the same; poor fellow, he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted. We had brief intervals of grim stillness, interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad; {{and this sort of}} thing was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>right</b> along, and was very creepy there in the dark and lonesomeness.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remained}} {{three days}} and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice {{for the purpose of}} stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and if there was any thing I wanted. [...] "Nothing," [...] I replied; [...] "I am as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?" [...] "She will be under weigh in less than half an hour," [...] he answered. [...] "I came to let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four days more. All is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to keep time by. I suppose you can't tell how long you have been buried--only three days--this is the twentieth. I would bring the watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed." [...] With this he went up.|$|E

25|$|While {{this was}} <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> the <b>right</b> {{detachment}} under Keyes, having found {{itself on the}} wrong side of the river, made contact with an Australian battalion to the south which brought up a boat with which they could make a crossing. Due to the size of the boat, it had to make a number of trips before the detachment was on the northern side. Once that was complete Keyes was able to take command of the unit. After carrying out a reorganisation, he was able to launch an assault on the redoubt and by 13:00 they had captured it and secured the crossing.|$|R
60|$|Ideas {{that are}} unhampered by {{political}} intrigue or financial considerations have a sweeping way with them, and before a year {{was out the}} records of the council show clearly that it was rising to its enormous opportunity, and partly through its own direct control and partly through a series of specific committees, it was planning a new common social order for the entire population of the earth. 'There can be no real social stability or any general human happiness while large areas of the world and large classes of people are in a phase of civilisation different from the prevailing mass. It is impossible now to have great blocks of population misunderstanding the generally accepted social purpose or at an economic disadvantage to the rest.' So the council expressed its conception of the problem it had to solve. The peasant, the field-worker, and all barbaric cultivators were at an 'economic disadvantage' to the more mobile and educated classes, and the logic of the situation compelled the council to take up systematically the supersession of this stratum by a more efficient organisation of production. It developed a scheme for the progressive establishment throughout the world of the 'modern system' in agriculture, a system that should give the full advantages of a civilised life to every agricultural worker, and this replacement has been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> up to the present day. The central idea of the modern system is the substitution of cultivating guilds for the individual cultivator, and for cottage and village life altogether. These guilds are associations {{of men and women who}} take over areas of arable or pasture land, and make themselves responsible for a certain average produce. They are bodies small enough as a rule to be run on a strictly democratic basis, and large enough to supply all the labour, except for a certain assistance from townspeople during the harvest, needed upon the land farmed. They have watchers' bungalows or chalets on the ground cultivated, but the ease and the costlessness of modern locomotion enables them to maintain a group of residences in the nearest town with a common dining-room and club house, and usually also a guild house in the national or provincial capital. Already this system has abolished a distinctively 'rustic' population throughout vast areas of the old world, where it has prevailed immemorially. That shy, unstimulated life of the lonely hovel, the narrow scandals and petty spites and persecutions of the small village, that hoarding, half inanimate existence away from books, thought, or social participation and in constant contact with cattle, pigs, poultry, and their excrement, is passing away out of human experience. In a little while it will be gone altogether. In the nineteenth century it had already ceased to be a necessary human state, and only the absence of any collective intelligence and an imagined need for tough and unintelligent soldiers and for a prolific class at a low level, prevented its systematic replacement at that time....|$|E
