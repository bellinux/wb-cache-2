50|$|Before freezing, sperm may be {{prepared}} (washed or left unwashed) {{so that it}} can be used for <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI), intrauterine insemination (IUI) or for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or assisted reproduction technologies (ART).|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{insemination}} may employ assisted reproductive technology, {{sperm donation}} and animal husbandry techniques. Artificial insemination techniques available include <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> and intrauterine insemination. The beneficiaries of artificial insemination {{are women who}} desire {{to give birth to}} their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship, single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility. <b>Intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI) is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reproductive performance in swine using two artificial insemination techniques. Were used 60 animals overall, the breed was DB 90 (DanBred) the average of the age was 22 months than weight 210 kg. The experimental delimitation was divided into two groups, which one containing 30 animals, randomly. The first group the animal were inseminated with post-cervical artificial insemination technique, with 1. 5 billons of spermatozoa in 50 ml, and in the second group was executed the <b>intracervical</b> artificial <b>insemination</b> technique, with 3 billons of spermatozoa in 80 ml. The statistic was not parametric analyze (Kruskal-Wallis) and test of de averages by Student-Newman-Keuls (p< 0. 05). The number of return to estrus was 2 in both groups (postcervical artificial <b>insemination</b> vs <b>intracervical</b> artificial <b>insemination),</b> the number of abortions (0 vs 2), the number of farrow (28 vs 26), the farrowing rate (93. 33 % vs 86. 68 %), and the litter size (14. 07 vs 14. 10), respectively. The post-cervical artificial insemination, showed similar results comparing with the <b>intracervical</b> artificial <b>insemination.</b> We conclude that the postcervical technique has several possible advantages for the producer, being possible the reduction of 40 % to 45 % of reproducers on the squad...|$|R
50|$|Collection condoms {{are made}} from {{silicone}} or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as <b>intracervical</b> or intrauterine <b>insemination.</b> Adherents of religions that prohibit contraception, such as Catholicism, may use collection condoms with holes pricked in them.|$|R
50|$|Sperm {{donation}} {{is another}} form of assisted conception. It involves donated sperm being used to fertilise a woman's ova by artificial insemination (either by <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> or intrauterine insemination) and less commonly by invitro fertilization (IVF), but insemination may also be achieved by a donor having sexual intercourse with a woman {{for the purpose of}} achieving conception. This method is known as natural insemination (NI).|$|E
50|$|Sperm may {{be donated}} privately and {{directly}} to the intended recipient, or through a sperm bank or fertility clinic. Sperm donation {{is a form of}} third party reproduction. Pregnancies are usually achieved by using donor sperm in assisted reproductive technology (ART) techniques which include artificial insemination (either by <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home). Less commonly, donor sperm may be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF).|$|E
50|$|Sperm {{banks and}} clinics usually 'wash' the sperm sample to extract sperm {{from the rest}} of the {{material}} in the semen. A cryoprotectant semen extender is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage. One sample can produce 1-20 vials or straws, depending on the quantity of the ejaculate and whether the sample is 'washed' or 'unwashed'. 'Unwashed' samples are used for <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI) treatments, and 'washed' samples are used in intrauterine insemination (IUI) and for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures.|$|E
5000|$|With a straw [...] or a vial {{volume of}} 0.5 milliliter, the general {{guideline}} is that, for <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI), straws or vials making {{a total of}} 20 million motile spermatozoa in total is recommended. This is equal to 8 straws or vials 0.5 ml with MOT5, or 2 straws or vials of MOT20. For intrauterine insemination (IUI), 1-2 MOT5 straws or vials is regarded sufficient. In WHO terms, it is thus recommended to use approximately 20 million grade a+b sperm in ICI, and 2 million grade a+b in IUI.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{artificial}} insemination {{can be used}} when a woman cannot, for any {{of a number of}} reasons, conceive by natural means. The sperm may be provided by either by a sexual partner of her choice or by a sperm donor. Artificial insemination techniques available include <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> and intrauterine insemination. Artificial insemination using donor sperm is most commonly employed by lesbian couples, single women. and heterosexual couples when the male partner is suffering from male infertility. Compared with natural insemination, {{artificial insemination}} may be more invasive, and it may require professional assistance and medical expertise, which will have a higher cost.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI) {{involves}} {{injection of}} unwashed or raw semen into the cervix with a needleless syringe. Sperm supplied by a sperm bank will be frozen {{and must be}} allowed to thaw before insemination. The sealed end of the straw itself must be cut off and the open end of the straw is usually fixed straight on to the tip of the syringe, allowing the contents to be drawn into the syringe. Sperm from more than one straw can generally be used in the same syringe. Where fresh semen is used this {{must be allowed to}} liquefy before inserting it into the syringe, or alternatively, the syringe may be back-loaded.|$|E

One sample will be divided into 1-20 vials or straws depending on the quantity of the ejaculate and whether the sample is washed or unwashed. Following the necessary quarantine period, the samples are thawed and used to inseminate women through artificial insemination or other ART treatments.

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} with donor sperm is {{a widely}} accepted form of treatment for severe male factor infertility. The introduction of quarantined, cryopreserved semen and the associated reduction in cycle fecundity when compared to fresh semen necessitated the development of strategies to improve the performance of frozen sperm. A prospective randomised clinical trail was undertaken in the Reproductive Medicine Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital to compare intrauterine insemination with <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> in a therapeutic donor insemination program with cryopreserved semen. The method of insemination was alternated in successive cycles in each patient after intitial randomised selection. Forty three patients underwent 61 <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> cycles and 48 intrauterine insemination cycles. Strict cycle control was exercised and the timing and frequency of insemination followed a specific protocol. Eighteen clinical pregnancies occurred following eleven intrauterine insemination cycles (22. 9 % per cycle) and seven <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> cycles (11. 5 % per cycle). Treatment outcome was influenced by patient age, {{the severity of the}} male factor and endometriosis. Most pregnancies followed insemination with 15 to 25 million motile sperm. Sperm fecundity differed amongst donors. The findings of our study and the current literature suggest that intrauterine insemination improves cycle fecundity in therapeutic donor insemination cycles with frozen donor sperm...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{fertility}} of boars and sows {{during the}} warmer {{period of the}} year significantly reduces the reproductive efficiency of pigs in intensive production. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the application of intrauterine (postcervical) artificial insemination (AI), with twice reduced dose volume (50 mL) and the number of spermatozoa per dose (2 x 109), compared to the classical <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (dose volume 50 mL with 4 x 109 spermatozoa), can increase the fertility of sows inseminated in the warm season of the year. After classical <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination,</b> farrowing rate was significantly (P 0. 05), neither depending on the season, or depending on the number of spermatozoa per dose (78 % and 75 % in warm, or 86 % and 83 % in cold season of the year).

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the potential advantages of transcervical artificial insemination into the caudal portion of the uterus (corpus uteri), compared with conventional sperm-dose deposition into the posterior region of the cervix. Three experiments was carried out to investigate: (1) the influence of insemination-dose volume, (2) sperm number per dose and (3) type of insemination catheter on sows fertility (farrowing rate and litter size). Classic <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> was performed in the total of 50 sows (25 inseminated with 100 ml doses and 25 with 50 ml doses). Intrauterine insemination was performed in the total of 50 sows (25 inseminated with 100 ml doses and 25 with 50 ml doses). Significant greater farrowing rate (88 %) and live born piglet per litter (10, 77 or 11, 86) was found after intrauterine insemination, then after <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (76 or 72 % farrowing rate, and 10, 42 or 9, 89 live born piglets per litter). Classic <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> was performed in the total of 90 sows, with different catheter type. Intrauterine insemination was performed in the total of 90 sows, with 5 x 109, 3, 7 x 109 or 2, 5 x 109 spermatozoa per dose. No significant differences in farrowing rate was found between intracervical and intrauterine insemination (83, 3 to 86, 7 %). Significant greater live born piglet per litter was found after intrauterine insemination with 2, 5 x 109 spermatozoa per dose. Obtained results suggest that intrauterine insemination can be performed by significant reduction of insemination dose volume and sperm number in dose, without decreasing sows fertility. It can result in significant increasing of boar reproductive efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{intensive}} {{pig production}} demands {{an increasing number}} of insemination doses per ejaculate of genetically superior boars. In order to achieve such a result the possibility of producing insemination doses in both reduced volume and spermatozoa count without decreasing the fertility of sows is studied. In this trial we studied the effect of insemination with reduced volumes of semen (50 mL) and varied spermatozoa count (4, 2 or 1 x 109). Insemination was performed by the classical (intracervical) or by the new (intrauterine) techniques and the basic fertility parameters (farrowing % and litter size) were measured. The farrowing value decreased with decreasing spermatozoa numbers after intracervical and intrauterine insemination. However, the farrowing value, regardless of spermatozoa numbers, was significantly higher after intrauterine insemination (83. 3 %, 76. 7 %, 66. 7 %) compared to the classical <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (73. 3 %, 66. 7 % and 50 %). Litters size did not vary significantly depending on the applied insemination procedure or spermatozoa number. These results indicate that application of the new intrauterine insemination procedure enables the use of doses with a smaller volume and spermatozoa number, at the same time obtaining a satisfactory farrowing and litter size. This opens the possibility of obtaining a significantly higher number of doses per ejaculate when compared to the classical <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> procedure. In such a way can be increased significantly the degree of reproductive exploitation of genetically superior boars...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether several clinical variables can affect the pregnancy rate of <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI) using cryopreserved donor spermatozoa. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, age, years of infertility, cervicitis, urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, insemination number, uterus position, endometrial thickness and morphology, maximal follicle diameter, and the number of dominant follicles on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration were retrospectively analyzed in 501 women who underwent their first ICI cycle using cryopreserved donor spermatozoa. Results: Increased age, length of infertility (> 5 years), retroverted uterine position, and endometrial thickness ( 14 mm) were associated with lower rates of pregnancy. Conclusion: In older women with infertile periods longer than five years, especially those with a retroverted uterus, intrauterine insemination (IUI) combined with ovarian stimulation should be recommended. In vitro fertilization with donor spermatozoa (IVFD) should be offered earlier to achieve a much higher success rate...|$|E
40|$|Data were {{analysed}} from 710 {{couples who}} had been assessed to determine the effectiveness and the drawbacks of three different methods of insemination using frozen donor semen. <b>Intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI) was the first method used when the women had no tubal disorder: 255 pregnancies were achieved {{in a total of}} 2558 cycles (10 %). Intrauterine insemination (IUI) associated with ovarian stimulation resulted in 152 pregnancies over 966 cycles (16 %). In-vitro fertilization (IVF) was proposed after- 12 insemination failures using either of the other methods or when the initial gynaecological examination had revealed abnormalities such as tubal occlusions; 48 pregnancies were obtained in 262 cycles (18. 3 %). The pregnancy rate using ICI was significantly higher when two inseminations were performed per cycle, compared with one insemination per cycle (12. 3 versus 7 %, P 8 X 1 O 6. No relationship was found between the number of motile spermatozoa and the pregnancy rate using IUI and IVF. The incidence of primary ovulatory disorder was higher among women whose husbands were oligozoospermic than among those whose husbands were azoospermic (19 versus 9 %, P < 0. 01), but ovarian stimula-tion improved the fecundity of subfertile women. The outcome of pregnancies was also analysed for the three methods.

40|$|At present, it {{is unclear}} which {{treatment}} strategy is best for couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility. We hypothesized that the prognostic profile influences the effectiveness of assisted conception. We addressed this issue by analysing individual patient data (IPD) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We performed an IPD analysis of published RCTs on treatment strategies for subfertile couples. Eligible studies were identified from Cochrane systematic reviews and we also searched Medline and EMBASE. The authors of RCTs that compared expectant management (EM), <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> (ICI), intrauterine insemination (IUI), all three with or without controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and IVF in couples with unexplained or male subfertility, and had reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy as an outcome measure, were invited to share their data. For each individual patient the chance of natural conception was calculated with a validated prognostic model. We constructed prognosis-by-treatment curves and tested {{whether there was a}} significant interaction between treatment and prognosis. We acquired data from 8 RCTs, including 2550 couples. In three studies (n = 954) the more invasive treatment strategies tended to be less effective in couples with a high chance of natural conception but this difference did not reach statistical significance (P-value for interaction between prognosis and treatment outcome were 0. 71, 0. 31 and 0. 19). In one study (n = 932 couples) the strategies with COS (ICI and IUI) led to higher pregnancy rates than unstimulated strategies (ICI 8 % versus 15 %, IUI 13 % versus 22 %), regardless of prognosis (P-value for interaction in all comparisons > 0. 5), but at the expense of a high twin rate in the COS strategies (ICI 6 % versus 23 % and IUI 3 % versus 30 %, respectively). In two studies (n = 373 couples), the more invasive treatment strategies tended to be more effective in couples with a good prognosis but this difference did not reach statistical significance (P-value for interaction: 0. 38 and 0. 68). In one study (n = 253 couples) the differential effect of prognosis on treatment effect was limited (P-value for interaction 0. 52), perhaps because prognosis was incorporated in the inclusion criteria. The only study that compared EM with IVF included 38 couples, too small for a precise estimate. In this IPD analysis of couples with unexplained or male subfertility, we did not find a large differential effect of prognosis on the effectiveness of fertility treatment with IUI, COS or IV...|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} in sheep {{is currently}} {{limited by the}} poor fertility obtained following the traditional methods of insemination (vaginal artificial insemination, cervical artificial insemination and transcervical artificial insemination). The reduced fertility after artificial insemination can {{be due to the}} difficulty of traversing the cervix and the cervical trauma caused by the instruments designed for artificial insemination. The objective {{of the present study was}} to test the competence of intrauterine artificial insemination in Sudanese Desert sheep via surgical interference. In the first part of this study, it was important to select only one ram to be used for conducting the artificial insemination and natural mating to eliminate the ram effect as a source of variation on fertility. Three Hamari rams of an average age, body weight, and body condition score (B. C. S.), 24 months, 52. 5 kg and 4 respectively, were selected. The 3 rams were trained for semen collection by the mean of artificial vagina. They were subjected to semen collection 3 times/week for 10 weeks. The semen samples were evaluated and analysed for quality by standard laboratory procedures and the effect of time lapse after collection on semen quality was also assessed. The results showed that no significant difference (p> 0. 05) appeared for the ejaculate volume for the 3 rams. Ram no. 2191 was significantly better (p< 0. 001) than the other tested rams in terms of mass motility, individual motility, percentage of the motile spermatozoa and the percentage of live normal spermatozoa. Both ram no. 2191 and ram no. 2193 had significantly higher (p< 0. 001) sperm concentration per ml, total number of sperms and the number of the straws obtained, as compared to ram no. 2190. The results of time lapse after collection on semen quality revealed that ram no. 2191 maintained good semen quality up to one hour. Accordingly, ram no. 2191 was chosen for the purpose of this study. In the second part of this study, Hamari ewes (n = 30), of average 27 months of age, average body weight of 30 kg and body condition score of 3, were used. They were randomly allocated into 3 groups to conduct intrauterine artificial insemination (IUAI), intracervical artificial insemination (ICAI) and control group for natural mating (NM). Oestrous was induced and synchronized in all ewes using progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG). The ewes were fitted with controlled internal drug release device (CIDR), which contains 0. 3 g progesterone, for 12 days. At the time of CIDR withdrawal, ewes received 300 IU of PMSG intramuscularly. Artificial insemination (IUAI & ICAI) was performed using 0. 25 x 109 freshly diluted spermatozoa with skimmed powder milk. Intrauterine artificial insemination was conducted 50 - 54 hours post progesterone and PMSG treatment, while the <b>intracervical</b> <b>insemination</b> was conducted at heat detection after progesterone and PMSG treatment. Ewes those assigned for natural mating were left with the ram just after the hormonal treatment. Most of the ovulatory follicles of ewes undergone surgery were found in the right ovary (80 %) with a diameter ranging between 0. 5 to 0. 8 cm. The conception rate as detected by the non-return rate and confirmed by progesterone assay was significantly higher (p< 0. 001) for ewes undergone intrauterine insemination (100 %) and natural mating (100 %) compared to cervical insemination (60 %). In contrast, the lambing rate of the ewes undergone surgical intrauterine insemination was significantly lower (p< 0. 001) as compared to those received cervical insemination or undergone natural mating. There was a significant difference in the twining rate for ICAI and NM (66. 7 % and 16. 7 %, respectively), where no twins were born from the ewes assigned for the intrauterine artificial insemination. There was no significant difference for the litter size and the gestation length between all types of insemination. In conclusion, the present results indicate that the intrauterine artificial insemination was an efficient method in ewes to achieve high conception rates; however, a suitable non-invasive mean is to be invented...|$|E
