Halyomorpha halys is a potential pest of many specialty crops in the Willamette Valley, including hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.). The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) characterize the damage resulting from feeding of H. halys adults on developing <b>hazelnut</b> <b>kernels,</b> 2) determine how the timing of feeding during kernel development influences damage to kernels, and 3) determine if the hazelnut shell thickness had an effect on feeding frequency or resulting damage to the kernels. In field trials conducted in 2012 and 2013, adult male H. halys were allowed to feed on developing nuts for one-week periods from initial nut development until harvest. Developing nuts not exposed to H. halys feeding served as a control treatment. Data were analyzed using an Exact Binomial Test. Damage symptoms corresponded with the <b>hazelnut</b> <b>kernels</b> ’ physiological development periods, and were similar to symptoms of stink bug feeding on tree nuts in past studies. Results demonstrated that when stink bugs fed on hazelnuts before kernel expansion, development of the kernels could cease and the result is an empty shell (P< 0. 001).

Two hundred and sixteen brown egg layers raised in contiguous wire cages were used. The duration of the experi-ment was 24 wk consisting of six periods of 4 wk. In the trial, six diets containing different levels of HKOM replacing 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % of SBM protein, respectively, were utilized as the treatments. Differences among the diets in terms of egg yield, feed consumption, feed efficiency ratio, egg weight, egg yolk and albumen ratios, shell thickness, shell weight, and Roche color values of the yolk were not statistically significant (P>. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the variability in kernel composition within the canopy of <b>hazelnut</b> trees. RESULTS: <b>Kernel</b> fresh and dry weight increased linearly with fruit height above the ground. Fat content decreased, while protein and ash content increased, from the bottom to the top layers of the canopy. The level of unsaturation of fatty acids decreased from the bottom {{to the top of the}} canopy. Thus, the kernels located in the bottom layers of the canopy appear to be more interesting from a nutritional point of view, but their lipids may be more exposed to oxidation. The content of different phytosterols increased progressively from bottom to top canopy layers. CONCLUSION: Most of these effects correlated with the pattern in light distribution inside the canopy. The results of this study indicate that fruit position within the canopy is an important factor in determining <b>hazelnut</b> <b>kernel</b> growth and composition...|$|R

Thus, in this study, the feasibility of High Dynamic Range (HDR) hyperspectral imaging for <b>hazelnut</b> <b>kernel</b> sorting (cv. Tonda Gentile Romana) of four quality classes (‘Class Extra’, ‘Class I’, ‘Class II’ and ‘Waste’) has been investigated. Two different exposure times (5 and 8 ms) were selected for experiments, and the respective spectra were combined to obtain a high dynamic range over the full spectral range. The illumination setup was also optimized to improve the intensity and uniformity of the light along the field of view of the camera. PLS-DA was used to classify the pixels based on their spectra and the spectral pre-treatment was optimized through an iterative routine. The performance of each PLS-DA model was defined based on its sensitivity, selectivity, α-error, β-error and accuracy rates. All of the selected models provided a very-good (> 90 %) or good (> 80 %) sensitivity and selectivity for the predefined classes. Misclassified kernels were primarily assigned to the low-quality classes (i. e. ‘Class II’ and Waste). Moreover, the spatial domain was used to evaluate the feasibility of distinguishing hazelnut classes {{on the basis of their}} size and shape. It was found that hazelnut dimensions can be used to improve the accuracy of the classification of the kernels.

40|$|Hazelnuts with {{damaged or}} cracked shells {{are more prone}} to {{infection}} with aflatoxin producing molds (Aspergillus Flavus). These molds can cause cancer. In this study, we introduce a new approach that separates damaged/cracked <b>hazelnut</b> <b>kernels</b> from good ones by using time-frequency features obtained from impact acoustic signals in an offline step. The proposed technique requires no prior knowledge of the relevant time and frequency locations. It adaptively segments impact signals from a training data set in time using local cosine packet analysis and a Kullback-Leibler criterion to assess the discrimination power of different segmentations. In each resulting time segment, the signal is further decomposed into sub-bands using an undecimated wavelet transform. The most discriminative sub-bands are selected according to the Euclidean distance between the cumulative probability distributions of the corresponding sub band coefficients. The most discriminative sub bands are fed into a linear discriminant analysis classifier. In the online classification step, the algorithm simply computes the learned features from the observed signal and feeds them to the LDA classifier. This allows the system to process 71 nuts/sec. The algorithm achieved a classification accuracy of 96. 7 % with the 24 most discriminative features, a higher rate than those provided with prior methods...|$|E

Principal {{aim of this}} work was to characterise the total antioxidant activity of phenolic extracts obtained from roasted “Nocciola Piemonte PGI” hazelnuts skin. Different extraction solvents (methanol, acidified methanol, ethanol, acidified ethanol, and acetone/water) and different protocols (cold solvent-assisted extraction and semi-automated Soxhlet extraction) were employed. The influence of different roasting degree (180 °C/ 10 min and 180 °C/ 20 min) was also investigated. DPPHradical dot and ABTSradical dot+ radical-scavenging methods, ferrous ions chelation activity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation investigated in this study demonstrated significant antioxidant properties for hazelnut skin phenolics. The main mechanism involved appeared the antiradical activity, strictly related to the total phenolic content (r = − 0. 8798 and − 0. 8285 for DPPHradical dot and ABTSradical dot+ assays, respectively). The acidification of extraction solvents led to a significant decrease of antiradical activity, whilst the different roasting conditions significantly influenced the chelation activity and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, showing higher effectiveness for high-roasted hazelnut skin extracts. Conversely, the direct measure of the antioxidant capacity of defatted hazelnut skins revealed higher ABTSradical dot+ scavenging properties for medium-roasted sample. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 28, 2016 - June 28, 2018 Multiple outbreaks of foodborne illness (Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7) {{have been associated with}} tree nuts and tree nut products since the early 2000 s. In response to these outbreaks and many others in fresh produce and peanut butter, Congress created and passed the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) to require a preventive, rather than a reactive, approach to improve food safety from production to consumer purchase. One outcome of FSMA, the Preventive Controls Rule, requires processors to implement strategies to reduce microbiological contamination. The most prudent approach for a processor is the implementation of a validated process proven to achieve a desired level of decontamination. Fumigation of tree nuts with propylene oxide (PPO) is a potential process {{that could be used to}} reduce contamination of Salmonella spp. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of PPO at reducing Salmonella spp. on raw <b>hazelnuts</b> (in-shell and <b>kernels)</b> in commercial processing facilities. Two commercial-scale trials were conducted to determine the efficacy PPO at two different concentrations: 0. 65 and 1. 00 kg/m³. In-shell <b>hazelnuts</b> and <b>kernels</b> were inoculated with a cocktail of five Salmonella strains previously associated with tree nuts or Enterococcus faecium ATCC 3459. Inoculated samples (25 - 50 g) were strategically placed within commercial packaging containing bulk hazelnuts and transported to commercial PPO facilities for fumigation and off-gassing (5 days). Samples were transported to the laboratory and analyzed for Salmonella survivors using standard serial dilution and spread plating techniques on Hektoen Enteric (HEK) with incubation at 37 °C for 24 - 48 hrs. Samples with low levels of survivors were analyzed using a most probable number (MPN) technique. Salmonella spp. concentrations in travel controls were compared to surviving concentrations in PPO and PPO+off-gassing samples to determine efficacy of treatments. A PPO treatment of 0. 65 kg/m³ with off-gassing achieved average reductions of 3. 67 and 4. 83 log CFU/g for <b>kernel</b> and in-shell <b>hazelnuts,</b> respectively. Increasing the PPO concentration to 1. 00 kg/m³ increased the average reductions of Salmonella spp. to 5. 66 and 6. 51 log CFU/g, respectively. PPO processing variables other than PPO concentration that impact PPO efficacy were discovered. Results in the second study indicated potential development of gas layers (PPO and air/nitrogen) in the chamber that likely contributed to variability in Salmonella spp. survivors due to three-dimensional location. The degree of chamber fill may also impact the efficacy of PPO. PPO has the potential to be a viable solution for the hazelnut industry, however, additional commercial-scale processing variables (gas dispersion, chamber fill, nut type and form, packaging) need to be further examined to establish consistent and effective PPO processes...|$|R

In the study the internal nuts to 140 °C for 30 min at thermal pre-treatment;  active constant wave, 30 % pulse, 60 % pulse and 90 % pulsed of ultrasound at 30 % amplitude was applied for 30 min and 60 min pretreatment.   Considering studies in the literature, a preliminary study was made to determine the heat treatment temperature. Temperature and time values of preliminary study were as follows: 130 °C- 30 minutes, 130 °C- 50 minutes, 140 °C- 30 minutes and 150 °C- 30 minutes. According to the results of the free fatty acid value in hazelnut oils which were obtained after preliminary thermal pretreatments, as a result was decided to apply the thermal pretreatment at 140 °C for 30 minutes. In subsequent studies, condition of thermal pretreatment was applied at 140 °C for 30 minutes and comparisons between thermal pretreatment and ultrasound pretreatment were analysed according to this condition. Ultrasonic application was carried out constant 30 % of the total power, at 20 kHz frequency probe systems with Bandelin Sonopuls brand HD 2200 model (Berlin, Germany). In these experiments, 200 ml of 96 % ethanol was added onto 100 grams hazelnuts placed into 500 ml polycarbonate a beaker. Application was made at 30 % power setting of the device, at 0, 3, 6 and 9 cycle (constant, 30 %, 60 %, 90 % pulse) settings of device for 30 minutes and 60 minutes. Grinded hazelnuts (50 g) were placed in the device (Fred S. Carver Inc. hydraulic pres, USA) and were pressed with 9071. 85 kg (20000 lbs) clamping force for 20 min. At the end of the pressing application, the remaining press cakes were weighed and the amounts of remaining oil in the press cakes were calculated by the Soxhelet method. Amount of obtained oil by pressing and yield was calculated according to mass balance of entering and outgoing the compression the seeds and oil amount. Some features of cold pressed oils from the hazelnuts which was applied thermal and ultrasonic pretreatment were compared hazelnut oil which was obtained no pre-processing hazelnut. Hazelnuts analyzed for the characterization of moisture, ash, fat, protein, and refractive index; free fatty acid (%), total phenolic compounds (mg GA/kg), antioxidant activity (%) of hazelnut oils and fatty acid composition of selected oils were researched. Also, after pre-processing, the oil yield of pressing the hazelnuts and the amount of total fat (%) were analysed. The significance of differences among means were determined at p 0. 05).   There were no differences between the results of pres yields. The efficiency of the press is not different press operations performed is homogeneous for all transactions Free fatty acid levels was found in the best ultrasound procedure. Low free fatty acid values, respectively 30 % pulsed, 60 min (0, 62) and active constant wave, 30 min (0, 66) processes possessed. While the free fatty acid values of heat treatment sample was % 1. 12, free fatty acid values of control sample was % 1, 04. Numbered 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 of processes respectively 0. 66; 0. 77; 0. 72; 0. 62 and 0. 78 with values were observed to significant differences from control  The phenolic content of which was found different from the control group in terms of gallik acid equivalent was the 5 (constant, 60 min) and 7 (60 %, 60 min) prosesses. The values of this process were respectively 37, 6 mg/kg and 34, 1 mg GAE/kg which were higher than control group (17, 0 mg GAE/kg). The highest GAE value of prosseses was 5 (constant, 60 min) proses which was a process of ultrasound. Antioxidant activity was decreased by heat treatment compared to antioksidant activity of control. However, this is insignificant in terms of statistics (p> 0, 05).  Both antioxidant activity of heat treatment and antioxidant activity of ultrasound procedures were not very different in terms of statistics (p> 0, 05). Antioksidant activity of oil was obtained by ultrasound-assisted treatment values 5. (constant, 60 min) process (78, 8) and 6.

40|$|Properties {{of populations}} of {{hazelnut}} C. avelana L. and Turkish hazelnut C. colurna L. in {{different regions of}} Serbia were studied over 1998 - 2005. Round-fruit selections suitable for candy industry were concurrently singled out. Populations of hazelnut and Turkish hazelnut are characterized by small or medium large fruits with round shape index and kernel index ranging from 0. 77 - 0. 89 and 0. 78 - 0. 84 respectively. Singled out selections of hazelnut and Turkish hazelnut have averagely medium large fruits and kernel. Round shape index of fruits and <b>kernel</b> of <b>hazelnut</b> amount to 0. 98 (1. 01 - 0. 91) and 0. 99 (1. 00 - 0. 96) respectively, whereas the same parameter in Turkish hazelnut amounts to 0. 99 (0. 99 - 0. 97) and 0. 98 (0. 98 - 0. 97). Average fruit weight of the singled out selections is 1. 79 g (hazelnut) and 1. 74 g (Turkish <b>hazelnut).</b> Average <b>kernel</b> mass is 0. 75 - 0. 70 g. i. e. <b>kernel</b> ratio in <b>hazelnut</b> and Turkish hazelnut amounts to 41 % and 40. 2 % respectively. The mineral matter content in the kernel of the selections amounted to 2. 4 % and 2. 3 % respectively. Raw proteins content ranged from 13. 8 % - 12. 4 % respectively, and oil content ranged from 47. 7 - 50. 2 % respectively. The majority of indicators under in situ conditions suggest that all selections singled out from the population deserve attention with objective of more intensified propagation and wider introduction into commercial production. It particularly refers to the round shaped kernel {{which is the most}} suitable for the candy industry. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, {{techniques}} traditionally used in Material Science, as the image- based analysis and the NIR spectroscopy, coupled to multivariate data analysis, were investigated {{in order to}} develop innovative approaches to evaluate quality parameters in agro-food products and for food process monitoring. The application of innovative approaches aims to overcome some of the disadvantages of the reference analysis, such as the time needed to prepare the samples, to carry out the analysis and to achieve the results, the specialized skills required to the operator, the invasive nature and the lack of environmental sustainability, since often solvents have to be used. Moreover, the reference analytical methods are not suitable for real-time applications and do not allow a prompt intervention of the automatic control in the case of out-of-range parameters. This thesis work is presented in four main parts. The first part (Chapter 1) gives an overview of the agro-food industry value, emphasizing the crucial role of the Material Science to improve the current analytical controls along the entire food supply chain and to develop new technologies. Furthermore, this part provides the conceptual elements, basics of control theory and some examples of the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) application in the agro-food industry. The second part (Chapters from 2 to 4) describes the fundamentals of the instrumental techniques explored in this thesis, while the third part (Chapter 5) presents the chemometric methods applied for data processing. The fourth part is the experimental section and includes three practical case studies, which make up the core of the thesis. The first case study (Chapter 6) focuses on developing an automatized method for hazelnut quality sorting, based on imaging techniques (RGB and multispectral) and the multivariate image analysis (MIA). The presented setup is an off-line method able to detect more than 90 % of ‘moldy' hazelnuts (defect type 1), while the discrimination between sound and ‘pest-affected' (defect type 2) hazelnuts was performed correctly at an 80 % degree. Enhanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques will be considered in future to detect hazelnut defects directly on the entire <b>hazelnut</b> <b>kernel.</b> In the second case study (Chapter 7), lab-scale drying tests were performed on in-shell hazelnuts in order to define a model of general applicability for hazelnut drying, since different cultivars and drying air parameters (Temperature and Relative Humidity) were considered. The hazelnut moisture content at the equilibrium (Me) and the drying rate (k) were calculated for each drying test by modelling the experimental data with a 2 nd order kinetics. Subsequently, the contribution of the drying air parameters and the cultivar on affecting Me and k was evaluated by means of the ANOVA and the MLR analysis. In the third case study (Chapter 8), NIR spectroscopy associated with chemometrics was investigated as a fast and non-invasive method to predict the Arabica/Robusta ratio and the colour of ground roasted coffee blends. The PLS 2 algorithm was applied to elaborate a model for the simultaneous determination of these two coffee parameters. A good predictive ability was achieved, with errors equal to 1. 28 A. U. and 4. 34 % w/w for the roasting degree and for the Arabica content, respectively. The final two chapters (9 and 10) summarize the results and perspectives of the research work, highlighting that all the approaches developed and discussed show the potential to be applied for real time determination of food quality parameters and process control at the industrial scale, according to the PAT guidelines. Overall, this thesis has shown that the combination of disciplines such as imaging, spectroscopy and chemometrics can provide practical insights and control possibilities that reference analytical methodologies cannot offer, and this can be also extended to the industrial process as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The quality {{is the main}} factor that {{directly}} affects the price for many agricultural produces. The quality depends on different properties of the produce. Most important property is associated with health of consumers. Other properties mostly depend {{on the type of}} concerned vegetable. For instance, emptiness is important for hazelnuts while openness is crucial for the pistachio nuts. Therefore, the agricultural produces should be separated according to their quality to maintain the consumers health and increase the price of the produce in international trades. Current approaches are mostly based on invasive chemical analysis of some selected food items or sorting food items according to their color. Although chemical analysis gives the most accurate results, it is impossible to analyze large quantities of food items. The impact sound signal processing can be used to classify these produces according to their quality. These methods are inexpensive, noninvasive and most of all they can be applied in real-time to process large amount of food. Several signal processing methods for extracting impact sound features are proposed to classify the produces according to their quality. These methods are including time and frequency domain methods. Several time and frequency domain methods including Weibull parameters, maximum points and variances in time windows, DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) coefficients around the maximum spectral points etc. are used to extract the features from the impact sound. In this study, we used <b>hazelnut</b> and wheat <b>kernel</b> impact sounds. The success rate over 90...|$|R
