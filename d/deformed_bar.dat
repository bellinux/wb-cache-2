50|$|Bangladesh Steel {{industry}} {{is emerging as}} one of the major industrial sectors of the country. It consists of small up to the largest scale of steel melting and re-rolling factories across the country that mostly produce <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> rod of different grade (40, 60, 500), angel, channel and coil for the construction industry. Though the history of Steel Industry is not older one but it can make a glorious future.Before 1971 Bangladesh did not have any steel mill and even after the liberation {{there were only a few}} steel factories in the country. In 1990s the actual development began in this sector through a revolution. During that period the building constructing agencies or developer companies came forward to build modern infrastructure. Then with the increasing demand, new investors started investing in steel or rod production.In 2012 we have almost 400 mills across the country including Dhaka, Chittagong. Although most of them are manual steel plants, 30 mills among them are automated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cold-rolled <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> with wing is a {{new type}} of {{cold-rolled}} <b>deformed</b> <b>bar,</b> it has high tensile strength and better ductility than the general cold-rolled deformed bars, and has good bonding properties with concrete. Five types of totally 15 full-scale specimens were tested to investigate the mechanical behavior, failure mode and the suitable value of minimum reinforcement ratio of concrete slab with cold-rolled <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> with wing. Experimental parameters include the reinforcement ratio, concrete strength, and reinforcement diameter. The deflection of mid-span, the strain of cold-rolled <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> and the crack width measured under each load level were studied. The test shows that the specimens with the reinforcement ratio of 0. 15 % present ductile failure, while those with the reinforcement ratio of 0. 12 % present brittle failure. Based on the results of the experiment, this paper suggests that the value of minimum reinforcement ratio of concrete slabs with cold-rolled <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> with wing could be 0. 15 %...|$|E

In this paper, beams with different proportions of steel fibre and different bar types are tested. Three sets of steel fibre reinforced concrete beams are made with 0 %, 1 %, and 2 % steel fibres by volume. All beams are singly reinforced with three different <b>bar</b> types; <b>deformed</b> <b>bars,</b> plain round <b>bars,</b> and <b>deformed</b> <b>bars</b> unbonded in the central one-third length. All beams are designed for flexure failure, and two equal point loads are applied symmetrically to generate a constant moment region in the central span between the point loads. Test results show that beams containing steel fibres have higher yield load, possess better post-yield load carrying capacity, and are more ductile than the beams made of plain concrete. Although beams with <b>deformed</b> <b>bars</b> possess higher post-yield load carrying capacity and are more ductile than beams with round and unbonded bars, this difference diminishes {{with the addition of}} fibres...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the presence of}} chlorides, CO 2 and moisture oxygen is also essential for the formation of corrosion products through reaction of free Fe 2 + in anodic region with the hydroxyl ions (OH–) in cathodic region. Therefore oxygen permeability of cracked concrete will also be useful to control the corrosion of steel in concrete as dense uncracked concrete cover generally reduced the availability of oxygen on steel surface (Mohammed et al. 2003) and a slower cathodic reaction is expected for the regions with low oxygen availability. In a limited number of studies the oxygen permeability of cracked concrete and cementitious composites is evaluated. Mohammed et al. (2001 a, b) studied the oxygen permeability of cracked concrete beams containing plain steel bar and deformed steel bar. Both beams were subjected to same load to create flexural cracks on the tension side of the beams. Results show higher oxygen permeability in the cracked beam reinforced with <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> than its counterpart plain bar reinforced cracked beam. Bigger width of cracks in the cracked beam reinforced with <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> than those of plain bar RC beam is the reason for higher oxygen permeability observed in that study. The ribs in the <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> is the reason for bigger crack width in the former beam than the latter beam. In another study, Mohammed et al. (2002) reported significantly higher oxygen permeability of concrete made by higher w/c ratio than the lower w/c ratio for the same crack width of 0.3  mm. Uncracked region showed significantly lower oxygen permeability than the cracked region irrespective of w/c.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of typical connections commonly used in precast concrete buildings subjected to reversed cyclic loads is presented, along with an analytical study of nonlinear behaviour of these specimens subjected to monotonically increasing loads until failure. Five different connection specimens were constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading to determine their seismic responses. The specimens represent a series of horizontal connections between double-tee flanges or between a double-tee flange and lateral load resisting element in a typical roof of a precast concrete structure. The analytical study consisted of two parts: linear finite element analysis of the connection to determine the test specimen geometry and to define its boundary conditions, and non-linear finite element analysis, using the NONLACS program, to predict the complete responses of the connections subjected to monotonically increasing loads. The experimental results were compared with the predictions made using theoretical calculations, the CPCI design method and non-linear finite element analysis. It is noted that the CPCI design method gives conservative predictions for the ultimate strength of the connection reinforced with a bent <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> anchor and a 90 $ sp circ$ hook, and the one with two deformed bars oriented at 45 $ sp circ$ and headed studs, both welded to a steel plate. The predicted ultimate strength of the connection with a bent <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> anchor welded to a steel plate and one with two straight <b>deformed</b> <b>bar,</b> oriented at 90 $ sp circ$ and welded to an embedded steel angle, {{are close to the}} experimental results.

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} of {{the bond}} stress {{as a function of}} the slip of <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> was determined experimentally, under displacement control, using 200 mm concrete cubes with centrally embedded 16 mm <b>deformed</b> <b>bar</b> designed to be in a confined condition. The observed global fluctuation in the bond stress, measured by linear variable differential transformers, was verified by independent measurement of the local strains along the length of the embedded bar using bonded electrical resistance (ER) strain gauges. In the pull-out tests, the failure mode was by shear. The ER strain gauges were installed inside grooves carefully machined in the steel bar to prevent direct friction from the concrete damaging the strain gauges. This approach also prevented damage to the wires and wire/gauge connection during the process of bar slip. The global fluctuation {{of the bond}} stress-slip behaviour was determined graphically and analysed using a number of statistical methods and independently verified from the local strain variation along the bar obtained from the strain gauge readings. Based on these observations, the fluctuation in bond stress with slip under displacement control has been shown to be mainly dependent on the transverse rib pattern of the bar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In this study, loss of concrete-steel bond {{strength}} of lightweight and ordinary concrete under monotonic and cyclic loading is examined for plain and <b>deformed</b> steel <b>bars.</b> Here, lightweight and ordinary concrete-steel {{bond strength}} {{is determined by}} pull-out test {{for a variety of}} specimens in various configurations. For each specimen, a bond strength-slip curve is obtained through monotonic loading. Following this process, an identical specimen is subjected to cyclic loading under similar conditions using the same test setup. These examinations reveal several insights. Lightweight concrete-steel bond strength is greater than the ordinary concrete-steel bond strength for plain steel bars under monotonic loading. Ordinary concrete-steel bond strength is greater than lightweight concrete-steel bond strength under both monotonic and cyclic loading for <b>deformed</b> steel <b>bars.</b> The loss of concrete-steel bond strength is greater in plain <b>bars</b> than in <b>deformed</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the models proposed in the literature for simulating the cyclic behavior of RC elements were developed and calibrated based on data referring to elements with <b>deformed</b> <b>bars.</b> Due to {{the differences in the}} interaction mechanisms at the concrete–steel interface between elements with <b>deformed</b> <b>bars</b> and elements with plain bars, these models may not be adequate for the latter. In this paper, a strategy presented in the literature to include the effects of bar slippage in the analysis of the cyclic behavior of beam–column joints is incorporated in the numerical modeling of a joint specimen with plain bars. The inadequacy of the methodology to simulate the response of the joint specimen is shown and discussed. The analyses also confirm the importance of considering bond–slip towards a more accurate simulation of the cyclic behavior of elements with plain bars...|$|R

In spite of the many test data obtained to date in this field, several aspects of dowel behavior are still open to further investigation, since dowel/cover/stirrup interaction is a manifold problem, especially when the dowel bar pushes against a thin concrete cover.

In order to determine the coefficient, which relates the normal and tangential loads, the method of reflected caustics was used. For the evaluation of this coefficient a single measurement of an appropriate length has to be made on the caustic, which was formed at the contact area of the two materials. This measurement allows the determination of the coefficient and in the case when the normal distribution of the contact load is known, the tangential load distribution can be readily obtained.
