5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's <b>economic</b> <b>woes</b> were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{deterioration}} of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. Goebbels {{took charge of the}} NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's <b>economic</b> <b>woes</b> on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.|$|E

40|$|Concomitant {{with the}} rise of neoliberalism, Booker prize winning novels, since the 1980 s, have {{consistently}} mediated global awareness of national contexts within a globalised economy. This paper will discuss the globalization of literature through the celebrity status of the Booker prize. It focuses, in particular, on the contemporary Irish writer, Anne Enright and her 2007 Booker prize novel, The Gathering. I will argue that the ephemeral nature of the text, expressed through the intimate details of the domestic, the psychological and familial, appear at odds with the contemporary national preoccupation with excessive materialism, consumerism and overspending. Does Ireland’s relationship to global economic conditions reflect national, cultural and social pathologies reflected in its literature? Does globally recognized Irish literature represent an alternative vision of Ireland that resists the vicissitudes of the global economy, even while these images depend on global forces? If Enright’s novel gained international fame just as Ireland teetered on the cusp of economic decline, then I suggest that the novel resists this by recuperating and celebrating the rich legacy of Irish literary culture, and indeed, Irish culture more broadly. The text becomes a site of contradictory images of Ireland, asserting a timelessness that is paradoxically reaffirmed only by the novel’s timely emergence onto an international scene only too conscious of Ireland’s <b>economic</b> <b>woe...</b>|$|R
40|$|Structural {{adjustment}} {{programs of the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) are often blamed for disrupting social rela-tions by forcing austerity on vulnerable people and introducing unpopular liberalization policies. Some suggest that such interventions harm ethnic relations in developing countries because they are insensitive to the tenuous social bargains that often preserve ethnic peace. Moreover, during crises, dominant groups may seek to displace the pain of reform on others, the ethnic division of labour may be affected differentially by reform policies, and ethnic entrepreneurs could use mom-ents of crisis to their advantage. We test the propositions by using unique data measuring the level of ethnic tensions in a country. The results show that IMF interventions reduce conditions of ethnic enmity. These results are robust to fixed effects estimation, endogeneity and selection effects. Moreover, IMF interventions lower ethnic tension in countries that are highly fractionalized, but they are more problematic where larger groups face each other and when larger groups are excluded from state power. These results suggest too that IMF interventions may lead to greater empowerment of excluded groups whomight agitate for change during periods of economic crisis. On balance, IMF interventions, relative to continued <b>economic</b> <b>woe,</b> pacify ethnic relations in crisis-ridden countries. We find no {{evidence to suggest that}} IMF pro-grams increase ethnic tensions, which is good news for poor countries requiring cheap loans and assistance with reforms...|$|R

40|$|Fears that U. S. {{workers are}} {{displaced}} form {{their jobs and}} suffer depressed wages {{as a result of}} increased undocumented immigration are unfounded, according to the available empirical evidence. The comprehensive range of economic studies conducted at the national, regional, metropolitan, and industrial/sectoral level have clearly demonstrated that undocumented immigrants have a negligible impact on the U. S. labor market. The empirical results suggest that the three theoretical models used to explain the labor market relationship between undocumented immigrants and native workers, the “segmentation” and “job ladder” hypotheses are the best depiction of the data. Segmentation theorists believe that native workers remain unaffected by undocumented immigrants because the labor market is sufficiently divided into at least two different types of job markets: more skilled employment and relatively unskilled employment. Job ladder theorists hypothesize that as native workers move on to better occupations, immigrants take the less desirable jobs that native workers have vacated. These two theories rule out the possibility of ob competition between native and undocumented immigrants, as do the empirical results. Cumulatively, the research and theories call out to policy makers, public officials, and the public to re-evaluate the misguided perceptions that target undocumented immigrants as a source of <b>economic</b> <b>woe.</b> Otherwise, Americans may scapegoat undocumented immigrants instead of identifying the crucial structural factors which are critical to the long-term growth of the economy and the prosperity of the United States...|$|R

Along with being a household nuisance, it is a major economic threat to producers of orchard fruits such as apple, peach, and pear; garden vegetables and row crops; and many ornamental species. Since its detection in the northeastern United States a decade ago, the BMSB has been detected in 38 states and has earned the distinction of being classified as the top invasive insect of interest by the U. S Department of Agriculture. With economic losses to the apple industry estimated at $ 37 million in 2010, the bug’s threat to apple growers prompted a Member of Congress to organize a public hearing in western Maryland.

25|$|The Ecuadorian economy, {{like that}} in the mother country, {{suffered}} a severe depression throughout most of the 18th century. Textile production dropped an estimated 50 to 75 percent between 1700 and 1800. Ecuador's cities gradually fell into ruins, and by 1790 the elite was reduced to poverty, selling haciendas and jewelry in order to subsist. The Native Ecuadorian population, in contrast, probably experienced an overall improvement in its situation, as the closing of the obrajes commonly led Native Ecuadorians to work under less arduous conditions on either haciendas or traditional communal lands. Ecuador's <b>economic</b> <b>woes</b> were, no doubt, compounded by the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 by King Charles III of Spain. Missions in the Oriente were abandoned, and many of the best schools and the most efficient haciendas and obrajes lost the key that made them outstanding institutions in colonial Ecuador.|$|E
40|$|The fiscal {{consolidation}} measures adopted in many euro area countries over 2010 - 13 reduced excessive domestic fiscal imbalances, but {{came at the}} cost of short-term output losses. This simultaneous tightening of fiscal policy raised concerns that such output losses might be exacerbated by negative spillovers from other countries. This paper presents some model-based simulations for the euro area with a view to gauge the cross-country impact of the fiscal measures adopted over 2010 - 13. The paper finds that the output effects of the {{fiscal consolidation}} were heterogeneous across countries, reflecting the different amounts and composition of fiscal measures adopted. We find that the trade channel is able to generate sizeable cross-border fiscal spillovers in the euro area. However, once the analysis takes into account the remaining channels (e. g. monetary policy reaction, exchange rate, and risk premium) total spillovers are estimated to be relatively small. In general, when compared to the growth fallout of domestic fiscal policies, negative fiscal spillovers do not seem to have added much to the <b>economic</b> growth <b>woes</b> of vulnerable countries...|$|R

The Titelberg in modern Luxembourg was not only the largest oppidum of the late Iron Age in Gallia Belgica, but the most long-lived, with occupations from La Tène II continuous for centuries, ultimately prospering due to copper and iron ore resources as a mint and industrial center before and after Gallo-Roman contact, until eclipsed by larger centers. During the middle of the first century AD, the mint was razed, not to be rebuilt, and the population dwindled. After an interval of perhaps three hundred years, a new smelting furnace was built into the remains of the Gallo-Roman Minting Foundry; excavation shows this smelter was used to melt down bronze coins and artifacts for reuse or as bullion. The questions arise from this, then: who was doing this and why? In the latter fourth century AD, were Franks moving into the territory and exploiting easy resources, or was this another example of continuity? Was the recycling process due to <b>economic</b> and political <b>woes</b> or was there a deeper reason?

40|$|A. Introduction: Crises {{in and of}} Europe “We seem to {{be caught}} in an ‘impossible interregnum’: After the end of {{classical}} national sovereignty, before the beginning of a postnational sovereignty. ” There is a growing sense of crisis in and of the European Union. Crises in Europe range from the immediate economic crisis of the Eurozone to political and cultural crises associated with the rise of right-wing populism and reaction to the perceived failure of state multi-culturalism. Neither <b>economic</b> nor cultural <b>woes</b> in Europe are restricted to the Eurozone or even to the European Union; they are frequently perceived as elements of broader global crises of democratic capitalism. And yet, however intimately intertwined with domestic and international crises, there is also a specific sense of crisis of the European Union, such that its very survival is perceived to be at stake— unlike its Member States or the international order of states. Because the existential crisis of the EU is not disconnected from the simmering elsewhere, {{it is important to keep}} in view both sets of crises, in and of the European Union, in assessing the Union’s current predicament and future trajectory. The existential threat to the EU is presented here in constitutional terms, with crisis heralding a reconstitution of Europe’s political form. If crisis occurs when the organizational principles of a society are forced to change because they no longer permit “the resolution of problems that are critical for its continued existence,” we can speculate on the kind of constitution that will emerge as the organizational principles of the EU appear no longer fit for purpose. What, in other words, might post-national sovereignty in Europe look like from a constitutional perspective? Why, in particular, does democracy seem to be under such sustained threat in current [...] ...|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel has {{continued}} to encourage an increase of French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew-language courses, sessions which help potential immigrants to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews consider leaving France for Israel where of the 74 percent, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to “preserve their Judaism,” while 12.4 percent said they were attracted by other countries. “Economic considerations” was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community will have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France’s <b>economic</b> <b>woes,</b> especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. During the Hebrew year 5774 (September 2013 - September 2014) for the first time ever, more Jews made Aliyah from France than any other country, with approximately 6,000 French Jews making aliyah, mainly fleeing rampant antisemitism, pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist violence and economic malaise with France becoming the top sending country for aliyah as of late September 2014.|$|E
