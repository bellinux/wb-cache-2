5|$|While {{developing}} Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately <b>departed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street racing theme {{prevalent in}} previous {{films in the}} series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences {{that might otherwise be}} put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Bowen, {{who starred}} as Susan's daughter, Julie, <b>departed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cast, as her {{character}} left for {{college at the}} end of the fourth season.

Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, also left the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May2008 that producers would not make a decision on his character until mid-June and that he was preparing to find work in case his contract was terminated. It was later confirmed that he would return to the series.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at 8:00 the {{following}} day, Revithi ran the marathon course on her own. Before starting, {{she had the}} town's only teacher, the mayor, and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she <b>departed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village. She ran the race at a steady pace and reached Parapigmata (the place where the Evangelismos Hospital stands today, near the Hilton Athens) at 13:30 (5½hours). Revithi {{was not allowed to}} enter Panathinaiko Stadium—her race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens. She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1794, the {{squadron}} was {{under the command of}} Commodore Sir Edward Pellew in the frigate HMS Arethusa, accompanied by HMS Artois under Captain Edmund Nagle, HMS Diamond under Captain Sir Sidney Smith and HMS Galatea under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats. All four ships had specially selected crews and equipment and the squadron formed the elite force of the Channel Fleet's light warships. Pellew led his squadron out of Cawsand Bay on 19 October with the intention of cruising off the entrance to Brest and intercepting shipping entering or leaving the port. The French fleet, its principal squadrons blockaded in Brest, continued to send raiders to sea. One such ship, was the large newly commissioned 40-gun frigate Révolutionnaire under Captain Antoine René Thévenard with a hastily assembled and disaffected crew and a main battery of 18–pounder cannon, which <b>departed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Channel port of Le Havre on 13 October, sailing westwards towards the Atlantic.|$|E

On 7June, I-174 fired four torpedoes at the American Liberty ship John Bartram, all of which missed. She sighted another convoy on 13June, too far away to attack. During this period, she was repeatedly attacked by Allied aircraft and warships, but did not sustain any damage.|$|E

5|$|Instead, Super Mario 64 was {{followed}} by other 3D Mario games on subsequent Nintendo systems, such as Super Mario Sunshine for the GameCube and Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii.
