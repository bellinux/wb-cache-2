50|$|Semi <b>direct</b> <b>democracies</b> {{in which}} representatives {{administer}} day-to-day governance, but the citizens remain the sovereign, allow for three forms of popular action: referendum (plebiscite), initiative, and recall. The first two forms—referendums and initiatives—are examples of direct legislation.|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Gravel became {{director}} of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, where he admired institute co-founder Gregory Fossedal's work on <b>direct</b> <b>democracy</b> in Switzerland. By 2004, Gravel had become chair of the institute, and Fossedal (who in turn was a {{director of}} the Democracy Foundation) gave the introduction at Gravel's presidential announcement.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of <b>direct</b> <b>democracy.</b> Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{proclaimed the}} new {{administration}} a <b>direct</b> <b>democracy,</b> in which Cubans could assemble at demonstrations to express their democratic will. As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites. U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, {{and the absence of}} freedom of speech and press.|$|E

40|$|In public {{discussions of}} policy, {{evidence}} that import-competing sectors earn low or falling incomes {{is often used}} to argue for protection. This paper rationalizes the apparent effectiveness of this argument in both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>democracies.</b> In <b>direct</b> <b>democracies,</b> a small degree of voter altruism leads to protection in the specific factors model when the import-competing sector earns little. Similarly, voter altruism creates an incentive in representative democracies for self-interested parties to present evidence to legislators on the income of import-competing factors. This leads to a theory in which campaign contributions buy access to legislators rather than buy votes. ...|$|R

5|$|Prohibition {{was gaining}} {{currency}} in Alberta: the Conservatives had included {{it in their}} 1913 platform, and it {{was supported by the}} increasingly powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). The government generally opposed the idea, and Cross held up Manitoba as example of its failures. But the government had also (at the UFA's behest) introduced <b>direct</b> <b>democracy</b> measures, one of which allowed citizens to initiate plebiscites. The well-organized temperance movement did so on prohibition, which was endorsed in the ensuing plebiscite; the legislature passed the Prohibition Act in the spring of 1916. As Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for enforcing it.|$|E
5|$|Since the Romans used {{a form of}} <b>direct</b> <b>democracy,</b> citizens, and not elected representatives, voted {{before each}} {{assembly}}. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power {{came in the form}} of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms. His personal 12-point platform prioritized <b>direct</b> <b>democracy,</b> fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms. In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate. His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} deliberative {{democracy}} is a mix between a majority ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative <b>democracies</b> or <b>direct</b> <b>democracies</b> to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage. It is a system which allows for legislators to discuss the issues in a productive manner trying to reach a consensus. If the group cannot reach a consensus then a majority-wins vote must be taken.|$|R

50|$|Deliberative Democracy is {{a reform}} of {{representative}} or <b>direct</b> <b>democracies</b> which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society. Deliberative Democracy {{is a tool}} for making decisions. Deliberative Democracy {{can be traced back}} all the way to Aristotle’s writings. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government, where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the United States Constitution with emphasis on public discussion.|$|R
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, <b>direct</b> <b>democracy</b> through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} <b>direct</b> <b>democracy,</b> two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, {{even if it did}} not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E
25|$|Within modern-day {{representative}} governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' {{initiatives and}} recall elections {{are referred to}} as forms of <b>direct</b> <b>democracy.</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>democracy</b> as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus, and kurdish cantons of Rojava.|$|E
50|$|With some exceptions, many {{countries}} expanded women's voting rights in representative and <b>direct</b> <b>democracies</b> {{across the world}} such as, the US, Canada, Great Britain and most major European countries in 1917-21, as well as India. This influenced many governments and elections by {{increasing the number of}} voters available. Politicians responded by spending more attention on issues of concern to women, especially peace, public health, education, and the status of children. On the whole, women voted much like their menfolk, except they were more interested in peace.|$|R

25|$|Goldsmith advocates greater <b>direct</b> <b>democracy,</b> such as Switzerland's {{model of}} using referendums. Goldsmith {{believes}} that <b>direct</b> <b>democracy</b> would help combat feelings of disenfranchisement among people and increase accountability. He has also argued {{in favour of}} introducing measures so that MPs can be subject to recall referendums midway through their term if a sufficiently large number of their constituents petition for it.|$|E

30|$|Beyond administration, {{the economists}} of {{business}} associations and labour unions are particularly influential in Switzerland. This {{is rooted in}} the fact that these organisations can always convincingly threaten to fight new legislation by organising a referendum. Government therefore has a strong incentive, to listen to the opinion of these interest groups in shaping legislative proposals. This is done informally by consulting them in the preparation of policies and more formally in the very far-reaching consultation process (the so-called Vernehmlassung) before the government sends a proposal to parliament. Compared to countries with no <b>direct</b> <b>democracies,</b> economic advisors, however, tend to play a smaller role in political parties and in think tanks.|$|R
40|$|<b>Direct</b> deliberative <b>democracy</b> {{presents}} a conceptually attractive model of civic governance – particularly relevant at local scale. We outline the 'work' of <b>direct</b> deliberative <b>democracy</b> by considering its underlying principles and objectives, and discuss four fundamental challenges that are commonly proposed: {{the difficulty of}} coordinating direct participation, the expertise required of participants, the often underestimated dynamics of power in direct action, and that deliberation {{is not necessarily the}} sole, ideal mode of participation. At hand of a case study of an online 'community of interest', the paper investigates the potential role of social media to facilitate this work, and to mitigate the challenges cited...|$|R
25|$|According to {{the theory}} of <b>direct</b> <b>democracy,</b> on the other hand, {{citizens}} should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of <b>direct</b> <b>democracy</b> offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} essay we analyse {{the links between}} the {{emergence}} of new arms and forms of war-emergence, the phalanx and its hoplites, and the trieres at sea, its economic base, and the emergence of democracy in classical Greece. We propose that the unique till then in the world phalanx formation, {{led to the development of}} particular values and ethics, which again were the necessary conditions for the emergence of democracy, then again, a unique phenomenon. We then turn to seapower, which according to our analysis was a sufficient condition for the establishment and endurance of democracy, because seapower led to a community of economic interests, on which <b>direct</b> <b>democracies</b> like Ancient Athens, were based. ...|$|R
