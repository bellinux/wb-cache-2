After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D− lines and the aforementioned pull-up resistors hold it in the J (idle) state. Sometimes skew due to hubs can add {{as much as one}} bit time before the SE0 of the end of packet.

25|$|Modern drives make {{extensive}} use of error correction codes (ECCs), particularly Reed–Solomon error correction.

The <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> themselves take up space on the HDD, but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors, resulting in much larger storage capacity. For example, a typical 1TB hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity of about 93GB for the ECC data.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of quickly {{inverting}} the standard representation of a permutation on $n$ elements in place. First, we present a naive algorithm to do it using $O(\log n) $ <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> in $O(n^ 2) $ time in the worst case. We then improve that algorithm, using a small bit vector, to use $O(\sqrt n) $ <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> in $O(n \sqrt n) $ time. Using a different approach, we present an algorithm to do it using $O(\sqrt n \log n) $ <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> in $O(n \log n) $ time. Finally, for our main result, we present a technique that leads to an algorithm to invert the standard representation of a permutation using only $O(\log^ 2 n) $ <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> of space in $O(n \log n) $ time in the worst case...|$|R

500|$|During 1923, after {{returning}} to England, Gilligan had his best season in county cricket. He took 163 wickets at 17.50 and scored 1,183 runs {{at an average of}} 21.12 to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season for the only time in his career. With Maurice Tate, whose emergence as a pace bowler was encouraged by Gilligan, he established a bowling partnership which proved effective over the following two seasons. Gilligan scored two centuries and nine times took five or more wickets in an innings. As a result of his performances, he was named as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that he was now [...] "among the leading amateur cricketers of the day", and was likely to play for England again. It concluded: [...] "It is not claimed for Arthur Gilligan, by even his warmest admirers, that he can be classed among great fast bowlers, but he is a very good one, combining with the right temperament and tireless energy just the <b>extra</b> <b>bit</b> of pace that to many batsmen is so distasteful." ...|$|E

In order to overcome CFO at the receiver, a new OFDM symbol structure based on extending the transmitted symbol by inserting <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> at the front of it before transmission is applied in this paper. The proposed method is capable of correcting {{frequency offset}} in the range of multiples of subcarrier spacing depending on the number of added <b>extra</b> <b>bits.</b> This is performed at the expense of transmitted power and data rate due to the insertion of <b>extra</b> <b>bits.</b> Simulation results indicate the performance improvement over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath fading channels...|$|R

30|$|The second {{method used}} to {{determine}} the rate is called suppressed feedback DVC, where a low complexity estimate of the SI is created at the encoder and used to estimate the rate. If the rate estimate is too low, then decoding failures can lead to significant distortion in the decoded frame. Conversely, if the rate is overestimated, any <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> are wasted. Typically, the rate estimate is good for low motion sequences and poor for high or complex motion sequences. In order to achieve robust performance, <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> may be transmitted to increase the likelihood of successful decoding. However, a finite probability of a decoding failure remains. Increasing the number of <b>extra</b> <b>bits</b> to reduce this probability implies that a larger percentage of transmitted bits will be redundant, yielding reduced rate-distortion (R-D) performance.|$|R
