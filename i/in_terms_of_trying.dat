50|$|With 11 {{wins and}} 13 losses, the Tigers' season {{came to an}} end with them in 10th place out in the 16-team competition. Despite the result, the Tigers {{performed}} well in small areas of the game, which showed <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the team's overall statistics {{at the end of the}} season. The error count was one area where they performed well, being ranked second in the league. They also performed strongly <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>tries,</b> scoring 89; only six teams scored more. They lacked penetration, however, ranking close to the bottom in the league <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> line breaks, tackle busts, off loads and metres gained. Defence was also a problem, with the Tigers conceding 45 points more than they scored. The failure of the club's new signings to perform as expected hurt the Tigers, while injuries to several key players, including Robbie Farah and Lote Tuqiri, compounded their situation. Benji Marshall stood in as captain in Farah's absence, and was the team's top scorer, with 167 points, which was fifth overall in the competition. Aaron Woods, who played all 24 games of the season, was named the club's Player of the Year.|$|R

Even using vanilla POS tags we achieve some efficiency gains, but when using detailed lexical types as supertags we manage to halve parsing time with minimal loss of coverage or precision. ...|$|R

50|$|There are correspondences between certain {{divisions}} {{and the presence}} or absence of medial glides in later dialects, in ways that differ depending on the class of the initial (e.g. velar, labial, retroflex, etc.). There are also clear co-occurrence restrictions between initials and divisions, in that initials from certain of these same classes can occur with finals only from certain divisions. The LMC authors of this system appear to have been aware of these classes of initials, and seem to have determined the separation into divisions partly on the basis of the co-occurrence relationships and partly on the medial glides, although it is debated how the exact classification was made. It is important to remember that the authors of this system were attempting to use LMC phonology to reconstruct EMC phonology (although they probably thought of it more <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to harmonize the way that words were normally pronounced with the rather different system of rhymes and homophones as laid out in the Qieyun).|$|E

He told CNN, [...] "I didn't think one song could encapsulate all of country music, so I pitched the idea of doing a mashup of a couple songs and blending them together."

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on consistency in HRM offering a view that contrasts with the received approach which frames the issue <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> implementation variability, slippages and resistance. Building on {{the result of a}} qualitative study in a large retail chain, we argue that consistency stems from a set of specific practices that we describe as text work, connection work and upkeep work. We suggest in particular that consistency is achieved through a dynamic process between center (HR department) and periphery (business units), in which the center monitors local situations and HRM activities and tries to govern them at a distance through text and talk, only for the periphery to produce further variation {{as the result of the}} attempt to domesticate the messiness of local situations. We argue that reframing the issue <b>of</b> consistency <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> practices which <b>try</b> to give regularity and consistency to what is inherently heterogeneous and local –rather than the more or less accurate implementation of an ideal design– has profound implications both for practice and future research...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the similarities and differences in learning styles between English medium and Bengali medium learners. This study attempted to find whether the learning styles of Bengali medium and English medium students’ are same or different. To find the similarities and differences the researcher did surveys in English medium and Bengali medium schools. It has analyzed the surveys or the answers or responds of questionnaires by using bar charts and following quantitative method. This research also provided the recommendation which can help teachers <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> different learning styles in their teaching, so that students can discover and be introduced with different learning styles.

40|$|First paragraph: In {{her very}} generous review {{of my book}} Beyond Learning, Megan Laverty raises some important, {{and in a sense}} {{fundamental}} points about the ideas put forward in the book. I find Laverty's review generous because, in hindsight, I feel that I could have knitted together the ideas presented in the book more tightly than I have managed to do. Having said this, the relatively loose fabric of the book may well provide readers with opportunities to pursue their own threads which, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> what I <b>try</b> to argue for in the book [...] that educators are not there to tell others what to think, what to do, or what to be, but rather to evoke responses [...] is, perhaps, not entirely a bad thing.

40|$|In a {{computer}} network, clients work with different applications; hence there are requirement of speed, bandwidth, delay etc. The parameters are called as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. QoS guarantees the {{performance in a}} network. To meet the growing demand of Optical Virtual Private Network (OVPN), the Internet Service Providers (ISP) should use multiple techniques which ensure the Quality of Service. For performing data communication between nodes in a network the path to be followed should be known. In this project, BGP/OBGP protocols have been discussed and using this protocol, paths have been found between routers. Then the optimal path is found out based on the path attributes.

Hence, the paper is of an argument that the Qur’anic concept of education is ethical; it imposes ethical values upon human being. But the aspect of ethics that the paper will be speaking is that which has to do with ethics in social interaction. The paper will look at some key terms that the Qur’an uses to infer to this social interaction which include qaulan sadida, qaulan ma’rufa, qaulan baligha, qaulan masysura, qaulan karima, and qaulan layyina. To offer a better explanation of what social interaction is all about, the paper will address and invoke some social setting in which people interact one another. In other words, the argument of the paper will be invalidated by the social facts found on the ground. This study is thus both normative and empirical...|$|R
