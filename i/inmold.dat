40|$|Abstract ─ This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the effect of weight percentage variation and size variation of MgFeSi added, gating system design and reaction chamber design on <b>inmold</b> process. By using <b>inmold</b> process, well-known problem of fading is avoided because the liquid iron reacts with magnesium in the mold and not, as usual, in the ladle. During the pouring operation, liquid metal passes through the chamber containing the magnesium, where the reaction of the metal with magnesium proceeds in the absence of atmospheric oxygen [1]. In this paper, the results of microstructural characteristic of ductile iron on this parameters are mentioned. The mechanisms of the <b>inmold</b> process are also described [2]. The data obtained from this research will assist in producing the vehicle parts and other machinery parts for different industrial zones and government industries and in transferring the technology to all industrial zones in Myanmar. Therefore, the <b>inmold</b> technology offers many advantages over traditional treatment methods both from a technical and environmental, as well as an economical point of view. The main objective of this research is to produce ductile iron castings in all industrial sectors in Myanmar more easily with lower costs. It will also assist the sharing of knowledge and experience related to the ductile iron production...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the microstructure and selected properties of ausferritic {{nodular cast iron}} annealed at the temperature 520 and 550 °C. This choice was dictated by the temperatures used {{in the practice of}} nitriding. Nodular graphite in cast iron was obtained with use of <b>Inmold</b> process. Cast iron containing molybdenum and copper ensuring obtaining an ausferrite in the cast iron matrix without the use of heat treatment of castings was tested. The effect of annealing temperature on the microstructure and the kind of fracture of the ausferritic nodular cast iron was presented. The effect of an annealing temperature on hardness, impact strength and the microhardness of ausferritic nodular cast iron matrix was shown too. The lamellar structure of phases in the cast iron matrix after annealing has been ascertained. There has been an increase in hardness of an annealed cast iron and microhardness of its matrix. The reduction in the impact strength of the cast iron annealed at 520 and 550 °C was approximately 10 - 30 %. Both an increase in the hardness of cast iron as well as an decrease in its impact strength is probably due to the separation of secondary carbides during the heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the research on the effect of copper on the crystallization process, microstructure and selected properties of the compacted graphite iron. Compacted graphite in cast iron was obtained using <b>Inmold</b> process. The study involved the cast iron containing copper at a concentration up to approximately 4 %. The effect of copper on the temperature of the eutectic crystallization as well as the temperature of start and finish of the austenite transformation was given. It has been shown that copper increases the maximum temperature of the eutectic transformation approximately by 5 °C per 1 % Cu, and the temperature of the this transformation finish approximately by 8 °C per 1 % Cu. This element decreases the temperature of the austenite transformation start approximately by 5 °C per 1 % Cu, and the finish of this transformation approximately by 6 °C per 1 % Cu. It was found that in the microstructure of the compacted graphite iron containing about 3. 8 % Cu, there are still ferrite precipitations near the compacted graphite. The effect of copper on the hardness of cast iron and the pearlite microhardness was given. This stems from the high propensity to direct ferritization of this type of cast iron. It has been shown copper increases the hardness of compacted graphite iron both due to its pearlite forming action as well as because of the increase in the pearlite microhardness (up to approx. 3 % Cu). The conducted studies have shown copper increases the hardness of the compacted graphite iron approximately by 35 HB per 1 % Cu...|$|E
