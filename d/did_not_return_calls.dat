5000|$|The {{massacre}} {{coincided with}} the visit of United States president Bill Clinton to India. In an introduction to a book written by Madeleine Albright titled The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs (2006), she accused [...] "Hindu Militants" [...] of perpetrating the act. This error created a major incident, with both Hindu and Sikh groups expressing outrage at the inaccuracy. Clinton's office <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>calls</b> seeking comment or clarification. In the hours immediately after the massacre in March 2000, the US condemned the killings but {{refused to accept the}} Indian government's accusation that it was the work of Pakistani Islamist groups. The publishers, Harper Collins routed a correction through Albright's office. In a public statement they acknowledged the mistake.Page xi of the Mighty and the Almighty contains a reference to Hindu militants that will be deleted in subsequent printings, both in America and in international editions. This error was due to a failure in the fact-checking process.|$|E
5000|$|As noted earlier, the Republican Secretary of State in Michigan {{was found}} purging voters from voting rolls when voter ID cards were {{returned}} as undeliverable. In the court challenge, {{the federal judge}} ordered the state to reinstate the voters. [...] The judge ruled that the state's actions were {{in violation of the}} NVRA. His decision noted {{that there was no way}} to prevent qualified voters from being disfranchised as their cards may be returned as undeliverable by postal error, clerical error, inadvertent routing within a multi-unit dwelling, or even simple misspelling or transposition of numbers in an address.In December 2007, Kansas Republican Chair Kris Kobach sent an email boasting that [...] "to date, the Kansas GOP has identified and caged more voters in the last 11 months than the previous two years!"Republicans sent out fundraising mailers to voters in five Florida counties: Duval, Hillsborough, Collier, Miami-Dade and Escambia, with 'do not forward' on the letters. The mailers included inaccurate voter ID numbers and ostensibly confirmed with voters they were registered as Republican. The RNC declined to discuss the mailer with the St. Petersburg Times. A representative denied that the mailing had anything to do with caging. Two top Florida elections officials, both Republicans, faulted the Republican mailing, calling it [...] "confusing" [...] and [...] "unfortunate" [...] because of a potential to undermine voter confidence by making them question the accuracy of their registrations." [...] Some officials expressed concern that the RNC would try to use a caging list derived from the mailers.In Northern California, reports of voter caging emerged when letters marked 'do not forward' were sent to Democrats with fake voter ID numbers. The description of the letters matches the letters that were sent out in Florida. See the caging letter that was sent out here. Many details on the letters were false; for example, the letters referred to a Voter Identification Division, but RNC personnel said they had no such department. The RNC <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>calls</b> from a news organization regarding the letters.On October 5, 2008 the Republican (but elected on the Democratic ticket) Lieutenant Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties that trend Democratic. The purges included decorated war veterans and active duty soldiers.Terri Lynn Land, the Secretary of State of Michigan, was found to be purging thousands of voters from voting rolls based on Voter ID cards being returned as undeliverable. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the purges. Judge Stephen J. Murphy ruled the purge illegal under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 and directed Land to reinstate the affected voters. (See full ruling here [...] ).The New York Times found in its review of state records that unlawful actions in six states led to widespread voter purges, which could have impacted the 2008 elections. Some of the actions were apparently the result of mistakes by the states in handling voter registrations and files as they tried to comply with a 2002 federal law related to running elections. Neither party was singled out, but because the Democratic Party registered more new voters this year, Democratic voters were more adversely affected by such actions of state officials.|$|E

5000|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{which would}} indicate a possible fragility of theory of mind in primates {{occurs when a}} baboon gets lost. Under such circumstances, the lost baboon generally makes [...] "call barks" [...] to announce that it is lost. Previous to the 1990s {{it was thought that}} these call barks would then be returned by the other baboons, similar to the case is in vervet monkeys. However, when researchers studied this formally {{in the past few years}} they found something surprising: Only the baboons who were lost would ever give call barks. Even if an infant was wailing in agony just a few hundred meters away, its mother who would clearly recognise its voice and would be frantic about his safety (or alternatively run towards her infant depending on her own perceived safety), would often simply stare in his direction visibly agitated. If the anguishing baboon mother made any type of call at all, the infant would instantly recognise her and run to her position. This type of logic appears to be lost on the baboon, suggesting a serious gap in theory of mind of this otherwise seemingly very intelligent primate species. However, it is also possible that baboons <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>call</b> barks for ecological reasons, for example because <b>returning</b> the <b>call</b> bark might call attention to the lost baboon, putting it at greater risk from predators.|$|R

50|$|A {{few years}} after the {{original}} commercial appeared, an urban legend spread that the actor who had played Little Mikey had died after eating an unexpectedly lethal combination of Pop Rocks (a type of carbonated hard candy) and a carbonated soft drink, which caused his stomach to inflate with carbon dioxide.
