5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

25|$|The play {{follows the}} basic plot and themes from We the Living. The plot in both {{is that of}} a woman <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{powerful}} man in order to save the man she loves. Rand acknowledged that similar plots had been used in many previous works of fiction, citing the opera Tosca as an example. She varied from traditional versions of the plot by making the powerful man an idealist who is in love with the woman and unaware of her other lover, rather than a villain who knowingly exploits her. The play significantly streamlines the story: Kira's family is omitted from the story, and the plot begins with her living with Leo. Some of the characterizations are also changed: Leo is more passive, and Andrei is portrayed less sympathetically.|$|E

500|$|Baker {{was born}} in Long Beach, California and raised in what he {{considered}} a [...] "stifling, Republican Southern Californian household". Rebelling against his parents, he became attracted to the fringe elements of society, including beatniks (anyone living as a bohemian, acting rebelliously, or appearing to advocate a revolution in manners), artists and gays. In high school during the 1960s he explored his sexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs, while living in fear that his abusive father would find out. At one point, his father hired a private detective to follow him, when he suspected Baker was <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male neighbor. This family dynamic would be used in many of his novels, most extensively in Boy Wonder.|$|E
500|$|In 1933, LeHand {{began to}} date the diplomat William Christian Bullitt, Jr., who became the first U.S. {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union late that year. FDR's son James later described this as [...] "the one real romance" [...] of her life. While some historians have stated that LeHand broke off the engagement after discovering Bullitt was <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Bolshoi Ballet dancer or that he [...] "dumped" [...] her, correspondence between the two makes it clear LeHand broke off the relationship in September 1940, after Bullitt returned to the United States from Nazi-occupied France and began demanding more of her time. The length and depth of LeHand's relationship with William C. Bullitt raises questions about FDR being the true love of her life.|$|E

500|$|After King Harthacnut's death, the English {{considered}} bringing Edmund and Edward back to England, {{but nothing}} came of it, as the princes were still in Kiev in late 1042. By 1043, Edmund, now in his late twenties, was being left out of Yaroslav's continental schemes, while Edward was elevated [...] "to a position of sole responsibility where England's crown or dynastic alliances were concerned." [...] This was possibly due to Edmund <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> noble lady, which had caused quite a scandal. Andrew of Hungary, a Hungarian prince who had also been exiled, had established himself at Yaroslav's court in the 1030s. In 1046, during the Vata pagan uprising in Hungary, Andrew returned to his homeland {{with the intention of}} gaining the throne; Edmund and Edward are likely to have fought for Andrew's army and it is possible that they were present at his coronation.|$|E

[...] However, it also shows Frank <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> much older cleaning lady, whom he calls [...] "mommy," [...] thus embarrassing them both and breaking the pact.|$|E
