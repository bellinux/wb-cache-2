Roughly 50,000 people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters {{and thousands of}} others sought refuge in public buildings, such as schools and churches. Across La Paz, officials evacuated 3,000 families from hurricane-prone areas. In the towns of Altata and Guamúchil alone, army officials evacuated 5,000 coastal residents.|$|E
30|$|Knotting {{inside the}} airway makes {{anastomosis}} easier, especially <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep operative field.

5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident. This {{had a profound effect}} on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|Freight volumes {{remained}} high {{throughout the}} following decades. In the late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force built a 32 million kroner storage area for aviation fuel at Muruvik. The terminal {{would be a}} reserve <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack on Sweden, and the Meråker Line was {{to be used to}} transport the fuel into Sweden. The depot was sold in 1988 to Petrofina, following the Royal Norwegian Air Force's quest to build a pipeline to the NATO-base at Trondheim Airport, Værnes.|$|E

5|$|From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards, the British built many pillboxes in Malta for defence <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Italian invasion. Many {{others were}} built during World War II. Many pillboxes still exist, {{especially}} on the north {{eastern part of the}} island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value.|$|E
5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute.

5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|Under the old tribal system, {{the tribal}} {{assembly}} elected a chief <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> external threat {{to lead the}} defense effort, {{and it was a}} temporarily granted authority.

Gonen wanted Adan {{to reach the}} Hizayon strongpoint, and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09:55 to request a crossing of the canal. Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments. Elazar, who was at a meeting, communicated with Gonen through his assistant and approved of a crossing, also giving permission for Sharon's division to move south.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a zone of buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazarević of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted Făgăraş. Sigismund I {{was also the first}} monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would take up arms. Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an annual basis. In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Székely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet after the beginning of the First World War in August 1914 and ferried Royal Marines to Belgium that same month. In early 1915, she was ordered to the Mediterranean to support Allied forces in the Dardanelles Campaign, but Prince of Wales only remained there briefly before she ordered to the Adriatic reinforce Italian forces there <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The ship was ordered home in early 1917 and reduced to reserve upon her arrival. Prince of Wales served as an accommodation ship until she was listed for sale in late 1919.
