25|$|The years 1813–1815 were {{difficult}} and tragic ones for Stock. Dresden was in chaos from the terminal {{stages of the}} Napoleonic wars, with the homes (the Körner home included) taken over by French soldiers and great numbers of civilian deaths. Stock's nephew Theodor, who had volunteered for the Freikorps to fight against Napoleon, died in action (1813); and niece Emma died of a short illness two years later, leaving the Körners childless. Stock, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> a second mother to her sister's children, was as devastated as Minna and Gottfried were. Finally, Gottfried fell into conflict with Frederick Augustus, the ruler of Saxony, and lost his job.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s {{conflict}} {{within the party}} between the younger libertarians and party chairman Carl I. Hagen, Jensen stood {{on the side of}} Hagen. She also supported Hagen in the 2001 internal conflict, and stated the same year that Hagen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> a father figure for her. She became first deputy chairman of the Progress Party in 1998, and parliamentary leader of the party in 2005. In 2006, Carl I. Hagen, chairman of the party since 1978 resigned to become vice president of parliament, and Jensen assumed leadership of the Progress Party to no internal opposition. While many had been speculating about the viability of the party and its future after Hagen resigning, a 2004 survey showed that Jensen enjoyed better general support than him, which was explained by her not being as controversial. Many had also predicted a more moderate course for the party with her being the leader, but she stood firmly by the policies of the party. Her leadership-style has however been considered to be softer than that of Hagen.|$|E
500|$|Only Rimsky-Korsakov {{actively}} {{pursued a}} full-time musical career, {{and he was}} under increasing fire from his fellow nationalists for much the same reason as Tchaikovsky <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> <b>Like</b> Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov had found that, for his own artistic growth to continue unabated, he had to study and master Western classical forms and techniques. Borodin called it [...] "apostasy", adding, [...] "Many are grieved at present {{by the fact that}} Korsakov has turned back, has thrown himself into a study of musical antiquity. I do not bemoan it. It is understandable...." [...] Mussorgsky was harsher: [...] "he mighty kuchka had degenerated into soulless traitors." ...|$|E

500|$|Sifton was {{selected}} Premier {{in an effort}} to restore party unity, and his first cabinet reflected that. [...] There were three ministers in addition to Sifton. [...] Charles R. Mitchell <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> <b>like</b> Sifton, a judge during the scandal, and was therefore unattached to either side. [...] Duncan Marshall had been a Rutherford cabinet minister, but not one identified strongly with its railway policy. [...] Archibald J. McLean had voted with the rebels, but not been a leader among them. [...] The cabinet thus included members of both factions, but none of those who inspired such strong opinions as to be overly divisive.|$|E
500|$|Benedict Arnold later {{issued a}} report stating that 48 British {{soldiers}} were killed and 145 wounded. [...] General Clinton praised Arnold for his [...] "spirited conduct", but also complained about the high casualty rate; about 25 percent of the troops sent against Fort Griswold were killed or wounded. [...] One British observer wrote that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a Bunker Hill expedition", and many British soldiers blamed Arnold for the events at Fort Griswold, {{even though he had}} not been in a position to prevent the slaughter. [...] Arnold next proposed a raiding expedition against Philadelphia, but the surrender of General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown in late October ended that idea.|$|E
500|$|The {{group of}} composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov {{became known as}} the Belyayev circle, named after their {{financial}} benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> <b>Like</b> The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition—which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Compared to the [...] "revolutionary" [...] composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be [...] "progressive... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily..." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{reported}} that Noriega had been visited by evangelical Christians, who claimed that {{he had become a}} born again Christian. On May 15 and 16, 1990, while Noriega still awaited trial, Clift Brannon, a former attorney turned preacher, and a Spanish interpreter, Rudy Hernandez, were allowed to visit Noriega for a total of six hours at the Metropolitan Correctional Center of Dade County, Florida. Following the visit, Noriega wrote Brannon a letter thanking him, and stating that his visit <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a dream, a revelation", and that [...] "receiving our Lord Jesus Christ as Savior guided by you" [...] had been an emotional moment for him. Noriega's prison sentence was reduced from 30 years to 17 years for good behavior. After serving 17 years in detention and imprisonment, his sentence ended on September 9, 2007.|$|E
500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future. At first, he imagined it to take place ten years after the first game, as he thought that would be roughly the amount of time needed for society to rebuild, but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later. Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years, and that he could not even imagine what the world would look like a hundred years into the future or what it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> during the Meiji period. The two had different ideas about the timeline of the series, but eventually decided to set the game [...] "several decades" [...] after Shin Megami Tensei. They made use of the tree of life as a central theme of the story.|$|E
500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend for all these years. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> an old dog, sleeping comfortably at our feet, and then one day it jumped up and bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do we put it to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E

500|$|Minogue {{underwent}} surgery on 21 May 2005 at Cabrini Hospital in Malvern and commenced chemotherapy treatment soon after. On 8 July 2005, {{she made her}} first public appearance after surgery when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her chemotherapy treatment at the Institut Gustave-Roussy in Villejuif, near Paris. In December 2005, Minogue released a digital-only single, [...] "Over the Rainbow", a live recording from her Showgirl tour. Her children's book, The Showgirl Princess, written during her period of convalescence, was published in October 2006, and her perfume, [...] "Darling", was launched in November. The range was later augmented by eau de toilettes including Pink Sparkle, Couture and Inverse. On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she discussed her illness and said that her chemotherapy treatment <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> [...] "experiencing a nuclear bomb". While appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2008, Minogue said that her cancer had originally been misdiagnosed. She commented, [...] "Because someone is in a white coat and using big medical instruments doesn't necessarily mean they're right", but later spoke of her respect for the medical profession.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to New York in June, Arnold made a variety of {{proposals}} for continuing to attack economic or military targets (including West Point) in order to force the Americans to end the war. [...] Clinton {{was not interested in}} most of his aggressive ideas, but the arrival of 3,000 new Hessian troops led him to relent. [...] He authorized an expedition against the port of New London, Connecticut, near Arnold's childhood home of Norwich. [...] Arnold's force of more than 1,700 men raided and burned New London on September 4, not long after the birth of his second son, and they captured Fort Griswold, causing damage estimated at $500,000. [...] British casualties were high; nearly one quarter of the force sent against Fort Griswold was killed or wounded, a rate at which Clinton claimed he could ill afford more such victories. [...] Arnold only reported 44 killed and 127 wounded in his official report, but there were unofficial whispers that between 400 and 500 casualties had occurred, with at least one claim that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a Bunker Hill expedition".|$|E
500|$|Previous {{seasons of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer had ended with an action episode which tied {{up all the}} threads of the season's main plot line, but series creator Joss Whedon wanted to end season four differently. The {{penultimate}} episode, [...] "Primeval", had concluded the Initiative storyline, but Whedon felt the season's overall story arc had not been as cohesive as it could have been, and therefore chose to create an episode {{to act as a}} [...] "grace note" [...] to the season, an episode which would comment on each of the four main characters and what they had just been through. While talking about the writing of the episode, Whedon said it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> writing poetry, a process he found [...] "liberating and strange". Like the earlier [...] "Hush" [...] — an episode with almost no dialogue — he viewed the episode as an exercise in form and writing, {{and what it means to}} write. The episode has no real structure, which was a departure for Whedon, as everything he had written before was constructed before even starting the script. Yet despite its fragmented style, the episode unfolds coherently in four discrete acts, each act comprising one character's dream.|$|E

2500|$|Born in {{the small}} town of Leslie, Michigan, she later moved with her family to St. Johns, Michigan, where she lived with her unhappily married parents in extreme poverty. Her father, August de Cleyre, named her after the famed French Enlightenment author Voltaire. At age 12, she was placed into a Catholic convent in Sarnia, Ontario, by her father, because he thought it would give her a better education. This {{experience}} had the effect of moving her towards atheism rather than Christianity. Of her time spent there she said, [...] "it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and there are white scars on my soul, where ignorance and superstition burnt me with their hell fire in those stifling days". She attempted to run away by swimming to Port Huron, Michigan, and hiking but she met friends of her family who contacted her father and sent her back.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{centuries later}} in 1053/54 the Almoravids began their advance on central Morocco. Their very first {{campaign}} {{was on the}} valley of the Draa river. The power in the valley <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> <b>like</b> in the city of Sijilmasa, for some 50 years {{in the hands of the}} Marghwata (a branch of the Zenata). Here and elsewhere in Morocco this domination was resented. After the Almoravids had conquered the Draa and Sijilmasa they went on to conquer Adaghwast at the southern end of the trans-Sahara route. Yusuf ibn Tashfin took command of North Morocco, while Abu Bakr ibn Umar was leader in the Sahara, Tafilalt and the Draa. Today the remains of an Almoravid fortress can still be seen on the top of the Zagora hill. [...] There are still groups in the Draa valley that claim descendancy from the Almoravids: the groups of Mrabtine linked to the Arib and the Msouffa, part of the confederation of the Ait Atta. This integration in the empire of the Almoravids was also the first integration of the Draa valley into the whole of Morocco.|$|E
