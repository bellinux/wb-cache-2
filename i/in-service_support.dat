The high operational tempo from the Operation Resolute and Operation Sovereign Borders border protection and asylum seeker interception operations, combined with design flaws and poor maintenance, resulted in the ships suffering from hull fracturing around the engineering spaces, mechanical defects, and corrosion issues. DMS's contract to provide <b>in-service</b> <b>support</b> will be terminated in 2017, and the patrol boats are undergoing a major refit in Singapore to reinforce the hull.

25|$|In 2014, {{the navy}} {{reported}} the recurrence of hull cracking around the engine spaces, {{which has been}} attributed to a combination of design issues related to the aluminium hull, and the high tempo of operations. By 2015, several patrol boats were confined to port because of structural, mechanical, and corrosion issues. In response, the Department of Defence threatened to cancel DMS' maintenance contract based on the company's poor performance in maintaining the Armidales (but did not go ahead due to the political repercussions from potentially losing local jobs). Defence and Serco (the parent company of DMS) later agreed to end the contract in 2017, with the Australian government to tender for a new <b>in-service</b> <b>support</b> contract during 2016. The patrol boat fleet began a mid-life refit program in October 2015, in order to extend hull life until a replacement class of larger vessels enters service from 2022. Patrol boats are being refitted two at a time in Singapore, with the RAN chartering the s Cape Byron and Cape Nelson from mid-2015 until the end of 2016 to supplement naval patrol boat availability. During work on the first two patrol boats, the estimated cost of work-per-vessel doubled to A$7 million.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of a nationwide one-year physical education (PE) professional development (PD) programme on 25 generalist classroom teachers from 10 primary schools in New Zealand. This research specifically explores how a year-long PD programme, focused predominantly on general pedagogical strategies, <b>supported</b> <b>in-service</b> generalist teachers to use of pedagogies previously reserved to the classroom to enhance their PE practice, reconceptualise the place and purpose of PE, and shifted their perceptions of themselves as teachers of PE. Interviews, questionnaires, lesson observations and document analysis were used to investigate the impact a PD programme had on teachers’ knowledge and practices in PE. This research specifically explores how a year-long PD programme, focused predominantly on general pedagogical strategies, <b>supported</b> <b>in-service</b> generalist teachers to explore how the use of pedagogies previously reserved to the classroom support them to enhance their PE practice; to reconceptualize the place and purpose of PE, and shifted their perceptions of themselves as teachers of PE. It is concluded that generalist teachers benefit from PD opportunities that allow for the transfer of pedagogical strategies and skills from the classroom to the PE context.

Hong Kong and China have been most severely affected by this new infectious disease. The elderly population is highly vulnerable, and mortality in those older than 65 years is more than 50 %. In our study, 27 health care workers and 40 elderly residents in a nursing home were interviewed to investigate their level of knowledge of SARS and its prevention. Most of the elderly residents knew little regarding SARS and prevention strategies, despite access to outside news by TV, radio, and visitors. Also, the worry and fear of an outbreak of SARS among staff working in the nursing home was considered to be high. Tailored education programs to promote awareness and prevention of SARS for the elderly are need.

40|$|The {{mobility}} rates {{within the}} Kindergarten–Grade 12 teacher workforce are distressing, {{and the teaching}} profession has a relatively high turnover rate compared to other occupations. The Commonwealth of Virginia encounters many challenges when attempting to retain highly qualified teachers in schools.

Turnover affects not only the composition of faculties at individual schools and the stability of these schools, but {{the quality of the}} teacher workforce as well. The factors that affect the retention of novice teachers in hard-to-staff high schools in Virginia were examined in this study.

40|$|A {{clearly stated}} lesson {{objective}} {{is considered an}} essential component of a well-planned lesson. Many teachers of Technology, a relatively new subject in South African schools, teach Technology with rather limited training both in content and methodological approaches. This study sought to investigate and classify lesson objectives framed or implied by teachers in their lesson plans according to knowledge and cognitive process dimensions. The two-dimensional Taxonomy Table introduced by Krathwohl was adapted for Technology and formed the framework for this study. It was found that most of the directly stated objectives are directed to the lower level of the cognitive process dimension and address mainly factual knowledge, while no activities or lesson components address meta-cognitive knowledge. Some lesson objectives inferred from planned assessment activities placed higher demands on learners' cognitive domain. A recommendation flowing from the study is that, during pre-service training and <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>support</b> processes, the importance of clear lesson objectives should be emphasised and that assessments planned for such lessons should closely match the lesson objectives. Further research is also needed on the reasons why low cognitive demands are made in the teaching of Technology...|$|R
