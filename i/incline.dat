40|$|The {{convective}} instability of pore-fluid flow in <b>inclined</b> and fluid-saturated three-dimensional fault zones has been theoretically investigated in this paper. Due to {{the consideration of}} the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone with any values of the <b>inclined</b> angle, {{it is impossible to}} use the conventional linear stability analysis method for deriving the critical condition (i. e., the critical Rayleigh number) which can be used to investigate the {{convective instability}} of the pore-fluid flow in an <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system. To overcome this mathematical difficulty, a combination of the variable separation method and the integration elimination method has been used to derive the characteristic equation, which depends on the Rayleigh number and the <b>inclined</b> angle of the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone. Using this characteristic equation, the critical Rayleigh number of the system can be numerically found {{as a function of the}} <b>inclined</b> angle of the three-dimensional fault zone. For a vertically oriented three-dimensional fault zone system, the critical Rayleigh number of the system can be explicitly derived from the characteristic equation. Comparison of the resulting critical Rayleigh number of the system with that previously derived in a vertically oriented three-dimensional fault zone has demonstrated that the characteristic equation of the Rayleigh number is correct and useful for investigating the convective instability of pore-fluid flow in the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system. The related numerical results from this investigation have indicated that: (1) the convective pore-fluid flow may take place in the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone; (2) if the height of the fault zone is used as the characteristic length of the system, a decrease in the <b>inclined</b> angle of the <b>inclined</b> fault zone stabilizes the three-dimensional fundamental convective flow in the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system; (3) if the thickness of the stratum is used as the characteristic length of the system, a decrease in the <b>inclined</b> angle of the <b>inclined</b> fault zone destabilizes the three-dimensional fundamental convective flow in the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system; and that (4) the shape of the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone may affect the convective instability of pore-fluid flow in the system.

5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa <b>incline</b> was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the <b>incline</b> was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the <b>incline</b> in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E

Specifically, the GaN NRs grew in a single <b>inclined</b> direction to the [11 - 20]sapp. Uni-directionally <b>inclined</b> NRs were formed through the one-sided (10 - 11) -faceted growth of the interfacial a-GaN plane layer.
