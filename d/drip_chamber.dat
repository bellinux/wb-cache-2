40|$|Tubing (especially venous) disconnections using pumped devices cause {{significant}} hemorrhage, {{and current}} monitoring techniques are imperfect because {{they rely on}} intraluminal pressure changes. We devised a passive detection method based on a patient's electrical voltages being transmitted via blood tubing to our alarm circuit. As the arterial and venous access sites are in close proximity, the signals are nearly identical during connection, and markedly different with disconnection. We built a prototype and tested it in vitro with saline and during hemodialysis treatments (n= 7). The connection status is determined by examining the difference between endogenous voltages in the blood tubing from and to the patient, and when it exceeds a threshold an alarm condition is triggered. We tested for possible confounding by an electrical shunt through the dialyzer and determined that pathway had an impedance approximately three times (> 350 [*]kΩ) that of the tubing to the patient. As the roller blood-pump periodically occluded the tubing, the resultant intermittent very high impedance prevented that potential shunting problem and improved the sensitivity of our device. Disconnections were detectable at various bloodline sites (needles, sampling ports, <b>drip</b> <b>chambers).</b> Thus, the circuit's sensors can be placed remotely at the dialysis machine, with electrical continuity to blood made by inexpensive conductive elements at the tubing wall or <b>drip</b> <b>chambers.</b> Appropriate threshold and noise-eliminating circuitry, as well as alarm states that alert the staff and stop the blood pump, make our prototype a promising low-cost safety enhancement...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested a}} new bedside method to {{determine}} the function of native arteriovenous fistula in 16 patients performed during hemodialysis without stopping the treatment. We initially measured vascular access flow (Qa) in each patient using the Transonic HD 01 plus device. We then measured the pressure in arterial and venous <b>drip</b> <b>chambers</b> at different blood pump flow rates (Qbset= 0, 50, 100, 250, 300, 350 [*]ml/min). The intravascular blood pressure gradient (Pf) between arterial and venous puncture sites was estimated by a mathematical model. Pf was positive for low Qbset, but became negative when Qbset overcame the threshold value (QInv). Such critical flow showed a high correlation with Qa, {{even if it was}} systemically lower. Computer analysis of fluid dynamics showed that when the blood pump flow overcame the QInv threshold, a critical transition from laminar flow to vortex circulation took place downstream of the venous needle, causing a dangerous shearstress on the vessel wall. Our results show that QInv provides an indication of the maximal blood pump flow rate needed to be reached to maximize blood flow supply in order to limit hemodynamic stress on the vascular access...|$|R

40|$|Graft flow as a {{predictor}} of thrombosis in hemodialysis grafts. BackgroundThe effort to reduce the incidence of graft thrombosis is mainly based on predicting venous stenosis by measuring venous <b>drip</b> <b>chamber</b> pressures. In this study we evaluated whether graft flow measurements, using an ultrasound dilution technique, would be of additional value to identify patients at risk for thrombosis. MethodsIn fifty consecutive patients with a bridge graft we measured graft flow and venous <b>drip</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure at a dialyzer blood flow of 200 ml/min. The results of these flow measurements were not used for selection of patients, nor for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. All thrombotic events and (radiological or surgical) interventions were registered. ResultsA total of 17 patient-years were analyzed. In 17 patients an intervention was done, and in 18 patients thrombosis occurred. The incidence rate of thrombosis was higher in patients with a flow 600 ml/min (N = 37; rate ratio 7. 2; 95 % CI, range 2. 84 to 18. 24, P 600 ml/min. In the remaining 32 patients only two developed spontaneous thrombosis. Remarkably, venous <b>drip</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure measurements did not discriminate between patients with graft flow > or < 600 ml/min, and showed a wide range in patients who developed spontaneous thrombosis within two months.

40|$|Objectives: Sonoclot {{was used}} in this study to monitor low {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH) during haemodialysis. Material and Methods: Two different intravenous doses (standard / half-dose) of dalteparin were studied in eight patients. Blood was sampled for coagulation analyses with Sonoclot, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and anti-Xa. A visual fibrin deposition score (VFS) in the venous <b>drip</b> <b>chamber</b> was also evaluated. RESULTS: All patients completed their dialysis. There was a progressive increase in TAT levels, which correlated to the dalteparin dose. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) were found for TAT, VFS and Sonoclot celite-activated clotting time (SonACT) between the different LMWH dosages. TAT and Sonoclot correlated to each other, but not to the VFS. SonACT was significantly increased at two hours, with the high dalteparin dose compared to the lower dose. CONCLUSION: Both Sonoclot and TAT failed to predict the VFS. No patient had any clinical clotting events and all dialyses were completed successfully...|$|E

Thus it is necessary to develop devices that can improve the connectivity of the system. Optical devices have a huge application in this field. Simple optical devices can be used for the purpose of object detection, checking the optical density of samples. Intravenous infusion rate can be measured using drip rate monitorig device.

40|$|We {{report that}} {{intracellular}} calcium levels rise in mammalian neurosecretory terminals and in cultured pheochromocytoma cells during acute exposure to physiological medium incubated in IV drip chambers. The agent {{responsible for this}} effect is shown to be di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). DEHP (800 nM) added to saline solution caused a rise in [Ca(2 +) ](i) similar to that elicited by the contaminant-containing solution. The extraction of this contaminant from the IV <b>drip</b> <b>chamber,</b> as measured by spectrophotometry, was time-dependent and was markedly accelerated {{by the presence of}} 50 mM ethanol in the solution. Larger [Ca(2 +) ](i) increases were observed in terminals exposed to solutions incubated in IV drip chambers for greater durations. The rise in calcium requires transmembrane calcium flux through membrane channels, as the response is blocked by either 100 microM cadmium or by lowering the extracellular free Ca(2 +) concentration to 10 microM. Our results suggest that acute alterations in intracellular calcium should be considered in addition to long-term effects when determining the safety of phthalate-containing plastics and that laboratory researchers using plastic perfusion materials consider this potential source of artifactual results...|$|E
40|$|Calcium ions (Ca 2 +) are {{involved}} in almost all neuronal functions, providing the link between electrical signals and cellular activity. This work examines the mechanisms by which a neuron can regulate the movement and sequestration of Ca 2 + through specific channels such that this ubiquitous ion can encode specific functions. My initial focus was using intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) imaging techniques to study {{the influence of the}} inhibition of specific voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) by ethanol on a depolarization induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i in neurohypophysial nerve terminals. This research took an unexpected turn when I observed an elevation of [Ca 2 +]i during perfusion with ethanol containing solutions. Control experiments showed this to be an artifactual result not directly attributable to ethanol. It was necessary to track down the source of this artifact in order to proceed with future ethanol experiments. The source of the artifact {{turned out to be a}} contaminant leaching from I. V. drip chambers. Due to potential health implications stemming from the use of these drip chambers in a clinical setting as well as potential artifactual results in the ethanol field where these chambers are commonly used, I choose to investigate this phenomenon more rigorously. The agent responsible for this effect was shown to be di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer that has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and mice. The extraction of this contaminant from the I. V. <b>drip</b> <b>chamber,</b> as measured by spectrophotometry, was time-dependent, and was markedly accelerated by the presence of ethanol in the solution. DEHP added to saline solution caused a rise in [Ca 2 +]i similar to that elicited by the contaminant containing solution. The rise in calcium required transmembrane flux through membrane channels. Blood levels of DEHP in clinical settings have been shown to exceed the levels which we found to alter [Ca 2 +]i. This suggests that acute alterations in intracellular calcium should be considered in addition to long-term effects when determining the safety of phthalate-containing plastics. As part of a collaboration between Steven Treistman and Robert Messing 2 ̆ 7 s laboratory at UCSF, I participated in a study of how ethanol regulates N-type calcium channels which are known to be inhibited acutely, and upregulated in the chronic presence of ethanol. Specific mRNA splice variants encoding N-type channels were investigated using ribonuclease protection assays and real-time PCR. Three pairs of N-type specific α-subunit Cav 2. 2 splice variants were examined, with exposure to ethanol observed to increase expression of one alternative splice form in a linker that lacks six bases encoding the amino acids glutamate and threonine (ΔET). Whole cell electrophysiological recordings that I carried out demonstrated a faster rate of channel activation and a shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials after chronic alcohol exposure, consistent with increased expression of ΔET variants. These results demonstrate that chronic ethanol exposure not only increases the abundance of N-type calcium channels, but also increases the expression of a Cav 2. 2 splice variant with kinetics predicted to support a larger and faster rising intracellular calcium signal. This is the first demonstration that ethanol can up-regulate ion channel function through expression of a specific mRNA splice variant, defining a new mechanism underlying the development of drug addiction. Depolarizing a neuron opens voltage gated Ca 2 + channels (VGCC), leading to an influx of Ca 2 + ions into the cytoplasm, where Ca 2 + sensitive signaling cascades are stimulated. How does the ubiquitous calcium ion selectively modulate a large array of neuronal functions? Concurrent electrophysiology and ratiometric calcium imaging were used to measure transmembrane Ca 2 + current and the resulting rise and decay of [Ca 2 +]i, showing that equal amounts of Ca 2 + entering through N-type and L-type voltage gated Ca 2 + channels result in significantly different [Ca 2 +]i temporal profiles. When the contribution of N-type channels was reduced, a faster [Ca 2 +]i decay was observed. Conversely, when the contribution of L-type channels was reduced, [Ca 2 +]i decay was slower. Potentiating L-type current or inactivating N-type channels both resulted in a more rapid decay of [Ca 2 +]i. Channel-specific differences in [Ca 2 +]i decay rates were abolished by depleting intracellular Ca 2 + stores suggesting the involvement of Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). I was able to conclude that Ca 2 + entering through N-type, but not L-type channels, is amplified by ryanodine receptor mediated CICR. Channel-specific activation of CICR generates a unique intracellular Ca 2 + signal depending on the route of entry, potentially encoding the selective activation of a subset of Ca 2 + -sensitive processes within the neuron...|$|E
