50|$|Posing as Robert Snow, a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fisherman,</b> Colonel White {{is taken}} {{on board the}} World Navy {{submarine}} USS Panther II as a guest. However, as the submarine prepares to dive, Ensign Soames traps his foot in a chain on the open deck and drowns as the vessel submerges. The Panther II captain appoints the Mysteron reconstruction of Soames as White's steward. Entering White's quarters with a gun, Soames shoots the occupant, but with a last effort his victim returns fire and Soames is also killed. However, {{the man in the}} cabin is not White, who is eventually found bound and gagged in a storage compartment - left there by Scarlet, who was killed in White's disguise. Back on Cloudbase, a revived Scarlet tells White that he pulled rank on Green to learn his whereabouts, used his Spectrum ID to be cleared by World Navy Security and hid away on board the Panther II before it left its base. Although White sentences Scarlet to death for misconduct, he concedes that it would be pointless since Scarlet is indestructible.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{existence}} of deep-sea fishing under the German flag there have been repeated efforts to establish the occupation of the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fisherman</b> as one requiring specialised training. Yet only during the Nazi era {{and that of the}} German Democratic Republic were these attempts crowned with success. As is illustrated by the two examples presented here, the non-existence of systematic vocational training in this field is not {{due to a lack of}} its necessity but rather to the fact that, particularly in times of labour scarcity, the shipping companies have never been interested in such training if they had the opportunity of finding employees elsewhere. ln periods of centralist, statist political systems, which intensively promoted the fishing industry and set up the fleets on the basis of political will rather than economic orientation, this one-sided interest of the shipping companies was not a factor. In interviews, former crew members have repeatedly expressed the point of view that the kind of vocational training practised in Germany before 1939 or in the Federal Republic of Germany since the end of the war- i. e. pure practical instruction on board - provides a solid basis for the everyday work on the deck of a deep-sea fishing vessel. Yet on the other hand, those who had obtained their training during the Nazi regime or received some form of instruction in coastal fishing were at a distinct advantage on board, being quickly selected for better jobs, for example net- making. In general, the comprehensive introduction of systematic vocational training for deep-sea fishing deck personnel would certainly have been welcome. But without the kind of legal initiative present, for example, in the German Democratic Republic, this aim could never be achieved. As it is, an ordinary seaman can sign onto a fishing vessel; entry into nautical college in order to qualify as an officer or captain is not dependent upon successful completion of training but merely upon time accumulated at sea. Thus there is no motivation for undergoing methodical instruction, particularly in view of the fact that doing so would cause a considerable reduction in earnings during the initial years of employment. The subject of vocational training in the deep-sea fishing industry has thus remained a direct reflection of the socioeconomic importance of this field in each of the respective political systems in Germany. ln times of economic orientation such training was non-existent and there was no legally established minimum qualification level. During eras of centralised economies, deep-sea fishing was a government priority and thus always accompanied by systematic vocational training for its deck personnel. " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Seafarers, {{including}} <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishermen,</b> have {{an increased}} risk of HIV and other STIs because of the high prevalence of risk behaviors in this group and their high degree of mobility. The situation of fishers and seafarers from the Pacific region is described with a focus on information, education and communication (IEC) aimed at preventing HIV/AIDS in this group. The Pacific context for HIV/AIDS is outlined, and the IEC materials that are available in the Pacific region, including print-based materials, video and audio productions, mass media and drama, are assessed, particularly in relation to their effectiveness in addressing cultural factors that predispose this group to take risks, such as resistance to using condoms. The challenges for IEC in the Pacific region include the basic literacy level of the target group, the requirement for materials to conform to social and religious mores, and the need for appropriate illustrations. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community works with national governments, maritime training institutions and donors to strengthen prevention initiatives aimed at this group. The effectiveness of the information components of these initiatives is reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [105]- 109) Anthropological {{studies of}} belief systems in maritime communities have typically considered {{the beliefs and}} rituals of fishermen in isolation of their wider religious and cultural contexts. The result has been psychologically and socially reductionistic models for the persistence of fishing ideologies and associated ritual acts. These theories, most {{of which have been}} based on studies of offshore, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishermen,</b> have adhered to the common assumption in the maritime anthropological literature that fishermen are a "race apart," socially and culturally isolated from the wider communities in which they live. For this reason, fishing ideologies have not been examined with reference to their relationships with the official religions in their communities, nor with attention to gender differences in religious expression. This thesis aims to address these and other shortcomings by examining gender differences in religious and supernatural acts and beliefs in a small inshore fishing village in Batangas, Philippines, and the implications these differences have on the articulation between animistic and Roman Catholic-based belief systems. Based on short-term fieldwork in a Tagalog village, this thesis explores the ways in which fishing luck in this village is believed to be obtained and lost, and describes and analyzes these occupational beliefs as part of a wider belief system, especially as they relate to gender constructions, Roman Catholicism, and fishing beliefs in other regions of the world. Roman Catholic-based traditions are largely the domain of women and are seen as forming an interdependent yet at times antagonistic relationship with animistic traditions, especially luck rituals, which are the primary source of fishermen's supernatural power and involvement.

5000|$|Cameron {{points out}} that, in Nova Scotia, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishermen</b> had no {{legal right to}} strike {{because they were not}} {{considered}} employees, but rather [...] "co-adventurers" [...] sharing the costs and profits of each voyage with the big fishing companies. He writes that the typical division of the profits was from 60 to 70 per cent for the boat share and from 30 to 40 per cent for the crew who also paid expenses including the cost of their own food. They also paid to use the companies' electronic gear. Cameron reports that a trawlerman who worked steadily was paid between $3,000 and $5,000 per year or about a dollar an hour at most, considering that such a fisherman might make 27 trips and work 5,000 hours which is about triple the annual working hours of the average Canadian industrial worker. In 1967, when the British Columbia-based UFAWU began an organizing drive in Nova Scotia, it found, among other things, that the fishermen had no job security; no say in the price of fish or division of the profits for the trip; no representative present when the fish were tallied and weighed and no proper statement of weights, prices or trip expenses in most ports. Cameron reports that the UFAWU successfully signed up a majority of the fishermen in the Canso Strait area. However, the fishing companies refused to deal with the union partly because they continued to argue that fishermen were [...] "co-adventurers" [...] and therefore, not eligible to join unions. The companies also {{made it clear that they}} did not want a militant, West Coast union to get a foothold in Nova Scotia, especially one that was led by Homer Stevens, a member of the Communist Party of Canada.|$|R
40|$|Professor Ajaga Nji {{spent more}} than 25 years {{travelling}} {{to some of the}} most under-privileged corners of the world to ask the question that has been puzzling him ever since he was a young man in Cameroon: why do poor people remain poor? His travels took him to most parts of his native Africa, as well Why Poor People Remain Poor: Key Elements for Poverty Alleviation and Sustainable Developmentas to Asia, Europe and the United States of America. Wherever he went, he spoke to poor people, and painstakingly recorded his conversations and interviews as he went. Over the years, a pattern began to emerge. Whether he was talking to farmers in Machacos, Kenya, or to herders in Sabongari, in the North West Province of Cameroon, a common thread of injustice, poor access to natural resources and lack of opportunities and education ran through the picture. Given that it took the author quarter of a century to investigate this vast subject, it would be absurd to try to synthesise the answers here. In one chapter, he comes up with 26 reasons why poor people remain just that. One clue, however, comes with the account of a poor fisherman he met in Cameroon, distraught because his old canoe leaked badly and because his net only caught a few young fish. This book is written for the fisherman, who might come to understand[]that he is poor because the rich, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishermen</b> use their wealth, greater resources and larger vessels to catch the big fish, pushing only the fries to the shores into his net, writes the author, many years after that encounter. But this is not a book of despair. The author is Professor of Rural Sociology and Technology Issues at the University of Dschang, Cameroon and has long experience of practical ways of alleviating poverty, many of which he outlines in his book. He concludes with the conviction that while poverty can probably never be eliminated altogether, it can be reduced in good measure through focused, targeted, anti-poverty programs based on a commitment to justice, peace, good governance, democracy and sustainable development.

40|$|As coastal {{fisheries}} {{around the}} world have collapsed, industrial fishing has spread seaward and deeper in pursuit of the last economically attractive concentrations of fishable biomass. For a seafood-hungry world depending on the oceans' ecosystem services, it is crucial to know whether deep-sea fisheries can be sustainable. The deep sea is by far the largest but least productive part of the oceans, although in very limited places fish biomass can be very high. Most deep-sea fishes have life histories giving them far less population resilience/productivity than shallow-water fishes, and could be fished sustainably only at very low catch rates if population resilience were the sole consideration. But like old-growth trees and great whales, their biomass makes them tempting targets while their low productivity creates strong economic incentive to liquidate their populations rather than exploiting them sustainably (Clark's Law). Many deep-sea fisheries use bottom trawls, which often have high impacts on nontarget fishes (e. g., sharks) and invertebrates (e. g., corals), and can often proceed only because they receive massive government subsidies. The combination of very low target population productivity, nonselective fishing gear, economics that favor population liquidation and a very weak regulatory regime makes deep-sea fisheries unsustainable with very few exceptions. Rather, deep-sea fisheries more closely resemble mining operations that serially eliminate fishable populations and move on. Instead of mining fish from the least-suitable places on Earth, an ecologically and economically preferable strategy would be rebuilding and sustainably fishing resilient populations in the most suitable places, namely shallower and more productive marine ecosystems that are closer to markets. Highlights ► Industrial fishing has spread seaward and deeper in pursuit of wild fish biomass. ► Low productivity <b>deep-sea</b> fishes tempt <b>fishermen</b> to overexploit their populations. ► Azores hook-and-line black scabbardfish is a rare, apparently sustainable exception. ► Subsidies for trawling in poorly managed high seas areas incentivize overfishing. ► Recovering and fishing productive shelf fish populations is much more sustainable. ...|$|R
