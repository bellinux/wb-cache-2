This sentiment, which shaped several generations and may now be fading away as European integration takes place, and is mainly due to the recent openness of Spain. This island syndrome was not so much a consequence of Portuguese policies, but rather a result of the times, and above all the extreme lack of openness of Spain. Whatever the cause(s), the syndrome, in the vein of the ecological anthropology, is important in rationalizing some of the patterns of social behavior of the Portuguese people.

40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{women who have been}} sexually {{assaulted}} once {{are more likely to be}} sexually assaulted again (revictimized). Several factors contribute to the likelihood of a woman being revictimized, including social support, personal behavior, and psychological health. This research proposes that a combination of these factors contributes to a woman’s self-perception as a victim or survivor of sexual assault. It is this self-perception that determines revictimization. Twenty women were interviewed to explore the victim or survivor mentality and its relation to revictimization. All women had negative consequences of the assault. Negative consequences lead some women to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> victim <b>mentality.</b> Some women were able to find positive consequences out of their assault and <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> survivor <b>mentality.</b> Revictimization was linked to negative consequences of the initial victimization and the victim mentality that resulted from the negative consequences. Reasons for non-revictimization were somewhat the opposite of the reasons for revictimization and were linked to positive consequences of the assault and the survivor mentality that resulted from the positive consequences. The overall attitudes and behaviors of a sexual assault victim determines whether she views herself as a victim or survivor which significantly impacts the likelihood of her revictimization...|$|R

40|$|Short-termism and myopia on {{the part}} of {{corporate}} managers, analysts, and investors have created a business environment driven by the excessive focus on short-term results and the need to meet earnings targets at the expense of long-term value creation. These are accompanied by numerous consequences, including the potential for short-term-oriented firms, particularly in the U. S., to lag behind global long-term-oriented firms, as well as the potential for short-term mindsets in the corporate world to catalyze financial crises. In this paper, I demonstrate that the market generally assigns higher values to long-term firms rather than short-term ones. This is evidenced by the fact that firms characterized to be long-term according to various financial metrics have higher valuation multiples than their short-term counterparts. The results suggest that the market has a degree of sophistication that rewards investments for the future rather than earnings management and present gratification, and that the corporate world should therefore increasingly <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> long-term <b>mentality...</b>|$|R

When it comes to large organizations, with {{hundreds or thousands of}} processes, thecreation of models becomes an essential activity. Even if the process itself does not change in the form of new process re-engineering efforts or new applications, there are new employees and contractors who must learn how things work to become effective new members of the organization’s human resource team.

Many universities in the US have factored in a term for credit-bearing service-learning courses, so that students are oriented to <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> service <b>mentality</b> and nurturing <b>a</b> ‘giving culture’ on campus. In the Asia Pacific region, Lingnan University, with its liberal arts ethos, is the first university in Hong Kong to use service-learning as a vehicle for knowledge transfer between university and community.

40|$|Michael Burawoy’s {{call for}} a public {{sociology}} disciplined by professional and policy sociology, on the one side, and driven by critical sociology, on the other, exposes the ideological biases of sociology to publics. In so doing, public sociology will thwart non-ideological efforts for sociology to exert influence on broader publics and on political decision-makers. In order for sociology {{to be able to}} influence public opinion and the decisions of key players in the political and economic arenas, it will need to earn respect through a long evolutionary process of careful research and explanation without ideological fervor.

2500|$|Most {{academic}} historians {{regard the}} notion of blitzkrieg as military doctrine to be a myth. Shimon Naveh wrote [...] "The striking feature of the blitzkrieg concept is the complete absence of a coherent theory which should have served as the general cognitive basis for the actual conduct of operations". Naveh described it as an [...] "ad hoc solution" [...] to operational dangers, thrown together at the last moment. Overy disagreed {{with the idea that}} Hitler and the Nazi regime ever intended a blitzkrieg war, because the once popular belief that the Nazi state organised their economy to carry out its grand strategy in short campaigns was false. Hitler had intended for a rapid unlimited war to occur much later than 1939, but the Third Reich's aggressive foreign policy forced the Nazi state into war before it was ready. Hitler and the Wehrmacht's planning in the 1930s did not reflect a blitzkrieg method but the opposite. John Harris wrote that the Wehrmacht never used the word, and it did not appear in German army or air force field manuals; the word was coined in September 1939, by a Times newspaper reporter. Harris also found no evidence that German military thinking <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> blitzkrieg <b>mentality.</b> Karl-Heinz Frieser and Adam Tooze reached similar conclusions to Overy and Naveh, that the notions of blitzkrieg-economy and strategy were myths. Frieser wrote that surviving German economists and General Staff officers denied that Germany went to war with a blitzkrieg strategy. Robert M. Citino argues: ...|$|R

40|$|Learning in America {{has been}} {{restrained}} by time. Educators have <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> time-bound <b>mentality</b> and deceived themselves {{into believing that}} schools can educate all students at the same pace. Across the nation {{there is a growing}} trend toward restructuring as educators seek smaller class enrollment with more flexible use of time. Block scheduling utilizes classes organized into longer blocks of time and may be an element that meets these demands for restructuring. In Virginia, 4 / 4 block scheduling is the most popular (31. 6 %) arrangement of the school day. Advocates of 4 / 4 block scheduling are convinced this schedule meets students' needs. With the adoption of the new Standards of Learning Tests for Virginia Public Schools it is important for educators to determine which schedule will help students improve their test scores. There are no empirical studies on the effect of 4 / 4 block scheduling on these Standards of Learning Tests. This study will attempt to determine if there is a meaningful relationship between two types of schedules, the 4 / 4 block and 7 -period traditional schedules, and student achievement on the Standards of Learning Tests for Virginia Public Schools. iii DEDICATION To my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the greatest teacher, thank you for performing the ultimate sacrifice.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering curriculum, all {{students}} must take part in a three quarter long senior design project. Students are presented with existing problems, select a project, and then apply the knowledge they have gained throughout their academic career to design and build a solution. The intent behind this project is to create an experience that is similar to an engineering project in industry, by applying engineering and teamwork skills to solve a problem. Team Trikeceratops’ mission was to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> adaptive adjustable tricycle {{to be used in the}} Special Education Department of the Buena Park School District for recreational use and physical therapy. The design team was comprised of four Cal Poly mechanical engineering students and a kinesiology student-consultant who worked through three primary design phases over the course of nine months to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> functional prototype. These phases included ideation and conception, detailed design, and manufacturing, all of which have different requirements that call for a variety of skill sets. During ideation and conception, Team Trikeceratops developed lists of requirements from sponsor input, divided the project into components, generated ideas, and refined the options to reach an overall conceptual design. This initial phase was also essential in <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> team <b>mentality</b> and establishing the basic rules and guidelines by which the team would operate. At the end of ideation and conception, the team had <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> full theoretical design that would meet the customer requirements. Detailed design was the second phase wherein the students took the conceptual design and applied engineering knowledge to clearly define the solution. In this phase, most of the more stereotypical engineering occurred. Students sized tubing for the frame, performed calculations and analysis on components, created manufacturing drawings, identified part numbers for acquisition, and began contacting companies for parts and services. At the end of detailed design, the team had a bill of materials, manufacturing plan, contact information for suppliers, and fully dimensioned drawings for manufacturing custom parts. The third phase of product development was manufacturing and testing. Students cut, notched, welded, and machined various custom components while simultaneously overcoming problems of improper sizing and extended lead times on ordered materials. Following this process, the students tested the tricycle to ensure that it met the customer requirements set forth in the Design Verification Plan and Report (DVPR). At the end of this phase a functioning prototype was completed and staged for delivery and the final report was compiled. This remainder of this report details Team Trikeceratops’ progress from initial concept generation to prototype realization and explores each part of the aforementioned engineering design process in depth...|$|R
