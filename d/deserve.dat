This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still <b>deserve</b> approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E

5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes.
