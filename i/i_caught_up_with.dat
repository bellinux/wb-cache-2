I asked him as soon as <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him if he had not had orders to go with Lieut. Bubb to buy supplies. He made the reply that he was taking some dispatches through for the New York Herald.” Grouard told Captain Jack that “he was discharged from the time he quit the command.” They agreed {{to spend the night in}} Custer City and resume the race the next day. Grouard had changed horses six times on the road, killing three and “using three of them up so they never were any good afterwards.” Upon his arrival in Custer City, he was so exhausted that he had to be taken off his horse. After handing the dispatches over to U.S. Army couriers, Grouard wrote a note to Gen. Crook telling him what he had done and laid in bed for three days. On September 16, 1876, Captain Jack reached Fort Laramie at 7:00 p.m., nine hours behind a government courier. Crawford had ridden a distance of 350 miles in six days. Still, Crawford had Davenport’s dispatches on the wire five hours ahead of all other correspondents. On September 18, 1876, the New York Herald published Crawford's own story under the headline “Captain Jack’s Ride as a Bearer of Herald Despatches.” While, the adventure cost Captain Jack his job as a military scout, his daring ride to tell the news of the great victory at Slim Buttes made him a national celebrity. Captain Jack proudly described his feat to countless audiences in later years.|$|E

You didn't tell me very much--THAT you couldn't for your life; but I saw for myself that, strange to say, you had received your impression, and I felt therefore that there must indeed have been {{something out of the}} way for you so to betray it." [...] She was fully upon him now, and she confronted him with his proved sensibility to the occasion--confronted him because of her own uneasy need to profit by it. It came over her still more than at the time, it came over her that he had been struck with something, even HE, poor dear man; and that for this to have occurred there must have been much to be struck with. She tried in fact to corner him, to pack him insistently down, in the truth of his plain vision, the very plainness of which was its value; for so recorded, she felt, none of it would escape--she should have it at hand for reference. [...] "Come, my dear--you thought what you thought: in the presence of what you saw you couldn't resist thinking. I don't ask more of it than that. And your idea is worth, this time, quite as much as any of mine--so that you can't pretend, as usual, that mine has run away <b>with</b> me. <b>I</b> haven't <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> you. <b>I</b> stay where I am.

Now I can work round you." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{interviews}} {{after the}} race, Kanaan credited his team's fuel strategy {{for being the}} main factor in his victory. During many of the laps that Wheldon led, Kanaan drafted behind him to use less gasoline than normal, {{and he was able}} to stay on the track longer than other drivers as a result. He said of the strategy, [...] "that's what probably gave me the win." [...] On the other hand, Wheldon later said that his radio problem forced more [...] "conservative" [...] pit stop planning by himself and his team. Third-place finisher Franchitti said: [...] "We had to take the gamble to try to get the win. I thought we had as good a car as TK (Tony Kanaan) and Dan (Wheldon). I think I could have hung with them, but I don't think <b>I</b> could have <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] Matsuura admitted his first-lap accident was his fault and apologized to his Japanese fans. After his accident on the 135th lap, Andretti was taken to the track's infield care center for a precautionary X-ray scan of his right shoulder which showed a negative result. He said that he struggled with controlling his car but was happy. With his second-place finish, Wheldon gained the season points lead with 188, three ahead of Kanaan and 17 in front of Dixon. The standings were closely contested, with the top six drivers separated by 27 points.|$|R
