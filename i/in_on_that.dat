5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E
25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E
25|$|On 22 January, Japanese {{artillery}} began {{firing on}} the 2/12th's position, {{but it was}} unable {{to prevent them from}} taking Prothero II. Meanwhile, a small patrol from the 2/2nd Pioneers began exploiting the area to the north-east of Prothero II and subsequently managed to install itself in a position on the eastern extremity of Kankiryo Saddle. To the south, the 2/9th carried out reconnaissance around the area in front of their position around Green Sniper's Pimple, and located several Japanese bunkers. Deciding on an indirect approach, an Australian patrol was sent to the flanks and under the cover of heavy artillery, they scaled the steep sides of McCaughey's Knoll to take the position with the element of surprise. Earlier, the 2/10th had taken several attempts to secure Cam's Hill, including an unsuccessful assault on the Japanese rear with a flanking move through the Faria River. Throughout the night, the Japanese launched several unsuccessful counter-attack attempts, but these were repelled and on 24 January, the 2/9th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions continued to converge, squeezing the Japanese defenders between them. As a result, the Japanese were forced to abandon positions around the top of the Faria River and the Kankiryo Saddle and they began to withdraw to Crater Hill. The following day, patrols from the 2/10th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions determined that the Japanese were digging <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> position, and throughout the day the 2/9th attempted to outflank the position, attacking from behind while the 2/10th and 2/12th assaulted frontally from the south. These proved unsuccessful and during 26 January, the 2/9th sent two companies across Kankiryo Saddle, securing the 4100 feature before coming under heavy fire from the Japanese on Crater Hill, where they had dug-in strong defences along several sharp ridges.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{commonly}} known that drug addiction involves permanent synaptic plasticity of various neuronal circuits. [...] Neuroproteomics is being applied {{to study the}} effect of drug addiction across the synapse. [...] Research is being conducted by isolating distinct regions of the brain in which synaptic transmission takes place and defining the proteome for that particular region. [...] Different stages of drug abuse must be studied, however, in order to map out the progression of protein changes along {{the course of the}} drug addiction. [...] These stages include enticement, ingesting, withdrawal, addiction, and removal. [...] It begins with the change in the genome through transcription that occurs due to the abuse of drugs.

2500|$|A {{detailed}} map {{was published}} by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, going online on 18 October 2011. The map contains the cesium concentrations and radiation levels caused by the airborne radioactivity from the Fukushima nuclear reactor. This website contains both web-based and PDF versions of the maps, providing information by municipality as had been the case previously, but also measurements by district. The maps were intended to help the residents who had called for better information on contamination levels between areas of the same municipalities, using soil and air sample data already released. A grid is laid over a map of most of eastern Japan. Selecting a square in the grid zooms <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> area, at which point users can choose more detailed maps displaying airborne contamination levels, cesium-134 or -137 levels, or total caesium levels.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was also}} the period when Mitică Filipescu, his brother Grigorie's only son, was arrested for conspiring against the throne. According to Lăcusteanu, the {{incident}} {{was part of a}} Russophile and Filipescu-family intrigue, rather than a liberal or nationalist revolt. Similarly, the Andronescu brothers, clients of Grigore Filipescu, recorded a rumor that [...] "all the Filipescu clan was <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> conspiracy." [...] An ex officio member of the reconstructed Divan (or Ordinary Assembly), Vulpea helped maneuver the opposition against Ghica, alongside Vilara and the young jurist Gheorghe Bibescu: immediately after the legislative election of 1841, they drafted a special report, presented to Ghica by the entire Assembly. It depicted Ghica as an anti-patriot and a foreigner, emphasizing his Albanian origins. Ghica was eventually disgraced by Sultan Abdulmejid I and deposed in October 1842. Alongside Câmpineanu, Vilara, and Ion Ghica, Vulpea suggested the appointment of Mihail Sturdza, the reigning Prince of Moldavia, for the throne in Bucharest. Their proposed personal union was quickly vetoed by Russia.|$|E

2500|$|Brennan (who was now {{a senior}} at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was {{supportive}} of Jobs {{when he told her}} he planned to drop out of Reed because {{he did not want to}} spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again. In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: [...] "If I had never dropped <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts." ...|$|E
