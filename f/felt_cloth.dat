5000|$|Very {{few details}} of the linothorax's {{construction}} are found in Homer and other authors of this era. The linen fabric was reinforced by a metal sheet around the waist, usually in a scale mail style, over a leather or <b>felt</b> <b>cloth</b> called zoma (ζῶμα) (Il. 23.683, 4.216, Od.14.482). Metal plates or flaps called pteryges (πτέρυγες) were protecting {{various parts of the}} body (Xenophon, Anabasis 4.7.15). A [...] "zoster" [...] (ζωστήρ) was a belt, probably of leather with metal plates, worn around the waist over the other parts of the cuirass (Il. 4.132, 135,186 etc.).The actual method of constructing a linothorax is unknown as no example has survived from ancient times. The only piece of armor that resembles the linothorax was discovered in a tomb in Vergina, Northern Greece (the ancient Macedonian capital of Aegae). This armor, which was most probably worn for ceremony, was constructed from sheet iron with gold embellishments. It is probably an iron copy of a linothorax.|$|E
40|$|The {{redox flow}} battery (RFB) {{has been the}} subject of {{state-of-the-art}} research by several groups around the world. Most work commonly involves the application of various low-cost carbon-polymer composites, carbon <b>felts,</b> <b>cloth,</b> paper and their different variations for the electrode materials of the RFB. Usually, the carbon-polymer composite electrode has relatively high bulk resistivity and can be easily corroded when the polarised potential on the anode is more positive than that of oxygen evolution and this kind of heterogeneous corrosion may lead to battery failure due to electrolyte leakage. Therefore, carbon electrodes with high electrical conductivity, acid-resistance and electrochemical stability are highly desirable. This review discusses such issues in depth and presents an overview on future research directions that may help commercialise RFB technology. A comprehensive discussion is provided on the advances made using nanotechnology and it is envisaged that if this is combined with ionic liquid technology, major advantages could be realised. In addition the identification of RFB failure mechanisms by means of X-ray computed nano tomography is expected to bring added benefits to the technology...|$|R

50|$|Chain stitch, {{which is}} {{adaptable}} and {{relatively easy to}} create, was used in Persia for Resht embroidery, with densely worked flowers and arabesques on <b>felted</b> woollen <b>cloths.</b> A type of embroidery similar to heavy chain stitch, known as kurar, was previously used by Bedouin to create dresses {{for both men and}} women. It required four people, with each person carrying four threads which were either of varying colors or silver and gold.|$|R
5000|$|Since the 18th century, {{especially}} in the 20th century, along with the metal processing, the processing of wool and silk, etc., went also on. In the Grand Bazaar of Gjakova <b>felt</b> <b>cloth,</b> woollen and silk fabrics (cloths), woollen and silk pipings (galloons) etc. used to be produced and sold in great amounts and were exported in even greater amounts in the markets and fairs of the neighboring provinces of Balkan countries, in Medieval countries and in Central European countries, too. Beautiful and high quality carpets and rugs were produced and sold there. The year book ("Salname") of Prizren Vilayet of 1874 used to mention the great number of tailors (“terzis”), tanners (“tabaks”) and embroiderers. The tailors used to work, according to it, first class cord dolmans and waistcoats for women and men, but these products used to meet only the country's needs. But for their own needs, the inhabitants of kasaba (the town) used to produce a kind of rough woollen cloth-worsted cloth. This shows that the textile artisan production had exceeded the patriarchal borders and had entered widely into the road of production of goods for market.|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000234352300003 International audienceDue {{to their}} bad effects on human health, {{removing}} Volatile Organic Compounds from indoor air {{has become an}} issue of major interest. In this study, the potential use of six commercial activated carbon <b>felts</b> and <b>cloths</b> for indoor toluene removal was investigated. Both batch and dynamic adsorption studies were performed, at toluene concentrations ranging from 21 to 18160 mg m(- 3), for an air velocity representative of indoor air treatment (0. 37 m s(- 1)). Batch measurements showed that felts exhibited higher adsorption capacities at equilibrium than cloths at high toluene concentrations, whereas this trend may be inverted at low concentrations. Experimental isotherms and kinetics were satisfactorily fitted by the Langmuir-Freundlich model and the Linear Driving Force model respectively. No main differences between the adsorption kinetics of <b>felts</b> and <b>cloths</b> were reported. Dynamic adsorption capacities at saturation appeared {{to be higher than}} 120 mg g(- 1) for both <b>cloths</b> and <b>felts,</b> irrespective of relative humidity levels and toluene concentrations. The influence of relative humidity on the adsorption capacity of felts was not significant for the higher toluene concentration studied in dynamics (307 mg m(- 3)), whereas an increase in relative humidity induced a decrease in adsorption capacity at the lower toluene concentration (38 Mg m(. 3)). Moreover, experimental curves of breakthrough time versus thickness of medium were satisfactorily fitted by the Adams-Bohart model, and the critical thickness determined by this model appeared to be below 1. 3 mm, regardless of the medium or toluene concentration...|$|R

50|$|Wadding, is {{made from}} <b>felt,</b> paper, <b>cloth</b> or card and has several {{different}} uses. In shotguns, a card wad or other secure wadding is used between the powder and the shot charge to prevent pellets from dropping into the powder charge {{and on top of}} the shot charge to hold it in place in the barrel. In smooth bore muskets and most rifles used prior to cartridges being introduced in the mid-to late nineteenth century, wadding was used primarily to hold the powder in place. On most naval cannons, one piece of wadding was used to hold the powder in place and served the purpose of creating a better seal around the shot. Another was used to act as a plug to stop the shot rolling out because of the swaying of the ship.|$|R

In this study, the potential use of five media for particle removal was investigated: a <b>felt,</b> a <b>cloth,</b> and a knitted fabric made entirely of activated carbon fibers, and two prototype nonwovens made of different proportions of activated carbon and glass fibers. Dynamic filtration measurements were performed in experimental conditions as representative as possible of indoor air, with alumina particles (modal diameter: 0. 37 mu m), at an inlet concentration of 2, 500 particles cm(- 3) and for two different frontal velocities of air: 0. 37 and 0. 50 m s(- 1). Although this medium was not designed for filtration, felt exhibited a high initial filtration efficiency (74 %) for a low pressure drop (less than 210 Pa). Similarly, associating several layers of woven/knitted media in series led to high performances, as it reduced preferential paths for the airflow. Finally, prototype nonwovens appeared more efficient than activated carbon felt, but exhibited higher pressure drops...|$|R
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A <b>felt</b> or <b>cloth</b> washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|R
5000|$|The bucket hat {{or fishing}} hat emerged in 1900. Originally made from wool <b>felt</b> or tweed <b>cloth,</b> these hats were {{traditionally}} worn by Irish farmers and fishermen as {{protection from the}} rain, because the lanolin from the unwashed (raw) wool made these hats naturally waterproof. From the interwar years onwards, these [...] "Irish walking hats" [...] were quickly adopted internationally for country pursuits because, when folded, they could fit inside a coat pocket. If the hat fell in the mud, it could be easily cleaned with a damp sponge, {{and it could be}} reshaped using steam from a kettle. In the 1960s, it was widely seen in the TV series Gilligan's Island and was often worn by members of the Mod subculture.|$|R
5000|$|Players of bowed string {{instruments}} rub cakes or {{blocks of}} rosin on their bow hair {{so it can}} grip the strings and make them speak, or vibrate clearly. Extra substances such as beeswax, gold, silver, tin, or meteoric iron are sometimes added to the rosin to modify its stiction/friction properties, and (arguably) the tone it produces. Powdered rosin {{can be applied to}} new hair, for example with a <b>felt</b> pad or <b>cloth,</b> to reduce the time taken in getting sufficient rosin onto the hair. Rosin is often applied to the bow before playing the instrument.

There are also specific, distinguishing types for basses—for more see Bow (music).|$|R
5000|$|His first {{impression}} of the approach to China's westernmost oasis was of many sand heaps and little fertile soil. Commenting on the oasis itself, he said that [...] "it yielded good crops and a luxuriance of fruit and flowers." [...] How inviting the orchards, the city walls, the winding lanes, and the mudbrick walls of houses must have been! After the bleak and thinly populated Pamirs, how heart-warming the sight of streams of people coming and going, ponies and donkeys laden with goods, heralding an important trade center. Xuanzang went to the famous bazaar at Kashgar. [...] "One gets from this country <b>felt</b> and <b>cloth</b> of excellent quality as well as fine woolen materials. Moreover, the inhabitants are clever at weaving various kinds of fine, fleecy carpets." [...] Xuanzang also remarks that the people have green eyes, suggesting the Sogdian or East Iranian origin {{of some of the}} population.In Kashgar, there were hundreds of Buddhist monasteries with more than a thousand monks, most of whom were of a realist Hinayana school. Remains of two Buddhist sites near Kashgar still exist. The first, the Cave of Three Immortals, dating from the second century, is hewn from the cliffs of the Quiakmakh River. It now stands thirty feet high above the river bed. It has two chambers; traces of wall paintings survive in the left chamber. The second site, the ancient village of Hanoi, had been a thriving Buddhist settlement in Tang times. Xuanzang is believed to have visited the Mauri-tim stupa there. Sally Hovey Wriggins ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} of this chapter are to present gas and liquid filtrations, mainly focussing on the adsorption of organic compounds from fluids onto activated carbon fibers in their different forms (<b>cloth,</b> <b>felts,</b> knitted). The separation of target organics in complex mixtures and/or the purification of fluids (water, wastewater, air, biogas) are challenging. Different aspects {{are presented in}} order to describe the overall adsorption processes. The fluid flow patterns (aerodynamics or hydrodynamics) are shown according {{to the design of}} the adsorbers, and pressure drops are evaluated and modeled. For filtration-adsorption treatments, the main targets are volatile organic compounds or odorous molecules in air and organic micropollutants at trace levels in water. The designs and characteristics of these filters are presented through their performance in separation or purification as a function of operating conditions. Classic equations to model batch reactor isotherm curves or dynamic filter breakthrough curves are given and discussed. Some industrial achievements illustrate specific applications for water and air treatments. Lastly, future trends are presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The modern poker {{table is}} a form of card table which is often covered with baize (a type of <b>felt)</b> or speed <b>cloth</b> (a Teflon-coated fabric) to help the cards slide easily across the surface. It is either an actual table or a {{fold-out}} tabletop surface. Those used in professional televised poker feature [...] "pocketcams" [...] which can view a player's pocket, or hole cards. Such tables are usually fairly oval-shaped, with the players sitting around a curve of the table with a dealer facing them in an indented area of the table made specifically for the dealer. In amateur poker, tables are often oval, round or octagonal, using a rotating dealer position. The edge of the table is usually padded and raised slightly for the players to rest their arms, and this section is called the [...] "rail". There is often a section of wood between the rail and the playing surface; this is called the [...] "race track" [...] and often features cup holders as well.

40|$|Purpose: Sediment-microbial {{fuel cells}} (S-MFC) are bio-electrochemical devices that {{are able to}} oxidize organic matter {{directly}} into harvestable electrical power. The flux of organic matter into the sediment is rather low, therefore other researchers have introduced plants for a continues supply of organic matter to the anode electrode. Until now only interconnected materials have been considered as anode materials in S-MFC. Here granular carbon materials were investigated for their suitability as anode material in sediment microbial fuel cells. Materials and methods: Laboratory microcosms with 8 different electrode materials (granules, <b>felts</b> and <b>cloths)</b> were examined with controlled organic matter addition under brackish conditions. Current density, organic matter removal and microbial community composition were monitored using 16 S-rRNA gene PCR followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). The main parameters investigated were the influence of the amount of electrode material applied to the sediment, the size of the granular material and the electrode configuration. Results and discussion: Felt material had an overall superior performance in terms of current density per amount of applied electrode material i. e. felt and granular anode obtained similar current densities (approx. 50 – 60 mA/m 2) but felt materials required 29 % less material to be applied. Yet, when growing plants, granular carbon is more suited because it is considered to restore, upon disturbance, the electrical connectivity within the anode compartment. Small granules (0. 25 – 0. 5 mm) gave the highest current density compared to larger granules (1 - 5 mm) of the same material. Granules with a rough surface had a better performance compared to smooth granules of the same size. The different granular materials lead to a selection of distinct microbial communities for each material, as shown by DGGE. Conclusions: Granular carbon is suited as anode material for sediment microbial fuel cells. This opens the perspective for application of MFC in cultivated areas. In a wider context, the application of granular carbon electrodes can also be an option for in-situ bioremediation of contaminated soils...|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{surfaces}} is {{very important}} in computer vision. Color and texture of a surface are two key characteristics that influence the surface recognition process. Light reflected from a surface contains information about these two characteristics. The color of a surface determines how a surface reflects light of a specific wavelength, and the surface texture determines the amount of diffuse and specular reflection taking place from the surface. ^ A statistical approach has been developed for classification of surfaces based on the spatial intensity distribution of light reflected from the surfaces. In this approach, a surface is modelled as a collection of mirror-like micro-facets oriented randomly with respect to each other. The random orientations of the micro-facets give rise to spatial intensity distribution of the reflected light. The reflected light field is characterized by a probability density function, which is used for deriving first and second order features. The first order features are the mean and variance of the reflected intensities, while the second order features are based on the spatial correlation between the reflected intensities. A correlation matrix is formulated based on the co-occurrence of two given intensities separated by a given angular distance. Two classification schemes based on maximum-likelihood and nearest-neighbor decision rules are implemented on the feature sets. ^ Experimental results for the classification schemes are presented for a variety of sample surfaces. These include paper, <b>cloth,</b> <b>felt,</b> sandpaper, cork, crumpled and smooth aluminum foils, etc. The success rate of 80 - 100 % has been achieved for the two classification schemes. ^ In addition to these statistical features, other properties of textures such as gloss, contrast, roughness, etc., have also been measured from the reflected intensities. Parameters such as micro-facet slope function, micro-facet orientation function, etc., have been measured and used for predicting the statistics of the perceived texture. Techniques have been developed to reduce the computational burden associated with this reflection data based surface classification scheme {{in order to make it}} suitable for on-line operation. ...|$|R
