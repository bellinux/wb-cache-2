25|$|Gryce {{is rumored}} to have {{traveled}} to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship in 1951 to study with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. However, there is much confusion and rumor surrounding this period in Gryce's life, {{and there is no}} evidence to suggest that Gryce did receive a Fulbright or formally study with the two composers. Gryce did take two semesters off to study in Europe, but little is known about his travels. It is possible that he studied with the composers privately. While Gryce did propagate the Fulbright rumor himself to substantiate his credentials, Gryce had little <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about this time in his life.|$|E
500|$|David Leitch {{directed}} a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which {{was believed to}} be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to [...] "make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There was nothing <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> because we had said it." [...] Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films.|$|E
500|$|MercyMe's {{lead singer}} Bart Millard wrote [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] while touring {{in support of}} their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". The travel was exhausting, and Millard commented in an {{interview}} that, {{on one of the}} nights on tour, he [...] "went to bed just really frustrated... It started feeling like everything I was saying was the same. I just thought, I have nothing <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> So I went to bed with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up {{early in the morning and}} wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going back to sleep. Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.|$|E

While he allows Conrad {{two days a}} week off to see Dr. Berger and stays late with him to work out on the other days, Conrad does not like him.

2500|$|The {{criminal}} {{case against the}} men charged has been met with strong criticism as well as conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation. District Attorney Matt Stowe was elected to office {{in the summer of}} 2014 following the arrests and stated that he believes he was elected in part due to skepticism regarding the arrests and questions over whether enough evidence exists against them to obtain a conviction. [...] " [...] wanted another set of eyes on this Holly Bobo case; they weren't happy with everything that was coming out of there, and I think that they wanted someone else to take a look and someone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'We know what's going on.|$|E

2500|$|New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, who {{designated}} the film a New York Times critics' pick, {{said that the}} film [...] "shows {{the dark side of}} that war. It shows the unspeakable and lets us decide if the death of Bin Laden was worth the price we paid." [...] Continued Dargis: There is much <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the movie, which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden's hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by, among others, Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt), much of it shot to approximate the queasy, weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before– the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals– has led to this.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011, the {{soldiers}} of the Mexican Navy visited the three houses where the Cázares were abducted to investigate the crime scene. In November 2011, Mexican security forces arrested two suspects on federal charges for drug and weapon offenses. According to the agency's investigator Manuel Adolfo Benavides Parra, the Cázares identified the two men {{as part of the}} Gulf Cartel kidnapping ring. However, since the two suspects were arrested under federal charges, his agency was prevented from interrogating them. At the same time, a Tamaulipas law enforcement official stated that the case was under state jurisdiction and refused to comment on the two detainees arrested for federal offenses. [...] "We have nothing <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] ", he added. U.S. authorities did not give details on the other alleged suspect arrested on Texas soil either. On November 2011, a friend of the Cázares managed to put them in contact with Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro, a high-ranking official within the Mexican government that said was willing to help in the kidnapping investigation. A couple of days after being in contact with the family, however, Zamora was victim of a tragic helicopter accident along with Secretary of Interior Francisco Blake Mora. In December 2011, the Cázares case was received by Gualberto Ramírez, coordinator of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the now-extinct Subprocuraduría de Investigación Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} John D. Luerssen {{wrote that}} What to Do When You Are Dead [...] "ups the punk/emo ante" [...] with [...] "fabulously" [...] composed songs, {{as well as}} a [...] "desire to challenge the norms of a movement that has grown increasingly stale". He described Jorgensen as going [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "flirting with his inner Aaron Lewis". Luerssen called the band's choice of working with Machine as being [...] "a risk that paid off". Chart Attack called the album a [...] "surprisingly meaty sophomore record," [...] with the group's [...] "dynamic double-guitar attack" [...] benefiting from Machine's [...] "prog-metal predilections". Chart Attack concluded with: [...] "Songs about dead people have rarely sounded so damned full of life." [...] Raziq Rauf of Drowned in Sound wrote that the record had [...] "two great songs on here that fill the unashamed emo cynic with hope, only to be let down" [...] by the remainder of the album. He {{went on to say that}} a [...] "slight redemption can be made" [...] with the album's title, but aside from that, [...] "there's nothing <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that you've not read before". LAS Magazine writer David Spain called the album [...] "an interesting notch along the battered branch of emo's legacy," [...] with the band giving [...] "its peers food for thought". Spain noted that the group [...] "didn't just set out to create another 40-minute schmaltz fest; they vested thought and idea into their work". Spain concluded by mentioning how the band [...] "succeed in creating a surprisingly original work in a drowning genre".|$|E
