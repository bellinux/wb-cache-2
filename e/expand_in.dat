5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to <b>expand.</b> <b>In</b> 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} unpopularity {{of some of}} his measures, Alexios's efforts had been vital to the {{survival}} of the empire. Financially and militarily bankrupt, and facing wave after wave of foreign invasion, the empire he inherited had been on the point of collapse. His long struggle to protect and restore the strength of the empire had been exhausting, but Alexios's successors inherited a viable state with both the internal stability and the military and financial resources, to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the future.|$|E
5|$|The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are {{club-shaped}} {{with long}} stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are sessile, that is, attached {{directly to the}} surface of the basidium, rather than by a short stalk (a sterigmata). Spores measure about 15 to 20µm long by 8 to 12µm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, and notched at one end. During development, the spores are separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells lining the inner walls of the peridiole. The spores <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.|$|E

5|$|The town {{continued}} to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century, annexing Caversham across the River Thames in Oxfordshire in 1911. Compared {{to many other}} English towns and cities, Reading suffered little physical damage during {{either of the two}} World Wars that afflicted the 20th century, although many citizens were killed or injured in the conflicts. One significant air raid occurred on 10 February 1943, when a single Luftwaffe plane machine-gunned and bombed the town centre, resulting in 41 deaths and over 100 injuries.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} machinations of Yelü Yixin, {{the only other}} event of note from Emperor Daozong's rule was a war fought between 1092 and 1102 between the Liao and a Mongolian, {{possibly}} Tatar tribe, group known as the Zubu. The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> that direction. In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao to capture and kill the Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. The war against the Zubu was the last successful military campaign waged by the Liao dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Barnette's first {{action as}} mayor {{was to write}} a letter to Washington, D.C., asking the federal {{government}} to sell its military food stores from posts near the town, thus alleviating the food shortage. This move was followed by others: licensing a telephone company, providing for garbage collection, fire protection, and a one-room school (which shut down later that winter for lack of funds). Barnette used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family. One of Barnette's brothers-in-law, James W. Hill, was given a 25-year contract to provide electricity, drinking water, and steam heat to the city. In 1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to <b>expand.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the local telephone system, Fairbanks was connected to the outside world via the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System, which was expanded from Eagle to Nome in 1903 and passed through Fairbanks.|$|E

Handel (Rodelinda, 1981) and Martinů (The Greek Passion, 1981) {{were added to}} the company's repertoire, and in 1983 Das Rheingold was staged in the WNO's first Ring cycle, followed by the other three operas of the cycle over the next two years. Das Rheingold, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung were conducted by the company's musical director, Richard Armstrong; Die Walküre (1984) was conducted by Goodall; it was seen as a coup for the company to secure his services – he was described by The Guardian as the greatest living Wagnerian conductor – but the casting of the whole cycle was criticised for some serious weaknesses among the principal singers, and reviewers were generally unimpressed by Göran Järvefelt's production.|$|E
5|$|East Lansing is {{very much}} a college town, with 60.2% of the {{population}} between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah's push to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the school's name {{changed to}} the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed {{to the modern}} Master of Business Administration (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered {{primarily}} to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year. Under Dean Karl Hill, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus {{with the construction of}} a new dormitory and the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976–1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third. Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, Plymouth has {{experienced}} rapid growth and development. As in many South Shore towns, Plymouth became {{more accessible to}} Boston in the early 1970s with improved railroads, highways, and bus routes. Furthermore, the town's inexpensive land costs and low tax rates were factors in the town's significant population rise. Plymouth's population grew from 18,606 residents in 1970 to 45,608 residents in 1990, a 145% increase in 20 years. The population has continued to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> recent years. While Plymouth has already surpassed several Massachusetts cities in population, the town is still officially regarded as a town, as {{it has not been}} re-chartered as a city and continues to be governed by a board of selectmen rather than a mayor. Plymouth has emerged as a major economic and tourist center of the South Shore.|$|E
5|$|Moderate easterly {{wind shear}} {{that had been}} {{affecting}} the developing system began to relax almost immediately after formation, allowing upper-level outflow to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> most directions and the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Adrian. A small central dense overcast materialized early on June19, followed shortly thereafter by hints of an eye-like feature. Thus, in accordance with increasing satellite intensity estimates, Adrian was upgraded to the season's first hurricane by 00:00UTC on June20 while located about 485mi (780km) south-southeast of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The storm further organized to attain its peak as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h) as the aforementioned eye-like feature became readily apparent in satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|No Hurrian {{names are}} {{recorded}} in the pre-Akkadian period, although the name of prince Ultum-Huhu is difficult to understand as Semitic. During the Akkadian period, both Semitic and Hurrian names were recorded, as the Hurrians appears to {{have taken advantage of}} the power vacuum caused by the destruction of the pre-Akkadian kingdom, in order to migrate and <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the region. The post-Akkadian period Tell Brak had a strong Hurrian element, and Hurrian named rulers, although the region was also inhabited by Amorite tribes. A number of the Amorite Banu-Yamina tribes settled the surroundings of Tell Brak during the reign of Zimri-Lim of Mari, and each group used its own language (Hurrian and Amorite languages). Tell Brak was a center of the Hurrian-Mitannian empire, which had Hurrian as its official language. However, Akkadian was the region's international language, evidenced by the post-Akkadian and Mitannian eras tablets, discovered at Tell Brak and written in Akkadian.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads {{as the dominant}} form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and medical waste. A number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E
5|$|Banding {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Like most of Borneo, {{this area}} was once {{under the control of}} the Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during the Brunei Civil War. Since the 18th century, Sandakan start to be ruled by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1855, when Spanish power began to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the Philippine archipelago, they began to {{restrict}} the trade of foreign nations with Sulu by establishing a port in Zamboanga and issuing a ruling which declared that ships wanting to engage in trade with the Sulu Archipelago must first visit the Spanish port. In 1860, the Sultanate of Sulu became important to the British as their archipelago could allow the British to dominate trade routes from Singapore to Mainland China. But in 1864, William Frederick Schuck, a German ex-member for the German consular service arrived in Sulu and met Sultan Jamal ul-Azam, who encouraged him to remain in Jolo. Schuck associated himself with the Singapore-German trading firm of Schomburg and began working in the interest of the Sultan and Datu Majenji, who was an overlord in the island of Tawi-Tawi. While he continued his voyage to Celebes, he decided to open his first headquarters at Jolo. Large quantities of arms, opium, textiles and tobacco from Singapore were shipped to Tawi-Tawi in exchange for slaves from the Sultanate.|$|E

5|$|Matt Damon is an American actor, {{producer}} and screenwriter. He made his screen debut {{at the age}} of 18 with a minor role in the 1988 film Mystic Pizza. After appearing in a series of supporting parts in much of the 1990s, Damon was cast by Francis Ford Coppola as the lead of the 1997 legal drama The Rainmaker. His breakthrough came later that year when he played the title role of an unrecognized genius in Good Will Hunting, a drama which he also co-wrote with Ben Affleck. Damon and Affleck won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Damon was nominated for Best Actor. He followed it by playing the title roles of a soldier in Steven Spielberg's war drama Saving Private Ryan (1998) and of the criminal Tom Ripley in the thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), both of which gained critical and commercial success. Damon's profile continued to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> the 2000s, as he took on starring roles in two lucrative film franchises. He featured as a con man in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Trilogy (2001–07) and played the titular spy Jason Bourne in four of the five films in the Bourne series (2002–16).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, {{there were signs}} of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that could take advantage of Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to <b>expand</b> <b>in</b> Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{railway network}} joined Burton in August 1839, {{which made it}} much more {{economical}} to distribute beer throughout the country. In 1842 William Worthington entered into partnership with Thomas Robinson, and the business traded as Worthington & Robinson. By 1861 Worthington employed 191 men and boys. Worthington dissolved the Robinson partnership in 1864, in order for his sons to acquire the business. The company became known as Worthington and Company, the co-partners being: William (1799-1871), {{with two of his}} sons, William Henry (1826-1894) and Calvert (1830-1871), who were joined two years later by his youngest son, Albert Octavius (1844-1918). After the introduction of agencies in British conurbations from the mid-1860s, the company began to rapidly <b>expand.</b> <b>In</b> 1866 the Prince of Wales awarded the company the Royal Warrant. Worthington pioneered brewing science from 1866 by employing a chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, who led the world in separation and cultivation of pure yeast strains. From 1872 the Worthington brewery was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company had previously resisted employing a laboratory, for fear that the public would perceive the scientific apparatus as a means of doctoring the beer. In order to differentiate themselves from other brewers, Worthington labelled their beers with alphabetical letters: their Burton Ales were called G, F and D, their light dinner ale was labelled M. Worthington E was an India Pale Ale, a competitor to Bass Pale Ale. By 1880, Worthington's IPA was challenging Bass's sales in the home market.|$|E
