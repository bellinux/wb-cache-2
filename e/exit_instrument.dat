The tool that we have designed allows incoming sunlight to be caught by a reflection system of flat mirrors, appropriately tilted, thus producing a solar ray that <b>exits</b> the <b>instrument</b> with a different inclination. We created new angular relationships between the gnomonic hole and the astronomic data engraved along the sundial in two case studies of historic sundials that are now inactive and abandoned.

40|$|AbstractA new {{instrument}} is described that couples a reverse-geometry mass spectrometer operating at 5 kV a high-pressure, temperature-variable drift reactor that operates at thermal energies. The first-stage mass spectrometer is a home-built instrument {{with the same}} dimensions and ion optics as a V. G. Instruments ZAB- 2 F. Ions <b>exiting</b> this <b>instrument</b> are decelerated to between 0 and 10 eV {{and focused on the}} entrance hole of the drift cell. The drift cell is 4. 0 cm long and 1. 52 cm in diameter and has a uniform drift field provided by stepped voltages applied to eight field guard rings. Pressure in the cell can be varied from 0 to 2 torr, and temperatures from 100 to 500 K. Ions exiting the cell are accelerated, passed through a quadrupole mass filter, and detected by an electron multiplier. A description is given of the ion optics used to focus and decelerate the beam from the first-stage mass spectrometer. Substantial analysis and discussion are given to ion energies in the cell and methods of pressure measurement. Experimental results obtained compare well with data in the literature when available. A new result on mobilities of Co+ ions in helium is presented. The data indicate that ions are present in both the ground state and metastable excited electronic state, exhibiting substantially different mobilities...|$|R
50|$|Early in aviation, it was {{difficult}} - if not impossible - to supply uninterrupted power in aircraft. Saunders-Roe solved this problem by putting an ionising gas (tritium; 3H) in small tubes. Tritium was discovered in 1934 by Lord Rutherford. The tubes ("Betalights") are made of borosilicate glass. The inside of the tubes is coated with a fluorescent powder, which glows {{as a result of}} the ionizing radiation of the tritium gas. Such a tube emits light for 15 years. Betalights were used to illuminate the flight <b>instruments,</b> <b>exit</b> signs and corridors of the aircraft produced by Saunders-Roe. When Saunders-Roe was acquired by Westland Helicopters production continued via Saunders-Roe Developments Ltd of North Hyde Road, Hayes, Middlesex (the former Fairey Aviation Head office). Betalight production was made independent under the name SRBT (Saunders-Roe Betalight Technology). A factory was established in Pembroke, Ontario, Canada, where tritium supplies are readily available. Today betalights are used in self luminous escape-route signs, under the product name Betalux.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-coherence interferometric sensor developed by FOGALE nanotech. Based on the well-established principle of low coherence interferometry, the sensor {{works as a}} comparator of optical path lengths. An optical path length in the measurement interferometer arm containing a target object is compared with an optical path length in an internal delay line. In contrast to classical laser interferometry, low coherence interferometry benefits from a higher robustness with respect to environmental disturbances {{and the ability to}} detect multiple target surfaces during one measurement, i. e. during one scan of the delay line. This makes it ideally suited for in-process metrology in industrial environments. Measurement ranges are between a few mm up to 400 mm.

50|$|To use {{an optical}} instrument, the {{entrance}} pupil of the viewer's eye must be aligned with and be of similar size to the <b>instrument's</b> <b>exit</b> pupil. This properly couples the optical {{system to the}} eye and avoids vignetting. (The entrance pupil of the eye {{is the image of}} the anatomical pupil as seen through the cornea.) The location of the exit pupil thus determines the eye relief of an eyepiece. Good eyepiece designs produce an exit pupil of diameter approximating the eye's apparent pupil diameter, and located about 20 mm away from the last surface of the eyepiece for the viewer's comfort. If the disc is larger than the eye's pupil, light will be lost instead of entering the eye; if smaller, the view will be vignetted. If the disc is too close to the last surface of the eyepiece, the eye will have to be uncomfortably close for viewing; if too far away, the observer will have difficulty maintaining the eye's alignment with the disc.|$|R
40|$|Ground-based Instrumentation for AstronomyHermes, a {{high-resolution}} fiber-fed echelle spectrograph {{is currently}} under {{development for the}} 1. 2 -meter Mercator Telescope at the Roque De Los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma. The optical design {{is based on a}} large R 2. 6 echelle grating, operating in quasi-Littrow and white-pupil configuration, and a double-prism cross-disperser. This instrument records the complete optical spectrum from 380 to 875 nm in one single exposure on a 2 k x 4 k CCD. Order separation is sufficiently large to record two interleaved spectra simultaneously through two 60 -mum core fibers: one spectrum of the object and one of the nearby sky or, alternatively [...] of a wavelength calibration lamp for high-precision radial velocity measurements. This type of observations also benefits from the high instrumental stability, owing to bench-mounting the spectrograph with a fixed configuration in a precisely temperature and humidity controlled chamber. Modest telescope size calls for high detection efficiency and great efforts in the design of both the fiber link and the spectrograph itself go in that direction. We aim at a peak-efficiency larger than 25 % for the complete system. With a large fiber aperture of 2. 3 arcsec. the resolving power lamda/deltalamda is 50000, a value that can be increased to 90000 with an adjustable slit at the fiber <b>exit.</b> This <b>instrument</b> mounted on a flexible telescope has a wide astronomical scope, going from asteroseismology to binary star research and chemical studies of stars and circumstellar material.

In the first part, the goal is to separate the instruments from the background and from irrelevant objects.

40|$|Problem Statement: Despite {{the fact}} that falls {{comprise}} {{a large percentage of}} hospital injuries, little is known quantitatively about what induces patient falls, particularly with regard to hospital bed ingress/egress and bedside transitions. This is concerning since many studies conclude that over 50 % of falls occur during activities related to leaving the bed and during in-room patient ambulation. Objective: Since most fall studies to date have focused on qualitative measurements and assessments, the focus of our study was to quantify key temporal/spatial gait parameters in a fall-prone population during hospital bed egress. Methods: Fourteen older adults (72. 5 +/- 10. 1 years) were recruited with a history of falls (Morse Fall Scale value> 50). An 18 -camera motion tracking system (NaturalPoint, Corvallis, OR) was used to track full-body biomechanics. Participants <b>exited</b> an adjustable, <b>instrumented</b> hospital bed without side rails at three bed heights calculated as a percentage of their lower leg length. Movements consisted of sit-to-stand transition and short ambulation from the bedside to a chair. As a control, the same events were captured from the chair (fixed height with arm rests) to the bed. Results: Time to first step initiation (TFSI), defined as first toe-off following sit-to-stand, and time to first step (TFS), defined as first heel strike, showed significant differences in high bed and low bed condition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDespite {{the fact}} that falls {{comprise}} {{a large percentage of}} hospital injuries, little is known quantitatively about what induces patient falls. Our study quantified kinematic and temporal parameters at key events of the sit-to-walk movement during hospital bed egress. Sixty five older adults (67. 6 +/- 14. 1 years) with a history of falls (Morse Fall Scale score 53. 3 +/- 21. 4) comprised the study population. Full-body biomechanics during unconstrained sit-to-walk movements were captured as participants <b>exited</b> an adjustable, <b>instrumented</b> hospital bed at three bed heights classified as high, medium, and low. Trunk momentum during peak vertical velocity (i. e. rising) was significantly smaller during high bed exits than the other two bed heights. Change in center of mass velocity between seat-off and first toe-off was significantly faster during medium bed exits vs low bed exits. Temporal variables in low bed conditions revealed delays in rising and gait initiation. These temporal delays indicate lack of confidence and prioritization of postural stability. Since sit-to-walk momentum values were not significantly different between bed heights, this suggests individuals are using similar strategies to generate motion but executing the motion differently in each condition. Therefore lower bed heights may be inappropriate for fall-prone individuals due to increased postural demands. If an optimal setting for hospital bed height exists, our data indicate it may lie in the range of knee height or slightly higher...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTor is {{a popular}} low-latency {{anonymity}} network. However, Tor does not protect against the exploitation of an insecure application to reveal the IP address of, or trace, a TCP stream. In addition, because of the linkability of Tor streams sent together over a single circuit, tracing one stream sent over a circuit traces them all. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether this linkability allows in practice to trace {{a significant number of}} streams originating from secure (i. e., proxied) applications. In this paper, we show that linkability allows us to trace 193 % of additional streams, including 27 % of HTTP streams possibly originating from ''secure'' browsers.

We show that BitTorrent users on Tor are over-represented in some countries as compared to BitTorrent users outside of Tor.

40|$|Monitoring {{biological}} relevant reactions on {{the single}} molecule level based on fluorescence spectroscopy techniques {{has become one}} of the most promising approaches for understanding a variety of phenomena in biophysics, biochemistry and life science. By applying techniques of fluorescence spectroscopy to labeled biomolecules a manifold of important parameters becomes accessible. For example, molecular dynamics, energy transfer, and ligand-receptor reactions can be monitored at the molecular level. This huge application field was and still is a major drive for innovative optical methods as it opens the door for new quantitative insights of molecular interactions on a truly micro- and nano-scopic scale. This thesis contributes new single molecule detection (SMD) concepts, correlation analysis and optical correlation spectroscopy to study fluorophores or labeled biomolecules close to a surface. The search beyond the classical confocal volume towards improved confinement was a key objective. In a first approach, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) using near field light sources to achieve highly confined observation volumes for detecting and measuring fluorophores up to micromolar concentration was investigated. In a second approach, FCS and fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA) based on dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was conceived to achieve a common observation volume for dual-color fluorescence measurements. This resulted in two novel fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy instruments providing observation volumes of less than 100 al. The first instrument generates a near field observation volume around and inside nano-apertures in an opaque metal film. Back-illumination of such an aperture results in a highly confined excitation field at the distal aperture <b>exit.</b> This <b>instrument</b> was characterized with FCS and observation volumes as small as 30 al were measured. The second instrument confines the observation volume with total internal reflection (TIR) at a glass-water interface. Today, the last-generation instrument provides a dual-color ps pulsed excitation and time-resolved detection for coincidence analysis and time-correlated single photon counting. It was characterized with FCS and FIDA and observation volumes of 70 al to 100 al were achieved. Moreover, the presence of the interface favors emission into the optically denser medium, such that nearly 60 % of the emitted fluorescence can be collected. This very efficient light collection resulted in a two- to three-fold stronger fluorescence signal and led to a high signal to background ratio, which makes this instrument particularly suitable for SMD studies on surfaces. In parallel to these experimental investigations, a theoretical analysis of the total SMD process including an analysis of optical focus fields, molecule-interface interactions, as well as the collection and detection efficiency was performed. This analysis was used as a guideline for steady instrument improvements and for the understanding of the SMD process. Finally, SMD concepts were applied for a first investigation of in vitro expression of an odorant receptor and for monitoring the vectorial insertion into a solid-supported lipid membrane. These receptors were incorporated and immobilized in the lipid membrane. With increasing expression time, an increasing amount of receptors as well as an increasing aggregation was observed. The incorporation density and the receptor aggregation were investigated with TIRF microscopy and image correlation spectroscopy...|$|R
