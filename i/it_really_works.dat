In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does {{take a while to}} kick in, but it is a very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing".

[...] A reviewer for TV Central wrote, [...] "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other.
