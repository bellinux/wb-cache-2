500|$|Chicago's bid was {{supported}} by major preliminary corporate commitments, philanthropic efforts by wealthy Chicagoans, promised planning participation by {{a wide range of}} community and government leaders, and the enthusiasm of the citizenry. Local support for the bid on the South Side, particularly in the Washington Park and Woodlawn community areas, was divided. Ben Joravsky, a Chicago Reader columnist, was one of the strongest critics of the Chicago 2016 bid. However, 2007 opinion polls indicated 76 percent public support. [...] In 2009, as the final selection approached, opponents of the bid became vocal even though organizers seemed to be pleased with the bid's progress and presentation. Peter Ueberroth stated, [...] "Chicago is <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> and we are impressed by that." ...|$|E

This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> with it or not.".|$|E

He made his debut in the opening match of 2010–11, a 3–1 victory over Forest Green, and was substituted in the 80th minute. Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 4–0 victory over Altrincham on 30 August. A red card in the 61st minute of a 1–0 defeat at Gateshead on 2 October for a high challenge resulted in a three match suspension. He finished the season with 38 appearances and six goals.|$|E

After we had ridden about four miles, keeping nearly parallel with the river, it struck me that we were not <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction--the right one for me, at any rate.

Perhaps you will ask me how I could tell which was which on such a night. I answer that it was by the wind.

In this hope he kept steadily advancing, until he found himself in the midst of those rocky fastnesses which divide the waters that flow into the Atlantic from those that flow into the Pacific Ocean.

Judging, therefore, from the present position of the sun, which was not very high, I concluded that we were moving toward the north, and therefore in the right direction. How far off the steamer might be I had no idea, for I was not accustomed to judging distances at sea; but I believed that if we were careful of our strength, and if the ocean continued as smooth as it now was, we might eventually reach the vessel, provided she were yet afloat.|$|E
40|$|Goal-based {{learning}} (GBL) {{has long}} been used for teaching (Schank and Kass, 1996) and training (Collins, 1994), and game playing is also very widely used (Fudenberg and Levine, 1998). When both are used together it can become a winning combination that focuses students? attention, dismisses precepts about a subject, lowers barriers to preferred learning-styles and open minds to new tools, ideas and concepts. The combination can be achieved using basic traditional physical props (e. g. pens and paper) or advanced internet technology.

60|$|Maxwell, now, at least, {{knew that}} he had got his play <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> again. He felt a fresh {{pleasure}} in returning to the old lines after his excursion in the region of comedy, and he worked upon them with fresh energy. He rehabilitated the love-business as {{he and his wife had}} newly imagined it, and, to disguise the originals the more effectively, he made the girl, whom he had provisionally called Salome, more like himself than Louise in certain superficial qualities, though in an essential nobleness and singleness, which consisted with a great deal of feminine sinuosity and subtlety, she remained a portrait of Louise. He was doubtful whether the mingling of characteristics would not end in unreality, but she was sure it would not; she said he was so much like a woman in the traits he had borrowed from himself that Salome would be all the truer for being like him; or, at any rate, she would be finer, and more ideal. She said that it was nonsense, the way people regarded women as altogether different from men; she believed they were very much alike; a girl was as much the daughter of her father as of her mother; she alleged herself as proof of the fact that a girl was often a great deal more her father's daughter, and she argued that if Maxwell made Salome quite in his own spiritual image, no one would dream of criticising her as unwomanly. Then he asked if he need only make Atland in her spiritual image to have him the manliest sort of fellow. She said that was not what she meant, and, in any case, a man could have feminine traits, and be all the nicer for them, but, if a woman had masculine traits, she would be disgusting. At the same time, if you drew a man from a woman, he would be ridiculous.|$|E
60|$|But I am leaving {{myself and}} my mules an unconscionable time upon the hill; scarcely, however, so long as I was there in reality, for it was getting dusk when I reached the foot, just three hours after my arrival at the top. There was no camp in sight, and, {{although}} {{we knew it was}} still six miles distant, we were ignorant of the direction in which it lay. Fortunately, none of the loads had shifted, and we were thus enabled to push past great numbers of animals who were standing with their loads upon the ground beside them. It was a very weary and unpleasant six-miles’ march. There was no moon, and it soon became extremely dark; and as the way was a mere track, we were quite ignorant whether we were <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> or not. Of course we followed mules in front of us, but there was no knowing whether they were going right—for a mule stopping for a minute, for a readjustment of the load, would lose sight of the one in advance, and would be just as likely as not to go in the wrong direction, and inevitably be followed by all in his rear. The way was across an undulating plain, with many deep nullahs covered with trees, and so dark that we could not see our horses’ ears. There was very little shouting now; everyone rode or walked along in a sort of sulky silence; the pace was of the slowest, the mules being scarcely able to crawl along. We could not pick our way, for we could not see the ground. Some got off and led their horses, others trusted to their horses’ eyes, and it was astonishing how well the animals picked their way; still there were some awkward falls. Even if one escaped these greater dangers, it was not pleasant to be caught by a bramble suddenly between the eyes, or to be nearly borne over the crupper of the horse by a stiff bough under the chin. At last, just when we had arrived at the conclusion that we must have missed our road, {{and that it would be}} better to draw off the way and pitch our tent until daybreak, we saw the camp-lights in the distance, and, after another mile’s travelling, arrived here, as I began this letter by saying, at half-past nine o’clock.|$|E

Although Warner Bros. spent large sums on albums that sold poorly, {{and there were some}} missteps in its promotion strategy, the presence of unorthodox acts like the Grateful Dead and critically acclaimed 'cult' performers like Newman and Parks, combined with the artistic freedom that the label afforded them, proved significant in building Warner Bros.' reputation and credibility.
