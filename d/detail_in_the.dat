5|$|Although not {{described}} in <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1966 act, SHPOs eventually became {{integral to the}} process of listing properties on the National Register. The 1980 amendments of the 1966 law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the National Register. Several 1992 amendments of the NHPA added a category to the National Register, known as Traditional Cultural Properties: those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups.|$|E

He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later additions to the existing patents.|$|E
5|$|Many English villages {{were given}} their shape in this period, {{and almost all}} are {{described}} in some <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eleventh century Domesday Book. Hoskins identifies three major types of village: those around a green or central square, as at Finchingfield in Essex; those along a single street, like Henley in Arden in Warwickshire; and those consisting of apparently haphazardly scattered dwellings, like Middle Barton near Hoskins's home in Oxfordshire.|$|E

5|$|The Natural History is {{generally}} divided into the organic {{plants and animals}} and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in each section.

The European release of the game {{was released}} in English, German and French, and had the title changed to Mystic Quest Legend to avoid confusion with Final Fantasy Adventure, which had been released in Europe as Mystic Quest. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first unveiled in June at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it was a popular venue, and the game was later presented in more <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fall 1992 issue of the Ogopogo Examiner.|$|E

5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was then working on a large {{consumer}} budget survey. Ideas from this project later {{became a part of}} his Theory of the Consumption Function. Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|HAL Laboratory {{developed}} Super Smash Bros. Melee, with Masahiro Sakurai as {{the head}} of production. The game {{was one of the first}} games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening full motion video sequence that would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screenshots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, with references to changes from its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E

5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 third edition was {{reviewed}} in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He praised the increased level of <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new edition, which adds {{additional information on}} geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The Aix Basin {{was first}} {{excavated}} for fossils in 1869 by French paleontologist Philippe Matheron. In the 1950s, Raymond Dughi and Francois Sirugue, {{a pair of}} French paleontologists working for the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle Aix-en-Provence, extensively studied the basin's fossil eggshells. They divided the eggs they had found into ten different types, {{but they did not}} describe them in <b>detail.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s, further work was done by the French paleontologist P.

5|$|The sets {{representing}} the interior {{rooms of the}} Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5|$|Before the Fourth Test, Fingleton added 52 against Border and 110 in an innings {{win over}} Transvaal. His 108 in the Fourth Test {{was more than}} South Africa's entire second innings of 98, and scored at almost a run a minute. In the Fifth Test, the pair {{combined}} for another century stand. Each of the three matches resulted in an innings victory for Australia as the series was taken 4–0. Fingleton ended the Test series with 478 runs at 79.66. Against Natal at Durban, he made his highest first class score of 167, his second century against the provincial side for the season. He ended the tour {{with a total of}} 1192 runs at 74.50, including six centuries. Despite his rapid scoring in South Africa, Fingleton's achievements went largely unheralded at home; at the time, England and Australia were by far the strongest Test teams and media coverage of the tour was scant. There was little <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reports apart from the scores and Fingleton was still described as a slow scorer, something that angered him.|$|E
5|$|Diệm spent {{little time}} on {{detailed}} defence and policy discussions with Australian officials during the trip, {{because of his}} extensive meetings with Catholic leaders. Although Diệm had signalled his intentions to discuss defence relations during the visit, these did not materialise. At {{the end of the}} visit, Diệm and Menzies released a bilateral statement, announcing that they would increase the magnitude of the Colombo Plan, a program under which Asian students could study abroad in Western nations. However, there was little <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> announcements relating to anti-communism, with only general expressions of Australian support. Diệm had previously stated that if North Vietnam attacked the south, he would send the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to land in the Red River Delta in the north and retaliate. This was contrary to the air attack plans of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), which had vowed to defend the south under the provisions of the Manila Treaty. Despite the public statements of support, the Australian government never shared the details of the SEATO plans with Diệm.|$|E
