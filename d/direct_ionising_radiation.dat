In this paper, {{a new type of}} planar silicon PIN photodiode is presented, in which both p+ and n+ electrodes are located {{on the same side of}} the device. The design offers highly efficient optical coupling between the backside and scintillator, providing a fill factor of close to 100 %. The performance of this detector is modelled using the ISE-TCAD simulator and its electrical and spectroscopic characteristics are experimentally investigated for the case of <b>direct</b> interaction of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> and also with an attached CsI(Tl) scintillator. The energy resolutions obtained at room temperature View the MathML source at 662 keV (scintillated) and 27 keV (direct) were 6. 3 % and 7. 0 % respectively, measured at full width at half maximum (FWHM). The new detector can be easily manufactured into arrays, for a variety of imaging (instrumentation) applications...|$|R

40|$|Background: A new {{initiative}} {{was introduced in}} Ireland following legislative changes that allowed nurses with special training to prescribe <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> (X-ray) for the first time. A small number of studies on nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> in other contexts have {{found it to be}} broadly as safe as <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> prescribing by physicians. Sociological literature on perceptions of safety indicate that these tend to be shaped by the ideological position of the professional rather than based on objective evidence. Objectives: To describe, compare and analyse perceptions of the safety of a nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> initiative across three occupational groups: nursing, radiography and medicine. Design: A cross-sectional survey design. Settings: Participants were drawn from a range of clinical settings in Ireland. Sample: Respondents were 167 health professionals comprised of 49 nurses, 91 radiographers, and 27 physicians {{out of a total of}} 300 who were invited to participate. Non-probability sampling was employed and the survey was targeted specifically at health professionals with a specific interest in, or involvement with, the development of the nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> initiative in Ireland. Methods: Comparisons of perspectives on the safety of nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> across the three occupational groups captured by questionnaire were analysed using the Kruskal Wallis H test. Pairwise post hoc tests were conducted using the Mann Whitney U test. Results: While the majority of respondents from all three groups perceived nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> to be safe, the extent to which this view was held varied. A higher proportion of nurses was found to display confidence in the safety of nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> compared to physicians and radiographers with differences between nurses’ perceptions and those of the other two groups being statistically significant. Conclusion: That an occupational patterning emerged suggests that perceptions about safety and risk of nurse prescribing of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> are socially constructed according to the vantage point of the professional and may not reflect objective measures of safety. These findings need to be considered more broadly in the context of ideological barriers to expanding the role of nurses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> induces {{different}} and diverse effects in cells. Early and late response genes are {{induced by the}} radiation stress. The signal transduction for genes regulated by <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> involves the activation of different kinases. However, the localisation of the triggering elements for the regulation of genes after <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> has not been characterised. The aim of this thesis was to localise and identify elements responsible for the regulation of genes after low level <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> Different radiolabelled chemicals were employed to target different cellular compartments. Tritiated thymidine, " 1 " 2 " 5 I-concanavalin A and tritiated water were employed to irradiate the nucleus, membrane and whole cell, respectively. Compared to whole cell irradiation, nuclear irradiation at low doses (0. 5 h at 0. 075, 0. 4 Gy/h) resulted in preferential regulation of c-fos and c-myc proteins over their encoding mRNA. On the other hand, membrane irradiation at much higher doses (0. 5 h at 6. 8 Gy/h) only resulted in the induction of c-fos transcripts. The results in this thesis propose a distinctive role for the different cellular compartments in the regulation of genes at different levels after <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> Triggering of the regulatory mechanisms for the regulation of different genes could be controlled by elements in different cellular compartments. Furthermore, the sensitivity and effectiveness of the nucleus in regulating genes and inducing cell death after <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> is unequivocally evident. Nonetheless, the transcriptional regulation of NF-#kappa#B (1. 9 fold) after low membrane doses (0. 5 h at 0. 25 Gy/h) suggests the presence of some sensitive elements in the cellular membrane. Damage to membrane elements is also implicated in the apoptotic processes responsible for cell lethality after membrane irradiation (LD_ 5 _ 0 = 80. 19). These results have implications for radiation induced carcinogenesis and mutation after low level <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> (author) Available from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC:DXN 033061 / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreSIGLEGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResponses of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) to {{stressors}} and injuries, such as <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation,</b> are modulated by the concomitant responses of the brains innate immune effector cells, microglia. Exposure to high doses of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> in brain tissue leads to the expression and release of biochemical mediators of ‘neuroinflammation’, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to tissue destruction. Contrastingly, low dose <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> may reduce vulnerability to subsequent exposure of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation,</b> largely through the stimulation of adaptive responses, such as antioxidant defences.

The consequences are not predictable and are due to several mechanism. <b>Ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> on plants may have: 1) indirect effects, as phenotypic expression of modifications induced at the genetic level; 2) direct damages due either to the interaction between the radiation itself with specific cellular structures (for example, the various components of cell walls) or to the production of Reactive Oxygen Species that can damage structural and functional macromolecules such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.
