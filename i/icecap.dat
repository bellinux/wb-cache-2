5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland <b>icecap,</b> an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Canadian Marine Drilling Ltd., a {{subsidiary}} of Dome Petroleum, brought a small armada to the Beaufort. It included three reinforced drillships and a support fleet of four supply boats, work and supply barges and a tugboat. This equipment expanded the explorable regions in the Beaufort Sea. Drillships, however, had their limitations for Beaufort work. Icebreakers {{and other forms of}} ice management could generally conquer the difficulties of the melting <b>icecap</b> in the summer. But after freeze-up began, the growing <b>icecap</b> would push the drill ship off location if it did not use icebreakers to keep the ice under control. CanMar's fleet eventually grew to include 5 drillships, the SSDC (Single Steel Drilling Caisson) and the Canmar Kigoriak, an Arctic Class 4 Icebreaker.|$|E

25|$|The Barnes <b>icecap</b> {{is found}} in {{the central part of the}} Baffin Island and it has been in retreat since at least the early 1960s when the Geographical Branch of the then Department of Mines & Technical Surveys sent a three-man survey team to the area to measure {{isostatic}} rebound and cross-valley features of the Isortoq River.|$|E
25|$|His studies {{continued}} at Northwestern University, where {{he earned a}} masters in geography in 19541955, studying shear moraines on the Greenland <b>Icecap.</b> During his work in Greenland he met Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and after joining the Air Force, served as scientific advisor to Byrd's staff with Admiral Dufek, at the Antarctic Projects Office in Washington, D.C., where he monitored international scientific programs in polar research. By 1958, when he was honorably discharged from the Air Force at age 27, Bishop had accumulated considerable skills as a mountaineer, polar scientist, photographer and explorer.|$|E
25|$|Subglacial volcanoes develop {{underneath}} icecaps. They {{are made}} up of flat lava which flows at the top of extensive pillow lavas and palagonite. When the <b>icecap</b> melts, the lava on top collapses, leaving a flat-topped mountain. These volcanoes are also called table mountains, tuyas, or (uncommonly) mobergs. Very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in Iceland, however, there are also tuyas in British Columbia. The origin of the term comes from Tuya Butte, {{which is one of the}} several tuyas in the area of the Tuya River and Tuya Range in northern British Columbia. Tuya Butte was the first such landform analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation. The Tuya Mountains Provincial Park was recently established to protect this unusual landscape, which lies north of Tuya Lake and south of the Jennings River near the boundary with the Yukon Territory.|$|E

The Quelccaya Ice Cap is the largest tropical <b>icecap</b> in the world, {{and all of the}} outlet glaciers from the <b>icecap</b> are retreating. In the case of Qori Kalis Glacier, which is one of Quelccayas' outlet glaciers, the rate of retreat had reached [...] per year during the three-year period of 1995 to 1998.

500|$|On 3 June 1888, Nansen's {{party was}} picked up from the {{north-western}} Icelandic port of Ísafjörður by the sealer Jason. A week later the Greenland coast was sighted, but progress was hindered by thick pack ice.

500|$|The {{expedition}} {{provided some}} key scientific information. [...] On June 18, 1884, wreckage from Jeannette {{was found on}} an ice floe near Julianehåb (now Qaqortoq), near the south-western corner of [...] Greenland. This proved that a continuous ocean current flowed {{from east to west}} across the polar sea, and was the basis of Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96. [...] Also, although the Open Polar Sea theory ended with Jeannettes voyage, the ship's meteorological and oceanographic records have provided 21st-century climatologists with valuable data relating to climate change and the shrinking of the polar <b>icecap.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of an}} {{expedition}} across the Greenland <b>icecap</b> grew in Nansen's mind throughout his Bergen years. In 1887, after the submission of his doctoral thesis, he finally began organising this project. Before then, the two most significant penetrations of the Greenland interior had been those of Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1883, and Robert Peary in 1886. Both had set out from Disko Bay on the western coast, and had travelled about [...] eastward before turning back. By contrast, Nansen proposed to travel from east to west, ending rather than beginning his trek at Disko Bay. A party setting out from the inhabited west coast would, he reasoned, {{have to make a}} return trip, as no ship could be certain of reaching the dangerous east coast and picking them up. [...] By starting from the east—assuming that a landing could be made there—Nansen's would be a one-way journey towards a populated area. The party would have no line of retreat to a safe base; {{the only way to go}} would be forward, a situation that fitted Nansen's philosophy completely.|$|E
500|$|Ski warfare, {{the use of}} ski-equipped {{troops in}} war, is first {{recorded}} by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. These troops were reportedly able to cover distances {{comparable to that of}} light cavalry. The garrison in Trondheim used skis at least from 1675, and the Danish-Norwegian army included specialized skiing battalions from 1747—details of military ski exercises from 1767 are on record. Skis were used in military exercises in 1747. In 1799 French traveller Jacques de la Tocnaye recorded his visit to Norway in his travel diary: Norwegian immigrants used skis ("Norwegian snowshoes") in the US midwest from around 1836. Norwegian immigrant [...] "Snowshoe Thompson" [...] transported mail by skiing across the Sierra Nevada between California and Nevada from 1856. In 1888 Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his team crossed the Greenland <b>icecap</b> on skis. Norwegian workers on the Buenos Aires - Valparaiso railway line introduced skiing in South America around 1890. In 1910 Roald Amundsen used skis on his South Pole Expedition. In 1902 the Norwegian consul in Kobe imported ski equipment and introduced skiing to the Japanese, motivated by the death of Japanese soldiers during a snow storm.|$|E

500|$|For this {{mountain}} there is photographic evidence of massive glacial retreat since {{the region was}} first extensively explored by airplane in 1936 {{in preparation for the}} peak's first ascent (see e.g. [...] ). Between then and 2010, the mountain lost 80 percent of its ice — two-thirds of which since another scientific expedition in the 1970s. That research between 1973 and 1976 showed glacier retreat for the Meren Glacier of [...] while the Carstensz Glacier lost [...] The Northwall Firn, the largest remnant of the <b>icecap</b> that once was atop Puncak Jaya, has itself split into two separate glaciers after 1942.

500|$|Early in 1882 Nansen took [...] "...the first fatal {{step that}} led me astray from the quiet life of science." [...] Professor Robert Collett of the university's zoology {{department}} proposed that Nansen take a sea voyage, to study Arctic zoology at first hand. Nansen was enthusiastic, and made arrangements through a recent acquaintance, Captain Axel Krefting, {{commander of the}} sealer Viking. The voyage began on 11 March 1882 and extended over the following five months. [...] In the weeks before sealing started, Nansen was able to concentrate on scientific studies. From water samples he showed that, contrary to previous assumption, sea ice forms {{on the surface of}} the water rather than below. His readings also demonstrated that the Gulf Stream flows beneath a cold layer of surface water. [...] Through the spring and early summer Viking roamed between Greenland and Spitsbergen in search of seal herds. Nansen became an expert marksman, and on one day proudly recorded that his team had shot 200 seal. In July, Viking became trapped in the ice close to an unexplored section of the Greenland coast; Nansen longed to go ashore, but this was impossible. However, he began to develop the idea that the Greenland <b>icecap</b> might be explored, or even crossed. On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and early in August was back in Norwegian waters.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, the party {{struggled}} to ascend the inland ice over a treacherous surface with many hidden crevasses. The weather was generally bad; on one occasion all progress was halted for three days by violent storms and continuous rain. On 26 August Nansen {{concluded that there was}} now no chance of reaching Christianhaab by mid-September, when the last ship was due to leave. He therefore ordered a change of course, almost due west towards Godthaab (now Nuuk), a shorter journey by at least [...] The rest of the party, according to Nansen, [...] "hailed the change of plan with acclamation". They continued climbing, until on 11 September they had reached a height of [...] above sea level, the summit of the <b>icecap</b> with temperatures dropping to [...] at night. From then on the downward slope made travelling easier, although the terrain was difficult and the weather remained hostile. Progress was slow because of fresh snowfalls which made dragging the sledges as hard as pulling them through sand. By 26 September they had battled their way down {{to the edge of a}} fjord that ran westward towards Godthaab. From their tent, some local willows and parts of the sledges Sverdrup constructed a makeshift boat, and on 29 September Nansen and Sverdrup began the last stage of the journey, rowing down the fjord. [...] Four days later, on 3 October 1888, they reached Godthaab, where they were greeted by the town's Danish representative. His first words were to inform Nansen that he had been awarded his doctorate, a matter that [...] "could not have been more remote from my thoughts at that moment". The crossing had been accomplished in 49 days, making 78 days in total since they had left the Jason; throughout the journey the team had maintained careful meteorological, geographical and other records relating to the previously unexplored interior. The rest of the team arrived in Godthaab on 12 October.|$|E
