40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{hydrocolloid}} dressings {{have been introduced}} routinely {{in the treatment of}} various types of wounds. They provide a moist environment promoting autolytic debridement, and stimulate angiogenesis. However, long-term application often leads to inflammation of the skin in the immediate area of the ulcer, causing irritant dermatitis in many cases, but sometimes also leads to contact sensitization. A 32 year-old woman burnt herself by an iron, and presented to our clinic and was treated with Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ. Nine days later, she again presented with an erythematous oozing patch with edema, and allergic contact dermatitis was suspected. A patch test (TRUE test) was performed and a positive reaction to colophonium was obtained. Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ contains <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>rosin</b> (colophonium) as the tackifying agent, so we could diagnose this case as allergic contact dermatitis due to the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>rosin</b> in Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ. We report another case of allergic contact dermatitis due to Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ in a 32 year-old woman. (Ann Dermatol 23 (S 3) S 387 ∼S 389...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hydrocolloid wound {{dressings}} {{have been}} in use for nearly two decades, and have rarely caused allergic contact dermatitis. DuoDERM E (DuoDERM CGF) is a newer version of DuoDERM (ConvaTec Ltd, a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ) that contains a sensitizing derivative of colophony. OBJECTIVE: We describe three patients who developed eczematous lesions under this type of wound covering. METHODS: The patients were patch tested to the European standard series, to a glues and adhesives series, and to pieces of various adhesive dressings. RESULTS: The patients displayed positive patch tests to colophony and to DuoDERM E or DuoDERM CGF hydrocolloid dressings. CONCLUSION: These dressings contain the pentaerythritol ester of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>rosin</b> as a tackifying agent, and this substance retains the sensitizing potential of colophony. The addition of this compound is an important change that may negatively alter the good safety record of ConvaTec dressings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} a 69 -year-old female {{patient with a}} longstanding history of venous ulcerations on both lower legs and multiple sensitivities, who developed eczematous lesions with the hydrocolloid dressing Combiderm (Convatec Ltd., a Bristol-Myers Squibb division, Ickenham, Middlesex, UK). Epicutaneous tests were positive to this dressing and to a modified colophonium derivative, i. e. glyceryl rosinate, however not to the unmodified colophonium from the standard series. A {{review of the literature}} showed several case reports about sensitization to similar hydrocolloids being distributed under various brand names in different countries and which contain the pentaerythritol ester of the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>rosin</b> as the tackifying agent. Some of the patients described did, while others did not, react to colophonium but only to a modified derivative. In our patient, the reaction to glyceryl rosinate most probably represent cross-sensitivity with the modified colophonium derivative used in Combiderm, the presence (but not the exact nature) of which was showed by the company. In patients where allergic contact dermatitis from hydrocolloid dressings is strongly suspected and colophonium tests negatively, patch testing to modified colophonium derivatives should therefore be performed. As the complete composition of wound dressings is most often unknown, we urgently advocate legal requirements for labelling of those and in fact all medically used devices...|$|E
40|$|Substitution of {{aluminum}} oxide for fused quartz in zinc oxide-eugenol-o-ethoxyben-zoic acid cements improved compressive strength and lessened film thickness. Physical properties {{were similar to}} those of zinc phosphate cement. The material is useful clinically for crown and bridge cementation, for insulating bases, and for temporary res-torations. The partial substitution of eugenol by o-eth-oxybenzoic acid (EBA) in zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) cements has been shown to yield greatly improved products. 1 - ' This finding has {{led to the development of}} a biologically acceptable crown and bridge cement consisting of ZnO, <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>rosin,</b> fused quartz, and EBA-eugenol liquid. Several of these formulations have optimum physical properties and recently have be-come available commercially. Alumina is often used as a reinforcing agent in ceramics. It is considerably more rigid than fused quartz so the present study was under-taken to determine if alumina reinforcement would improve the properties of EBA dental cements.

40|$|Zinc oxide-eugenol cement is well tolerated by the tissues. ' It {{acts as a}} palliative on {{the dental}} pulp 2 and seals the cavity margins better than zinc {{phosphate}} cement. - 5 The effects of zinc phosphate cement on tissue or on the pulp are unpredictable and may vary from mild to severe. ' 6, I The solubility and disintegration of zinc oxide-eugenol in dilute organic acids are {{less than that of}} zinc phos-phate cement. 8 Zinc oxide-eugenol cement has, however, the disadvantages of long setting time and poor strength. 9 To reduce the setting time of zinc oxide-eugenol cement, chlorides, nitrates, acetates, and <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>rosin</b> have been used. 10 '" The setting time and, to some extent, the strength and hardness of the cement may also be controlled by the manufacturing process of the zinc oxide, by addition of salts, especially zinc salts, and by controlling the moisture content. "' To increase the strength of the zinc oxide-eugenol cement, Messing' 2 has added up to 10 per cent polystyrene to the eugenol and obtained a slight decrease in the solubility and slight increases in the 24 -hour compres-sive strength and hardness of the cement.
