The track was then added to the set-list of the concert tour. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger was most impressed with the performance, calling it {{one of the highlights of}} the concert. He added that [...] "reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that it was hard not to wish she could get back to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out." [...] Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in May 2011, along with another song from Born This Way, [...] "You and I". Sitting atop a high stool, Gaga—in a red leather blazer, a floppy mask-like hat and see-through leopard bodysuit—played a piano made out of a wire high-heel structure.|$|E

Vice versa, nutrient media, labeled substrates, etc., may be introduced into the culture while under pressure. Chemical fixation of subsamples for electron microscopy or adenosine 5 '-triphosphate determinations under pressure is also possible without affecting the growing culture. Data are given of growth experiments demonstrating the feasibility of the method. Problems of oxygen depletion are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial biomass {{production}} is often estimated from incorporation of radioactively labeled leucine into protein, in both oxic and anoxic waters and sediments. However, {{the validity of}} the method in anoxic environments has so far not been tested. We compared the leucine incorporation of bacterial assemblages growing in oxic and anoxic waters from three lakes differing in nutrient and humic contents. The method was modified to avoid O 2 contamination by performing the incubation in syringes. Isotope saturation levels in oxic and anoxic waters were determined, and leucine incorporation rates were compared to microscopically observed bacterial growth. Finally, we evaluated the effects of O 2 contamination during incubation with leucine, as well as the potential effects of a headspace in the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel.</b> Isotope saturation occurred at a leucine concentration of above about 50 nM in both oxic and anoxic waters from all three lakes. Leucine incorporation rates were linearly correlated to observed growth, and {{there was no significant difference}} between oxic and anoxic conditions. O 2 contamination of anoxic water during 1 -h incubations with leucine had no detectable impact on the incorporation rate, while a headspace in the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel</b> caused leucine incorporation to increase in both anoxic and O 2 -contaminated samples. The results indicate that the leucine incorporation method relates equally to bacterial growth rates under oxic and anoxic conditions and that incubation should be performed without a headspace...|$|E

As specified in the test guideline[23], we determined the nitrate concentration in the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> at only two time points, i.e. 3 h and 28 days after application. Nitrate generated in the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> is not consumed under the test conditions, thus a net increase at the test end-point indicates an increase in microbial nitrification activity during the 4 -week incubation period. It is unclear whether {{there is still a}} difference in microbial activity between experimental and control <b>vessels</b> after the <b>incubation</b> period of 28 days. More detailed data on the effects of nanomaterials on microbial nitrification activity in the soil were outside the scope of this investigation, and would require additional sampling time points that are not currently mandated for the testing of non-agrochemicals. Additional data could also be produced by including modified tests, such as the determination of potential ammonium oxidation activity[24].|$|R
30|$|Mesocosms are {{important}} research tools in aquatic ecology because they {{close the gap}} between laboratory studies at the individual or lower organization level and field studies at the population and ecosystem level. However, most mesocosm studies regarding the pelagic environment do not consider the effects of physical factors like water-column stratification, turbulence and mixing. Neglecting such factors might bias the results compared to the natural system. Using a unique indoor mesocosm facility, we present results on how different water-column stratifications can be made and how they act as barriers for exchange between water layers. Turbulent mixing, simulated by vertically rotating <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels,</b> is shown to be of high importance for primary production, generating up to nine times higher production in humus-rich water than <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> at fixed depths. Convective stirring is shown to be an attractive method for generating different turbulence conditions, and different temperature settings can be used to get turnover times from 84  h or more down to 17  min for a 5 -m water parcel. We also demonstrate how an anoxic bottom layer can be achieved by stimulating heterotrophic bacteria through addition of bioavailable organic carbon.|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} assimilable {{organic carbon}} (AOC) bioassay is proposed. We evaluated {{all aspects of}} the AOC bioassay technique, including inoculum, <b>incubation</b> water, bioassay <b>vessel,</b> and enumeration technique. Other concerns included eliminating the need to prepare organic carbon-free glassware and minimizing the risks of bacterial and organic carbon contamination. Borosilicate vials (40 ml) with Teflon-lined silicone septa are acceptable <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels.</b> Precleaned vials are commercially available, and the inoculum can be injected directly through the septa. Both bioassay organisms, Pseudomonas fluorescens P- 17 and Spirillum sp. strain NOX, are available from the American Type Culture Collection and grow well on R 2 A agar, making this a convenient plating medium. Turbid raw waters need to be filtered prior to an AOC analysis. Glass fiber filters used with either a peristaltic pump or a syringe-type filter holder are recommended for this purpose. A sampling design that emphasizes replication of the highest experimental level, individual batch cultures, is the most efficacious way to reduce the total variance associated with the AOC bioassay. Quality control for the AOC bioassay includes an AOC blank and checks for organic carbon limitation and inhibition of the bioassay organisms...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic and larval {{development}} {{were followed}} from fertilisation to {{settlement in the}} Antarctic heteronemertean Parborlasia corrugatus (McIntosh, 1876). The first cleavage occurred 10 to 15 h after fertilisation, and the second at ≃ 17 h. Larvae hatched at the gastrula stage, between 170 and 200 h post-fertilisation, and were ≃ 150 μm in diameter. Early larval stages aggregated in dense groups near the surface of <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> and were positively phototactic. Early pilidium larvae were recognisable 435 h post-fertilisation. They were 155 × 152 μm in size, and possessed a complete apical tuft of cilia and a full marginal band of locomotory cilia. At this stage, the gust was visible through the body wall, and the mouth was open and was ≃ 40 μm in diameter. Late pilidia, 222 × 193 μm in size, were helmet-shaped. They had an apical tuft over 100 μm long, and possessed a lobed marginal band of locomotory cilia. Pilidia were observed aggregating close {{to the bottom of}} <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> 1200 to 1350 h (50 to 56 d) after fertilisation, and this was interpreted as settlement behaviour. At this stage, the apical tuft had been lost and they were highly contractile, being capable of compressing their bodies. However, neither developing juveniles within the larval envelope nor hatched juveniles were observed. Pilidia consumed the microalgae Tetraselmis suecica, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Isochrysis galbana. They also fed on particulate organic material < 1 μm in size, as shown by the presence of material in the guts of larvae offered filtered extracts of algal cultures. There was some indication that larvae could use dissolved organic material, since pilidia held in seawater with organic material removed did not survive as long as those in filtered seawater or in filtered water with added amino acids. However, the only larvae to exhibit settlement behaviour in the feeding experiments were those offered Tetraselmis succica and Thalassiosira pseudonana, and these required a longer development time to reach this stage than pilidia in the standard cultures, where a mixed algal diet was offered...|$|R
40|$|Correlation {{between the}} number of dissociated spleen cells, {{incubated}} with antigen in a modified Mishell and Dutton system, and the number of antibody-forming cells (AFC) produced as a result of incubation has been studies in mice of C 57 Bl/ 6 strain. It has been shown that when suspension densities are increased 2 - to 4 -fold, the number of AFC formed is very often reduced 10 - to 100 -fold, although the percentage of viable cells recovered at the end of incubation is not significantly diminished. The observed reduction of AFC formation in cultures containing increased numbers of cells, designated here the surface density effect, was found to be expressed more by spleen cells of unimmunized than of immunized mice. Inhibition was dependent on the thickness of the cell layer formed {{on the bottom of the}} <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel</b> (cells per square centimeter), rather than on the cell: volume ratio of cultures. The effect was not due to a deficit of antigen or nutrition and could not be reproduced by adding of incubation media conditioned by dense cultures. It was determined not by impairment of clone induction but by inhibition of subsequent proliferation. This suppression is reversible and can be reversed by decreasing the cell density, even after 3 days of culture...|$|E
40|$|Importance of {{physical}} form rather than viscosity {{in determining the}} rate of starch hydrolysis in legumes 1 ’ 2 Susan Wong, BSc(Hons) and Kerin 0 ‘Dea,t PhD ABSTRACT These studies were designed {{to determine whether the}} slow rate of carbohydrate absorption after oral ingestion of legumes is due to the viscosity of leguminous fibers or rather to the physical inaccessability of the carbohydrate to the intestinal hydrolytic enzymes. Using lentils {{as an example of a}} legume known to be slowly absorbed in vivo, we examined factors that could potentially modulate the rate of formation of glucose from the starch in lentils in vitro. The slow rate of hydrolysis of lentil starch does not appear to be due to increased viscosity (or the presence of gelling fibers) since 1) the rate of release of free glucose from a dialysis sac into the dialysate was not affected by the presence of lentils, and 2) the rate of hydrolysis of lentil starch was not affected by increasing the shaking rate of the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel</b> from 0 to 150 oscillations per minute. In contrast, the physical form of lentils appeared to be critical in determining the rate of starch hydrolysis. Grinding the lentils before cooking increased the starch hydrolysis rate 5 -fold, while blending them after cooking gave an intermediate rate. Am J Clin Nutr l 983; 37 : 66 - 70.

40|$|Microbial {{oxidation}} {{of methane}} in oxic water bodies {{is an important}} control {{on the amount of}} dissolved methane which is released from the ocean to the atmosphere. We explored the use of stable isotope methane spikes to quantify methane oxidation rates in Arctic seawater samples. A Picarro G 2201 -i cavity ring-down spectrometer was used to determine methane concentration and isotope ratios from headspace samples in foil incubators. The methane mass balance and the change in stable isotope ratios served as independent constraints on methane oxidation. For a fractionation factor of 1. 025 oxidation rate constants determined with both methods agreed within 20 % for small changes in isotope ratio (e. g., 10 ‰). For large changes in isotope ratio (e. g., 90 ‰), which was outside the calibration range, methods diverged. Rate constants down to 0. 01 / d could be resolved with high statistical support. Stable isotope infrared spectroscopy to determine methane oxidation in foil incubators (ISMOFI) was successfully tested on under ice seawater from Utqiagvik, Alaska, by repeated sampling from each <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel.</b> Depending on the amount of isotope spike added, we determined oxidation rates of 0. 15 [*]±[*] 0. 02 nmol / (L*d) at in situ methane concentration and a maximal oxidation potential of 271 [*]±[*] 41 nmol / (L*d). The ISMOFI method permits variable incubation durations from days to months in a single incubator. The method is transportable and applicable in a variety of field or seagoing laboratory environments, and it avoids the use of hazardous substances such as radioisotopes and toxic chemicals...|$|E

40|$|Receptor {{turnover}} may be {{a crucial}} part in the physiology of endothelin (ET). <b>Incubation</b> of <b>vessel</b> segments could be a possible method to demonstrate this. The aim was to study contractile responses of human omental arteries to different ET agonists at various periods after incubation at 37 degrees C in 5 % CO 2 and air. The maximum effect (Emax; percentage of contraction to 60 mM K+ buffer solution) and the potency of ET- 1 were unaltered (pD 2 = 8. 82 +/- 0. 06). The selective ETB agonist IRL 1620 demonstrated a negligible Emax in nonincubated segments (2. 4 +/- 0. 9 %). After only 1 day of incubation the Emax was 51 +/- 23 %, and it reached 114 +/- 53 % after 5 days. The pD 2 of IRL 1620 was stable throughout the incubation time (7. 23 +/- 0. 08). ET- 3 showed a moderate Emax in nonincubated segments (55 +/- 18 %), with a pD 2 of 6. 68 +/- 0. 24. However, subsequent incubation revealed an increase of pD 2 to 8. 60 +/- 0. 20 on the fifth day. The maximum contraction increased to 206 +/- 44 %; this {{is equal to the}} contraction obtained in paired experiments with ET- 1 (215 +/- 18 %).

40|$|Seawater {{cultures}} {{were conducted}} in large volume (36 1) gas impermeable tri-laminate bags {{for the purpose of}} empirically deriving bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) and carbon conversion factors (CCF) in the south central Ross Sea. This experimental design allowed for concomitant measurements of metabolic reactants (loss of total and dissolved organic carbon [TOC and DOC]) and products (gain of total carbon dioxide [TCOz] and bacterial biomass) to be made from a single <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel.</b> Some previous studies have relied on proxy measurements (e. g. 02, 3 H-thymidine incorporation and cell abundance) to determine BGE and CCF rather than direct carbon measurements. Our experimental design enabled a complete carbon budget to be constructed and eliminated variability associated with normally employed parallel bottle incubations. Uhlization of TOC was well balanced by the production of TC 02, in 7 of 8 experiments, validating the use of tri-laminate bags for measuring microbial respiration. In 3 experiments, where TOC, DOC, TCOz and bacterial biovolume were directly measured, carbon mass balance yielded BGE estimates of 12, 32 and 38 % and bacterial CCF of 77, 95 and 134 fg C pm- 3. In experiments where independent DOC measurements were not made we used our empirically derived CCF values to determine bacterial carbon production and calculated DOC concentrations and BGE for these remaining experiments. The BGE derived from all the bag experiments conducted throughout the austral spring and summer 1995 - 1997 ranged from 9 to 38 %. Our experimental design and carbon mass balance approach could be applied to other aquatic systems to empirically derive the BGE and CCF, factors essential for determining carbon flux through bacterioplankton...|$|E
40|$|The {{convoluted}} (CPT) {{and straight}} (SPT) {{portions of the}} renal proximal tubule are susceptible to injury by {{a wide variety of}} chemical agents. These agents often affect the CPT or SPT selectively by proposed mechanisms usually attributed to tubular concentration, blood flow delivery patterns and tubuloglomerular feedback responses within the intact kidney. The innate cellular responses to chemical exposures remain virtually unexplored. Hence, the basic goal of this research was to develop an in vitro system that was conducive to examining the innate cellular differences in susceptibility between the CPT and SPT following in vitro exposure to mercuric chloride (HgCl₂), potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) $ or hypoxic conditions. A renal cortical slicing technique was developed for these studies to position the CPT and SPT within discrete regions of slices made perpendicular to the cortical-papillary axis. An <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel</b> that could maintain the morophological and biochemical viability of slices for at least 12 hr was also developed. The selective necrosis of CPT induced by K₂Cr₂O₇ or hypoxic exposure, and SPT induced by HgCl₂, observed in vivo was reproduced in renal cortical slices exposed in vitro. Innate cellular uptake mechanisms were then investigated since the tissue distribution of each metal was found to be most concentrated within their respective injured cell type. The transport of PAH, TEA, phosphate, sulfate, glutathione and cysteine were examined as potential mechanisms for selective accumulation of these metals. K₂Cr₂O₇ caused a dose-dependent reduction in the uptake rate of sulfate by cortical slices, while phosphate, PAH, and TEA uptake were unaffected. Although HgCl₂ has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups its uptake as a complex to glutathione or cysteine was not enhanced. HgCl₂ also had no affect on the uptake rate of PAH or TEA even though both HgCl₂ and K₂Cr₂O₇ were able to reduce the steady state accumulation of these organic substrates...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{dimethyl}} sulfide (DMS) from marine samples is often quantified using gas chromatography techniques. Typically, these are labour intensive {{and have a}} slow sample turnover rate. Here we demonstrate {{the use of a}} portable fast DMS sensor (FDS) that utilises the chemiluminescent reaction of DMS and ozone to measure DMS production in aqueous samples, with a maximum frequency of 10 Hz. We have developed a protocol for quantifying DMS production that removes potential signal interference from other biogenic trace gases such as isoprene (2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) and hydrogen sulfide. The detection limit was 0. 89 pM (0. 02 ppbv) when using a DMS standard gas mixture. The lowest DMS production rates quantified with the FDS and verified using conventional gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD) were around 0. 01 nmol min - 1. There was a strong correlation in DMS production when comparing the FDS and GC-FPD techniques with a range of marine samples (e. g., r 2 = 0. 94 for Emiliania huxleyi). However, the combined dataset showed the FDS measured 22 % higher DMS production than the GC-FPD, with the differences in rates likely due to interfering gases, for example hydrogen sulfide and isoprene. This possible overestimation of DMS production is smaller than the two-fold difference in DMS production between day and night samples from a culture of E. huxleyi. The response time of the instrument to changes in DMS production is method dependent (e. g., geometry of <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel,</b> bubble size) and was approximately 4 min under our conditions when using a culture of E. huxleyi (800 ml) with aeration at 100 ml min - 1. We suggest the FDS can reduce sample handling, is suitable for short- and long-term measurements of DMS production in algal cultures, and will widen the range of DMS research in marine environments. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

We report on the potential toxicity of five different commercially available, lab-grade butyl stoppers on MOx activity in samples from marine and lacustrine environments. MOx rates in incubations sealed with non-halogenated butyl were > 50 % lower compared to parallel incubations with halogenated butyl rubber stoppers, suggesting toxic effects {{associated with the use}} of the non-halogenated butyl type. Aqueous extracts of non-halogenated butyl rubber were contaminated with high amounts of various organic compounds including potential bactericides such as benzyltoluenes and phenylalkanes.

Furthermore, the non-halogenated and two types of the halogenated butyl elastomers additionally leached comparably high amounts of zinc. While the source of the apparent toxicity with the use of the non-halogenated rubber stoppers remains elusive, our results indicate that leaching of contaminants from some butyl rubber stoppers can severely interfere with the activity of MOx communities, highlighting the importance of testing rubber stoppers for their respective contamination potential.

QRAE (www. raesystems. eu) and ITX (www. indsci. com) gas monitors with data logging facilities were {{used to measure the}} 10 -second average concentration of H 2 S released into the air above the heaps of SMC as they were being disturbed. The highest concentrations of up to 2083 ppm were detected for the outdoor stored material in comparison to concentrations of up to 687 ppm detected for indoor stored material. Outdoor stored SMC had higher moisture contents (66 - 72 %) compared to indoor stored material (53 - 65 %). Laboratory studies were conducted to study the effects of moisture content (69 – 85 %) and temperature (35 ºC or 45 ºC) on H 2 S production from fresh un-steamed and steamed samples of SMC. The H 2 S gas concentration in the head space of the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> was measured every 24 hours for 3 days. Un-steamed SMC produced higher levels of H 2 S than steamed SMC and in general the higher the moisture content the higher the H 2 S concentration. Higher concentrations of H 2 S were also produced with the higher incubation temperature of 45 ºC. These results suggest that the high levels of H 2 S detected during disturbance of stored SMC are heavily influenced by moisture content. The higher rates of H 2 S production at 45 ºC also suggest that thermophilic microorganisms are involved in the process.

Gas chromatographic measurement of head space gas from incubation tubes containing leaves or seedlings {{was a simple}} method of simultaneously measuring all four compounds. Increased ethylene production had two phases, a moderate increase {{from the beginning of}} the stress period and a large increase just prior to appearance of leaf lesions. Ethane production in SO 2 -stressed plants did not increase until lesions appeared. Acetaldehyde and ethanol production began within 6 hours at 0. 3 microliter per liter SO 2 and 24 hours at 0. 1 microliter per liter SO 2 and continued throughout a 6 -day fumigation. Production of acetaldehyde and ethanol continued when plants were removed to clean air for up to 2 days. A higher concentration of SO 2 (0. 5 microliter per liter) induced acetaldehyde and ethanol production within 2 hours of the start of fumigation of birch and pine seedlings. A number of other stresses, including water deficit, freezing, and ozone exposure induced production of acetaldehyde and ethanol. Production of these compounds was not due to hypoxia, as the O 2 partial pressure in the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> did not decline. Increasing the O 2 partial pressure to 300 millimeters Hg did not affect production of these compounds. Production of ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethanol declined when more than 80 % of the leaf area became necrotic, while ethane production was linearly related to the percentage of necrosis. A number of woody and herbaceous plant species produced acetaldehyde and ethanol in response to freezing stress, while others did not.

40|$|The {{microbial}} mediated {{production of}} nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and its reduction to dinitrogen (N 2) via denitrification represents {{a loss of}} nitrogen (N) from fertilised agro-ecosystems to the atmosphere. Although denitrification has received great interest by biogeochemists in the last decades, the magnitude of N 2 lossesand related N 2 :N 2 O ratios from soils still are largely unknown due to methodical constraints. We present a novel 15 N tracer approach, based on a previous developed tracer method to study denitrification in pure bacterial cultures which was modified for the use on soil incubations in a completely automated laboratory set up. The method uses a background air in the incubation vessels that is replaced with a helium-oxygen gas mixture with a 50 -fold reduced N 2 background (2 % v/v). This method allows for a direct and sensitive quantification of the N 2 and N 2 O emissions from the soil with isotope-ratio mass spectrometry after 15 N labelling of denitrification N substrates and minimises the sensitivity to the intrusion of atmospheric N 2 at the same time. The incubation set up {{was used to determine}} the influence of different soil moisture levels on N 2 and N 2 O emissions from a sub-tropical pasture soil in Queensland/Australia. The soil was labelled with an equivalent of 50 μg-N per gram dry soil by broadcast application of KNO 3 solution (4 at. % 15 N) and incubated for 3 days at 80 % and 100 % water filled pore space (WFPS), respectively. The headspace of the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessel</b> was sampled automatically over 12 hrs each day and 3 samples (0, 6, and 12 hrs after incubation start) of headspace gas analysed for N 2 and N 2 O with an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (DELTA V Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany(. In addition, the soil was analysed for 15 N NO 3 - and NH 4 + using the 15 N diffusion method, which enabled us to obtain a complete N balance. The method proved to be highly sensitive for N 2 and N 2 O emissions detecting N 2 O emissions ranging from 20 to 627 μN kg- 1 soil- 1 hr- 1 and N 2 emissions ranging from 4. 2 to 43 μN kg- 1 soil- 1 hr- 1 for the different treatments. The main end-product of denitrification was N 2 O for both water contents with N 2 accounting for 9 % and 13 % of the total denitrification losses at 80 % and 100 %WFPS, respectively. Between 95 - 100 % of the added 15 N fertiliser could be recovered. Gross nitrification over the 3 days amounted to 8. 6 μN g- 1 soil- 1 and 4. 7 μN g- 1 soil- 1, denitrification to 4. 1 μN g- 1 soil- 1 and 11. 8 μN g- 1 soil- 1 at 80 % and 100 %WFPS, respectively. The results confirm that the tested method allows for a direct and highly sensitive detection of N 2 and N 2 O fluxes from soils and hence offers a sensitive tool to study denitrification and N turnover in terrestrial agro-ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{respiratory}} {{reduction of}} nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to dinitrogen (N 2) via denitrification {{plays a key}} role within the global N-cycle since it is the most important process for converting reactive nitrogen back into inert molecular N 2. However, due to methodological constraints, we still lack a comprehensive, quantitative understanding of denitrification rates and controlling factors across various ecosystems. We investigated N 2, N 2 O and NO emissions from irrigated cotton fields within the Aral Sera Basin using the He/O 2 atmosphere gas flow soil core technique and an incubation assay. NH 4 NO 3 fertilizer, equivalent to 75 kg ha− 1 and irrigation water, adjusting the water holding capacity to 70, 100 and 130 % were applied to the <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> to assess its influence on gaseous N emissions. Under soil conditions as they are naturally found after concomitant irrigation and fertilization, denitrification was the dominant process and N 2 the main end product of denitrification. The mean ratios of N 2 /N 2 O emissions increased with increasing soil moisture content. N 2 emissions exceeded N 2 O emissions by a factor of 5 [*]±[*] 2 at 70 % soil water holding capacity (WHC) and a factor of 55 [*]±[*] 27 at 130 % WHC. The mean ratios of N 2 O/NO emissions varied between 1. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 4 (70 % WHC) and 644 [*]±[*] 108 (130 % WHC). The magnitude of N 2 emissions for irrigated cotton was estimated to be in the range of 24 [*]±[*] 9 to 175 [*]±[*] 65 kg-N ha− 1 season− 1, while emissions of NO were only of minor importance (between 0. 1 to 0. 7 kg-N ha− 1 season− 1). The findings demonstrate that for irrigated dryland soils in the Aral Sera Basin, denitrification is a major pathway of N-loss and that substantial amounts of N-fertilizer are lost as N 2 to the atmosphere for irrigated dryland soils...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} a newly designed system with three stand-alone working <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels</b> for simultaneous measurements of N(2), N(2) O, NO, and CO(2) emissions from soil. Due {{to the use}} of a new micro thermal conductivity detector and the redesign of vessels and gas sampling a so-far unmatched sensitivity (0. 23 μg N(2) -N h(- 1) kg(- 1) ds or 8. 1 μg N(2) -N m(- 2) h(- 1)) for detecting N(2) gas emissions and repeatability of experiments could be achieved. We further tested different incubation methods to improve the quantification of N(2) emission via denitrification following the initialization of soil anaerobiosis. The best results with regard to the establishment of a full N balance (i. e., the changes in mineral N content being offset by simultaneous emission of N gases) were obtained when the anaerobic soil incubation at 25 °C was preceded by soil gas exchange under aerobic conditions at a lower incubation temperature. The ratios of N and C gas emission changed very dynamically following the initialization of anaerobiosis. For soil NO(3) (-) contents of 50 mg N kg(- 1) dry soil (ds) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of approximately 300 mg C kg(- 1) ds, the cumulative emissions of N(2), N(2) O, and NO were 24. 3 ± 0. 1, 12. 6 ± 0. 4, and 10. 1 ± 0. 3 mg N kg(- 1) ds, respectively. Thus, N gas emissions accounted (on average) for 46. 2 % (N(2)), 24. 0 % (N(2) O), and 19. 2 % (NO) of the observed changes in soil NO(3) (-). The maximum N(2) emission reached 1200 μg N h(- 1) kg(- 1) ds, whereas the peak emissions of N(2) O and NO were lower by a factor of 2 - 3. The overall N(2) :N(2) O and NO:N(2) O molar ratios were 1. 6 - 10. 0 and 1. 6 - 2. 3, respectively. The measurement system provides a reliable tool for studying denitrification in soil because it offers insights into the dynamics and magnitude of gaseous N emissions due to denitrification under various incubation conditions...|$|R

We tested {{the hypothesis that}} enhanced vascular reactivity in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hypertensive mice is due to increased activation of Pyk 2. Aorta and small mesenteric arteries from DOCA-salt and uninephrectomized (UNI) male C 57 B 1 / 6 mice were used. Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) was higher in DOCA (126 +/- 3) vs. UNI (100 +/- 4) mice. Vascular responses to phenylephrine (1 nM to 100 mu M) were greater both in aorta and small mesenteric arteries from DOCA-salt than UNI, but treatment with Tyrphostin A- 9 (0. 1 mu M, Pyk 2 inhibitor) abolished the difference among the groups. Pyk 2 levels, as well as phospho-Pyk 2 (Tyr 402), paxillin, and phospho-paxillin(Tyr 118) were increased in DOCA-salt aorta. <b>Incubation</b> of <b>vessels</b> with Tyrphostin A- 9 restored phosphorylation of Pyk 2 and paxillin.

40|$|Demand for {{livestock}} products {{are expected to}} rise due to increasing global population, urbanisation and affluence. Sustainably managing livestock excreta will be central to achieving an expansion in production whilst minimising environmental damage. The deposition of excreta to soil by livestock accounts for ca. 21 % of the UK agricultural N 2 O emissions. Accurate quantification of N 2 O and assessments of the efficacy of mitigation technologies are key research areas for progressing toward enhanced sustainability and productivity in grazed grasslands. The overall thesis aims are to enhance understanding of N cycling and losses in sheep urine patches, as ‘hot-spots’ and ‘hot-moments’ for rapid nutrient cycling. Objectives were (i) to determine how sheep urine patch and environmental parameters influence N 2 O emissions, (ii) to determine the optimal way to accurately measure N 2 O emissions from sheep urine patches via the static chamber technique, and (iii) to assess the efficacy of synthetic nitrification inhibitors as a mitigation strategy for urine patch N 2 O emissions. Sheep-grazed grasslands were selected for study, based {{on the lack of}} current available evidence for these agroecosystems. N 2 O emissions were monitored from sheep urine-influenced soil in small <b>incubation</b> <b>vessels,</b> or by the static chamber technique in the field (manual and automated campaigns). The use of 14 C-labelled inhibitors were also employed in laboratory studies, to trace the fate of nitrification inhibitors in the plant-soil-microbe system and provide {{a better understanding of the}} factors that affect the efficacy of inhibitors to reduce N 2 O emissions. Urine patch size and N concentration were found to be important parameters influencing emissions of N 2 O from sheep urine patches. Emissions of N 2 O were generally lower than the IPCC default of 1 % of the N applied in sheep excreta, where peaks in emissions occurred alongside rainfall events. Total extractable N, oxidation reduction potential and soil water-filled pore space were determined to be key drivers of N 2 O emissions from sheep urine under controlled conditions. The urine patch diffusional area was shown to be important for accurate quantification of N 2 O emissions when using the chamber technique; the importance of daily sampling of emissions, an assessment of the diurnal nature of N 2 O emissions and having a high number of replicate chambers to adequately represent the large spatial variability in N 2 O emissions was also confirmed. The nitrification inhibitors DCD and DMPP had contrasting behaviours in differing soil types. DCD had a greater sorption in comparison to DMPP and microbial uptake and degradation were concluded to be important parameters influencing their effective period in the soil. A graminaceous plant was shown to be able to acquire DCD intact through its roots and translocate the compound to shoots which raises concerns about contamination of food products. A liquid application of DMPP was not effective in reducing cumulative N 2 O emissions from sheep urine patches in the field. The efficacy of nitrification inhibitors to reduce N 2 O appears to vary widely, nevertheless they are a mitigation strategy that could be implemented in the short term. Achieving enhanced sustainability and productivity in grazed grasslands is a complex problem, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and the involvement of policy-makers and farmers to resolve. There are several mitigation strategies available or being developed, and some which require more research before being practicable. Advances in technologies to measure and mitigate N 2 O emissions will greatly enhance our knowledge of N cycling and losses, and the potential to alleviate such losses from the urine patch environment in the near future...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} characterize vascular function in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rat model of preeclampsia and to investigate the role of plasma factors in mediating any observed changes in vascular reactivity. Mean arterial blood pressure and vascular function were measured in RUPP and control rats. Mesenteric vessels from both virgin and pregnant rats were exposed for 1 hour or overnight to plasma from both RUPP and control rats and their vascular function assessed. RUPP rats were characterized by severe hypertension, restricted fetal growth, and reduced placental weight (P< 0. 001). Vasorelaxation was impaired in resistance vessels from RUPP compared with control rats (acetylcholine: R(max) 70 +/- 3 versus 92 +/- 1 [NP] and 93 +/- 3 % [sham], P< 0. 01; bradykinin: 40 +/- 2 versus 62 +/- 2 [NP] and 59 +/- 4 % [sham], P< 0. 001). <b>Incubation</b> of <b>vessels</b> from pregnant (but not virgin) animals with RUPP plasma overnight resulted in an attenuation of vasorelaxant responses (acetylcholine: 63 +/- 7 versus 86 +/- 2 %, P< 0. 05; bradykinin: 35 +/- 5 versus 55 +/- 6 %, P< 0. 001). The residual relaxant response in RUPP plasma-treated vessels was not further attenuated after treatment with N(omega) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (acetylcholine: 57 +/- 7 versus 63 +/- 7 %, ns; bradykinin: 37 +/- 5 versus 35 +/- 5 %, ns). The RUPP rat model is characterized by an impaired response to vasodilators which may be attributable to one or more circulating factors. This plasma-mediated endothelial dysfunction appears to be a pregnancy-dependent effect. Furthermore, nitric oxide-mediated vasorelaxation appears to be absent in RUPP plasma-treated vessels...|$|R

In the muscle vascular bed, the combined ETA and ETB receptor antagonist PD 145065 (1 mg/kg/min, intra-arterially) abolished the biphasic vascular responses (dilatation followed by constriction) to both ET- 1 (0. 4 microgram/kg/min, intra-arterially) and to the selective ETB receptor agonist IRL 1620 (3. 2 micrograms/kg/min, intra-arterially). In the cat femoral artery and vein in vitro, PD 145065 competitively inhibited the contractile responses to both ET- 1 and IRL 1620. The contractile response to the latter agonist could be evoked only after long-term <b>incubation</b> of the <b>vessels</b> (37 degrees C for 5 days). These results indicate that PD 145065 is a potent antagonist at both ETA and ETB receptors in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, this antagonist may prove useful for elucidating the possible physiologic and/or pathophysiologic roles of the endothelins. For example, it was shown that PD 145065 had no effect on vascular tone in the resting state, indicating no role for the endothelins in the regulation of basal vascular tone in cat skeletal muscle...|$|R

In this study, pressurized recovery and <b>incubations</b> in pressure <b>vessels</b> were used to test whether B. puteoserpentis symbionts displayed similar behavior in the presence of symbiont substrates. The relative abundances of both types of symbionts were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and group-specific gene copy numbers were assessed using qPCR. Specimens sampled using isobaric and non-isobaric recovery contained similar relative proportions (in surface coverage) of sulfur- and methane-oxidizing bacteria indicating that recovery type did not have impact on measured relative areas. Similarly, pressurized incubations with different substrates did lead to significant differences in the relative surface coverage of the two types of bacteria, although slight variations were measured with qPCR, suggesting changes in relative abundances of gene copy numbers but not in relative areas covered. Total gill surface areas and total bacterial numbers in specimens were estimated for the first time. Symbiont bearing-mussels display exchange surfaces about 20 -fold higher than those found in similar-sized coastal mussels, and mean bacterial numbers of 2. 5 * 1012 per specimen were estimated.

The pig {{coronary artery}} with intact endothelium is highly sensitive to bradykinin (BK, pEC 50 8. 6), while being insensitive to the B 1 receptor agonist, LysdesArg 9 BK. The tissue responds to BK with concentration-dependent relaxation, which is prevented by B 2 receptor antagonists, particularly DArg[Hyp 3, Thi 5, DTic 7, Oic 8]BK (HOE 140, pKB 9. 3), (E) - 3 -(6 -acetoamido- 3 -pyridyl) -N-(N-{ 2, 4 -dichloro- 3 -[(2 -methyl- 8 -quinolinyl) oxy-methyl]phenyl}-N- methylaminocarbonyl-methyl) acrylamide (FR 173657), a new non peptide compound (pKB 9. 3), while B 1 receptor antagonists (e. g. Lys[Leu 8]desArg 9 BK) are inactive. The order of potency of kinin-related peptides in this vessel is: LysBK > or = BK > [Hyp 3]BK > [Aib 7]BK, a sequence typical of a B 2 receptor system. Antagonists such as HOE 140 and FR 173657, at high concentrations reduce the maximum effect of BK and thus behave as noncompetitive antagonists.

After 7 - 8 h in vitro <b>incubation,</b> the <b>vessel</b> shows high sensitivity to LysdesArg 9 BK (pEC 50 8. 3) and is insensitive to BK. The pig renal vein responds to B 1 receptor agonists with concentration-dependent contraction which maintains a stable plateau and is prevented by selective B 1 receptor antagonists such as Lys[Leu 8]desArg 9 BK (pKB 6. 7).
