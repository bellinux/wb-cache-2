25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

They speculate whether his comment {{may have been a}} factor, though both are self-centered: Elaine wonders about her own death, and George urges Jerry to play in the softball game, because he thinks Jerry needs [...] "to play left field", as Jerry's replacement fielder [...] "stinks," [...] and, George adds, [...] "I just don't see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> think dead people care who's at their funeral?

500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{considered}} {{to have a good}} chance of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond Phillips said, [...] "The funny thing about the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which is amazing, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> gotta say, 'Is the man mad or is he – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E

[...] Due to band's various misfortunes with the suicide of band members, Toshi's {{brainwashing}} and lack of overseas success, X Japan have been described in The Times as: [...] "The world's unluckiest band", {{in an article published}} on Friday the 13th October, 2017. When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: [...] "Kinda? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can't say 'the world's unluckiest band', but what I can say is 'the world's luckiest band'. Thanks to our fans." ...|$|E
500|$|A real-life {{journalist}} named Reid, who Gray {{interviewed for}} his book, states that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] mirrors well how some journalists actually work. She said the episode shows [...] "the ludicrous nature of, you know, {{what we do}} in a lot of things. The kids news with Bart and Lisa: <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> see them do really stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that." [...] Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that [...] "the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do {{have an impact on the}} minds of many intelligent members of American society." ...|$|E

500|$|The American review site Metacritic {{rated the}} series a 64 out of 100, {{indicating}} [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] from 12 critics. David Hinkley of the New York Daily News rated it four stars out of five, stating it is [...] "a little cartoonish {{in the same}} way Seagal or Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies were cartoonish, exaggerating characters and action. But [...] "Strike Back" [...] also differs sharply and significantly in that the villains here aren't the random abstract caricatures from those films, like throwback Nazis or Jamaican drug lords," [...] adding that the villains give the series [...] "an added level of intensity, because we have a more visceral sense of the potential consequences." [...] Linda Stasi of the New York Post rated it three out of four stars, summing up the series as; [...] "Good action, good characters and, besides, it's the only show in the history of TV where the term, [...] "" [...] is code. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> gotta love that, no?" ...|$|E
500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't.

Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E
500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> know who Rihanna is, {{but would you}} recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Orbison often excused his {{motionless}} {{performances by}} saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like [...] "Mean Woman Blues" [...] did offer that. He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, [...] "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Gladwell {{started at}} The New Yorker in 1996 {{he wanted to}} [...] "mine current {{academic}} research for insights, theories, direction, or inspiration". His first assignment was to write a piece about fashion. Instead of writing about high-class fashion, Gladwell opted to write a piece {{about a man who}} manufactured T-shirts, saying: [...] "it was much more interesting to write a piece about someone who made a T-shirt for $8 than it was to write about a dress that costs $100,000. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> or I could make a dress for $100,000, but to make a T-shirt for $8 – that's much tougher." ...|$|E

On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, [...] "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared.
