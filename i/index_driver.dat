Thefirst twohavebeen studied {{for many years}} and with many good results, but traffic sign recognition is aless-studied field. Traffic signs provide drivers with very valuable information about the road, in order to make driving safer and easier. We think that traffic signs must play the same role for autonomous vehicles. They are designed to be easily recognized by human drivers mainly because their color and shapes are very different from natural environments. The algorithm described in this paper takes advantage of these features. It has two main parts. The first one, for the detection, uses color thresholding to segment the image and shape analysis to detect the signs. The second one, for the classification, uses a neural network. Some results from natural scenes are shown. On the other hand, the algorithm is valid to detect other kinds of marks that would tell the mobile robot to perform some task at that place. <b>Index</b> Terms—Advanced <b>driver</b> information systems, color/shape processing, computer vision, neural networks, traffic signs recognition.

It is shown that at high clock frequencies where the output voltage at the termination {{point of the}} transmission line may not reach its steady-state value during the clock period, {{it is possible to}} reduce energy dissipation while meeting a dc noise margin by driver sizing. This is in sharp con-trast with the steady-state analysis, which states that driver size has no impact on the energy dissipation per output change. In ad-dition, we propose a new design metric which is the product of en-ergy, delay and some measure of ringing in lossy transmission lines. In particular, this paper provides closed-form expressions for the energy dissipation, 50 % propagation delay, and the percentage of maximum undershoot when the circuit exhibits an underdamped behavior. This metric is used during the driver sizing problem for-mulation for minimum energy-delay-ringing product.

40|$|Although {{road traffic}} {{congestion}} is an objective state of traffic flow, drivers have different feelings about road traffic congestion. First of all, {{in order to}} reveal the law that driver’s mental state changes along with congested degree of road traffic, the targeted questionnaire was designed to analyze the driver’s psychological feeling under different state of traffic flow. Then, {{from the perspectives of}} the driver’s subjective feeling, the new definition of road traffic congestion was put forward, so the pressure coefficient of traffic congestion, which is written as χ press t 0 − t n, is defined to measure traffic congestion pressure. Furthermore, by adopting statistical methods to associate the driver’s subjective feeling toward traffic congestion with objective parameters of traffic flow, the grading thresholds of the unblocked state, mild congested state, moderate congested state, and severe congested state were calculated, which are χ press t 0 − t n = 0. 37, χ press t 0 − t n = 0. 51, and χ press t 0 − t n = 0. 65, respectively. And in the field of application for the grading thresholds, Fourier Transform theory was introduced to calculate domain frequency <b>indexes</b> of the <b>driver’s</b> heart rate variability in the four states of traffic flow, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Increasing {{mobility}} {{in everyday}} life {{has led to the}} concern for the safety of automotives and human life. Computer vision has become a valuable tool for developing driver assistance applications that target such a concern. Many such vision-based assisting systems rely on motion estimation, where optical flow has shown its potential. A variational formulation of optical flow that achieves a dense flow field involves a data term and regularization terms. Depending on the image sequence, the regularization has to appropriately be weighted for better accuracy of the flow field. Because a vehicle can be driven in different kinds of environments, roads, and speeds, optical-flow estimation has to be accurately computed in all such scenarios. In this paper, we first present the polar representation of optical flow, which is quite suitable for driving scenarios due to the possibility that it offers to in-dependently update regularization factors in different directional components. Then, we study the influence of vehicle speed and scene texture on optical-flow accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships of these specific characteristics on a driving scenario (vehicle speed and road texture) with the regularization weights in optical flow for better accuracy. As required by the work in this paper, we have generated several synthetic sequences along with ground-truth flow fields. <b>Index</b> Terms—Advanced <b>driver</b> assistance systems (ADASs), op-tical flow, regularization parameters, road texture, vehicle speed.

The automatic lane-keeping control loop is never opened, and no on/off switching strategy is used. During the driver’s maneuver, the vehicle lateral dynamics are controlled by the driver himself through the vehicle steering system. When there is no driver’s steering action, the vehicle center of gravity tracks the center of the traveling lane thanks to the automatic lane-keeping system.

To analyze such data, we have previously proposed a time series model that reduces lateral position data into several parameters for measuring lateral control, and {{have shown that}} these parameters can detect differences between neurologically impaired and healthy drivers (Dawson et al, 2010 a). In this paper, {{we focus on the}} “re-centering” parameter of this model, and test whether the parameter estimates are associated with off-road neuropsychological tests and/or with on-road safety errors. We assessed such correlations in 127 neurologically healthy drivers, ages 40 to 89. We found that our re-centering parameter had significant correlations with five neuropsychological tests: Judgment of Line Orientation (r = 0. 38), Block Design (r = 0. 27), Contrast Sensitivity (r = 0. 31), Near Visual Acuity (r = - 0. 26), and Grooved Pegboard (r = - 0. 25). We also found that our re-centering parameter was associated with on-road safety errors at stop signs (r = - 0. 34) and on-road safety errors during turns (r = - 0. 22).

The model is validated through comparisons with accurate daily density drag data previously computed for numerous satellites in the altitude range of 175 to 1000 km. Model comparisons are computed for the JB 2008, JB 2006, Jacchia 1970, and NRLMSIS 2000 models. Accelerometer measurements from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites are also used to validate the new geomagnetic storm equations...|$|R
