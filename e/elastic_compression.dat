40|$|The Cam-clay models, or {{any other}} plasticity-based models, do not make {{distinction}} between the mode of stress transfer in coarse- and fine-grained soils. An examination of behavior at micro level in fine-grained soils, from the consideration of load transfer through physico-chemical interactions, suggests that the plastic compressions result from the grouping of particles into larger clusters and that <b>elastic</b> <b>compressions</b> result from the decrease in the spacing between particles. During shearing, these clusters gradually get dismembered, releasing the locked-in energy. The effect of such dismembering of clusters can be easily incorporated into the original Cam-clay model, and better predictions can be obtained with the associated flow rule, itself, for both normally and over consolidated states. The method essentially defines the hardening of yield surfaces with internal changes in the spacing between particles, instead of changes in externally observed plastic strains. The approach describes the behavior of over consolidated soils as yielding along successfively hardening Roscoe surfaces with gradually varying plastic properties...|$|R

METHODS: Fourteen female students (aged 20 – 22 yr) who had regularly performed moderate exercise were submitted to maximum calf-raise exercises of 1 movement per 3 seconds till exhaustion. Seven subjects (T-group) received effleurage massage on both calf muscles immediately after the exercise plus 24 hours of <b>elastic</b> calf <b>compression.</b> The other subjects (C-group) received no treatment. We examined creatine-kinase, maximum calf muscle circumference, maximum voluntary isometric muscle contraction, perceived pain, maximum angle of dorsiflexion and one-leg long jumping before and immediately after treatment (T-group) or exercise (C-group) for 3 days of exercise plus 7 days of recovery. Subjects carried a step counter to count the number steps walked each day. RESULTS: The number of calf-raise repetitions in both groups significantly decreased on days 2 and 3. Creatine kinase increased significantly in the T-group from day two of the exercise period to day five of the recovery period, and was tendentially higher than in the C-group. Maximum calf muscle circumference in T-group was higher post-treatment versus pre-exercise, and significantly higher in the C-group.

The incremental values of intensity of loads (loading, unloading and reloading) were applied on the footing to evaluate the response of a square footing and also to obtain the value of elastic rebound of the footing corresponding to each cycle of load.

50|$|In {{sedimentology}} compaction {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} a sediment progressively loses its porosity due to the effects of loading. This forms {{part of the process of}} lithification. When a layer of sediment is originally deposited, it contains an open framework of particles with the pore space being usually filled with water. As more sediment is deposited above the layer, the effect of the increased loading is to increase the particle-to-particle stresses resulting in porosity reduction primarily through a more efficient packing of the particles and to a lesser extent through <b>elastic</b> <b>compression</b> and pressure solution. The initial porosity of a sediment depends on its lithology. Mudstones start with porosities of >60%, sandstones typically ~40% and carbonates sometimes as high as 70%.

However, the effects of elastic and inelastic leggings on the calf muscle pump have not been compared. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare in normal subjects the effects of <b>elastic</b> and inelastic <b>compression</b> on leg intramuscular pressure (IMP), an objective index of calf muscle pump function. IMP in soleus and tibialis anterior muscles was measured with transducer-tipped catheters. Surface compression between each legging and the skin was recorded with an air bladder. Subjects were studied under three conditions: (1) control (no legging), (2) elastic legging, and (3) inelastic legging. Pressure data were recorded for each condition during recumbency, sitting, standing, walking, and running. Elastic leggings applied significantly greater surface compression during recumbency (20 +/- 1 mm Hg, mean +/- SE) than inelastic leggings (13 +/- 2 mm Hg). During recumbency, elastic leggings produced significantly higher soleus IMP of 25 +/- 1 mm Hg and tibialis anterior IMP of 28 +/- 1 mm Hg compared to 17 +/- 1 mm Hg and 20 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, generated by inelastic leggings and 8 +/- 1 mm Hg and 11 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively, without leggings. During sitting, walking, and running, however, peak IMPs generated in the muscular compartments by elastic and inelastic leggings were similar.
