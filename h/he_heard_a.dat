5|$|Wright was {{motivated}} {{to become a}} violinist when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> performance by Fritz Kreisler. After study in the United States, he spent seven years studying with Otakar Ševčík in Prague and Vienna.|$|E
5|$|After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was {{informed}} that Dodge was to take over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he could to pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 25 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Pecatonica.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball and landed on the shoulder again while going for a dig. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> strange sound.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> {{moment later}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> exclamation of relief from Monsieur Thuran.|$|R
6000|$|It seemed <b>an</b> age till <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{the steps}} and voices {{approaching}} again --and this time <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> added sound,--the trampling of hoofs, apparently. Then <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Hendon say-- ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not turn}} when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> inner door fly open, and a quick footstep, muffled on the carpet.|$|R
5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|Solti {{enrolled}} at the Ernö Fodor School of Music in Budapest {{at the age of}} ten, transferring to the more prestigious Franz Liszt Academy two years later. When he was 12 <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor. His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he {{found that there was}} no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E
60|$|He sprang forward, {{and called}} Pelagia's name again and again. Once <b>he</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> answer: but the {{soldiers}} thrust him back.|$|R
6000|$|... "As Joseph was a-walking [...] <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> angel sing-- [...] 'This night {{shall be}} the birth night [...] Of Christ, our heavenly King.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought that}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> answer, {{but was not}} certain, and again dashed forward, almost as speedily {{as if he had}} but just started.|$|R
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E
5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E
25|$|Kenny G {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington. His mother was {{originally}} from Saskatchewan, Canada. His family was Jewish, and {{he grew up in}} Seattle's Seward Park neighborhood, which is a center of the city's Jewish community. He came into contact with the saxophone when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> performance on The Ed Sullivan Show. He started playing saxophone, a Buffet Crampon alto, in 1966 when he was 10 years old.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that'll settle him," [...] laughed the boy; {{but just}} then <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> angry shout, and looking around saw a {{policeman}} running toward him.|$|R
60|$|He did not finish, but {{his heart}} sank within him. He {{examined}} the passageway once more and shouted as before. <b>He</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> answer, but was not certain.|$|R
60|$|Noiselessly {{he entered}} the hallway {{and walked to the}} door of the rear room. Listening, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> Irishman and his wife talking over some factory work the man had been promised.|$|R
25|$|As deputy postmaster, Franklin became {{interested}} in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach Newport, Rhode Island? The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from Falmouth in Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 1962, Ladd {{was found}} lying {{unconscious}} {{in a pool}} of blood with a bullet wound near his heart, in what might have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The bullet penetrated Ladd's chest around the third and fourth rib, through the lungs and bounced off the rib cage. At the time, Ladd said he thought <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> prowler, grabbed a gun, and tripped over, accidentally shooting himself. This was accepted by the police investigating.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} German {{invasion}} of France Koestler joined the French Foreign Legion {{in order to}} get out of the country. He deserted in North Africa and tried to get back to England. While waiting to gain passage on a ship out of Lisbon, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> false report that the ship on which Hardy was travelling had sunk, and that she and his manuscript were lost. He attempted suicide, but survived.|$|E
60|$|Before the {{sun rose}} {{he found himself in}} a thick wood where it was too dark for him to see his path, and here <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> owl crying as if it were in despair.|$|R
60|$|The storm came {{up during}} the night, and Dave was awakened to find himself rolling {{from one side of}} his berth to the other. He arose, and as he did so <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> exclamation from Roger.|$|R
60|$|She {{pushed him}} in and closed the doors. From his hiding-place <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> {{animated}} conversation at the street-door and minute particulars as to the time which had elapsed since his departure and the direction he had taken.|$|R
25|$|A one-eyed British {{war veteran}} rescued {{a woman from}} India who was in trouble on her descent. The climber, Leslie Binns, {{successfully}} rescued her and tried to save another from her ill-fated eleven-person expedition which suffered three fatalities. About 500 metres from the summit, which he could see with his one eye, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> woman screaming for help so he gave up his summit bid to help her down. She {{had run out of}} bottled oxygen and was getting frostbitten.|$|E
25|$|Roger Olian, a {{sheetmetal}} foreman at St. Elizabeths Hospital, a Washington psychiatric hospital, {{was on his}} {{way home}} across the 14th Street Bridge in his truck when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> man yelling that there was an aircraft in the water. He was the first to jump into the water to attempt to reach the survivors. At the same time, several military personnel from the Pentagon—Steve Raynes, Aldo De La Cruz and Steve Bell—ran down to the water's edge to help Olian.|$|E
25|$|By {{this point}} Hamilton was well-honoured. However, {{by now he}} {{supported}} eugenics. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> story that HIV had been created from an accident with a polio vaccine, which it was thought could have been contaminated with a chimp virus. This supported his idea that modern medicine could be negative, as he thought medicine opposed {{the logic of the}} genes. So he travelled to eastern Congo to look for the virus, amid the murder and chaos. He died, and later research disproved the idea that HIV had come from a medical accident.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} chute opened <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> {{approaching}} fighter; a Hurricane flown by Witold Urbanowicz, {{who saw the}} yellow Mae West life jacket worn by RAF pilots and veered off to circle the parachute all the way down.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>heard</b> the {{flutter of}} many fans, the frou-frou of silk dresses, {{and above all}} the din and sound of dance music, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> inane laugh and an {{affected}} voice repeating the doggerel rhyme that was even now written on that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre had placed before him: ...|$|R
60|$|Even in {{the outer}} office, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> exclamation of surprise, as {{the piece of paper}} on which he had written his name was read. He was at once shown in. Mr. Tufton looked at him, with a little surprise.|$|R
25|$|After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was {{informed}} that Henry Dodge was to take over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he could to pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 11 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{got off to}} a bad {{start on}} May 31 when Longstreet marched down the Charles City Road and turned onto the Williamsburg Road instead of the Nine Mile Road. Huger's orders had not {{specified}} a time that the attack was scheduled to start and he was not awakened until <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> division marching nearby. Johnston and his second-in-command, Smith, unaware of Longstreet's location or Huger's delay, waited at their headquarters for word of the start of the battle. Five hours after the scheduled start, at 1 p.m., D.H. Hill became impatient and sent his brigades forward against Casey's division.|$|E
25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{most famous}} aria, [...] "Quand le bien-aimé reviendra" [...] ("When my {{sweetheart}} returns to me"), is mentioned by Hector Berlioz in his Memoirs as his [...] "first musical experience" [...] (<b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> {{adaptation of the}} melody sung during his First Communion).|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin {{closed his}} eyes as though <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> discord.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>heard</b> in <b>a</b> {{profound}} ancient male unfamiliar melody {{the accumulation}} of the past.|$|R
