We realized a long stroke path and an ultraprecision positioning simultaneously {{with a single}} apparatus.

40|$|Magnetoelectroelastic (MEE) {{materials}} are {{a class of}} new multifunctional composites. They have been promising candidates for the core components of adaptive systems, for example, sensors, actuators, transducers, and microwave devices, owing to their special coupling effects among elastic, electric and magnetic fields. In engineering practice, layered structures are very common. In such structures, interface delamination will result in interfacial cracks, which {{is the main reason}} behind structural failure. In the past couple of decades, although many researchers have studied the interfacial crack problems of MEE materials, most of their work is on the basis of Griffith crack model, in which the stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} crack tips have oscillating singularity. This is not realistic in practice. Therefore, this thesis is devoted to developing more rational interfacial crack models for investigation of the fracture behaviors of MEE bimaterials. First, in order to eliminate the oscillating behaviour of stresses near the crack tip, an electrically conductive interface crack model with a frictionless contact zone in an MEE bimaterial is developed. A combined Dirichlet-Riemann and Hilbert boundary value problem is formulated and solved analytically. Second, the crack models with pre-fracture zones are developed between two MEE materials, which are adhered by means of a thin interlayer, and the extended stresses are assumed to be finite within the pre-fracture zones. By utilizing the corresponding boundary conditions, the aforementioned problems are finally formulated mathematically as a system of equations. The fracture parameters, such as lengths of contact zone and pre-fracture zones, field intensity factors and the <b>extended</b> <b>displacement</b> jumps at the initial crack tips, related to these two sorts of models are provided. Numerical results are presented to study the influence of various factors on the fracture parameters. Third, as an alternative to Green’s function, the integral identities are derived for a semi-infinite interfacial crack problem in an anisotropic MEE bimaterial subjected to an asymmetric load on the crack surface. This crack problem is formulated in terms of singular integral equations, which establish the relationship between the applied external load and the <b>extended</b> <b>displacement</b> jumps across the crack faces. Illustrative examples demonstrate that the proposed method is very convenient for the fracture analysis of MEE solids. Finally, a static fracture analysis of interfacial crack problems in MEE bimaterials is presented with the extended finite element method (X-FEM). In order to capture the oscillating singularity of the stresses near the crack tip, suitable crack tip enrichment functions for MEE bi{{materials are}} newly derived and applied to perform X-FEM analysis. By comparing yielded results with the analytical and numerical solutions of the corresponding interfacial crack problems, the validity of the proposed formulation is verified. All the aforementioned work can significantly enrich and improve the theory of fracture mechanics of MEE solids and they can also serve as the benchmark for the future endeavors of fracture analysis. Moreover, results presented in this thesis will provide the theoretical reference and techniqucal support for the design and application of multilayered MEE structures and devices. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Nevertheless compared to two-dimensional electrophoresis, the resolution of common chromatographic techniques is low. Liquid chromatography in the displacement mode has previously been shown to offer higher resolution and to elute proteins in the high concentrations. In this study we compared to what <b>extend</b> <b>displacement</b> mode was a suitable alternative to gradient mode for the separation of a complex protein mixture using anion-exchange displacement chromatography and if it is therefore helpful for proteomic investigations. Hence we analyzed the qualitative protein composition of each fraction by tryptic digestion of the proteins, analysis of the tryptic peptides by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry followed by data base analysis and by measuring the elution profiles of 22 selected proteins with selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. In the fractions of displacement mode a significantly higher number of identified proteins (51 versus 16) was yielded in comparison to gradient mode. The resolution of displacement chromatography was slightly lower than of gradient chromatography for many but not for all proteins. The selectivities of displacement mode and gradient mode are very different. In conclusion displacement chromatography is a well suited alternative for top-down proteomic approaches which start with separating intact proteins first prior to mass spectrometric analysis of intact or digested proteins. The significant orthogonality of both modes may be used in the future for combining them in multidimensional fractionation procedures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn <b>extended</b> <b>displacement</b> {{discontinuity}} method (EDDM) {{is proposed}} {{to analyze the}} stress wave propagation in jointed viscoelastic rock mass (VRM). The discontinuities in a rock mass are divided into two groups. The primary group with an average geometrical size larger than or {{in the same order}} of magnitude of wavelength of a concerned stress wave is defined as “macro-joints”, while the secondary group with a high density and relatively small geometrical size compared to the wavelength is known as “micro-defects”. The rock mass with micro-defects is modeled as an equivalent viscoelastic medium while the macro-joints in the rock mass are modeled explicitly as physical discontinuities. Viscoelastic properties of a micro-defected sedimentary rock are obtained by longitudinally impacting a cored long sedimentary rod with a pendulum. Wave propagation coefficient and dynamic viscoelastic modulus are measured. The EDDM is then successfully employed to analyze the wave propagation across macro-joint in VRM. The effect of the rock viscosity on the stress wave propagation is evaluated by comparing the results of VRM from the presented EDDM with those of an elastic rock mass (ERM) from the conventional displacement discontinuity method (CDDM). The CDDM is a special case of the EDDM under the condition that the rock viscosity is ignored. Comparison of the reflected and transmitted waves shows that the essential rock viscosity has a significant effect on stress wave attenuation. When a short propagation distance of a stress wave is considered, the results obtained from the CDDM approximate to the EDDM solutions, however, when the propagation distance is sufficiently long relative to the wavelength, the effect of rock viscosity on the stress wave propagation cannot be ignored...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the steady state stable region of an AC Excited Synchronous Machine (AESM), especially of that of an induction machine type, is presented in this paper. The AESM essentially has two unstable phenomena, one is the stepout, the other the hunting. The step-out can {{be judged by the}} steady state stability condition of a synchronous machine type; on the other hand the hunting can be judged by that of an induction machine type. The steady state stable region of a synchronous machine type always exists at any slip within the range of 180 degrees of the <b>extended</b> internal <b>displacement</b> angle. However the stable region of an induction machine type is not as simple; that is, it changes complexly for ships and ceases to exist beyond the range of certain slips (boundary slips). This paper derives these boundary slips and shows by numerical calculations that it is very effective to increase the secondary resistance of an AESM for the expansion of the steady state stable region of an induction machine type...|$|R
