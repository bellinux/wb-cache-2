25|$|He won {{a second}} Hugo for the 1967 novella Riders of the Purple Wage, a {{pastiche}} of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake {{as well as}} a satire on a futuristic, cradle-to-grave welfare state. Reinvigorated, Farmer became a full-time writer again in 1969. Upon moving back to Peoria in 1970, he entered his most prolific period, publishing 25 books in 10 years. His novel To Your Scattered Bodies Go (a reworked, previously unpublished version of the prize-winning first novel of 20 years before) won him his third Hugo in 1971. A 1975 novel, Venus on the <b>Half-Shell,</b> created a stir in the larger literary community and media. It purported to be written in the first person by one “Kilgore Trout,” a fictional character appearing as an underappreciated science fiction writer in several of Kurt Vonnegut’s novels. The escapade did not please Vonnegut when some reviewers not only concluded that it had been written by Vonnegut himself, but that it was a worthy addition to his works. Farmer did have permission from Vonnegut to write the book, though Vonnegut later said he regretted giving permission.|$|E

2500|$|Farmer wrote Venus on the <b>Half-Shell</b> (1975) {{under the}} name Kilgore Trout, a fictional author who appears {{in the works of}} Kurt Vonnegut. He had planned to write more of Trout's fictional books (notably Son of Jimmy Valentine), but Vonnegut put an end to those plans. Farmer's use of the {{pseudonym}} had caused confusion among many readers, who for some time assumed that Vonnegut was behind it; when the truth of Venus on the Half-Shells authorship came out, Vonnegut was reported as being [...] "not amused." [...] In an issue of the semi-prozine The Alien Critic/Science Fiction Review, published by Richard E. Geis, Farmer claimed to have received an angry, obscenity-laden telephone call from Vonnegut about it. Thereafter Farmer wrote a number of pseudonymous [...] "fictional author" [...] stories, mostly for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. These were stories whose [...] "authors" [...] are characters in other stories. The first such story was [...] "by" [...] Jonathan Swift Somers III (invented by Farmer himself in Venus on the <b>Half-Shell</b> but inspired by one of the dead voices of Spoon River Anthology). [...] Later Farmer used the [...] "Cordwainer Bird" [...] byline, a pseudonym invented by Harlan Ellison for film and television projects from which he wished to disassociate himself, and perhaps related to the name Cordwainer Smith, a pseudonym used by Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger.|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} of a thin, metal film onto {{an array of}} spherical silica colloids, followed by dissolution of the colloidal template, produces metallic <b>half-shells</b> with nanometer-scale dimensions. <b>Half-shells</b> of gold, platinum, and palladium were fabricated, with diameters of the particles ranging from 100 to 500 nm, and shell thicknesses of 8 − 15 nm. The <b>half-shells</b> have three useful properties because of their geometries: (i) a high ratio of surface area to volume, (ii) a large length of edge relative to size, and (iii) an entropic resistance to assembling into close-packed structures. The surface properties of these <b>half-shells</b> can be modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), formed by adsorption of alkanethiols. The surfaces composed of aggregated gold <b>half-shells</b> are superhydrophobic; the measured contact angle of water on a surface of unmodified gold <b>half-shells</b> was 151 ° and on a surface of gold <b>half-shells</b> functionalized with a hexadecanethiolate SAM was 163 °. Aggregates of <b>half-shells</b> were patterned using template-assisted self-assembly. This paper describes a versatile and experimentally simple technique for fabricating hollow metallic hemispheres (which we call “half-shells”) with diameters of 100 - 500 nm and thicknesses of 8 - 15 nm. The method uses monolayers or multilayers of spherical silica colloids on glass substrates as templates on which the <b>half-shells</b> are formed. The silic...|$|R

40|$|Continuous fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastics}} {{often are}} offered as impregnated and consolidated semi-finished products which {{are known as}} organic sheets. The thermoplastic matrix leads to several advantages including the thermoformability and weldability. Parts made of organic sheets are frequently produced by forming the semi-finished product into <b>half-shells</b> and stiffening those shells {{in the course of}} the process e. g. by the injection moulding of ribs. Larger and more complex parts with hollow body structures can be manufactured e. g. by forming the semi-finished products into <b>half-shells</b> and joining the <b>half-shells.</b> However, the currently available manufacturing technologies for parts made of organic sheets have cap profile shaped joints which prevent the use of the reinforcing fibres across the joint plane. Investigations have proven that overlapping weld joints in organic sheets show much higher strengths than cap profile shaped joints which can be explained by the fibre use across the joint plane. Furthermore, the infrared welding technology was verified as an appropriate process for the welding of organic sheets since no need for additional welding material is given, short heating times can be realized and no contact of the infrared emitters to the joining parts is required. Therefore, the present study shall reveal the high potential of the overlapping welding of organic sheets. Influences on the weld strengths of infrared welded organic sheets are described and potential improvements concerning the materials to be welded as well as the welding process are shown...|$|R

30|$|Laparoscopy was {{performed}} using a reusable single-site trocar with five integrated access ports (S-Portal X-Cone, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). This new device {{consists of two}} symmetrical metal <b>half-shells</b> that are connected and sealed by one large silicon cap containing the access port. Once in the peritoneal cavity, the two <b>half-shells</b> fit together to form an X shape and the final access portal.

A clamp integrated into the rubber sealing prevents the X-Cone from opening unintentionally. The external and internal diameters {{at the level of the}} X-Cone's waistline are 25 and 20  mm, respectively. Under general anesthesia, each patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomic position with both legs supported in Allen stirrups and the arms resting alongside the body.

The single-port trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity and the abdomen was insufflated to 12  mmHg. The patient was then put in a Trendelemburg position. Following placement of the X-Cone, the surgeon stood behind the patient’s left shoulder at the level of the patient’s right shoulder, and the monitor was positioned between the patient’s legs.

40|$|Many {{proteins}} contain {{regions of}} unstructured polypeptide chain {{that appear to}} be flexible and to undergo random thermal motion. In some cases the unfolded sequence acts as a flexible tether that restricts the diffusion of a globular protein domain for the purpose of catalysis or self-assembly. In this article, we present a stochastic model for tethered protein domains under various conditions and solve it numerically to deduce the general and dynamic properties of these systems. A critical domain size dependent on the length of the tether is presented, above which a spherical domain tethered to an impenetrable wall by a flexible chain displays a restricted localization between two concentric <b>half-shells.</b> Results suggest that the diffusion of such a spherical domain is effectively reduced in its dimensionality and able to explore the available space with high efficiency. It also becomes clear that the orientation of the ball is not independent of the distance from the tethering point but becomes more constrained as the linking tether is extended. The possible biological significance of these and other results is discussed...|$|R
