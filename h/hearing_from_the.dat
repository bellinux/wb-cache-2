Jacques Ribault received {{the crew of the}} sinking ship into the Pearl, and then dropped a league down the river to where stood two more of the ships which had arrived from France, and which had not even been unloaded. <b>Hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> carpenter, Jean de Hais, who had escaped in a small boat, of the taking of the fort, Jacques Ribault decided to remain a little longer in the river to see if he might save any of his compatriots.|$|E
500|$|In May 1799 Gibraltar was one {{of fifteen}} line-of-battle-ships in a fleet {{commanded}} by George Elphinstone, which had been blockading the port of Cádiz {{since the beginning of}} the year. On <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British frigate [...] that the French fleet had broken out of Brest and was on its way, Elphinstone immediately had all ships prepare for action, and dispatched the brig-sloop [...] to warn Jervis at Gibraltar. The French fleet under Vice-Admiral Étienne Eustache Bruix, which had escaped on 25April, comprised 25 ships-of-the-line and had already evaded Hood's Channel Fleet, when it appeared fifteen miles off Cádiz on 4May.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of his firm support of the war, Kropotkin's {{popularity}} dwindled, and many former friends cut ties with him. Two exceptions included Rudolf Rocker and Alexander Schapiro, but both were serving prison sentences at the time. As a result, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated during his final years in London prior to his return to Russia. In Peter Kropotkin: His Federalist Ideas (1922), an overview of Kropotkin's writings by Camillo Berneri, the author interjected criticism of the former's militarism. Berneri wrote, [...] "with his pro-war attitude Kropotkin separated himself from anarchism," [...] and asserted that the Manifesto of the Sixteen [...] "marks the culmination of incoherence in the pro-war anarchists; [...] also supported Kerensky in Russia on the question of prosecuting the war." [...] Anarchist scholar Vernon Richards speculates that {{were it not for the}} desire of Freedom editor Thomas Keell (himself staunchly anti-war) to give the supporters of the war a fair <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start, they might have found themselves politically isolated far earlier.|$|E
500|$|The movie Mayor West is {{watching}} {{on the television}} is Romancing the Stone. The music played in the background during the black people's parade is taken almost verbatim from the film adaptation of the 1975 musical The Wiz where, in the final number of the film, they sing [...] "Brand New Day" [...] {{when it came to}} the absence of most of the Quahog Police Department. The two songs playing in the background at the junior prom are [...] "Hold On to the Nights" [...] by Richard Marx and [...] "Why" [...] by Annie Lennox. The music used in the background and the academy's logo when Peter, Quagmire and Cleveland are entering the police training grounds is a reference to that used in the Police Academy. The scene where Meg plays Madame Butterfly while turning the lamp on and off and the line [...] "I will not be ignored, Brian" [...] is a reference to 1987 thriller Fatal Attraction. The entire scene in the hotel where Meg is discovered attempting to seduce Brian is a reference to The King of Comedy, which MacFarlane notes as one of his favorite movies.
