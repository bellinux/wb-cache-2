In the first scene of the film, Sridhar attempted to depict Chennai as a [...] "progressive place: where couples sang duets on the Marina". Most of the film was shot in Ooty. Filming also took place on location at the Aaliyar Guest House, a bungalow near Aaliyar Dam, Coimbatore. During filming, Gopu gave Ravichandran the lyrics of the song [...] "Naalaam Naalaam", which were written like tongue-twisters in chaste Tamil. He claimed they were his own lines and asked him to memorise them. When the director called for the shots, Ravichandran asked for more time because he found it difficult to remember the dialogue. The puzzled director then said, [...] "This isn’t the dialogue. Who <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> This is a social film, a comedy. Gopu must have done it. He’s always pulling a fast one, don’t you know?" [...] During the 50th anniversary of the film in 2014, Rajasree said she had difficulties in providing the right pronunciation of her dialogues for the film.|$|E
