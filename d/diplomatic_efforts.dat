5|$|Llywelyn {{responded by}} {{intervening}} {{with his own}} forces but outright conflict was prevented by the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, probably destroying the temporary defences and stores. De Clare began work again the following year, raising tensions and prompting Henry to send two bishops, Roger de Meyland and Godfrey Giffard, {{to take control of}} the site and arbitrate a solution to the dispute.|$|E
5|$|The Dixie Mission {{hosted the}} Patrick Hurley and George Marshall {{diplomatic}} missions {{to negotiate a}} unification of the Chinese Communists and Nationalists. Both <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> failed. Later, the brief existence of the Dixie Mission served as a positive memory between the People's Republic of China and the United States during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon when official {{relations between the two}} countries were re-established. Veterans of the Dixie Mission, like John Service and Koji Ariyoshi, were among the first Americans invited to visit the People's Republic of China.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E

50|$|Shwe Mann {{has been}} seen as a key figure in the ongoing <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> to recalibrating Washington’s foreign policy towards Asia, known as “pivot.” Indeed, the U.S. President sought his company during his first {{official}} visit to Myanmar.|$|R
5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> {{had little to do with}} the situation on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E
5|$|In late 546, when John Troglita reached Carthage, the {{situation}} was dire: the imperial troops, under Marcentius the dux of Byzacena and Gregory the Armenian in Carthage, were few in number and demoralized. They held out in the coastal cities, blockaded by the Moors of Byzacena under their chieftain Antalas, while the Leuathae and Austurae tribes from Tripolitania were raiding Byzacena with impunity. <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>efforts,</b> however, secured the allegiance of the Moorish leaders Cutzinas and Ifisdaias, who joined the imperial army with several thousands of their men. In addition, the tribesmen of the Aurès Mountains under Iaudas withdrew to Numidia on learning of Troglita's arrival and pursued a course of armed neutrality.|$|E

Tapa reportedly relayed Kosoko's rejection of British friendship to the visiting party of Consul John Beecroft, Commander Wilmot, Commander Gardner, and Lieutenant Patey.|$|R
5|$|The Lahore trial {{directly}} linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot.

5|$|Indonesian {{independence}} was secured through {{a blend of}} both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without youth confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Operation Storm was a {{strategic}} {{victory in the}} Bosnian War, effectively ending the siege of Bihać and placing the HV, Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the ARBiH {{in a position to}} change the military balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the subsequent Operation Mistral 2. The operation built on HV and HVO advances made during Operation Summer '95, when strategic positions allowing the rapid capture of the RSK capital Knin were gained, and on the continued arming and training of the HV {{since the beginning of the}} Croatian War of Independence, when the RSK was created during the Serb Log revolution and Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) intervention. The operation itself followed an unsuccessful United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> to settle the conflict.|$|E
5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the humiliation of the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1919 {{he tried}} to {{convince}} General Grigory Semyonov to join him as a stronger force to fight the Red Army. Semyonov refused despite a significant <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> from Governor Vasile Balabanov claiming he was governor only since the provisional government in St Petersburg collapsed in the revolution.|$|R
50|$|The South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation reopened {{its mission}} in Libya, {{focusing}} on locating Hammerl. The South African government {{began to work}} with Austria, trying to recover the body for a proper burial, which required a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> involving {{both sides of the}} Libyan conflict.|$|R
50|$|Canada's {{relationship}} with Namibia began in 1977 when Canada joined the Western Contact Group, a joint <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> of France, United Kingdom, United States, Canada and West Germany {{to bring an}} internationally acceptable transition to independence for Namibia. In 1990, official relations started; Canada has dispatched a Honorary Consul to Windhoek.|$|R
5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts,</b> the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Henry had {{reserved}} {{the episcopal}} see of Exeter for Warelwast {{since the death}} of Osbern FitzOsbern in 1103, but the controversy over investiture meant that his election and consecration were not possible before a settlement was reached. Instead the king gave Warelwast the office of Archdeacon of Exeter after Osbern's death. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury records that Warelwast had earlier tried to remove Osbern from office, but this story probably originates with Eadmer and is of dubious veracity. While archdeacon, Warelwast is recorded as being present at the transfer of a Devon church to Bath Cathedral. He was elected Bishop of Exeter, and was consecrated on 11August 1107, by Anselm at the royal palace of Westminster. Other bishops consecrated at the same time included William Giffard to Winchester, Roger of Salisbury to Salisbury, Reynelm to Hereford, and Urban to Llandaff. Warelwast's elevation was a reward for his <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> in the investiture crisis. The mass consecration signalled the end of the investiture crisis in England.|$|E
5|$|In 1708, Leszczyński {{appointed}} Poniatowski {{his personal}} representative to Charles XII. He {{participated in the}} Battle of Holowczyn that year, and served as an aide to Charles XII during his exile in the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Here, he worked to establish an alliance between the Ottomans and the Swedes, aiming to bring the Ottomans into the war against Russia. Due to <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> {{on the part of}} the French, aligned with Sweden, the Ottomans began to campaign against the Russians in 1710. With this change in Ottoman foreign policy came the dismissal of Çorlulu Ali Pasha, Grand Vizier of Ahmed III. His successor, Köprülü Numan Pasha, was an acquaintance of Poniatowski and had been a supporter of an anti-Russian shift in Ottoman politics.|$|E
50|$|From 2011, the PLO's <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> {{has been}} focused on the {{so-called}} Palestine 194 campaign, which aims to gain membership for the State of Palestine in the United Nations. It seeks to effectively gain collective recognition for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.|$|R
5000|$|Walt has {{frequently}} criticized America's policy {{with respect to}} Iran. In 2011, Walt told an interviewer that the American reaction to an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in the United States [...] "might {{be part of a}} larger American <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> to put Iran on the hot seat." ...|$|R
50|$|Italy's {{support of}} the January 1919 Zelenaši (Greens) {{uprising}} in Montenegro was {{seen as part of}} a larger Italian military and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> to stretch the already frail defense capability of the newly created South Slavic state which would make it easier for Italians to dispute the new state's still undefined and internationally unrecognized borders.|$|R
5|$|Like {{most other}} revolutionaries, Heliade favored {{maintaining}} {{good relations with}} the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's suzerain power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures. As Sultan Abdülmecid I was assessing the situation, Süleyman Paşa was dispatched to Bucharest, where he advised the revolutionaries to carry on with their <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts,</b> and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by Locotenenţa domnească, a triumvirate of regents comprising Heliade, Tell, and Nicolae Golescu. Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of Regulamentul Organic and its system of government. Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by Robert Gilmour Colquhoun in exchange for a deposit of Austrian florins.|$|E
5|$|Nonant {{was elected}} bishop in 1185, {{probably}} in January, and consecrated on 31 January 1188. The long delay between his election and his consecration {{was due to}} Nonant's continued <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> on behalf of Henry II. In 1186, {{he was sent to}} Rome to secure papal permission for the crowning of Prince John as King of Ireland. The bishop-elect was briefly in England from December 1186 until February 1187, but then went with King Henry to the continent and did not return to England until January 1188. However, when Henry returned to France in July 1188, Hugh accompanied the king and did not return until shortly before the coronation of King Richard I of England. Nonant also purchased the offices of Sheriff of Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire. Holding these offices was against canon law, and the bishop's tenure in these offices may have been the cause of his quarrel with Baldwin of Forde.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May, Deutschland was {{attacked}} by two Republican planes. It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias, or else had been fired upon by it. 32 sailors were killed, the Kriegsmarine's greatest loss {{of life in the}} war. After a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia had been the original target, but minefields posed too great a problem), Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement, but British <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> to keep Germany patrolling prevailed. After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement. Republican minister of defense Indalecio Prieto considered a declaration of war on Germany, but Soviet fear of a world war prevented this.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emphasis}} of Maglione's letter {{was not on}} the failure of a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort,</b> but chagrin at the alleged conduct and lack of gratitude of the recipients of the visas. According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, by [...] "improper conduct", Maglione could only have meant that the recipients had continued to practice Judaism.|$|R
50|$|The Western Contact Group (WCG), {{representing}} {{three of}} the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - France, United Kingdom and United States - and including Canada and West Germany, launched a joint <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> in 1977 to bring an internationally acceptable transition to independence for Namibia, after a decade of illegal occupation by apartheid South Africa.|$|R
50|$|United Nations Secretary-General U Thant {{also went}} to Cairo to help {{negotiate}} an agreement to avoid conflict. UN Secretary General, U Thant, visited Cairo for mediation and a renewed <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> to solve the crisis. Talks failed as President Nasser kept the straits closed and Israel {{refused to accept the}} UN troops on its side of the border.|$|R
5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, {{and he seems to}} have had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of the}} clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Navy {{participated in a}} number of {{conflicts}} {{after the end of the}} Cold War. After <b>diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> failed, the Navy was instrumental in the opening phases of the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq; the ships of the navy launched hundreds of Tomahawk II cruise missiles and naval aircraft flew sorties from six carriers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. The battleships Missouri and Wisconsin fired their 16-inch guns for the first time since the Korean War on several targets in Kuwait in early February. In 1999, hundreds of Navy and Marine Corps aircraft flew thousands of sorties from bases in Italy and carriers in the Adriatic against targets in Serbia and Kosovo to try to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. After a 78-day campaign Serbia capitulated to NATO's demands.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diplomatic</b> <b>efforts</b> {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E
5000|$|E3G was {{established}} in 2004, when it {{played a pivotal role}} in the successful <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> to get Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.

50|$|Guttenberg also {{repeatedly}} {{warned of}} the looming threat posed to German and European security by Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, he rejected taking rash military action against Iran and instead called for an international <b>diplomatic</b> <b>effort</b> to deal with Tehran’s nuclear program. As a Member of Parliament, he was a strong critic of the far-left party Die Linke, which he accused of links to terrorists.|$|R
