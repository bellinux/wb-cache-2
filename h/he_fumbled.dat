5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Nevada in {{possession}} of the ball at the Maryland 20-yard line. The first play of the quarter was a rush attempt by Taua, but <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> and recovered the ball for a loss of one yard. On the second play of the quarter, Kaepernick completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marko Mitchell, tying the score at 28–28.|$|E
5|$|After another knee {{operation}} and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was {{kept out of}} the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day (April 29) of the 1981 NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints {{selected}} Tyler with the first pick of the ninth round, 222nd overall. The Saints also possessed the draft's first-overall pick, which they used on Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, a halfback from the University of South Carolina. In his first training camp, Tyler wore number 42, and was signed to a contract on June 23. The 1981 New Orleans Saints finished with four wins and 12 losses, and Tyler played in all 16 games but started none. The former Washington Husky accumulated 183yards rushing on 36carries as well as 23receptions. <b>He</b> <b>fumbled</b> four times overall. In the nine-game 1982 NFL season, the Saints went 4–5. Tyler played all nine games, but again did not start any. On August 29, 1983, the Saints cut Tyler, along with five other players, {{in order to reach}} the 49-man roster limit.|$|E

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a long third down after a quarterback sack on the final play of the first quarter. On the first play of the quarter, Tech quarterback Al Clark was sacked by Brian Simmons, and this time <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> the ball. The loose ball was {{picked up in the}} end zone by Carolina defender Greg Ellis for the Tar Heels' third touchdown of the game. Because North Carolina missed its extra-point kick following its previous touchdown, Tar Heels' head coach Carl Torbush ordered the team to attempt a two-point conversion in order to gain the missed extra point from the previous play. A pass attempt by Keldorf fell incomplete, but with just seven seconds elapsed in the second quarter, North Carolina led 220.|$|E
5|$|Wilkins {{returned}} {{the second half}} kickoff 26yards to the Colts's 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25yards and caught four passes for 19yards as the Colts drove 56yards in 13 plays and scored with a 29-yard field goal from Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19–14. On the Bears' next drive, Jones {{started out with a}} 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down and one on the Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Anthony McFarland. Then, on third down, <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins {{returned the}} ball 12yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked his third field goal to make the score 22–14.|$|E
25|$|After a {{scoreless}} first half, Tech {{opened a}} drive to start the second half with runs from Barron, Harlan, and Ferst. As Barron was about to score, <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> and McDonough recovered {{the ball in the}} end zone. Barron later scored the second touchdown.|$|E

25|$|With 8 minutes remaining, the Lions {{received}} a punt and Daunte Culpepper {{returned to the}} game. Culpepper's pass was complete to John Standeford, but <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> and Tampa Bay recovered. They did not surrender the ball again, and ran out the clock to seal the victory.|$|E
25|$|In the NFC Championship Game {{against the}} Minnesota Vikings on January 24, Bush had only 8 yards rushing on 7 carries with 2 receptions for 33 yards, and <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> a punt return.

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, after a UCLA missed field goal, Earl McCullouch would run 52 yards on a flanker reverse; <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> {{near the end}} of the play but USC recovered. He then caught another 13-yard pass. This set up O. J. Simpson for a weaving 12-yard {{touchdown}} run through most of the UCLA defensive unit in which he dragged two tacklers to the end zone. USC led at halftime 14-7.|$|E

He scored 11 touchdowns, his longest being a 77-yard touchdown run. He averaged 19.7 attempts per game and 99.4 yards per game, and {{over the course of the}} season, Lynch had an average of 5.0 yards per carry. <b>He</b> <b>fumbled</b> 4 times, and lost 2 of them. Lynch was elected into the 2013 Pro Bowl as a reserve.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} league {{game of the}} 2007–08 season, Lehmann made a serious error after just 52 seconds, {{allowing}} David Healy to score for Fulham. However, Lehmann's blushes were spared {{late in the game}} as Arsenal won 2–1. In his second league match against Blackburn Rovers <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> a David Dunn shot to allow Blackburn to equalise, in a game that finished 1–1. On 24 August, the BBC reported that he returned to Germany to treat an Achilles tendon injury which he picked up during international duty against England, meaning Manuel Almunia took his place for Arsenal's third match.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the infamous game-losing play make {{kneeling}} acceptable, {{but most of the}} teams using it changed how it was done. Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> the snap, there was not only no offensive player there to try to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{during the}} season opener <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> with four {{seconds left in the}} first half, which led to a Washington Redskins' {{touchdown}} as time expired that proved to be the difference in the game. Although the call was heavily criticized, after the incident he would not see much action during the team's second worst start in franchise history (one win in their first eight games), that eventually cost the job of head coach Wade Phillips. His special teams shortcomings were also being criticized during the losing streak. On December 5 against the Indianapolis Colts when the season was already lost, he rushed 19 times for 100 yards and a touchdown in a win.|$|E
25|$|The Texans had a fast start, as {{they forced}} two first-half {{turnovers}} {{and had the}} game tied at 14 at halftime. However, that did not hold up {{in the second half}} as the Colts scored 24 second-half points and held Houston to −4 total yards on offense. There was even a drive when Texans QB David Carr was sacked on three straight plays, and on those last two sacks, <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> the ball. But, Houston recovered both fumbles, and punted the ball after those three horrible plays. Colts QB Peyton Manning was 21 for 27 with 237 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, and David Carr was 6 of 9 with 48 passing yards, one touchdown, and an interception.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{was named}} the starter for the opening game of the 2008 season, which was against {{division}} rival, Denver Broncos. The Raiders defense failed to keep the Broncos out {{of the end zone}} while the offense was unable to get into the end zone until late in the game, putting Russell in a rough situation. The Raiders were beaten handily by the Denver Broncos in the 41-14 loss. Russell completed 17 of 26 pass attempts for 180 yards and also threw for 2 touchdowns, finishing with a passer rating of 111.1. <b>He</b> <b>fumbled</b> once early in the red zone while looking to complete a throw to Darren McFadden in the flat. The game showed both his professional aptitude and his inexperience as the Denver defensive schemes both confused and rushed him out of the pocket.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} week, the Bears {{faced the}} Indianapolis Colts for Super Bowl XLI rematch. Although the game {{took place during}} prime-time, they would treat the game {{as if it were}} any other preseason game. Regardless, the Bears won by a score of 27–24, but not without controversy. Grossman, making his homecoming to Indiana, struggled throughout the night. <b>He</b> <b>fumbled</b> the ball three times (though only turning it over once), and threw an interception. Despite completing the night by completing nine of eleven passes for fifty-nine yards and one rushing touchdown, Grossman's struggles became the focus of the night. Griese, however, threw ten completions on thirteen attempts with one touchdown. The Bears defense was able to record three interceptions, while the special teams unit was able to force a fumble on a return. Return specialists Devin Hester and Danieal Manning also performed productively as kick returners.|$|E
25|$|As {{a junior}} in 2004, he was the {{secondary}} captain and led the team in tackles and interceptions. Jones also played briefly on offense, as well as returning punts and kick-offs for the second season. He was named first-team all-Big East as a defensive back and honorable mention All-American by several sources. He led the team with 76 tackles, adding two sacks, three interceptions, and seven passes defended. Jones was named to Collegefootballnews.com's All-American first-team and was named honorable mention All-American at kick returner. Jones was also named Big East Special Teams Player of the Year. His 76-yard punt return against East Carolina was his season-long return and only punt return for a touchdown in Jones' career. He had a long touchdown run against UConn that was negated due to a penalty. Jones ended his college career in the 2005 Gator Bowl, when <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> a kick return early in the game; the Mountaineers lost to Florida State.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the game}} {{appeared}} to be over. However, the Steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the Colts still had three timeouts remaining. But on Pittsburgh's first play, in which Bettis tried to punch it in for an insurance touchdown, <b>he</b> <b>fumbled</b> {{for the first time}} all season when linebacker Gary Brackett popped it from Bettis' hands with his helmet. Indianapolis defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and {{appeared to be}} on his way for an Indy touchdown that would have given the Colts the lead when Roethlisberger made a season saving tackle at the Colts' 42-yard line, spinning around and grabbing his ankle. Eventually, the Colts then advanced to the Pittsburgh 28-yard line, but Vanderjagt, who had been perfect at home in the playoffs, missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left, and the Steelers ran out the clock.|$|E
