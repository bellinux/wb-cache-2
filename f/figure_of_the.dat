40|$|<b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{polishing}} pad are of great significance for <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> optical workpieces in the continuous polishing process. Three main factors which affect <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad, including the {{polishing pad}} creep deformation, the calibration plate grinding and the ambient change in temperature, are analyzed in this work. Processing parameters including the eccentricity between the polishing pad and the calibration plate, the calibration plate thickness, angular velocities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad are introduced in this analytic process. With this method, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polishing pad in the continuous polishing can be obtained.

5|$|From the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally {{into the}} {{pictorial}} space.

The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E
