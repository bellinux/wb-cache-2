Known throughout the textile industry as the Keighley dobby, it has since been copied, modified and manufactured {{in a variety of}} different forms. Hattersley also invented, in 1868, the skip box: a development of the circular or revolving box.

Success was due in part to its close proximity to the Hudson River by way of the Hoosic River. Woolen products were shipped south to New York and Philadelphia, giving the company and the regional industry a huge boost. By 1895 the mill was employing 300, and had achieved the position of being the largest industrial venture in Southwestern Vermont.|$|E

The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698.

60|$|It {{was clearly}} a fact, that through the {{influence}} of the seven trunks Mrs. Cliff was becoming a very popular woman, and Miss Shott did not like it at all. She had never had any faith--at least she said so--in those lumps of gold found in a hole in some part of the world that nobody had ever heard of; and had not hesitated to say that fortunes founded on such wild-goose stories as these should not even be considered by people of good sense who worked for their living, or had incomes which they could depend on. But the <b>dress</b> <b>goods,</b> the ribbons, the gloves, the little clocks, the shoes, the parasols, the breast-pins, the portfolios of pictures, the jewelry, the rugs and table covers, and hundreds of other beautiful and foreign things, were a substantial evidence that Mrs. Cliff's money was not all moonshine.|$|E

60|$|Ah Kim, thirty-seven {{years of}} age, fat and a bachelor, really did want a wife, {{especially}} a small-footed wife; for, China born and reared, the immemorial small-footed female had been deeply impressed into his fantasy of woman. But more, even more {{and far more}} than a small-footed wife, did he want his mother and his mother's delectable beatings. So he declined Fu Yee Po's easy terms, and at much less cost imported his own mother from servant in a boss coolie's house at a yearly wage of a dollar and a thirty- cent dress to be mistress of his Honolulu three-story shack building with two household servants, three clerks, and a porter of all work under her, to say nothing of ten thousand dollars' worth of <b>dress</b> <b>goods</b> on the shelves that ranged from the cheapest cotton crepes to the most expensive hand-embroidered silks.

He seized the young man's throat, being the part which came readiest to his grasp, as Conachar arose from the pretended stumble, and pressing it severely as he cast the lad from him, exclaimed: [...] "Had this been in another place, young gallows bird, I had stowed the lugs out of thy head, as I have done to some of thy clan before thee." ...|$|R

60|$|Lucretia felt {{rather than}} {{expressed}} these ideas and impressions. She was not naturally communicative, and conversed {{with no one}} with less frankness and facility than with her step-mother. Madame Colonna therefore found no reasons in her conversation with Lucretia to change her determination. As her mind was not ingenious {{she did not see}} questions in those various lights which make us at the same time infirm of purpose and tolerant. What she fancied ought to be done, she fancied must be done; for she perceived no middle course or alternative. For the rest, Lucretia's carriage towards her gave her little discomfort. Besides, she herself, though good-natured, was obstinate. Her feelings were not very acute; nothing much vexed her. As long as she had fine <b>dresses,</b> <b>good</b> dinners, and opera-boxes, she could bear her plans to be crossed like a philosopher; and her consolation under her unaccomplished devices was her admirable consistency, which always assured her that her projects were wise, though unfulfilled.|$|R
