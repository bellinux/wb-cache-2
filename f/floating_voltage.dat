50|$|SPICE1 {{was first}} {{presented}} {{at a conference}} in 1973. SPICE1 was coded in FORTRAN and used nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations. Nodal analysis has limitations in representing inductors, <b>floating</b> <b>voltage</b> sources and the various forms of controlled sources. SPICE1 had relatively few circuit elements available and used a fixed-timestep transient analysis. The real popularity of SPICE started with SPICE2 in 1975. SPICE2, also coded in FORTRAN, was a much-improved program with more circuit elements, variable timestep transient analysis using either the trapezoidal (second order Adams-Moulton method) or the Gear integration method (also known as BDF), equation formulation via modified nodal analysis (avoiding the limitations of nodal analysis), and an innovative FORTRAN-based memory allocation system developed by another graduate student, Ellis Cohen. The last FORTRAN version of SPICE was 2G.6 in 1983. SPICE3 was developed by Thomas Quarles (with A. Richard Newton as advisor) in 1989. It is written in C, uses the same netlist syntax, and added X Window System plotting.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{strategies}} {{to control the}} wake-up noise for circuits implemented in MTCMOS technology. In MTCMOS circuits, during the switchings between the active and standby modes, sudden surges in current happens due to <b>floating</b> <b>voltages</b> at the nodes.

In this paper we address the above problem by developing wake-up {{strategies to}} control these current surges as the circuit is getting turned on.

A novel partitioning technique is proposed for MTCMOS circuits under a given constraint of maximum drawncurrent from the power-grid network. Two approaches are proposed in this paper; the optimal ILP-based formulation and a polynomial-time heuristic. Experimental results show that up to 90. 7 % improvement in peak drawn-current is obtained with a maximum of 4 clock cycles time to turn on the circuit. Also result show the effectiveness of the heuristic in terms of the quality of solution and a run-time of up to 6600 times faster than the ILP approach for larger circuits...|$|R
