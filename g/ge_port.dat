And on the LCC's you use the two ethernet interfaces provided with the two RP's in each chassis.In a single SFC with two LCC you will install both SC-GE-22 modules in the single SFC and each interface of the RP connect twice to the single SFC. In a 2 x 2 setup one <b>GE</b> <b>port</b> of each RP connects to one SFC and the other <b>GE</b> <b>port</b> connects to the other SFC. In a four SFC setup the first RP connects to SFC 1 and 3 while the other RP of that shelf connects to SFC 2 and 4.To allow for redundancy you will connect each ethernetport0 interface of each RP to a port on the first FC-FE-22 and each interface 1 to the second SC-FE-22. And to allow for communication between the two Sc-FE-22 modules (creating a mesh-network) you connect port 22 of each SC-FE-22 to each other. In a dual SFC each SC-FE-22 has a direct (full mesh) link to all 3 other SC-FE-22 and in a 4 SFC system you also create a full-mesh network between all FC-FE-22 modules.This cabling means that for a one SFC and two LCC you will need 8+1 ethernet cables for network control, in a dual SFC you will need 14 cables (8xSC-LC + 6 LCC mesh) and in a 4 SFC-2 LCC you need 8 LC cables and 28 SFC-SFC mesh cables.|$|E

This update paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports and the Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex in the period 2000 - 2005, with an emphasis on 2005. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about the financial situation in each port. A global indication concerning the financial health of the companies studied is also provided. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. 2005 was a year of steady growth for most Flemish maritime ports, in terms of quantity of cargo handled and value added, although there was a slight deceleration in comparison to the previous year. The employment situation was, by contrast, somewhat mixed, while investment soared, far exceeding the pace recorded since 2000. The current changes in world trade patterns are having a substantial impact on the operations of the Flemish and Li 8 ge ports, situated at the heart of one of the wealthiest and busiest trading regions of the world. To cope with the accelerating internationalisation of port competition and the tremendous growth of containerised seaborne transport, the ports concerned need to constantly adapt their infrastructures, through innovation and investment. As major logistic centres, they have to face the challenge of responding to increasing demand in terms of capacity, while adding as much value as possible to the goods passing through them. Accessibility and seamless connections with the hinterland are key to their success and durability. This has become absolutely vital in a climate of growing regional and international competition, accentuated by the booming Asian economies. The port of Li 8 ge is striving to turn a threat into an opportunity. In the wake of the Cockerill Sambre blast furnace closure, the Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex is undergoing a major restructuring. Cargo figures were down sharply in 2005, while the economic situation of the area was dominated by stagnation or decline in terms of value added, employment and investment. However, this fall could be shortlived since the revival expected from the development of value-added logistics will also generate increased activity, traffic and demand for manpower.

This update 1 paper provides for the first time an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports together with the Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex in 2004. The results for the rest of the period 1999 - 2003 have also been updated. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about the financial situation of several vital sectors in each port. A global indication concerning the financial health of the companies studied is also provided, using the NBB bankruptcy prediction model. In addition, it includes figures with respect to the ongoing growth of several cargo traffic segments and provides an overall picture of socio-economic developments in the ports. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. 2004 was an excellent year for the Flemish maritime ports as a whole, in terms of the quantity of handled cargo and the value added produced. But the employment situation was more mixed, and private investment dropped. The ongoing developments in the maritime ports sector and in the world economy are having a dramatic impact on the operations of the Flemish ports, which have to deal with the global trend of increasing international competition, expansion and dispersion of foreign trade, capital concentration, privatisation and vertical integration of port logistic services, increase in containerised shipments, and so forth. At the same time, as major logistic centres, they have to face a dual challenge: increasing demand in terms of capacity, and the necessity to add climate of increasing regional and international competition, not only within the Hamburg - Le Havre range but also from Asian markets. The port of Li 8 ge, still the second largest inland port in Europe, is striving to turn a threat into an opportunity. Although the Cockerill Sambre blast furnaces are being closed, that is creating new space and the overall Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex is being restructured. In spite of this climate of uncertainty, the main goal of the Autonomous Port of Li 8 ge is to establish itself as a major logistic centre in the region, able to attract new businesses. In the meantime, the short-term impact on employment is negative, as direct employment decreased substantially in 2004, whereas value added and investment made up for the ground lost in 2003.

(2 ̆ 026) After the upturn in 2010, maritime cargo traffic in the Flemish ports continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace in 2011. Direct value added declined in the four ports in Flanders as a whole. Both maritime and non-maritime clusters as a whole were down. The only increase in value added occurred in the port of Zeebrugge. The value added of the non-maritime clusters in each port declined, while in the maritime cluster, the port of Antwerp was the only one to register a steep drop. Direct employment in the Flemish ports as a whole declined during the year 2011. This is true of both the maritime and non-maritime cluster. Only the port of Ghent registered a rise in employment in both clusters. Investment contracted in the Flemish ports as a whole for the third year in a row. The decline in investment was between 7 and 13 percent in the ports of Antwerp, Ghent and Ostend, whereas Zeebrugge recorded a negative rate of one-fifth in its investment levels in 2011. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Li 8 ge increased slightly in 2011. Direct value added rose in both clusters, while employment registered a decline in the maritime cluster and a rise in the nonmaritime cluster. After falling in 2010, investment picked up again in 2011 in both clusters. The volume of cargo handled at the port of Brussels rose in 2011. Value added in the maritime cluster was up but contracted in the non-maritime cluster. Employment increased in both clusters. The drop in investment recorded since 2009 continued throughout 2011.

Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In terms of maritime cargo traffic, the downturn recorded during the last quarter of 2008 continued throughout 2009. Direct value added declined in all the ports in Flanders. Maritime branches as a whole contracted. Only the value added of the maritime branches in the port of Ostend remained stable. The non-maritime branches as a whole saw a contraction in all the Flemish ports. It was the port of Antwerp that suffered the most from the drop in the value added. Its maritime branches shrank by nearly one third. While the non-maritime branches were slightly down. The port of Ghent recorded a bigger decrease in the non-maritime branches. Conversely, the value added in the port of Zeebrugge fell more sharply in the maritime branches. Direct employment in the ports of Flanders as a whole declined during the year 2009. Except in Ghent, direct employment in the maritime branches fell in all the Flemish ports. Similarly, only one of them, the port of Ostend, recorded a rise in employment in the non-maritime branches. Thanks to this, it has been the only Flemish port to register direct employment growth. Investment decreased in all the ports in Flanders. The decline in investment was between one-sixth and one-fifth in the ports of Ghent, Antwerp and Zeebrugge. While Ostend recorded a cut of more than one third in its investment levels in 2009. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Li 8 ge decreased strongly in 2009. Direct value added and employment registered a significant decline. Maritime and non-maritime branches were down for both value added and employment. Thanks to the "other services" branch of activity, investment rose steadily. The volume of cargo handled at the port of Brussels declined in 2009. Value added in this port remained steady. But employment contracted slightly.

This update paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex and the port of Brussels in the period 2002 - 2007, with an emphasis on 2007. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about social balance and the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics.

[ [...] . ] In terms of maritime cargo traffic, 2007 was another excellent year for all the Flemish maritime ports, driven by the expansion of world trade. Direct value added rose in all the ports in Flanders. Both maritime and non-maritime branches as a whole expanded. The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge enjoyed particularly high growth in direct value added of their maritime branches, unlike the ports of Ostend and Ghent where growth was higher in the non-maritime branches. Direct employment also rose, albeit in less spectacularly: the more moderate growth of the biggest Flemish port - Antwerp - set the tone for the overall result. In this favourable economic environment, investment increased in the Flemish ports as a whole, after falling in 2006. The ports of Antwerp, Ostend and Ghent recorded very high levels of investment in 2007, although not reaching Antwerp's peak of 2005. The rise was more marked in the maritime branches, especially in the ports of Antwerp and Ostende, but the non-maritime branches also recorded strong expansion. With the completion of the Albert II dock, investment in the port of Zeebrugge levelled out, even though there are some other projects in progress. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Li 8 ge again increased in 2007. Direct value added recorded strong growth and employment picked up. Both these variables improved on the previous year's figures, thanks mainly to the metalworking and energy sectors. Investment doubled. A major factor behind this increase was the construction of a new bioethanol plant in Wanze. Despite these good results, the threat of declining activity in the ArcelorMittal factories in Li 8 ge has prompted the local port to pursue its strategy of diversifying traffic. Preparatory work on the land for the Trilogiport project began at the end of 2008. The volume of cargo handled at the port of Brussels rose in 2007. Despite the restrictions on the land available for port-related activities, both value added and employment in the port of Brussels increased. There was a notable fall in investment in the non-maritime branches with the completion of the water purification plant. However, the port authority is continuing with its infrastructure renovation work.

This update paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex and the port of Brussels in the period 2003 - 2008, with an emphasis on 2008. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about social balance and the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In terms of maritime cargo traffic, 2008 was another good year for all the Flemish sea ports, despite the downturn recorded during the last quarter of the year. Except for Ghent, direct value added rose in all the ports in Flanders. Maritime branches as a whole expanded, but the non-maritime branches of trade and industry contracted. The ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend enjoyed growth in both maritime and nonmaritime branches, while in Antwerp and Ghent, the non-maritime branches declined. In Antwerp, however, the growth in direct value added in the maritime branches was particularly high, unlike the port of Ghent. Direct employment rose slightly during the year 2008. Again, direct employment in the maritime branches as a whole increased, whereas it declined in trade and industry. Nonetheless, a rise in employment was reported in all the Flemish ports apart from Antwerp. After the growth of 2007, investment declined marginally in the Flemish ports across the board. The ports of Antwerp, Ostend and Ghent recorded higher investment in 2008. Thanks to the port of Antwerp's shipowners, the rise was concentrated in the maritime branches, whereas the non-maritime branches as a whole declined, due to the downturn in the Antwerp region. In the other ports, investment in the non-maritime branches expanded. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Li 8 ge increased again in 2008. Direct value added and employment registered strong growth. Due to the metalworking and energy sectors, employment improved on the previous year's figures. Fuel production and the chemicals industry accounted for the growth in value added. Investment rose strongly, too. A major factor behind this increase was the construction of a new bioethanol plant in Wanze and a waste treatment plant in Herstal. At the end of the year, ArcelorMittal decided to shut down blast furnace n 06 in Seraing, a decision that will have an impact on the activity in the port of Li 8 ge. The volume of cargo handled at the port of Brussels rose again in 2008. Value added in this port increased and employment remained steady. After falling back in 2007, investment picked up thanks to the infrastructure renovation work undertaken by the port authority on the former Carcoke site.

This update paper 1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 <b>ge</b> <b>port</b> complex and the port of Brussels in the period 2001 - 2006, with an emphasis on 2006. The port of Brussels has been included in the analysis for the first time. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about the financial situation in each port except for Brussels. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In terms of quantity of cargo handled, 2006 was an excellent year for the Flemish maritime ports as a whole, driven by the world trade expansion. Direct value added rose in all Flemish port, except for Antwerp. Direct employment also increased, mainly in the maritime branches as a result of seaborne traffic growth. Investment on the other hand, took a downward plunge after the exceptionally high amounts in 2005. This was mainly due to a number of shipping companies and - to a lesser extent - the completion of the Deurganckdok in Antwerp. The current changes in world trade patterns have a substantial impact on the activities in the Flemish ports. To cope with the accelerating internationalisation of port competition and the tremendous growth of containerised seaborne transport, the ports need to constantly adapt their infrastructures, through innovation and investment. As major logistic centres, they have to face the challenge of responding to increasing demand in terms of capacity, while adding as much value as possible to the goods passing through them. To face this challenge, they try to focus on particular branches or aspects for which they believe they hold all the winning cards. This has become absolutely vital in a climate of growing regional and international competition, accentuated by the booming Asian economies. All figures indicate that the situation is improving for the port of Li 8 ge. The growth of value added, investment and quantity of cargo handled exceeds last year's figures. Employment still decreases but to a lesser extent. Moreover, the future is looking even brighter as the TriLogiPort project should begin to make progress, the blast furnace 6 of Arcelor in Seraing has been reopened, a new bioethanol plant is being built in Wanze and several works developing the infrastructure are being carried out. The last few years, the quantity of cargo handled at the port of Brussels has stabilised. In terms of land available for port related activities, the port of Brussels has reached its limits. As a result, the extension of the infrastructure is one of the main priorities, all the more because the port authority has set ambitious goals for the near future. The present report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details per economic sector, though the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2006...|$|E
