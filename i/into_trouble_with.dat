5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to renew the}} station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> the FCC due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing.

He only reached the East in spring, and assumed his new command at Monocarton in April. Priscus immediately ran <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> the soldiers: his haughty manner in refusing to mingle with them made him unpopular, and when a decree by Emperor Maurice which reduced army pay by a quarter was announced, the soldiers mutinied on Easter day, 18 April 588.
