5|$|Eventually, Poland and Lithuania {{reached an}} {{agreement}} on a new border that left Sejny on the Polish side of the border. The Polish–Lithuanian border in the Suwałki Region <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since then (with {{the exception of the}} World War II period).|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department {{designated}} M-189 {{as a state}} trunkline {{highway in}} late 1932 or early 1933. During {{the latter half of}} 1936, the department paved the highway in its entirety. The route <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since. The current bridge across the Brule River was built in 1988.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since then.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Hugh Fulton {{organized}} 142 {{specific and}} varietal names into eighteen species groups containing {{a total of}} 64 species. When Henry Augustus Pilsbry's 1900 monograph Manual of Conchology appeared, {{the number of species}} in the genus Amphidromus had increased to 81, and these were placed in nineteen groups. Pilsbry's study <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> only illustrated monograph of the genus, and it is still considered indispensable for any serious study of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the NBA {{agreed with}} the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an {{arrangement}} that <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E

5|$|Judge Judy has {{maintained}} preeminence within its genre. Since its debut, it <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> No. 1 rated court show and regularly draws approximately 9 to 10 million viewers daily. During the 2009–10 television season, Judge Judy {{became the first}} TV series in nearly a decade to attract more daytime viewers than The Oprah Winfrey Show. Since then, {{it has been the}} highest rated show in all of daytime television.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, {{providing}} access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of the highways {{at either end of the}} route, the route <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since then.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1920s, connecting US Highway10 (US10, Woodward Avenue, now M-1) with US25 (Gratiot Avenue, now M-3). Extensions to the highway designation moved the termini in the 1930s and 1940s east to M-29 (Jefferson Avenue) and US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5). A change in the 1960s added a section of north–south roadway to {{the eastern end of}} M-102; that change was reversed within about a year. A western extension along Grand River Avenue in 1977 was reversed in 1994, and M-102 <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
5|$|Vocalist Andrew Schwab <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> band's lead lyricist. Schwab {{has said}} most lyrics {{are based on}} his emotions. He also tries to {{incorporate}} social commentary from literature. Prominent influences include comic book artist Chris Ware and writers Chris Bachelder, Don DeLillo, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and T. S. Eliot. He has written lyrics around {{a variety of topics}} that include alcohol abuse ("One-Armed Man"), conformity ("S.M.C."), emptiness ("Evil (A Chorus of Resistance)"), greed ("Cold and Calculated"), nightlife ("Molotov"),, spirituality ("Chapter 2"), pornography ("P.S."), and child molestation ("Sioux Lane Spirits").|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} four drafts the Rockets participated in, each team had a total of 90 draft choices (14 in 1967, and 19 each from 1968 to 1971). For two drafts in 1972 and 1973, there were eight rounds, and from 1974 to 1985, the draft was 10 rounds long. However, in 1985, the draft was {{shortened}} to seven rounds, and in 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E
5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to make the connection with the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to smooth out the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same to this day.|$|E

5|$|NY73 was {{truncated}} to {{its current}} eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US9, while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY74, matching the other Vermont route number that ends in Larrabees Point. The already existing NY74 in Chautauqua County (in the Jamestown area) was renumbered to NY474 as a result. The opening of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY74 from US9 to I-87. By 1981, NY74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga, on a concurrency with NY22. The highway <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same since that date.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Raptors {{have made}} 34 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft {{selections}} during their draft history. The Raptors {{began as an}} expansion team in 1995 and first participated in the NBA draft on June 28, 1995 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season.

5|$|The {{history of}} the rugby ground begins with the first stands {{appearing}} for spectators in the ground in 1881–1882. Originally the Arms Park had a cricket ground {{to the north and}} a rugby union stadium to the south. By 1969, the cricket ground had been demolished {{to make way for the}} present day rugby ground to the north and a second rugby stadium to the south, called the National Stadium. The National Stadium, which was used by Wales national rugby union team, was officially opened on 7 April 1984, however in 1997 it was demolished to make way for the Millennium Stadium in 1999, which hosted the 1999 Rugby World Cup and became the national stadium of Wales. The rugby ground <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>the</b> home of the semi-professional Cardiff RFC yet the professional Cardiff Blues regional rugby union team moved to the Cardiff City Stadium in 2009, but returned three years later.|$|E
