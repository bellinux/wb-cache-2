5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Indiana, Sadler moved to Michigan as a {{teenager}} {{to work at the}} Battle Creek Sanitarium. There he met the physician and health-food promoter John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of corn flakes breakfast cereal, who became his mentor. Sadler married Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, in 1897. He worked for several Christian organizations and attended medical school, graduating in 1906. Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago with his wife, who was also a physician. He joined several medical associations and taught at the McCormick Theological Seminary. Although he was a committed member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for almost twenty years, he left the denomination after it disfellowshipped his wife's uncle in 1907. Sadler and his wife became speakers on the Chautauqua adult education circuit in 1907, and he became a highly paid, popular orator. He eventually wrote over 40 books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics advocating a <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> to health. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion but was skeptical of mediums, assisting debunker Howard Thurston, and embraced the scientific consensus on evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of diplomatic history, was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with twenty-seven years of history, the series spanned the longest time period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E

30|$|To {{handle these}} {{complexity}} in Arabic script in general, and in Urdu Nasta’liq script in particular, {{a number of}} different approaches have been studied (Naz et al. 2014 a). These approaches can be primarily categorized under Analytical and <b>Holistic</b> frameworks. Analytical <b>approaches</b> are further divided into explicit segmentation and implicit segmentation based methods. Explicit segmentation approaches usually have three major steps: over-segmentation, grouping, and classification. In the first phase, the ligature is segmented into units not bigger than various shapes of character and then grouping is performed onto the recognized unit to form ligature hypotheses. These ligature candidates are then fed to the recognition engine to find the most plausible combination. These approaches are script dependent and are mainly based on the analytical characteristics of the particular script to perform segmentation (Naz et al. 2015 b). Accurate and consistent segmentation under various document degradations usually becomes a performance bottle-neck of such systems. Implicit segmentation approaches are based on predefined labels or code-books for images of text-lines, words or ligatures. The labels with their corresponding images are fed to a given machine learning model, which is then used to identify segmentation cue points at recognition time without pre-segmented units of ligatures (Saeed and Albakoor 2009). On the other hand, <b>holistic</b> <b>approaches</b> deal with the shapes of the entire ligatures. In this way, the shape of the ligature or sub-word is learned by the model without segmenting it into sub units. In <b>holistic</b> <b>approaches,</b> the system is trained for recognizing each ligature/word directly. <b>Holistic</b> <b>approaches</b> are considered to be script independent. However, they suffer from scalability issues as the number of unique shapes regarding ligatures or sub-word in a particular script may be very large. Urdu has more than 25, 000 ligatures (Lehal 2012), thus the <b>holistic</b> based <b>approaches</b> are not suitable for such a large number of classes. However, small scale applications such as city names, bank checks etc, with limited vocabulary could be developed using <b>holistic</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|R
