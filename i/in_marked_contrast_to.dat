5|$|Dupuy de Lôme was {{designed}} to fill the commerce-raiding strategy of the Jeune École. Considered by some the first true armoured cruiser, she was superior to existing British and Italian protected cruisers, especially in her relatively thick steel armour. She could control the engagement range with her superior speed and her heavy armament of quick-firing guns, {{all of which were}} mounted in gun turrets, <b>in</b> <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> her intended opponents who mounted their guns in lightly protected casemates or pivot mounts.|$|E

This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.|$|E

This was <b>in</b> <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> previous expeditions, and Given-Wilson compares it specifically to the 'devastation wreacked' in last such campaign, by Richard II in 1385.

Brown has suggested the king 'envisaged... a punitive expedition' with either a confrontation or such a chevauchée that the Scots would be eager to negotiate. In the event, they offered no resistance as the English army marched through Haddington.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. <b>In</b> <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|The first agreement, {{signed on}} 14 September 1937, {{included}} plans to counterattack aggressive submarines. Naval patrols were established; the United Kingdom and France were to patrol {{most of the}} western Mediterranean {{and parts of the}} east, and the other signatories were to patrol their own waters. Italy was to be allowed to join the agreement and patrol the Tyrrhenian Sea if it wished. A second agreement followed three days later, applying similar provisions to surface ships. Italy and Germany did not attend, although the former took up naval patrols in November. <b>In</b> <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the actions of the Non-Intervention Committee and the League of Nations, this conference succeeded in preventing attacks by submarines.|$|E
5|$|The patrols were {{a strain}} on the Royal Navy and the {{provisions}} were relaxed with French agreement, effective from January. Submarine activity soon returned and full patrols were resumed in early February. On the whole, submarine activity during this period did not amount to much; patrols were again relaxed in May, and the agreement suspended in August. The success of the conference was <b>in</b> <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{the failure of the}} Non-Intervention Committee. The Nationalists and Italians switched to using air power against shipping; at least one ship was sunk off the Spanish coast by aircraft in the final months of 1937.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, <b>in</b> <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, by 1612–13, the Wodeyars {{exercised}} a {{great deal}} of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal overlordship of the Aravidu dynasty, tributes and transfers of revenue to Chandragiri stopped.

Chamaraja VI and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward but were thwarted by the Bijapur Sultanate and its Maratha subordinates, though the Bijapur armies under Ranadullah Khan were effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna. Expansionist ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar acquired Satyamangalam (in modern northern Coimbatore district) while his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil regions of Erode and Dharmapuri, after successfully repulsing the chiefs of Madurai. The invasion of the Keladi Nayakas of Malnad was also dealt with successfully. This period was followed by one of complex geo-political changes, when in the 1670s, the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} dinosaur {{research}} {{has enjoyed a}} surge in activity {{that began in the}} 1970s and is ongoing.

Vertebrate paleontology has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the amazingly well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of cladistics, which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} viscoelastic {{theory of}} nematodynamic type is developed for nematic liquid crystalline (LC) semi-flexible polymers. A measure of transient elastic strain {{due to the}} change in length of macromolecular strands under stress, {{and the director of}} unit length are employed in the theory as hidden variables. <b>In</b> the <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the common theoretical approaches to low molecular nematics, the effect of directors space gradient is neglected in the present theory. Nevertheless, the theory allows describing nonlinear anisotropic viscoelasticity and evolution equation for the director in flows of LC polymers. When LC macromolecules are relatively rigid or when they are soft but the flow is slow, a weakly nonlinear viscoelastic anisotropic behavior is described by few temperature dependent parameters. In the infinitesimal case the evolution equation for director reminds the Ericksens equation, but with an additional relaxation term. The present theory can also be applied for analyzing flows of concentrated polymer suspensions and nano-composites filled with uniaxially symmetric particles. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

40|$|Pronounced {{enhancements}} {{of total}} and tropospheric ozone were observed with the Brewer spectrophotometer and ozonesondes at Watukosek (7. 5 °S, 112. 6 °E), Indonesia in 1994 and in 1997 when extensive forest fires {{were reported in}} Indonesia. The integrated tropospheric ozone increased from 20 DU to 40 DU in October 1994 and to 55 DU in October 1997. On October 13, 1994, most ozone mixing ratios were more than 50 ppbv throughout the troposphere and exceeded 80 ppbv at some altitudes. On October 22, 1997, the concentrations were more than 50 ppbv throughout the troposphere and exceeded 100 ppbv at several altitudes. The coincidences of the ozone enhancements with the forest fires suggest the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone due to its precursors emitted from the fires for both cases. The years of 1994 and 1997 correspond to El Niño events when convective activity becomes low in Indonesia. Thus, in this region, {{it is likely that}} pronounced enhancements of tropospheric ozone associated with extensive forest fires due to sparse precipitation may take place with a period of a few years coinciding with El Niño events.

By the age of 7, Lewis-Clack’s piano abilities coupled with both blindness and manifestation of autistic symptoms led to the label “prodigious musical savant.” “Savant Syndrome is a rare but remarkable condition in which persons with developmental disabilities,have some spectacular 'islands of genius' that stand <b>in</b> <b>marked,</b> jarring <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> overall limitations.”.
