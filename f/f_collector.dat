Ellipsometry investigations revealed a significant decrease in the refractive index of the films with ageing of the corresponding precursor sols. In contrast, the photoluminescence properties of the films are independent of precursor ageing time, although significant differences are observed with respect to the corresponding bulk materials. Compared to the bulk materials, the films exhibit a significant blue-shift of the excitation spectra and an increase of the excited state lifetime.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an adaptive}} PDE observer for battery state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimation. Real-time state and parameter information enables operation near physical limits without compromising durability, thereby unlock-ing the full potential of battery energy storage. SOC/SOH esti-mation is technically challenging because battery dynamics {{are governed by}} electrochemical principles, mathematically modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). Simultaneous state and parameter estimation is extremely challenging in PDE models. Consequently, several new theoretical ideas are developed, inte-grated together, and tested. These include a backstepping PDE state estimator, a Padé-based parameter identifier, nonlinear pa-rameter sensitivity analysis, and adaptive inversion of nonlinear output functions. The end result is the first combined SOC/SOH battery estimation algorithm that identifies physical system vari-ables via an electrochemical model, from measurements of voltage and current only.

40|$|The Blattid fauna of Celebes, the Moluccas, and New Guinea, {{a region}} which from a zoogeographical {{point of view}} forms an {{important}} area of transition, is still insufficiently known. Moreover {{the literature on the}} Blattids of this region is scattered in various papers which made it desirable to give a general survey of the hitherto known species of the group from Celebes, the Moluccas, and New Guinea. The present paper deals with the material of Blattidae from the region mentioned above contained in the Leiden and in the Amsterdam museums. I am indebted to Prof. Dr. H. Boschma and Dr. H. C. Blöte of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden, and to Prof. Dr. L. F. de Beaufort and Mr. J. B. Corporaal of the Zoological Museum at Amsterdam for placing the material at my disposal. Further I should like to express my thanks to the board of Greshoff's Rumphiusfonds for a grant which enabled me to carry out the investigations. As far as concerns our knowledge of the Blattidae in the region dealt with in the present paper, Celebes is the best known although the number of known species probably represents a part only of the existing forms. Hanitsch (1933) already came to this conclusion as he could state that few species only were caught by more than one collector.

5000|$|During the {{lifetime}} of Hume, Blyth was considered the father of Indian ornithology. Hume's achievement which made use of a large network of correspondents was recognised even during his time: Mr. Blyth, who is rightly called the Father of Indian Ornithology, [...] "was {{by far the most}} important contributor to our knowledge of the Birds of India." [...] Seated, {{as the head of the}} Asiatic Society's Museum, he, by intercourse and through correspondents, not only formed a large collection for the Society, but also enriched the pages of the Society's Journal with the results of his study, and thus did more for the extension of the study of the Avifauna of India than all previous writers. There can be no work on Indian Ornithology without reference to his voluminous contributions. The most recent authority, however, is Mr. Allen O. Hume, C.B., who, like Blyth and Jerdon, got around him numerous workers, and did so much for Ornithology, that without his Journal Stray Feathers, no accurate knowledge could be gained of the distribution of Indian birds. His large museum, so liberally made over to the nation, is ample evidence of his zeal and the purpose to which he worked. Ever saddled with his official work, he yet found time for carrying out a most noble object. His Nests and Eggs, Scrap Book and numerous articles on birds of various parts of India, the Andamans and the Malay Peninsula, are standing monuments of his fame throughout the length and breadth of the civilised world. His writings and the field notes of his curator, contributors and collectors are the pith of every book on Indian Birds, and his vast collection is the ground upon which all Indian Naturalists must work. Though differing from him on some points, yet the palm is his as an authority above the rest in regard to the Ornis of India. Amongst the hundred and one contributors to the Science in the pages of Stray Feathers, there are some who may be ranked as specialists in this department, and their labors need a record. These are Mr. W. T. Blanford, late of the Geological Survey, an ever watchful and zealous Naturalist of some eminence. Mr. Theobald, also of the Geological Survey, Mr. Ball of the same Department, and Mr. W. E. Brooks.

40|$|Analytical, {{computational}} {{and experimental}} studies {{were carried out}} to investigate heat transfer and fluid flow in micro-channel absorber plates for compact (thin and light-weight) solar thermal collectors. The main objective of the work was to study different design and/or operating scenarios as well as study the significance of various micro-scaling effects. Analytical investigation showed that, under similar conditions, the proposed design yields a much higher fin efficiency, <b>F</b> and <b>collector</b> efficiency factor, F’ compared with the conventional solar collector design. An analytical model combining convective heat transfer in the collector fluid with axial conduction in the metal plate was developed. The predicted plate temperature profiles from the analytical model were in close agreement with the measured profiles. The model further showed that axial thermal conduction can significantly alter the plate temperature profile. Experiments were designed to represent real life operation of the proposed system. A CFD study, using the same design and operating parameters, produced results comparable with experiments. This numerical simulation also gave further insight into the heat transfer and fluid flow patterns in the micro-channel plate. The effect of channel cross section geometry was studied. The Nusselt number was observed to increase as the aspect ratio approached unity. Measured friction factors were similar in trend to the predictions for rectangular channels, although the overall rise in fluid temperature resulted in slightly lower friction factors. Thermal performance reduced slightly with increase in hydraulic diameter. The significance of various scaling effects was also investigated experimentally and numerically. Most of the typical scaling effects such as viscous dissipation and entrance effects were found to be insignificant however, conjugate heat transfer, surface boundary condition, surface finish and measurement uncertainties could be significant. The results showed a Reynolds number dependent Nusselt number which has been attributed to axial thermal conduction. It was also observed that only three walls were transferring heat; the walls of heat transfer had a uniform peripheral temperature while the heat flux varied peripherally. The closest simplified thermal boundary condition to represent heat transfer in these channels is the H 1 with three (3) walls transferring heat. Increased surface roughness (obtained by using an etching technique to create the channels) was found to have a detrimental effect on heat transfer. The results showed that thermal improvement can be achieved by increasing the fluid velocity; however, pumping the thermal fluid above a pump power per plate area of 0. 3 W/m 2 resulted in marginal improvement. In practice, optimum microchannel geometry in plates should be sized based on fluid properties and operating conditions. The micro-channels should also have thin walls to minimise the effects of conjugate heat transfer. A Photovoltaic pump should be installed alongside the collector in order to provide pumping power required and minimise the overall fluid temperature rise. The results are beneficial for the design of micro-channel absorber plates for low heat flux operation up to 1000 W/m 2. ...|$|R
500|$|In 1910, Arthur Smith Woodward named Megalosaurus bradleyi {{based on}} a skull from the Middle Jurassic, the {{specific}} name honouring the <b>collector</b> <b>F.</b> Lewis Bradley. In 1926, this was made a separate genus Proceratosaurus. In 1920, Werner Janensch named Megalosaurus ingens, [...] "the enormous", based on specimen MB R 1050, a twelve centimetre long tooth from German East Africa. It possibly represents a large member of the Carcharodontosauridae; Carrano e.a. saw it as an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 1923, von Huene renamed Poekilopleuron bucklandii Eudes-Deslongchamps 1838 into Megalosaurus poikilopleuron. Today, the genus Poekilopleuron is generally seen as valid. In the same publication, von Huene named two additional Megalosaurus species. The first was Megalosaurus parkeri, its specific name honouring William Kitchen Parker and {{based on a}} pelvis, leg bones and vertebrae from the Late Cretaceous. This was made the separate genus Metriacanthosaurus in 1964. The second was Megalosaurus nethercombensis, named after its provenance from Nethercombe and based on two dentaries, leg bones, a pelvis and vertebrae from the Middle Jurassic, which von Huene himself in 1932 made the separate genus Magnosaurus. In 1925, Depéret, based on two teeth from Algeria, named Megalosaurus saharicus. In 1931/1932 this was made the separate genus Carcharodontosaurus. In 1956 von Huene by mistake named the same species as Megalosaurus africanus, intending to base it on remains from Morocco but referring the Algerian teeth; this implies that M. africanus is a junior objective synonym of M. saharicus. In 1926, von Huene named Megalosaurus lydekkeri, its specific name honouring Richard Lydekker, based on BMNH 41352, i.e. the same specimen {{that had already been}} made the holotype of M. woodwardi (Lydekker, 1909). This implies that M. lydekkeri is a junior objective synonym of M. woodwardi. It is likewise seen as a nomen dubium. In the same publication von Huene named Megalosaurus terquemi based on three teeth found near Hettingen, its specific name honouring Olry Terquem. It is seen as a nomen dubium, the fossil material probably representing some member of the Phytosauria or some other archosaur. In 1932, a work by von Huene mentioned a Megalosaurus (Magnosaurus) woodwardi, a synonym of Magnosaurus woodwardi named in the same book. Its type specimen is differing from the earlier Megalosaurus woodwardi (Lydekker, 1909), the two names are not synonyms. In 1954 Samuel Welles named Megalosaurus wetherilli. This species is exceptional in being based on a rather complete skeleton, found in Arizona, from the Early Jurassic. Its specific name honours John Wetherill. In 1970, Welles made this the separate genus Dilophosaurus. In 1955, Albert-Félix de Lapparent named Megalosaurus mersensis based on a series of twenty-three vertebrae found near Tizi n'Juillerh in a layer of the El Mers Formation of Morocco. This probably represents a member of the Mesosuchia. In 1956, Alfred Sherwood Romer renamed Aggiosaurus nicaeensis Ambayrac 1913, based on a lower jaw found near Nice, on the authority of von Huene into Megalosaurus nicaeensis. Originally it had been considered to be some crocodilian; present opinion confirms this. In 1957, de Lapparent named Megalosaurus pombali based on three teeth found near Pombal in the Jurassic of Portugal. Today it is seen as a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.|$|R
