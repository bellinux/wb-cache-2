25|$|Of decisive {{importance}} for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either {{be caused by a}} reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments {{under the influence of the}} <b>external</b> <b>stress.</b> Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1cm3 cube of quartz with 2kN (500lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.|$|E

For example, the δD values of multiple leaf wax molecules are enriched in shrubs (median ~ -90‰) relative to trees (median ~ -135‰), which themselves are enriched relative to both C3 (median ~ -160‰) and C4 grasses (median ~ -140‰). Between individual species, substantial variation of δD values have been documented.

2500|$|The {{internal}} electric dipoles of a {{ferroelectric material}} are coupled {{to the material}} lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change {{the strength of the}} dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization). [...] The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge. [...] This can cause current flow {{in the case of a}} ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> to a material is called piezoelectricity. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called pyroelectricity.|$|E
2500|$|G0 is a resting phase {{where the}} cell {{has left the}} cycle and has stopped dividing. [...] The cell cycle starts with this phase. [...] The word [...] "post-mitotic" [...] is {{sometimes}} {{used to refer to}} both quiescent and senescent cells. Non-proliferative (non-dividing) cells in multicellular eukaryotes generally enter the quiescent G0 state from G1 and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for neurons). This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated. Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> and usually constitutes an arrest in G1. Some cells enter the G0 phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic, e.g., some liver, kidney, and stomach cells. Many cells do not enter G0 and continue to divide throughout an organism's life, e.g., epithelial cells.|$|E

At the same time, the level of ompF porin expression is noticeably affected. Because of the role of these proteins in membrane permeability, these data suggest that OmpF and OmpX are involved in the control of the penetration of antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones through the enterobacterial outer membrane.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{sufficiently}} general thermally activated {{mechanism for}} extension of dislocations in some preferential direction was proposed. This mechanism comprises a necessary step of dislocation transformations {{that lead to}} blocking. The reasons for blocking {{of different types of}} dislocations in different materials are diverse. A new concept was developed concerning the possibility of thermally activated blocking of superdislocations in the absence of <b>external</b> <b>stresses.</b> Some experiments with single crystals of Ni 3 (Al, Nb) were performed. They included no-load heating after preliminary low- or high-temperature deformation. It was found that the initial dislocation structure, which included curvilinear dislocations, transformed to a set of long rectilinear blocked superdislocations after no-load heating. The experimental results confirmed theoretical assumptions on the possibility of thermally activated transformations of superdislocations to indestructible barriers in the absence of <b>external</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R

Under various stress conditions, we measured the cell growth of the wild-type E. coli and the dps knockout mutant E. coli (△dps) cells using a UV spectrophotometer. The growth rate of the cells was compared to in-vestigate the functional roles of the DPS protein in E. coli. In comparison to the properties of the wild-type E. coli cells, the dps knockout mutant E. coli (△dps) cells showed highly sensitive phenotypes under various stress conditions, such as heat shock, acidic pH, nutrient deficiency, and different con-centrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that DPS plays key roles in E. coli in combat-ing diverse <b>external</b> <b>stresses.</b> The DPS DNA-binding protein in E. coli plays crucial roles in bacterial cell growth and in the protection of the cells from environmental stresses by tightly binding and pre-serving their DNA molecules.
