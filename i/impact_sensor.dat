40|$|Constructing a {{sediment}} budget from morphological channel change, typically {{measured using}} repeat cross-sectional surveys, has proven a useful technique for estimating mean bedload transport rates in gravel-bed rivers. We apply and suggest {{improvements to the}} approach using new data sources from an intensely monitored 5. 6 km reach of an upland gravel-bed river in northern England. Sediment <b>impact</b> <b>sensors</b> {{were placed in the}} bed to record the instantaneous passage of grains during transport events. These sensors provide valuable information for the budget including: (1) a downstream budget limit from which the rest of the budget can be calculated; (2) estimates of sediment input from tributaries; and (3) a better indication of active transport time used in the calculation of average transport rates. Further information collected from field studies include estimates of lateral inputs from the banks using field surveys and bank erosion pins and estimates of the variability of sediment porosity from bed grain size distributions. Budget calculations for different locations and time periods demonstrate large spatial and temporal variabilities in bedload transport rates over a short distance (< 3 km). Whilst some uncertainty in the new data sources remains, this work highlights some limitations of the traditional budget approach and some potential solutions; in particular the value of sediment <b>impact</b> <b>sensors</b> for sediment transport studies...|$|R

40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{in this thesis}} that an experimental method may be successfully employed {{with the purpose of}} discerning the differences in the resultant strain of thin aluminium plates due to impacts of projectiles with varying composition and speed. It also proposes a method for discerning the relative energy imparted to a plate initially hit by a projectile, compared with a plate positioned behind the initial plate, for the purpose of speculating why a relatively energetic projectile may yield less strain of the initial plate when compared with the results of the use of lower energy projectiles of a different composition. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) films are used to measure the strain of the plates, by observing the induced voltage given by the films as they are strained along with the plate. The voltage induced by the <b>sensors,</b> for any <b>impact</b> in question within the project, is recorded over a specific time period, and from this data a peak voltage amplitude is ascertained and is associated with the energy transferred to the plate by the relevant projectile. This thesis finds that differences in the response of PVDF sensors are observed as projectiles with different characteristics are used, and that further study should be undertaken to allow for a proper understanding of the relation between projectile properties, and the amount of strain detected by <b>impact</b> <b>sensors.</b> The decay time of the acoustic signal trace given by <b>impact</b> <b>sensors</b> is shown to increase exponentially as projectile density is increased.

This article is {{the first part of}} a two-part review in which we look beyond commonly recognized chemical biocompatibility to explore the biomechanics of the sensor–tissue interface as an important aspect of continuous glucose sensor biocompatibility. Part I provides a theoretical framework to describe how biomechanical factors such as motion and pressure (typically micromotion and micropressure) give rise to interfacial stresses, which affect tissue physiology around a sensor and, in turn, <b>impact</b> <b>sensor</b> performance. Three main contributors to sensor motion and pressure are explored: applied forces, sensor design, and subject/patient considerations. We describe how acute forces can temporarily <b>impact</b> <b>sensor</b> signal and how chronic forces can alter the foreign body response and inflammation around an implanted sensor, and thus <b>impact</b> <b>sensor</b> performance. The {{importance of}} sensor design (e. g., size, shape, modulus, texture) and specific implant location on the tissue response are also explored.

40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{and examines}} the sources {{responsible for the}} variations in the peak signal from a thin plate <b>impact</b> <b>sensor</b> used to measure particle radius. Steel spherical particles, dropped onto a thin aluminium plate that is simply supported on all sides, cause plate vibrations that are detected by a piezo-electric transducer. The peak positive signal from the sensor {{is used as a}} measure of the radius of the impacting particle. The thin plate <b>impact</b> <b>sensor</b> is a simplified version of a sensor from a commercial device known as the grain loss monitor. Earlier experiments using the grain loss monitor sensor to measure the radius of particles, reported an unexplainable peak sensor signal variation. An Experimental and a theoretical analysis of this problem using the thin plate <b>impact</b> <b>sensor,</b> shows that small changes in impact position result in large changes in the peak sensor signal. Experiments using six steel spheres, ranging in radius from 3 / 32 inches to 8 / 32 inches, impacting onto a square 1 / 32 inch thick aluminium plate, show that the peak sensor signal and the degree of sensitivity of the peak signal to changes in impact position depends on. the location of the impact site. Specifically, for the impact locations tested, this sensitivity exhibits a minimum at approximately 2 cm from the transducer and a maximum sensitivity at the transducer site. Therefore, using these results, a hypothetical change in the impact position of approximately 0. 1 % of the lateral dimension of the plate, or about 0. 5 mm, results in the peak sensor signal exhibiting changes, for all the particles tested, that average 4. 7 %, 3. 9 %, 1. 9 %, and 4. 5 % of the peak at impact locations at approximately 0 cm, 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm from the transducer, respectively. The peak sensor signal also shows an almost linear response to changes in particle radius at a. ll impact positions tested, indicating that the peak signal of this particular sensor configuration provides a measure of particle radius. A theoretical model and analysis of the thin plate <b>impact</b> <b>sensor</b> identifies the factors that influence the generation of the peak sensor signal and indicates that changes in the impact position are the most likely cause for changes in the peak sensor signal. Numeric simulations, using the theoretical model to approximate the experimental thin plate <b>impact</b> <b>sensor,</b> confirm that the sensor signal and its spectra change with impact location and particle radius to a degree that is similar to that seen in the experimental results. However, the simulated peak sensor signals are not accurately modelled and is due to the simple transducer model having difficulty reproducing the large signal response of the transducer. An extension of the theoretical and experimental results to the grain loss monitor sensor in sizing steel spheres suggests that unperceived changes in impact position of approximately 0. 4 % of the sensor's lateral dimension, or changes in distance of about 0. 25 mm and 0. 5 mm in the shortest and longest lateral plate dimensions, respectively, could result in a standard deviation of 16 % of the mean peak sensor signal...|$|E
