5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using <b>glossy</b> <b>paper,</b> unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E

These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on <b>glossy</b> <b>paper.</b> The majority of the pictures are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity.

25|$|Fine ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) {{is an essential}} ingredient in the microporous film used in diapers and some building films as the pores are nucleated around the {{calcium carbonate}} particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC or PCC {{is used as a}} filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of <b>glossy</b> <b>paper.</b> Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometres.|$|E
25|$|The front covers {{featured}} {{images of}} the narrating Animorph undergoing the various stages {{of one of the}} morphs from the story, with a few exceptions (noted in each book's article). Behind the morphing character were images of clouds and skies, which became more colorful and elaborate as the series progressed. All the covers of the regular series books had a small cutout over part of the full morph's anatomy, revealing a computer-generated illustration on the first page, which was printed on <b>glossy</b> <b>paper.</b> The illustration shared the image of the full morph with the front cover, but placed within an environment from the story. The book spines repeated the narrating character's face from the front cover, and the spine color changed with every new episode, resulting in a very colorful collection when viewed from any angle. A small excerpt from one of the book's chapters was printed on the inside of every front cover.|$|E
500|$|When it debuted, {{there were}} more than twenty-nine {{publications}} catering to women. Upon the publication of its first issue in 1896, Review of Reviews called it [...] "one of the most popular of the magazines that have been started this year". The illustrated magazine was produced monthly and cost sixpence (cheap enough for middle-class readers). A typical issue contained 120 pages on quality <b>glossy</b> <b>paper.</b> It sold reasonably well in the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada. The magazine was available in women's reading rooms in public libraries, locations that were well distributed across the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|As in {{offset litho}} {{printing}} and traditional photographic printing, <b>glossy</b> <b>papers</b> give the highest color density (or Dmax), {{and therefore the}} widest color gamut.

Longevity depends on the specific combination of inks and paper. For maximum life, the paper substrate is [...] "wood-free" [...] (i.e., wood-based but without lignin), or cotton-based, {{or a combination of}} the two. Plastic substrates also exist.|$|R

500|$|The {{magazine}} {{was launched in}} October 1928 by Periodical House, Inc. It was initially published in a 7x10” format, with more than 100 pages per issue, and sold for 15 cents per copy. [...] In November 1933, the magazine moved to the so-called [...] "slick" [...] format — an 8½x10" [...] format printed on <b>glossy</b> <b>paper</b> and began featuring full-sized plans for model airplanes in every issue. [...] Issue size was reduced to 74 pages. The {{magazine was}} published on a monthly basis. In addition to adventure stories, non-fiction aviation articles and aviation news were added, as were modeling articles. [...] The magazine’s tagline became [...] "Fiction, Model Building, Fact — Three Aviation Magazines in One." ...|$|E
500|$|Science-Fiction Plus was a U.S. {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} published by Hugo Gernsback for seven issues in 1953. [...] In 1926 Gernsback had launched Amazing Stories, [...] the first science fiction magazine, {{but he had}} not been involved in the genre since 1936, when he sold Wonder Stories. [...] Science-Fiction Plus was initially in slick format, meaning that it was large-size and printed on <b>glossy</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] Gernsback had always believed in the educational power of science fiction, and he continued to advocate his views in the new magazine's editorials. [...] The managing editor, Sam Moskowitz, had been a reader of the early pulp magazines, and published many writers who had been popular before World War II, such as Raymond Gallun, Eando Binder, and Harry Bates. [...] Combined with Gernsback's earnest editorials, the use of these early writers gave the magazine an anachronistic feel. [...] Sales were initially good, but soon fell. [...] For the last two issues Gernsback switched the magazine to cheaper pulp paper, but the magazine remained unprofitable. [...] The final issue was dated December 1953.|$|E
500|$|Street & Smith was {{acquired}} by Samuel Newhouse, the owner of [...] Condé Nast, in August 1959, though Street & Smith was not merged into Condé Nast {{until the end of}} 1961. [...] Analog was the only digest-sized magazine in Condé Nast's inventory—all the others were slicks, such as Vogue and Vanity Fair. [...] All the advertisers in these magazines had plates made up {{to take advantage of this}} size, and Condé Nast changed Analog to the larger size from the March 1963 issue to conform. [...] The front and back signatures were changed to <b>glossy</b> <b>paper,</b> to carry both advertisements and scientific features. [...] The change did not attract advertising support, however, and from the April 1965 issue Analog reverted to digest size once again. [...] Circulation, which had been increasing before the change, was not harmed, and continued to increase while Analog was in slick format. [...] From the April 1965 issue the title switched the [...] "fiction" [...] and [...] "fact" [...] elements, so that it became Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact.|$|E
50|$|A kandeel is {{a lantern}} {{with a wooden}} {{framework}} and covered in coloured matte or <b>glossy</b> <b>papers.</b> These lanterns are generally hung in front of homes during the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali. Kandeel in Sanskrit is known as akasha deepa (lantern of the sky) and in Kannada, Goodu Deepa (nested light), or Nakshatra Gudu (star-like nest).Hindus in earlier days set kandeels afloat high, a gesture to invite the spirits of their ancestors moving around to come back home and be with them during the festival time; hence the name akasha deepa (lantern of the sky) or AkashaKandil.|$|R
50|$|The 1977-1979 The Amazing Spider-Man live-action {{television}} series inspired yet another title change, in October 1981; the Spider-Man weekly also changed {{to more of}} a magazine format, with photo essays, reader comments, contests, and the like (as well as the obligatory reprints of Marvel US material). The format also changed to 28 pages with 8 pages of colour - a marked difference to others titles when almost all UK comics were still black and white except for their covers and perhaps the centre spread. The colour pages were printed on a <b>glossier</b> <b>paper.</b> Only the Spider-Man strip ran during these issues.|$|R

5000|$|... in 1908, {{publisher}} Charles H. Kerr, {{unhappy with}} what he perceived the scholastic and overly theoretical bent of International Socialist Review, dismissed editor Simons and himself took over the publication's editorial role, assisted by the capable radical Mary Marcy. Reflecting Kerr's own increasingly radical politics, the magazine's political line moved further to the left wing of the socialist movement, with new emphasis given to current events in the strike movement and {{the activity of the}} Industrial Workers of the World. The magazine also soon changed in form, making increased use of graphics for the illustration of rather shorter articles printed on <b>glossier</b> <b>paper</b> stock. Although a somewhat polarizing decision, alienating the moderate wing of the Socialist Party, ISR's circulation and influence grew significantly in the years following these changes.|$|R

In large part because their pictures were clear enough to be appreciated, and because their name always appeared with their work, magazine photographers achieved near-celebrity status.

60|$|From each {{carriage}} there descended {{gentlemen of}} highly respectable appearance, clothed in shining black garments, and wearing, {{for the most}} part, white cravats. One of these gentlemen carried in his hands a handsome silver inkstand, and another gentleman who followed him, bore a roll of <b>glossy</b> <b>paper,</b> tied round with a broad ribbon of sober purple hue. The roll contained an Address to Mr. Thorpe, eulogizing his character in very affectionate terms; the inkstand was a Testimonial to be presented after the Address; and the gentlemen who occupied the three private carriages were all eminent members of the religious society which Mr. Thorpe {{had served in the}} capacity of Secretary, and from which he was now obliged to secede in consequence of the precarious state of his health.|$|E
6000|$|It is oblong--some {{thirty feet}} in length and twenty-five in breadth--a shape affording the best(ordinary) {{opportunities}} for the adjustment of furniture. It has but one door--by no means a wide one--which is {{at one end of}} the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor--have deep recesses--and open on an Italian veranda. Their panes are of a crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance), issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe--the tints of crimson and gold--appear everywhere in profusion, and determine the character of the room. The carpet--of Saxony material--is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the ground, and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short irregular curves--one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls are prepared with a <b>glossy</b> <b>paper</b> of a silver gray tint, spotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an imaginative cast--such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no [...] "brilliant effects." [...] Repose speaks in all. Not one is of small size. Diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room, which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved, without being dulled or filagreed. They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of the chamber is injured. But one mirror--and this not a very large one--is visible. In shape it is nearly circular--and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood, also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This is also without cover--the drapery of the curtains has been thought sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all.|$|E
