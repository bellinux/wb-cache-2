25|$|Louis T. Wright, an African American and Harvard Medical School {{graduate}} (1915), introduced <b>intradermal</b> vaccination for smallpox for {{the soldiers}} while serving in the Army during World War I.|$|E
25|$|An <b>intradermal</b> {{injection}} of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFÎ²3) is being tested. The results of three trials already completed {{were published in}} the Lancet along with an editorial commentary.|$|E
25|$|Compound nevus: {{a mixture}} of {{junctional}} and <b>intradermal</b> proliferation. Compound nevi are slightly raised and brown to black. Beauty marks are usually compound nevi of either the acquired variety or congenital variety.|$|E
25|$|Spitz nevus: a {{distinct}} variant of <b>intradermal</b> nevus, {{usually in a}} child. They are raised and reddish (non-pigmented). A pigmented variant, called the 'nevus of Reed', typically appears on the leg of young women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intradermal</b> {{spindle cell}} lipomas are {{distinct}} {{in that they}} most commonly affect women and have a wide distribution, occurring with relatively equal frequency {{on the head and}} neck, trunk, and upper and lower extremities.|$|E
25|$|A vaccine {{administration}} may be oral, by injection (intramuscular, <b>intradermal,</b> subcutaneous), by puncture, transdermal or intranasal. Several recent {{clinical trials}} {{have aimed to}} deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up-taken by the common mucosal immunity system, thus avoiding the need for injections.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{completing}} {{medical school and}} moving back to Georgia, Wright joined the Army Medical Corps, serving as a lieutenant during World War I, stationed in France. While there he introduced <b>intradermal</b> vaccination for smallpox and was awarded the Purple Heart after a gas attack.|$|E
25|$|Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is {{best known}} by its trade name, Botox. Local <b>intradermal</b> {{injection}} of BTX-A is helpful in chronic focal painful neuropathies. The analgesic effects are not dependent on changes in muscle tone. Benefits persist for at least 14 weeks {{from the time of}} administration.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{involves}} exposing {{the skin to}} Aspergillus fumigatus antigens; an immediate reaction is hallmark of ABPA. The test should be performed first by skin prick testing, and if negative followed with an <b>intradermal</b> injection. Overall sensitivity of the procedure is around 90%, though up to 40% of asthmatic patients without ABPA can still show some sensitivity to Aspergillus antigens (a phenomenon likely linked to a less severe form of ABPA termed severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS)).|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} dose of 5 tuberculin units (TU - 0.1 ml), {{according to}} the CDC, or 2 TU of Statens Serum Institute (SSI) tuberculin RT23 in 0.1 ml solution, {{according to the}} NHS, is injected intradermally (between the layers of dermis) and read 48 to 72 hours later. This <b>intradermal</b> injection is termed the Mantoux technique. A {{person who has been}} exposed to the bacteria is expected to mount an immune response in the skin containing the bacterial proteins.|$|E

2500|$|HMB-45 is a {{monoclonal}} antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It {{is used in}} anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors. [...] The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not <b>intradermal</b> nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.|$|E
2500|$|BCG {{is given}} {{as a single}} <b>intradermal</b> {{injection}} at the insertion of the deltoid. [...] If BCG is accidentally given subcutaneously, then a local abscess may form (a [...] "BCG-oma") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with antibiotics immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. However, {{it is important to}} note an abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.|$|E

The virus can be transmitted by direct contact on the skin or by transmission from mosquitos. The vaccinia virus is a known prevention method for the Monkey Poxvirus through <b>intradermal</b> inoculation, it has been found that <b>intradermal</b> inoculation of the vaccinia virus does not provide resistance to the Yaba monkey tumor virus however.|$|E
