40|$|<b>Immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> is an {{important}} ice nucleation pathway involved {{in the formation of}} cirrus and mixed-phase clouds. Laboratory <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments are necessary to determine the range in temperature, T, and relative humidity, RH, at which ice nucleation occurs and to quantify the associated nucleation kinetics. Typically, isothermal (applying a constant temperature) and cooling-rate-dependent <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments are conducted. In these experiments it is usually assumed that the droplets containing ice nucleating particles (INPs) all have the same INP surface area (ISA); however, the validity of this assumption or the impact it may have on analysis and interpretation of the experimental data is rarely questioned. Descriptions of ice active sites and variability of contact angles have been successfully formulated to describe ice nucleation experimental data in previous research; however, we consider the ability of a stochastic freezing model founded on classical nucleation theory to reproduce previous results and to explain experimental uncertainties and data scatter. A stochastic <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> model based on first principles of statistics is presented, which accounts for variable ISA per droplet and uses parameters including the total number of droplets, N tot, and the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficient, J het (T). This model is applied to address if (i)  a time and ISA-dependent stochastic <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> process can explain laboratory <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> data for different experimental methods and (ii)  the assumption that all droplets contain identical ISA is a valid conjecture with subsequent consequences for analysis and interpretation of <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing.</b> The simple stochastic model can reproduce the observed time and surface area dependence in <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments for a variety of methods such as: droplets on a cold-stage exposed to air or surrounded by an oil matrix, wind and acoustically levitated droplets, droplets in a continuous-flow diffusion chamber (CFDC), the Leipzig aerosol cloud interaction simulator (LACIS), and the aerosol interaction and dynamics in the atmosphere (AIDA) cloud chamber. Observed time-dependent isothermal frozen fractions exhibiting non-exponential behavior can be readily explained by this model considering varying ISA. An apparent cooling-rate dependence of J het is explained by assuming identical ISA in each droplet. When accounting for ISA variability, the cooling-rate dependence of ice nucleation kinetics vanishes as expected from classical nucleation theory. The model simulations allow for a quantitative experimental uncertainty analysis for parameters N tot, T, RH, and the ISA variability. The implications of our results for experimental analysis and interpretation of the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> process are discussed...|$|E

However, the present SBM {{coupled with the}} ALICIS module does not explicitly predict the concentration or composition of impurities that potentially act as <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> nuclei inside supercooled droplets. Accordingly, the present model needs to adopt an empirical parametrization that excludes the detailed characteristics of <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> nuclei. As an alternative approach, Lohmann and Diehl (2006) employed {{the assumption that the}} concentration of potential IN inside supercooled droplets was identical to that in ambient air (i.e., aerosol particle concentration).

These approaches are still affected by large uncertainties, even though the ambient aerosol concentration is related to the number of activatable immersion IN inside supercooled droplets through wet scavenging.|$|E
40|$|Ice {{nucleating}} particles (INPs) in {{the atmosphere}} are responsible for glaciating cloud droplets between 237 and 273  K. Different mechanisms of heterogeneous ice nucleation can compete under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Contact freezing is considered relevant because higher ice nucleation temperatures than for <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> for the same INPs were observed. It has limitations because its efficiency depends {{on the number of}} collisions between cloud droplets and INPs. To date, direct comparisons of contact and <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> with the same INP, for similar residence times and concentrations, are lacking. This study compares immersion and contact freezing efficiencies of three different INPs. The contact freezing data were obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH) using 80  µm diameter droplets, which can interact with INPs for residence times of 2 and 4  s in the chamber. The contact freezing efficiency was calculated by estimating the number of collisions between droplets and particles. Theoretical formulations of collision efficiencies gave too high freezing efficiencies for all investigated INPs, namely AgI particles with 200  nm electrical mobility diameter, 400 and 800  nm diameter Arizona Test Dust (ATD) and kaolinite particles. Comparison of freezing efficiencies by contact and <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> is therefore limited by the accuracy of collision efficiencies. The concentration of particles was 1000  cm − 3 for ATD and kaolinite and 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000  cm − 3 for AgI. For concentrations [*]<[*]  5000  cm − 3, the droplets collect only one particle on average during their time in the chamber. For ATD and kaolinite particles, contact freezing efficiencies at 2  s residence time were smaller than at 4  s, which is in disagreement with a collisional contact freezing process but in accordance with <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> or adhesion freezing. With “adhesion freezing”, we refer to a contact nucleation process that is enhanced compared to <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> due to the position of the INP on the droplet, and we discriminate it from collisional contact freezing, which assumes an enhancement due to the collision of the particle with the droplet. For best comparison with contact freezing results, <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments of the same INPs were performed with the continuous flow diffusion chamber Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber–Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (IMCA–ZINC) for a 3  s residence time. In IMCA–ZINC, each INP is activated into a droplet in IMCA and provides its surface for ice nucleation in the ZINC chamber. The comparison of contact and <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> results did not confirm a general enhancement of freezing efficiency for contact compared with <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments. For AgI particles the onset of heterogeneous freezing in CLINCH was even shifted to lower temperatures compared with IMCA–ZINC. For ATD, freezing efficiencies for contact and <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments were similar. For kaolinite particles, contact freezing became detectable at higher temperatures than <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing.</b> Using contact angle information between water and the INP, it is discussed how the position of the INP in or on the droplets may influence its ice nucleation activity...|$|E
40|$|Ice {{formation}} largely {{influences the}} properties of clouds and hence it has an important impact on weather and climate. Primary ice formation {{is a consequence of}} either homogeneous or heterogeneous ice nucleation. The latter process is catalyzed by a foreign substance called Ice Nucleating Particle (INP). Mineral dust particles were found to contribute to atmospheric INPs. Most types of mineral dust are ice active below - 20 °C. In contrast, atmospheric observations indicate that <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> {{as one of the most}} important heterogeneous ice nucleation processes can occur at temperatures higher than - 15 °C. One possible explanation for cloud glaciation at high temperatures might be the presence of biological material (e. g. bacteria) inducing ice nucleation. Our fundamental process and even qualitative understanding concerning atmospheric heterogeneous ice nucleation is limited. In the framework of the present thesis, experimental and theoretical work was carried out to improve the basic understanding of the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of mineral dust and bacterial INPs. On the basis of model simulations <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments were designed at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS). The <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of mineral dust and bacterial INPs was studied in dependence of temperature and particle surface area/number at LACIS. As a results of the present thesis, it was found that the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of kaolinite being a proxy of mineral dust INPs does not depend on the droplet volume, but on the particle surface area. The kaolinite particles investigated caused freezing below - 30 °C. In contrast, Ice Nucleation Active (INA) protein complexes that are attributed to bacterial INPs were found to induce freezing at - 7 °C. Furthermore, it was shown that the ice nucleation activity of protein complexes is very similar regardless of whether the INA protein complex is attached to the outer cell membrane of intact bacteria or to cell membrane fragments. The <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> ability depends on the number and type of INA protein complexes present in the droplet ensemble. The <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> ability of mineral dust and bacterial INPs was parameterized accounting for the time effect.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the {{morphological}} modification of aerosol particles with respect to heterogeneous ice nucleation is comprehensively investigated for laboratory-generated hematite particles as a model substrate for atmospheric dust particles. The surface area-scaled ice nucleation efficiencies of monodisperse cubic hematite particles and milled hematite particles were measured with a series of expansion cooling experiments using the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere (AIDA) cloud simulation chamber. Complementary off-line characterization of physico-chemical properties of both hematite subsets were also carried out with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and an electro-kinetic particle charge detector to further constrain droplet-freezing measurements of hematite particles. Additionally, an empirical parameterization derived from our laboratory measurements was implemented in the single-column version of the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM 5) to investigate the model sensitivity in simulated ice crystal number concentration on different ice nucleation efficiencies. From an experimental perspective, our results show that the immersion mode ice nucleation efficiency of milled hematite particles is almost an order of magnitude higher at − 35. 2 °C T < − 33. 5 °C than that of the cubic hematite particles, indicating a substantial effect of morphological irregularities on <b>immersion</b> mode <b>freezing.</b> Our modeling results similarly show that the increased droplet-freezing rates of milled hematite particles lead to about one order magnitude higher ice crystal number in the upper troposphere than cubic hematite particles.

40|$|Heterogeneous ice {{formation}} by <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> in mixed-phase clouds can be parameterized in general circulation models (GCMs) by classical nucleation theory (CNT). CNT parameterization schemes describe <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> as a stochastic process, including {{the properties of}} insoluble aerosol particles in the droplets. There are different ways to parameterize the properties of aerosol particles (i. e., contact angle schemes), which are compiled and tested in this paper. The goal {{of this study is}} to find a parameterization scheme for GCMs to describe <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> with the ability to shift and adjust the slope of the freezing curve compared to homogeneous freezing to match experimental data. We showed in a previous publication that the resulting freezing curves from CNT are very sensitive to unconstrained kinetic and thermodynamic parameters in the case of homogeneous freezing. Here we investigate how sensitive the outcome of a parameter estimation for contact angle schemes from experimental data is to unconstrained kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We demonstrate that the parameters describing the contact angle schemes can mask the uncertainty in thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Different CNT formulations are fitted to an extensive <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> dataset consisting of size-selected measurements as a function of temperature and time for different mineral dust types, namely kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, microcline (K-feldspar), and Arizona test dust.

40|$|<b>Immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> is {{the most}} {{relevant}} heterogeneous ice nucleation mechanism through which ice crystals are formed in mixed-phase clouds. In recent years, {{an increasing number of}} laboratory experiments utilizing a variety of instruments have examined <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> activity of atmospherically relevant ice nucleating particles (INPs). However, an inter-comparison of these laboratory results is a difficult task because investigators have used different ice nucleation (IN) measurement methods to produce these results. A remaining challenge is to explore the sensitivity and accuracy of these techniques and to understand how the IN results are potentially influenced or biased by experimental parameters associated with these techniques. Within the framework of INUIT (Ice Nucleation research UnIT), we distributed an illite rich sample (illite NX) as a representative surrogate for atmospheric mineral dust particles to investigators to perform <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments using different IN measurement methods and to obtain IN data as a function of particle concentration, temperature (T), cooling rate and nucleation time. Seventeen measurement methods were involved in the data inter-comparison. Experiments with seven instruments started with the test sample pre-suspended in water before cooling, while ten other instruments employed water vapor condensation onto dry-dispersed particles followed by <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing.</b> The resulting comprehensive <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> dataset was evaluated using the ice nucleation active surface-site density (ns) to develop a representative ns(T) spectrum that spans a wide temperature range (− 37 °C < T < − 11 °C) and covers nine orders of magnitude in ns. Our inter-comparison results revealed a discrepancy between suspension and dry-dispersed particle measurements for this mineral dust. While the agreement was good below − 26 °C, the ice nucleation activity, expressed in ns, was smaller for the wet suspended samples and higher for the dry-dispersed aerosol samples between about − 26 and − 18 °C. Only instruments making measurement techniques with wet suspended samples were able to measure ice nucleation above − 18 °C. A possible explanation for the deviation between − 26 and − 18 °C is discussed. In general, the seventeen <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> measurement techniques deviate, within the range of about 7 °C in terms of temperature, by three orders of magnitude with respect to ns. In addition, we show evidence that the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> efficiency (i. e., ns) of illite NX particles is relatively independent on droplet size, particle mass in suspension, particle size and cooling rate during freezing. A strong temperature-dependence and weak time- and size-dependence of <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> efficiency of illite-rich clay mineral particles enabled the ns parameterization solely as a function of temperature. We also characterized the ns (T) spectra, and identified a section with a steep slope between − 20 and − 27 °C, where a large fraction of active sites of our test dust may trigger <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing.</b> This slope was followed by a region with a gentler slope at temperatures below − 27 °C. A multiple exponential distribution fit is expressed as ns(T) = exp(23. 82 × exp(−exp(0. 16 × (T + 17. 49))) + 1. 39) based on the specific surface area and ns(T) = exp(25. 75 × exp(−exp(0. 13 × (T + 17. 17))) + 3. 34) based on the geometric area (ns and T in m− 2 and °C, respectively).

40|$|Clouds are a {{critical}} component of Earth’s climate and hydrological cycle. The formation of ice in the atmosphere, especially at lower altitudes, can substantially impact the evolution of clouds and their radiative properties, and represents the initiation of the cold rain precipitation process. In mixed-phase clouds quantitatively understanding the interactions between ice and liquid, and the subsequent impact on the cloud development, is fundamentally dependent on the process of ice formation and its representation within cloud models. Experiments show that ice nucleating particles (INPs) exhibit variability in both freezing efficiency and time-dependent behaviour. The variability in freezing efficiency is currently well characterised and represented, but variability in time-dependence is poorly characterised and rarely represented in models and parameterisations. The primary aim of this thesis is to understand the role that time-dependence plays in the freezing behaviour of droplets, and secondly to examine the sensitivity of mixed-phase clouds to time-dependence in <b>immersion</b> mode <b>freezing.</b> It is initially found that CNT-based models are unable to reproduce the observed time-dependent behaviour. A new model is therefore presented that uniquely incorporates the variability in both freezing efficiency and time-dependent behaviour; this is applied to experimental data to understand the manifestation of time-dependence in experiments. The model is then used to derive a new theoretical framework for use in experimental analysis and cloud modelling studies. The framework is underpinned by the finding that the temperature dependence (named λ) of the nucleation rate coefficient solely determines the time-dependent behaviour observed in droplet freezing experiments. New and existing experimental data is used to demonstrate the ability for the framework to reconcile data obtained on different timescales with different experimental methods. Finally, an efficient and representative parameterisation is used to explore the sensitivity of mixed-phase clouds to time-dependence. Using a series of increasingly complex models (0 D to 2 D) it is shown that the inclusion of time-dependence impacts cloud properties in regimes where the updraught speed is relatively low...|$|R

The original aim of this work was to develop and to validate a new reference function for Au/Pt thermocouples which reflects the properties of presently commercially available Au and Pt wires. The thermoelectric properties of 16 Au/Pt thermocouples constructed at different National Metrological Institutes by using wires from different suppliers and 4 commercially available Au/Pt thermocouples were investigated. Most of them exhibit significant deviations from the current reference function of Au/Pt thermocouples caused by the poor performance of the Au-wires available. Thermoelectric homogeneity was investigated by measuring <b>immersion</b> profiles during <b>freezes</b> at the freezing point of silver and in liquid baths. The thermoelectric inhomogeneities were found to be one order of magnitude larger than those of Au/Pt thermocouples of the Standard Reference Material® (SRM®) 1749. The improvement of the annealing procedure of the gold wires is a key process to achieve thermoelectric homogeneities in the order of only about (2 – 3) mK, sufficient to replace the impracticable HTSPRTs as interpolation instruments of the ITS- 90. Comparison measurements of some of the Au/Pt thermocouples against a HTSPRT and an absolutely calibrated radiation thermometer were performed and exhibit agreements within the expanded measurement uncertainties.

Minimum tolerance to rapid <b>freezing</b> (<b>immersion</b> in liquid nitrogen; cooling rate, approximately 200 degrees C min- 1) {{was associated with}} respirofermentative (exponential) growth on glucose. However, maximum tolerance occurred not during the stationary phase but during active respiratory growth on ethanol accumulated during respirofermentative growth on glucose. The peak in tolerance occurred several hours after entry into the respiratory growth phase and did not correspond to a transient accumulation of trehalose which occurred {{at the point of}} glucose exhaustion. Substitution of ethanol with other carbon sources which permit high levels of respiration (acetate and galactose) also induced high freeze-thaw tolerance, and the peak did not occur in cells shifted directly from fermentative growth to starvation conditions or in two respiratorily incompetent mutants. These results imply a direct link with respiration, rather than exhaustion of glucose. The role of ethanol as a cryoprotectant per se was also investigated, and under conditions of rapid freezing (cooling rate, approximately 200 degrees C min- 1), ethanol demonstrated a significant cryoprotective effect. Under the same freezing conditions, glycerol had little effect at high concentrations and acted as a cryosensitizer at low concentrations. Conversely, under slow-freezing conditions (step freezing at - 20, - 70, and then - 196 degrees C; initial cooling rate, approximately 3 degrees C min- 1), glycerol acted as a cryoprotectant while ethanol lost this ability. Ethanol may thus have two effects on the cryotolerance of baker's yeast, as a respirable carbon source and as a cryoprotectant under rapid-freezing conditions...|$|R

Combining results from the numerical model with experimental data, {{it was found that}} for the experimental parameter space considered, classical homogeneous ice nucleation theory is able to predict the freezing behavior of highly diluted ammonium sulfate solution droplets, while classical heterogeneous ice nucleation theory, together with the assumption of a constant contact angle, fails to predict the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of surrogate mineral dust particles (Arizona Test Dust, ATD).

40|$|A {{number of}} new {{measurement}} methods for ice nucleating particles (INPs) have been introduced in recent years, {{and it is important}} to address how these methods compare. Laboratory comparisons of instruments sampling major INP types are common, but few comparisons have occurred for ambient aerosol measurements exploring the utility, consistency and complementarity of different methods to cover the large dynamic range of INP concentrations that exists in the atmosphere. In this study, we assess the comparability of four offline <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> measurement methods (Colorado State University Ice Spectrometer, IS; North Carolina State University Cold Stage, CS; National Institute for Polar Research Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied to Freezing Test, CRAFT; University of British Columbia Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor – Droplet Freezing Technique, MOUDI-DFT) and an online method (continuous flow diffusion chamber, CFDC) used in a manner deemed to promote/maximize <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing,</b> for the detection of INP in ambient aerosols at different locations and in different sampling scenarios. We also investigated the comparability of different aerosol collection methods used with offline <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> instruments. Excellent agreement between all methods could be obtained for several cases of co-sampling with perfect temporal overlap. Even for sampling periods that were not fully equivalent, the deviations between atmospheric INP number concentrations measured with different methods were mostly less than one order of magnitude. In some cases, however, the deviations were larger and not explicable without sampling and measurement artifacts. Overall, the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> methods seem to effectively capture INP that activate as single particles in the modestly supercooled temperature regime (>[*]− 20 [*]°C), although more comparisons are needed in this temperature regime that is difficult to capture with online methods. Relative to the CFDC method, three <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> methods that disperse particles into a bulk liquid (IS, CS, CRAFT) exhibit a positive bias in measured INP number concentrations at below − 20 [*]°C, increasing with decreasing temperature.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to produce and evaluate high-performance wood fiber composites. High-performance was defined as: high dimensional stability and a high durability, including resistance to wood-decaying organisms (fungi, bacteria, and insects). The main method, used to accomplish these properties, was acetylation of the wood fibers prior to the composite production. Acetylation involves a chemical modification of wood components, which {{was carried out by}} reaction with acetic anhydride. Another method applied was impregnation with kraft lignin followed by fixation of the lignin with an aluminum salt solution. Thus, lignin metal complexes are formed in situ - complexes that are insoluble under normal conditions in the environment. Test results show that both methods lead to more dimensionally stable composites, i. e. reduced swelling and shrinkage due to a varying moisture load. Kraft lignin treatment of wood fiber was estimated to be an economical method for obtaining a certain degree of stabilization of composites (fiberboards), although the composites cannot be labeled "high-performance" since they do not meet all requirements, as defined above. However, the use of acetylated fibers leads to a very high degree of dimensional stability as well as biological decay resistance and, furthermore, the mechanical properties are maintained during and after cyclic climate aging. Regardless of the lignocellulosic fiber source used, the thickness swelling of acetylated fiberboards in water is reduced by approximately 90 % and results from cyclic testing according to EN 321 (three cycles, each comprising 72 h water <b>immersion,</b> 24 h <b>freezing</b> at - 18 °C and 72 h drying at 70 °C) show that more than 85 % of the original internal bond strength, IBS, remains after testing. The latter figure should be compared with the corresponding value of 20 - 40 % obtained for fiberboards made from unmodified fibers. Acetylated wood fiber composites have also been tested for resistance to biological decay in a worldwide field test where 30 cm long fiberboard stakes were half-buried in soil. After three years of testing, most of the control stakes (made from unmodified fiber) had failed due to heavy decay while most of the acetylated composite stakes were perfectly sound, showing no sign of decay. To determine whether the acetylation, and other methods of chemical modification, cause any degradation of the cellulose,. alfa. -cellulose was isolated from unmodified and chemically modified fibers after which the intrinsic viscosity and molecular mass distribution (determined by size exclusion chromatography) of the cellulose samples were analyzed. The main part of the cellulose from acetylated wood fiber seems to be unaffected by the modification method, whereas the other modification methods appear to yield more or less degraded cellulose. In order to manufacture products with complex shapes, moldable flexible fibermats were produced on both a small pilot scale (kilograms) and on a large scale (over one metric ton). A variety of industrial products were manufactured from the acetylated fibermats: exterior doors, automotive panels, façade claddings, flooring boards, wet-room wall panels, toilet lids and roof tiles. Generally, {{it was found that the}} dimensional stability of the products was high and that other important properties, such as mechanical and weathering properties, were also very satisfactory. The conclusion is that composites based on acetylated wood fiber are truly high-performance, as defined above...|$|R

Depending on ambient conditions and aerosol composition, heterogeneous nucleation will occur through one of several mechanisms including the contact and <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> mechanisms. Through a series of contact freezing experiments, we have characterized the ability of aerosols composed of volcanic ash, soot, and peat soil, to act as ice nuclei (IN) {{as a function of}} temperature. The <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> ability of the ash particles has also been measured. In these studies, an optical microscope apparatus equipped with a cooling stage and a digital camera was used to observe the freezing events. For each experiment, a particular IN was placed in contact with the surface, or immersed in the bulk, of an ultra pure water droplet. The droplet was then subjected to freezing-melting cycles resulting in 25 independent measurements of the freezing temperature of the droplet. In the volcanic ash experiments, we observed contact freezing at warmer temperatures than <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing.</b> As contact freezing IN, the peat was the most effective with an average contact freezing temperature of - 10. 5 ?C, followed by volcanic ash (- 11. 2 ?C), and then soot (- 25. 6 ?C).

40|$|Up to now, the {{importance}} of pollen for atmospheric ice nucleation {{was considered to be}} minor, as they are too large to stay in the atmosphere for a long time. But as recent investigations have shown, not the pollen grains themselves are responsible for freezing, but easily suspendable macromolecules on their surfaces (Pummer et al., 2012). Due to the bursting of pollen grains these ice nucleating active (INA) macromolecules could be numerous in the atmosphere. In the present study, the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of birch pollen, i. e. its ice nucleating active (INA) macro-molecules, was investigated at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS, Hartmann et al., 2011).

40|$|Biological particles, e. g. {{bacteria}} and their Ice Nucleating Active (INA) protein complexes, might {{play an important}} role for the ice formation in atmospheric mixed-phase clouds. Therefore, the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of INA protein complexes generated from a SnomaxTM solution/suspension was investigated as function of temperature in a range of − 5 &deg;C to − 38 &deg;C at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS). The <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> of droplets containing small numbers of INA protein complexes occurs in a temperature range of − 7 &deg;C and − 10 &deg;C. The experiments performed in the lower temperature range, where all droplets freeze which contain at least one INA protein complex, are used to determine the average number of INA protein complexes present, assuming that the INA protein complexes are Poisson distributed over the droplet ensemble. Knowing the average number of INA protein complexes, the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate and rate coefficient of a single INA protein complex is determined by using the newly-developed CHESS model (stoCHastic model of idEntical poiSSon distributed ice nuclei). Therefore, we assume the ice nucleation process to be of stochastic nature, and a parameterization of the INA protein complex's nucleation rate. Analyzing the results of <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments from literature (SnomaxTM and Pseudomonas syringae bacteria), to results gained in this study, demonstrates that first, a similar temperature dependence of the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate for a single INA protein complex was found in all experiments, second, the shift of the ice fraction curves to higher temperatures can be explained consistently by a higher average number of INA protein complexes being present in the droplet ensemble, and finally the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate of one single INA protein complex might be also applicable for intact Pseudomonas syringae bacteria cells. The results obtained in this study allow a new perspective on the interpretation of <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments considering INA protein complexes and the derived simple parameterization of the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate can be used in cloud resolving models for studying the effect of bacteria induced ice nucleation...|$|E

Droplets with single immersed, size-selected 400 nm and 800 nm kaolinite particles were produced at 300 K, cooled down to supercooled temperatures typical for mixed-phase cloud conditions, and {{the fraction of}} frozen droplets with increasing residence time was detected. To simulate the conditions of <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> in mixed-phase clouds we used the Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (ZINC) and its vertical extension, the Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber (IMCA). We observed that the frozen fraction of droplets increased with increasing residence time in the chamber.

The rate at which droplets freeze was observed to decrease towards higher temperatures and smaller particle sizes. Comparison of the laboratory data with four different ice nucleation models, three based on classical nucleation theory with different representations of the particle surface properties and one singular, suggest that the classical, stochastic approach combined with a distribution of contact angles is able to reproduce the ice nucleation observed in these experiments most accurately. Using the models to calculate the increase in frozen fraction at typical mixed-phase cloud temperatures {{over an extended period of}} time, yields an equivalent effect of − 1 K temperature shift and an increase in time scale by a factor of ~ 10...|$|E

40|$|Kaolinite {{particles}} {{from two different}} sources (Fluka and Clay Minerals Society (CMS)) were examined {{with respect to their}} ability to act as ice nuclei (IN). This was done in the water-subsaturated regime where often deposition ice nucleation is assumed to occur, and for water-supersaturated conditions, i. e., in the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> mode. Measurements were done using a flow tube (the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator, LACIS) and a continuous-flow diffusion chamber (CFDC). Pure and coated particles were used, with coating thicknesses of a few nanometers or less, where the coating consisted of levoglucosan, succinic acid or sulfuric acid. In general, {{it was found that the}} coatings strongly reduced deposition ice nucleation. Remaining ice formation in the water-subsaturated regime could be attributed to <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing,</b> with particles immersed in concentrated solutions formed by the coatings. In the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> mode, ice nucleation rate coefficients j het from both instruments agreed well with each other, particularly when the residence times in the instruments were accounted for. Fluka kaolinite particles coated with either levoglucosan or succinic acid showed the same IN activity as pure Fluka kaolinite particles; i. e., it can be assumed that these two types of coating did not alter the ice-active surface chemically, and that the coatings were diluted enough in the droplets that were formed prior to the ice nucleation, so that freezing point depression was negligible. However, Fluka kaolinite particles, which were either coated with pure sulfuric acid or were first coated with the acid and then exposed to additional water vapor, both showed a reduced ability to nucleate ice compared to the pure particles. For the CMS kaolinite particles, the ability to nucleate ice in the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> mode was similar for all examined particles, i. e., for the pure ones and the ones with the different types of coating. Moreover, j het derived for the CMS kaolinite particles was comparable to j het derived for Fluka kaolinite particles coated with sulfuric acid. This is suggestive for the Fluka kaolinite possessing a type of ice-nucleating surface feature which is not present on the CMS kaolinite, and which can be destroyed by reaction with sulfuric acid.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and test results of the new optical particle counter TOPS-Ice (Thermostabilized Optical Particle Spectrometer {{for the detection of}} Ice particles). The instrument uses measurements of the depolarized component of light scattered by single particles into the near-forward direction (42. 5 ° ± 12. 7 °) to distinguish between spherical and non-spherical particles. This approach allows the differentiation between liquid water droplets (spherical) and ice particles (non-spherical) having similar volume equivalent sizes and therefore can be used to determine the fraction of frozen droplets in a typical <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiment. We show that the numerical simulation of the light scattering on non-spherical particles (ellipsoids in random orientation) with account for the actual scattering geometry used in the instrument supports the validity of the approach, even though the cross polarized component of the light scattered by spherical droplets is not vanishing in this scattering angle. For the separation of the ice particle mode from the liquid droplet mode, we use the width of the pulse detected in the depolarization channel instead of the pulse height. Exploiting the intrinsic relationship between pulse height and pulse width for Gaussian pulses allows us to calculate the fraction of frozen droplets even if the liquid droplet mode dominates the particle ensemble. We present test results obtained with TOPS-Ice in the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> experiments at the laminar diffusion chamber LACIS (Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator) and demonstrate the excellent agreement with the data obtained in the same experiment with a different optical instrument.

40|$|Data {{from both}} {{laboratory}} studies and atmospheric measurements {{are used to}} develop an empirical parameterization for the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> activity of natural mineral dust particles. Measurements made with the Colorado State University (CSU) continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) when processing mineral dust aerosols at a nominal 105 % relative humidity with respect to water (RH w) are taken {{as a measure of}} the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> nucleation activity of particles. Ice active frozen fractions vs. temperature for dusts representative of Saharan and Asian desert sources were consistent with similar measurements in atmospheric dust plumes for a limited set of comparisons available. The parameterization developed follows the form of one suggested previously for atmospheric particles of non-specific composition in quantifying ice nucleating particle concentrations as functions of temperature and the total number concentration of particles larger than 0. 5 μm diameter. Such an approach does not explicitly account for surface area and time dependencies for ice nucleation, but sufficiently encapsulates the activation properties for potential use in regional and global modeling simulations, and possible application in developing remote sensing retrievals for ice nucleating particles. A calibration factor is introduced to account for the apparent underestimate (by approximately 3, on average) of the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> fraction of mineral dust particles for CSU CFDC data processed at an RH w of 105 % vs. maximum fractions active at higher RH w. Instrumental factors that affect activation behavior vs. RH w in CFDC instruments remain to be fully explored in future studies. Nevertheless, the use of this calibration factor is supported by comparison to ice activation data obtained for the same aerosols from Aerosol Interactions and Dynamics of the Atmosphere (AIDA) expansion chamber cloud parcel experiments. Further comparison of the new parameterization, including calibration correction, to predictions of the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> surface active site density parameterization for mineral dust particles, developed separately from AIDA experimental data alone, shows excellent agreement for data collected in a descent through a Saharan aerosol layer. These studies support the utility of laboratory measurements to obtain atmospherically relevant data on the ice nucleation properties of dust and other particle types, and suggest the suitability of considering all mineral dust as a single type of ice nucleating particle as a useful first-order approximation in numerical modeling investigations...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{biological}} {{aerosol particles}} (PBAPs) may {{play an important}} role in aerosol–climate interactions, in particular by affecting ice formation in mixed phase clouds. However, the role of PBAPs is poorly understood because the sources and distribution of PBAPs in the atmosphere are not well quantified. Here we include emissions of fungal spores and bacteria in a global aerosol microphysics model and explore their contribution to concentrations of supermicron particle number, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> rates. Simulated surface annual mean concentrations of fungal spores are ~ 2. 5 × 10 4 m − 3 over continental midlatitudes and 1 × 10 5 m − 3 over tropical forests. Simulated surface concentrations of bacteria are 2. 5 × 10 4 m − 3 over most continental regions and 5 × 10 4 m − 3 over grasslands of central Asia and North America. These simulated surface number concentrations of fungal spores and bacteria are broadly in agreement with the limited available observations. We find that fungal spores and bacteria contribute 8 and 5 % respectively to simulated continental surface mean supermicron number concentrations, but have very limited impact on CCN concentrations, altering regional concentrations by less than 1 %. In agreement with previous global modelling studies, we find that fungal spores and bacteria contribute very little (3 × 10 − 3 %, even when we assume upper limits for ice nucleation activity) to global average <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> ice nucleation rates, which are dominated by soot and dust. However, at lower altitudes (400 to 600 hPa), where warmer temperatures mean that soot and dust may not nucleate ice, we find that PBAP controls the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> ice nucleation rate. This demonstrates that PBAPs can be of regional importance for IN formation, in agreement with case study observations...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} known that ash particles from coal combustion can trigger ice nucleation when {{they interact with}} water vapor and/or supercooled droplets. However, data on the ice nucleation of ash particles from different sources, including both anthropogenic and natural combustion processes, are still scarce. As fossil energy sources still fuel the largest proportion of electric power production worldwide, and biomass burning contributes significantly to the global aerosol loading, further data are needed to better assess the ice nucleating efficiency of ash particles. In the framework of this study, we found that ash particles from brown coal (i. e., lignite) burning are up to 2 orders of magnitude more ice active in the immersion mode below − 32  °C than those from wood burning. Fly ash from a coal-fired power plant was shown {{to be the most}} efficient at nucleating ice. Furthermore, the influence of various particle generation methods on the freezing behavior was studied. For instance, particles were generated either by dispersion of dry sample material, or by atomization of ash–water suspensions, and then led into the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS) where the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior was examined. Whereas the <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> behavior of ashes from wood burning was not affected by the particle generation method, it depended on the type of particle generation for ash from brown coal. It was also found that the common practice of treating prepared suspensions in an ultrasonic bath to avoid aggregation of particles led to an enhanced ice nucleation activity. The findings of this study suggest (a) that ash from brown coal burning may influence <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> in clouds close to the source and (b) that the freezing behavior of ash particles may be altered by a change in sample preparation and/or particle generation...|$|E
30|$|Deposition {{nucleation}} {{is completed}} when water vapor directly deposits {{onto the surface}} of an aerosol particle, provided that supersaturation with respect to ice is positive. The aerosol particle {{does not have to be}} hydroscopic. On the other hand, condensation-freezing nucleation originates from the nucleation process of a droplet under the condition that supersaturation with respect to water is positive. The aerosol particle is activated as CCN but does not have to completely dissolve in the droplet. The droplet that is formed then immediately freezes from the non-dissolved impurity. Distinguishing these two types of nucleation process is difficult in measurements where supersaturation with respect to water is positive. Supersaturation (i.e., humidity) rather than temperature is an important factor controlling the progress of these processes. Contact freezing possibly occurs when supercooled droplets collide with aerosol particles. The collision is usually caused by Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, electrophoresis, and/or inertial impaction. The concentration of aerosol particles that can act as contact-freezing IN at the relevant temperature is the most important factor in determining the freezing probability. <b>Immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> originates from impurities already present inside a supercooled droplet. Unlike condensation-freezing nucleation, <b>immersion</b> <b>freezing</b> does not have to start immediately upon the formation of a supercooled droplet. The freezing can occur when the temperature of the supercooled droplet decreases.|$|E
