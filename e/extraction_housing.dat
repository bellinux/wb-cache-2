40|$|Abstract Background Deforestation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} forms of land degradation worldwide. Although remote sensing and aerial photographs can supply valuable information on land/use cover changes, they may not regularly be available for some tropical coasts (e. g., Cameroon estuary) where cloud cover is frequent. With respect to mangroves, researchers are now employing local knowledge as an alternative means of understanding forest disturbances. This paper was primarily aimed at assessing the mangrove forest products usage, along with the local people's perceptions on environmental changes, between Littoral (Cameroon estuary) and Southern (mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village) regions of Cameroon. Methods The data from both locations were obtained through conducting household interviews and field observations. Results In the Cameroon estuary (Littoral region), 69. 23 % of respondents (mostly elders) could distinguish two to four mangrove plants, whereas the informants (65. 45 %) in the mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village (mostly young people interviewed from the Southern region) are familiar with only one or two commonly found mangroves. Also, more respondents from the Cameroon estuary are depending on mangroves for fuelwood (Rhizophora spp.) and housing (Rhizophora spp., Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn and Nypa fruticans (Thumb.) Wurmb.) purposes, in contrast to Nyong River mouth and Mpalla village. Although local people perceived wood extraction as a greater disruptive factor, there are several causes for mangrove depletion in the Cameroon estuary. Among others, over-harvesting, clear-felled corridors, sand <b>extraction</b> and <b>housing</b> were found important. Furthermore, a decline in mangrove fauna composition (in terms of fishery products) was recorded in the Littoral as well as Southern regions. However, the causes of such perceived negative changes were not similar in both cases. Conclusions Findings of this study highlight the need to improve sustainable management of the mangrove ecosystems through afforestation (in large impacted areas), selective removal of senescent tree stems and branches (in little damage stands), regulating sand <b>extraction</b> and <b>housing</b> activities, and creating awareness and law enforcement. </p...|$|R

40|$|Process {{modelling}} for {{the purposes}} of equipment design, simulation or evaluation has been carried out in the sugar industry using a range of different techniques. Methods employed in the past have included the development of specialised simulation tools using computer programming languages or spreadsheets. Some use has also been made of commercial flowsheeting packages, as well as the SUGARS software package which was developed specifically for this application. However, each of these modelling techniques suffers from a number of limitations, with none providing both ease of use and the flexibility to allow detailed in-house process knowledge to be designed into the system. SIMULINK is a commercial software system, overlaid on the MATLAB programming language, which is widely used for modelling, simulating and analysing steady state or dynamic systems using block diagrams. In the current study, the use of the SIMULINK software to develop a library of model blocks describing sugar industry operations is demonstrated, focusing on the diffuser <b>extraction</b> and boiling <b>house</b> operations.

40|$|Remote sensing {{techniques}} have been {{commonly used to}} map land cover and land use types. For many applications, users may only {{be interested in a}} specific land class in an image such as extracting urban areas from an image, or retrieving dead trees from a forest. This could be referred to as a one-class classification problem. In addition, with the increasing availability of high spatial resolution imagery, earth objects can be mapped in detail, which enable us to quickly update and monitor the change of a specific class. However, conventional pixel-based classification methods have difficulty in dealing with high spatial resolution remote sensing data. In this study, we use urban <b>house</b> <b>extraction</b> as an example, and propose to classify houses from high spatial resolution images by integrating one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and object-based classifiers. We also compared the performance from the proposed method with the one-class SVMs and pixel-based method. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the pixel based method, and could be a promising way to provide relatively quick and efficient way in extracting a specific land class from high spatial resolution images. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} and mid 2000 s, {{household}} debt relative to income grew sharply, helping precipitate a financial crisis. Previous research has shown a strong link between house price growth and increased debt; {{in this paper we}} examine the link between interest rates and debt. Using credit record panel data, we document that homeown-ers borrowed over $ 1 trillion against home equity between 2002 and 2005. Moreover, we show that the likelihood of equity extraction peaked in 2003, just as mortgage rates hit historic lows, and estimate that low interest rates explain about 37 per-cent of the extraction boom. Our results indicate that the <b>extraction</b> response to <b>house</b> price growth is similar in magnitude to the response to interest rates, and we provide new evidence for the presence of financial frictions by looking at differential responses to interest rates and house prices across age and credit score groups. Fi-nally, although equity extractors use some funds to pay down high-cost credit card debt, extractions lead to a large rise in leverage that persists for several years. This rise in leverage exposes homeowners to greater risk. Indeed, we find that those who extracted from 2004 – 2007 exhibited excess defaults, unlike earlier extractors, and differences in borrower characteristics do not fully account for this change. ∗The views expressed {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Federal Reserve Board or its staff.

40|$|An {{important}} {{constraint on}} mechanisms of past carbon cycle variability {{is provided by}} the stable isotopic composition of carbon in atmospheric carbon dioxide (δ 13 C-CO 2) trapped in polar ice cores, but obtaining very precise measurements {{has proven to be a}} significant analytical challenge. Here we describe a new technique to determine the δ 13 C of CO 2 at very high precision, as well as measuring the CO 2 and N 2 O mixing ratios. In this method, ancient air is extracted from relatively large ice samples (~ 400 g) with a dry-extraction "ice grater" device. The liberated air is cryogenically purified to a CO 2 and N 2 O mixture and analyzed with a microvolume-equipped dual-inlet IRMS (Thermo MAT 253). The reproducibility of the method, based on replicate analysis of ice core samples, is 0. 02 ‰ for δ 13 C-CO 2 and 2 ppm and 4 ppb for the CO 2 and N 2 O mixing ratios, respectively (1 σ pooled standard deviation). Our experiments show that minimizing water vapor pressure in the <b>extraction</b> vessel by <b>housing</b> the grating apparatus in a ultralow-temperature freezer (− 60 °C) improves the precision and decreases the experimental blank of the method to − 0. 07 ± 0. 04 ‰. We describe techniques for accurate calibration of small samples and the application of a mass-spectrometric method based on source fragmentation for reconstructing the N 2 O history of the atmosphere. The oxygen isotopic composition of CO 2 is also investigated, confirming previous observations of oxygen exchange between gaseous CO 2 and solid H 2 O within the ice archive. These data offer a possible constraint on oxygen isotopic fractionation during H 2 O and CO 2 exchange below the H 2 O bulk melting temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a possible solution for the designing of a device for the decommissioning of the horizontal fuel channels in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. The decommissioning activities are dismantling, demolition, controlled removal of equipment, components, conventional or hazardous waste (radioactive, toxic) in compliance with the international basic safety standards on radiation protection. One as the most important operation in the final phase of the nuclear reactor dismantling is the decommissioning of fuel channels. For the fuel channels decommissioning should be taken into account the detailed description of the fuel channel and its components, the installation documents history, adequate radiological criteria for decommissioning guidance, safety and environmental impact assessment, including radiological and non-radiological analysis of the risks that can occur for workers, public and environment, the description of the proposed program for decommissioning the fuel channel and its components, the description of the quality assurance program and of the monitoring program, the equipments and methods used to verify the compliance with the decommissioning criteria, the planning of performing the final radiological assessment at the end of the fuel channel decommissioning. These will include also, a description of the proposed radiation protection procedures to be used during decommissioning. The dismantling of the fuel channel is performed by one device which shall provide radiation protection during the stages of decommissioning, ensuring radiation protection of the workers. The device shall be designed according to the radiation protection procedures. The decommissioning device assembly of the fuel channel components is composed of the device itself and moving platform support for coupling of the selected channel to be dismantled. The fuel channel decommissioning device is an autonomous device designed for dismantling and extraction of the channel closure plug and shield plug, extraction of the end fitting, cutting and extraction of the pressure tube.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{social and}} ecological factors that facilitate effective management of coral reefs as social-ecological systems. Meta-analytical and field-based methods {{were employed to}} examine current management challenges and identify strategies that improve management effectiveness and coral reef health. A meta-analysis {{was used to evaluate}} biological indicators of reef health in relation to the types of fishing regulations in place (no-take areas, gear restriction areas, and periodic closures) and the actor groups (community-based, co-management, state, private) involved in management efforts for coral reef fisheries throughout the world. Other than enhancement of fish biomass within no-take areas that was significantly greater than in gear restriction areas, most biological indicators benefitted similarly from management techniques of no-take areas and gear restriction areas. Community-based and co-management were the best performing management arrangements for some biological outcomes but require further case studies to verify findings. Investigation of management effects by region indicated that previously degraded reefs received fewer benefits from management implementation than did relatively healthier reefs. For field investigations, the Comoros islands in the Western Indian Ocean served as a model for tropical coral reefs with challenging socioeconomic contexts, high biodiversity, and high vulnerability to coral reef degradation. Empirical study at 21 sites was used to identify the relative effects of natural and anthropogenic threats to coral reefs of the Comoros. Most previous studies of reef health focus on primarily natural factors or a single anthropogenic threat. This study examined suites of natural factors and human activities to identify the relative importance of each on reef health. Human activities including fishing, sand <b>extraction,</b> and beachfront <b>housing</b> and development were the best predictors of reef health status. Most notably, human population and fishing predicted fish richness, abundance, and biomass with seasonal variation in the effects, while site orientation strongly predicted benthic cover. Field studies in the Comoros were also used to investigate the roles of community and state actors in co-management and compare effectiveness of comanagement across sites with varying levels of actor participation. Effective management was found to occur with community or `meta-community 2 ̆ 7 (in this case, a Marine Protected Area in which the efforts of several communities were organized) participation in governance and support of state or external agents, while resilient management that overcame considerable challenges was found to occur only with strong community participation and leadership in governance. External agents were found to contribute to development of meta-community governance structure and initiation of community participation through education and capacity building. The findings from these studies reveal that coral reef management can be improved through context appropriate regulations that address detrimental human activities and through wide acceptance and participation in governance with cooperation among states, communities, and external agents...|$|R
40|$|Harmattan and Dust (sand) storms {{together}} with anthropogenic activities {{including the use}} of firewood and kerosene as fuel for cooking, and diesel/petrol generators for electricity generation are potential sources of particulate and gaseous pollutants in homes in Damaturu town, Nigeria. Other activities like the burning of locally produced incense and mosquito coils as well as the use of aerosol sprays are further possible sources of indoor pollution, which may result in exposure of people to a range of pollutants through inhalation, by ingestion of settled dusts as well as dermal contact. Local people associate occurrence of dust events with adverse health effects and hence {{there is a need for}} an understanding of the composition of the settled and airborne dusts in order to assess the possible associated health risks. The first phase of the study involved selection and development of methods of dust sampling and analysis. For validation of the methods employed and to establish a broad understanding of the characteristics of the settled dusts, an initial survey study was conducted involving the application of thermal desorption/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD/GC/MS) analysis for organic compound analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for analysis of metals, and microbiological analysis. Airborne samples were also collected using sorbent tubes to determine organic compounds in air during activities such as cooking with kerosene, gas, and firewood as well as during electricity generation with fossil fuels. Carbon monoxide (CO) and ultrafine particles (UFPs) monitored simultaneously during some of the household activities. The study involved a novel method of extracting organic chemical emissions from dust by heating of the dusts directly in a micro chamber (μ-CTETM) and collection of emissions on sampling tubes. The method provided a relatively quick way of collecting chemical emissions from dusts that are readily available for release. The sampled tubes were analysed by TD/GC/MS. The conventional solvent extraction of the dusts was also carried out and the extracts were analysed by liquid injection-GC/MS and results of the two methods compared. The study determined a number of constituents (metals, SVOCs, phthalates and physical properties) of dusts collected from households in Damaturu during different weather events and from different indoor/outdoor locations; and compared with some UK samples. The samples investigated include dusts deposited; during two notable dusty-weather events (Harmattan and Storm) as well as when there was no notable dust event; during human activities; and dusts from different types of buildings (modern and traditional homes) as well as inside and outside homes. A standard reference material for organic chemicals (SRM 2585) was also analysed. The physical characterization of the settled house dust samples analysed revealed the various shapes and sizes, and elemental composition of the constituents, which included respirable particles. The microbial analysis also indicated the presence of the spores of a host of fungi and bacterial species; and the possible contributions of household activities to the increased production of pollutants (UFP and CO) ascertained. The μ-CTE <b>extraction</b> of the <b>house</b> dusts by heating with TD/GC/MS analysis of the emissions as well as the solvent extraction-GC/MS revealed the presence of many organic chemical compounds with different analytical retention times and varying concentrations in the dust samples. Chemicals of interest quantified: benzene, hexanal, nonanal, diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutylphthalate (DIBP), dibutylphthalate (DBP), and diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP). A host of other chemicals commonly present in the analysed samples identified using the NIST library associated with the MS system software. These chemicals included naphthalene and C 10 -C 16 aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, which would need confirmation by running the pure compound samples. There was an observed higher concentration of the chemicals in the solvent extracts than the μ-CTE extracted dust. The higher concentration of the chemicals in the solvent extracts expected due to the aggressive removal of the chemicals by the organic solvent whereas in the case of thermal extraction only the readily available chemicals (loosely bound to the matrix) released by increases in temperature were removed. Generally, the concentrations of the chemicals found were higher in the indoor than in the outdoor dust samples. In the analysis of the dusts collected during weather events; higher chemical concentrations observed in the samples collected during Harmattan period than the other periods. The Harmattan dust period may pose increased exposures to dust and possible health risks. More exposure is expected to occur in the traditional homes compared with the modern homes due to the higher concentrations of the chemicals in both the indoors and the outdoors and this may be especially important to women and children who spend most of their times at home. Metal analysis involved microwave-assisted digestion of the dust samples followed by ICP-MS analysis. The total quant method of metal analysis for a general profiling indicated the presence of more than 50 elemental contaminants in house dust. The results of the quantitative analysis for six target metals: Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn showed their presence in all indoor and the outdoor dust samples. The mean concentrations showed that the metals were in higher concentrations in the indoor dusts than in the outdoor dusts. The quantitative analysis carried out indicated higher metal contents in the storm dusts than the dusts during the other periods. Results of the dusts collected from modern and traditional homes indicated the presence of the metals in higher concentrations in the dusts from traditional homes than the dusts from the modern homes. The estimated mean concentrations of the metals and phthalates inadvertently ingested as a constituent of dust indicated that some of the pollutants could exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) due to high exposures to dust expected to be the case in Damaturu. The results of the investigation of the dust composition, combined with information on exposure to dust and pollutants, show that dusts are a risk to the health of people in the Damataru community. Recommendations are made for more studies to provide a better understanding of dust ingestion and exposure to some phthalates and heavy metals in particular and the possible health risks. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first ever research study of airborne and settled dusts undertaken in North-Eastern Nigeria...|$|R
