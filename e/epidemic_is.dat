5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS <b>Epidemic</b> <b>is</b> a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS <b>epidemic</b> <b>is</b> a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E

25|$|John Snow {{is famous}} for his {{investigations}} into {{the causes of the}} 19th century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) epidemiology. He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho <b>epidemic</b> <b>is</b> considered the classic example of epidemiology. Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology, having helped shape public health policies around the world. However, Snow’s research and preventive measures to avoid further outbreaks were not fully accepted or put into practice until after his death.|$|E

2500|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the worst wildlife diseases in recent history that is currently decimating North American cave-hibernating bat populations. This <b>epidemic</b> <b>is</b> responsible for mass mortalities in hibernating North American bats, and is caused by a uniquely cold-adapted fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus begins to grow on bats during the winter hibernation season, when bats are in torpor and immune-compromised. The body temperature of a hibernating bat is the optimal fungal growth environment. The fungus has affected 90% of species that hibernate in caves for the winter. Pseudogymnoascus destructans spores have been found growing on the Virginia big-eared bat. To date, no WNS mortality in this species has been observed although the syndrome has killed millions of its fellow cave-dwelling species. [...] It is currently thought that the Big Ears may have a natural immunity to WNS through a yeast that the bat 'combs' over their body that inhibits the growth of the WNS fungus.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court of Oklahoma analogized water {{fluoridation}} to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case.

To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of {{the case that the}} substance {{to be added to the}} water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay.

40|$|Recent {{epidemics}} {{of acute}} asthma have caused speculation that, if their causes were known, early warnings might be feasible. In particular, some <b>epidemics</b> seemed to <b>be</b> associated with thunderstorms. We wondered what risk factors predicting <b>epidemics</b> could <b>be</b> identified. Daily asthma admissions counts during 1987 - 1994, for two age groups (0 - 14 yrs and > or = 15 yrs), were measured using the Hospital Episodes System (HES). <b>Epidemics</b> <b>were</b> defined as combinations of date, age group and English Regional Health Authority (RHA) with exceptionally high asthma admission counts {{compared to the}} predictions of a log-linear autoregression model. They were compared with control days 1 week before and afterwards, regarding seven meteorological variables and 5 day average pollen counts for four species. Fifty six asthma <b>epidemics</b> <b>were</b> identified. The mean density of sferics (lightning flashes), temperature and rainfall on <b>epidemic</b> days <b>were</b> greater than those on control days. High sferics densities <b>were</b> overrepresented in <b>epidemics.</b> Simultaneously high sferics and grass pollen further increased the probability of an epidemic, but only to 15 % (95 % confidence interval 2 - 45 %). Two thirds of <b>epidemics</b> <b>were</b> not preceded by thunderstorms. Thunderstorms and high grass pollen levels precede asthma epidemics more often than expected by chance. However, most <b>epidemics</b> <b>are</b> not associated with thunderstorms or unusual weather conditions, and most thunderstorms, even following high grass pollen levels, do not precede epidemics. An early warning system based on the indicators examined here would, therefore, detect few epidemics and generate an unacceptably high rate of false alarms...|$|R
2500|$|Some US professors have {{disagreed}} with the contention that Nepalese soldiers caused the outbreak. Some said it was more likely dormant cholera bacteria had been aroused by various environmental incidents in Haiti. Before studying the case, they said a sequence of events, including changes in climate triggered by the La Niña climate pattern and unsanitary living conditions for those affected by the earthquake, triggered bacteria already present to multiply and infect humans. However, a study unveiled in December and conducted by French epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux contended that UN troops from Nepal had started the epidemic as waste from outhouses at their base flowed into and contaminated the Artibonite River. A separate study published in December in the New England Journal of Medicine presented DNA sequence data for the Haitian cholera isolate, finding that it was most closely related to a cholera strain found in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008. It was more distantly related to existing South American strains of cholera, the authors reported, adding that [...] "the Haitian <b>epidemic</b> <b>is</b> probably {{the result of the}} introduction, through human activity, of a V. cholerae strain from a distant geographic source." [...] Rita Colwell, former director of the National Science Foundation and climate change expert, still contends that climate changes were an important factor in cholera's spread, stating in an interview with UNEARTH News in August 2013 that the outbreak was [...] "triggered by a complicated set of factors. The precipitation and temperatures were above average during 2010 and that, in conjunction with a destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure, can be considered to have contributed to this major disease outbreak." ...|$|E
