In 1919, the year tetrodes were invented, William Henry Eccles coined the term diode from the Greek roots di (from δί), meaning 'two', and ode (from ὁδός), meaning 'path'. (However, the word diode itself, as well as triode, tetrode, pentode, <b>hexode,</b> were already in use as terms of {{multiplex}} telegraphy; see, for example, The telegraphic journal and electrical review, September 10, 1886, p.252).|$|E
2500|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{require a}} local oscillator and mixer, combined in {{the function of}} a single pentagrid converter tube. Various alternatives such as {{using a combination of}} a triode with a <b>hexode</b> and even an octode have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both control grids (at a low potential) and screen grids (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers including the miniature tube version of the [...] "All American Five". Octodes such as the 7A8 were rarely used in the US, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not long}} before the triode and <b>hexode</b> {{structures}} were placed in the same glass envelope - by no means a new idea. The triode grid was usually internally connected to the <b>hexode</b> grid 3, but this practice was dropped in later designs when the mixer section operated as a straight IF amplifier in AM/FM sets when operating on FM, the mixing being carried out in a dedicated FM frequency changing section.|$|E
50|$|A {{vacuum tube}} (such as a pentode, but also {{sometimes}} triodes, <b>hexodes,</b> heptodes and so on) with its control grid given a helix with a variable pitch {{can be made}} to operate with more negative grid voltages, with reduced amplification, before it is completely cut off (i.e. yielding no significant output). This ability to vary the amplification (sometimes called mu) and also the transconductance, is useful in Automatic Gain Control (AGC) stages of radio receivers. Devices with this characteristic are called remote-cutoff or variable-mu or super-control types.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} between the two versions of the heptode, manufacturers data often describes them as [...] "heptode of the <b>hexode</b> type" [...] for a heptode without a suppressor grid, and a [...] "heptode of the octode type", where a suppressor grid is present.|$|E
50|$|A valve {{can contain}} {{more than one}} control grid. The <b>hexode</b> {{contains}} two such grids, one for a received signal {{and one for the}} signal from a local oscillator. The valve's inherent non-linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals. This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in superheterodyne receivers.|$|E
50|$|Two or more {{elements}} in a single envelope were handled by adding letters after the heater identifier, in alphabetical order, so an ECH35 is a 6.3 volt heated triode plus a <b>hexode</b> with an octal base; a PABC80 is a Noval 300mA series-heater combination of a single low-power diode A, a pair of diodes with common cathode B, and a triode C. There were many ECCnn(n) 6.3V dual triodes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>hexode</b> (six-electrode) was {{actually}} developed after the heptode or pentagrid. It {{was developed in}} Germany as a mixer but was designed from the start {{to be used with}} a separate triode oscillator. Thus the grid configuration was grid 1, signal input; grids 2 and 4 screen grids (connected together - again, usually internally) and grid 3 was the oscillator input. The device had no suppressor grid. A major advantage was that by using grid 1 as the signal input grid, the device was more sensitive to weak signals.|$|E
50|$|Frequency {{converter}} {{may also}} {{refer to a}} much-lower-powered circuit that converts radio frequency signals at one frequency to another frequency, especially in a Superheterodyne receiver. See Frequency mixer. The circuit usually consists of a local oscillator and frequency mixer (analog multiplier) that generates sum and difference frequencies from the input and local oscillator, of which one (the Intermediate frequency) will be required for further amplification, while the others are filtered out. The same result was achieved historically by the pentagrid converter or a Triode and <b>Hexode</b> in a single tube, but can be implemented in transistor radios economically by a single transistor functioning as a self-oscillating mixer.|$|E
50|$|Since the transitron {{oscillator}} didn't depend on secondary emission {{it was far}} more reliable than the dynatron. However, because the screen grid is not designed to handle high power, the oscillator's output power is limited. Other tubes with multiple grids beside the pentode, such as the <b>hexode</b> and pentagrid converter tube, have been {{be used to make}} similar negative transconductance oscillators. Pentode tubes used in this circuit have a negative transconductance of only around -250 microsiemens, giving a negative resistance of -4000Ω. Tubes with more grids, such as the pentagrid converter, {{can be used to make}} {{transitron oscillator}}s with higher transconductance, resulting in smaller negative resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Like all tube {{numbering}} systems, {{there are}} many inconsistencies between theory and practice. For example, there is no assigned letter code for cathode-ray tubes. Some unusual types received rather mundane sounding designations, based solely on electrode count, {{because there was no}} better place to put them. For example, the 2F21 is not an actual <b>hexode,</b> but a pattern generating monoscope tube. Some very exotic types received generic designators, even when there was a more appropriate designator available. For example, the 2H21 [...] "phasitron" [...] phase modulator tube used in early FM broadcast transmitters was assigned an [...] "H" [...] (octode) designator, when {{it would have been a}} perfect candidate for the otherwise unused [...] "T" [...] category for deflection controlled tubes.|$|E

5000|$|In European {{nomenclature}} a {{first letter}} [...] "E" [...] identifies tubes with heaters {{to be connected}} in parallel to a transformer winding of 6.3V; [...] "U" [...] identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in series across the mains supply, drawing 100 mA; and [...] "P" [...] identifies similar 300 mA series-connected tubes. Following the voltage letter, [...] "A" [...] stands for a low-current (signal) diode section, [...] "B" [...] for a double diode with common cathode section, [...] "C" [...] for a triode section, [...] "F" [...] for a pentode section, [...] "H" [...] for a <b>hexode</b> or heptode section, and [...] "L" [...] for a power tetrode or pentode section. The first number identified the base type, for example 3 for Octal base; 9 for B7G sub-miniature 7 pin. The remaining numbers identified a particular tube type; tubes with all characters except the first identical had identical electrodes but a different heater; e.g. the EBC81 and UBC81. Generally, odd numbers identified tubes / valves with variable mu characteristics and even numbers straight, or sharp cut-off types.|$|E
40|$|Very deep treches (up to 200 um) {{with high}} aspect ratios (up to 10) in silicon are etched using a fluorine-based plasma (SF 6 /O 2 /CHF 3). Isotropic, {{positively}} and megatively (i. e. reverse) tapered {{as well as}} fully vertical walls with smooth surfaces are achieved by controlling the plasma chemistry. A convenient way to find the processing conditions needed for a vertical wall is described: the Black Silicon Method.
