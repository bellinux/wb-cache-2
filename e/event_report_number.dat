40|$|ABSTRACT Karen Varda MEDICATION ERRORS PRE AND POST IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ADMIN-RX BARCODE ENABLED MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM Medication errors {{have been}} {{extensively}} explored {{in the literature}} but the impact of information technologies (IT) on these errors has not. This study evaluated {{the impact of the}} implementation of a barcode enabled medication administration system on medication errors in an acute care hospital. Medication errors were measured for a four month period pre and post implementation of the Admin-Rx system using web-based <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> filed by hospital staff. Medication errors were analyzed per 1000 patient days by total <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> filed, <b>number</b> of actual errors made, and category of error by stage in the medication process where the error occurred (ordering, transcribing, dispensing, and administration). There were no significant differences detected from pre implementation to post implementation, though some trends were noted. The actual number of medication errors was higher post implementation while the number of medication error <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> was higher pre implementation. The number of errors in the administration stage was lower post implementation. The implementation of barcoding at the bedside would be expected to impact errors {{at this stage of the}} medication process. Transcription errors accounted for a greater percentage of the errors post implementation than pre implementation. These findings suggest the impact of barcode technology on the entire medication administration process warrants further research and focus...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE Twometa-analyses {{conclude}} that finasteride treatment of androgenic alopecia (AGA) is safe {{but do not}} assess quality of safety reporting. OBJECTIVE To assess safety reporting for clinical trial reports of finasteride for AGA. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials. gov, and a clinical data repository for an academic medical center. STUDY SELECTION Published clinical trial reports for finasteride treatment of AGA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS For each trial, we assessed quality of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> extracted the <b>number</b> and type of adverse events in treatment and placebo groups, and assessed duration of safety evaluation and adequacy of blinding. Two observers independently extracted the data; differences were resolved by consensus. We assessed generalizability in a large cohort of men prescribed finasteride, 1. 25 mg/d or less, by assessing for eligibility in the finasteride-AGA pivotal trials. MAIN OUTCOMES ANDMEASURES Quality was assessed as adequate, partially adequate, inadequate, or no <b>events</b> <b>reported.</b> We used funnel plots of the hazard ratio to assess bias. RESULTS Of 34 clinical trials, none had adequate safety reporting, 19 were partially adequate...|$|R
40|$|Between December 2013 and February 2014, {{a series}} of storm events {{occurred}} {{in areas of the}} North Atlantic frequented by migratory seabirds. Prolonged exposure to sustained storm conditions was followed by an unprecedented level of seabird mortality, apparently due to starvation, exhaustion and drowning. A total of 54, 982 wrecked birds was recorded along European coastlines of the North-East Atlantic over the winter; 94 % of which were dead. The majority of birds found were recorded on the French coastline (79. 6 %), and the most impacted species was the Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica (53. 5 %).

Producers are the links between the EUDAQ framework and the subdetector systems such as the beam telescope, the TLU, or user DAQ systems. They interface with the EUDAQ library and provide a set of commands to be called by the Run Control. This simple interface scheme eases the integration of user DAQ systems into the software framework. The data read out from the detectors by the individual Producers are sent to the so-called Data Collector. This Data Collector {{is responsible for the}} event building, i.e. the correlation of events from all subdetector systems to single global events comprising all data belonging to one trigger. Basic sanity checks such as testing the consistency of <b>event</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>reported</b> by the individual subdetectors are executed.|$|R

The impact of single life events and {{the cumulative effect of}} multiple life events on child mental health were examined. In a northern German city, the complete 1 -year intake of preschool children at the primary school entry assessment was included. In 1, 887 children, life events and psychiatric symptoms were recorded by means of standardized parent questionnaires. Included were all life events between child's birth and school entry. For more than 80 percent of all children, at least one life <b>event</b> was <b>reported.</b> The <b>number</b> of life events was independent of any demographic variable; the mean was 2. 2. The number of life events had a highly significant effect on the prevalence of child mental health problems. Six family-change-factors, especially coherent in content, could be identified by factor analysis. The study provides important data on the epidemiology and clinical impact of life events and psychopathology in early childhood.

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are application-dependent networks. An application may require general event region information, per-node event region information, or prioritized event information {{in case of}} multiple events. All event flows are subject to congestion in wireless sensor networks. This {{is due to the}} sudden impulse of information flow from a number of event nodes to a single destination. Congestion degrades system throughput and results in energy loss of nodes. In this paper, we present a multievent congestion control protocol (MCCP) for wireless sensor networks. MCCP supports multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> modes, that is, general <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> per-node fair <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> and prioritized multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting.</b> MCCP efficiently mitigates congestion and provides output according to selected <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> mode. MCCP uses hop-by-hop packet delivery time and buffer size as the basic metrics for congestion detection. Moreover, we introduce a schedule-based scheme at the transport layer for rate assignment and ordered delivery of event packets to underlying routing layer. This helps to avoid packet collisions and increases the packet delivery ratio even in high densities. Detailed simulation analysis confirms that MCCP decreases packet drops and provides high packet delivery ratio (above 90 %) for multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> modes.|$|R

5000|$|The PRR {{is defined}} as the ratio between the {{frequency}} with which a specific adverse <b>event</b> is <b>reported</b> for the drug of interest (relative to all adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for the drug) and the frequency with which the same adverse <b>event</b> is <b>reported</b> for all drugs in the comparison group (relative to all adverse events for drugs in the comparison group). For example, suppose that nausea was reported 83 times for a given drug of interest, out of 1356 adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for the drug. Thus the proportion of adverse events of nausea for this drug is 83/1356 = 0.061. Suppose that we wish to compare the drug of interest to a class of drugs, for which nausea was reported as an adverse event 1489 times, out of 53789 total adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for drugs in the class. Thus, nausea was reported with proportion 1489 / 53789 = 0.028 for the class of drugs. The PRR in this case is 0.061 / 0.028 = 2.18. This tells us that nausea was reported more than twice as frequently (among all adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports)</b> for the drug of interest compared to drugs in the comparison group.|$|R

In this paper we present and explore methods for utilizing both the unstructured free-text and structured data elements in safety <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> to identify and rank similar events. We evaluate the results of three different free-text search methods, including a unique topic modeling adaptation, and structured element weights, using a patient fall use case.

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{provision}} of safe healthcare {{is considered a}} priority in European Union (EU) member states. Along with other preventative measures in healthcare, the EU also strives to eliminate the “causes of harm to human health”. The aim of this survey {{was to determine whether}} safety culture, supervisors and communication between co-workers influence the <b>number</b> of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the heads of clinical departments and to the management of an institution. Methods. This survey is based on cross-sectional analysis. It was carried out in the largest Slovenian university hospital. We received 235 completed questionnaires. Respondents included professionals in the fields of nursingcare, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiological technology. Results. Safety culture influences the <b>number</b> of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the head of a clinical department from the organizational point of view. Supervisors and communication between co-workers do not influence the <b>number</b> of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports.</b> Conclusion. It can be concluded that neither supervisors nor the level of communication between co-workers influence the frequency of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> while safety culture does influence it from an organizational point of view. The presumed factors only partly influence the number of submitted adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports,</b> thus other causes of under-reporting must be sought elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Web Services are an XML {{technology}} recently {{viewed as}} capable of being used for network management. A key aspect of WS in this domain is <b>event</b> <b>reporting.</b> WS-based {{research in this area}} has produced a collection of notification specifications, which consider even aspects such as filtering to reduce machine and network resource consumption. Still though, additional aspects need to be addressed if WS <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> is to be used efficiently for network management. This paper borrows an idea in network management that of policy based task delegation and applies {{it in the context of}} WS-based management by using the WS-Notification standard messages, to increase <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> efficiency. More specifically, we are adding functionality to the entity that produces events making it capable of performing a set of tasks apart from simple ones such as collecting and reporting notification data. This functionality allows an entity, such as a manager, capable of delegating tasks of various complexities to an <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> entity where they can be performed dynamically. As a proof of concept that the approach is feasible and increases efficiency we analyze a complex <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> scenario where task delegation is used. We compare this approach for performance to a plain WS-based event system and also to simple SNMP traps. ...|$|R

Methods and Findings: We searched ClinicalTrials. gov on March 27, 2012, for randomized controlled trials of drugs with posted results. For {{a random sample of}} these trials, we searched PubMed for corresponding publications. Data were extracted independently from ClinicalTrials. gov and from the published articles for trials with results both posted and published. We assessed the time to first public posting or publishing of results and compared the completeness of results posted at ClinicalTrials. gov versus published in journal articles. Completeness was defined as the reporting of all key elements, according to three experts, for the flow of participants, efficacy results, adverse events, and serious adverse events (e. g., for adverse <b>events,</b> <b>reporting</b> of the <b>number</b> of adverse events per arm, without restriction to statistically significant differences between arms for all randomized patients or for those who received at least one treatment dose).
