5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few <b>Dollars</b> <b>More</b> (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few <b>Dollars</b> <b>More</b> and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E

That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The film earned {{considerable}} {{critical and}} financial success, grossing in inflation-adjusted <b>dollars</b> <b>more</b> box office sales {{than any previous}} Star Trek film. The plaudits include the franchise's first Academy Award (for makeup). The film's major cast members are contracted for two sequels. Paramount's sequel to the 2009 film, Star Trek Into Darkness, premiered in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2013, but the film did not release in the United States until May 17, 2013. While the film was not as successful in the North American box office as its predecessor, internationally, in terms of box office receipts, Into Darkness was the most successful of the franchise. A thirteenth film entitled Star Trek Beyond was released on July 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials {{decided whether to}} replace her {{at a cost of}} $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 <b>dollars</b> <b>more</b> than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E
50|$|Wow/Grape Jam is {{the second}} album by the rock band Moby Grape, {{released}} in 1968.

25|$|The {{most popular}} Spaghetti Westerns {{were those of}} Sergio Leone, whose Dollars Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few <b>Dollars</b> <b>More,</b> and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), {{featuring}} Clint Eastwood and scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with Once Upon a Time in the West.|$|E
50|$|In the 1870s, when Joseph Cairn Simpson (founder of California's first all-sports newspaper, Breeder and Sportsman) {{migrated}} west, {{he brought}} horses with him. One was the filly Marian. To finance his newspaper, he sold Marian to Theodore Winters, who owned California's best stallion, Norfolk, by America's greatest sire, Lexington. Norfolk retired undefeated. Winters bought him for $15,001, one <b>dollar</b> <b>more</b> {{than the amount}} paid for Lexington himself.|$|R
50|$|The film, {{along with}} Beery's role in Min and Bill, catapulted Beery's career. Beery signed a {{contract}} with MGM shortly thereafter specifying that he receive a <b>dollar</b> <b>more</b> per year than any other actor on the lot, effectively making him the world's highest paid actor. The picture also made nine-year-old Jackie Cooper the first child star of the 1930s, an era noted for its numerous, popular child actors.|$|R

25|$|The U.S. {{system is}} often {{compared}} with that of its northern neighbor, Canada (see Canadian and American health care systems compared). Canada's system is largely publicly funded. In 2006, Americans spent an estimated US$6,714 per capita on health care, while Canadians spent US$3,678. This amounted to 15% percent of U.S. GDP in that year, while Canada spent 10%. A study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of U.S. health care <b>dollars</b> (<b>more</b> than $1,000 per person per year) went to health care administrative costs.|$|E
25|$|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was {{marketed as}} {{the third and final}} {{installment}} in the Dollars Trilogy, following A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few <b>Dollars</b> <b>More.</b> The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now seen {{as one of the greatest}} and most influential Westerns of all time.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growing}} {{influence}} of United States {{in international affairs}} many American Jewish organizations such as American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee actively intervened on behalf of Persian Jews. During the great famine of Persia in 1917-1919 Albert Lucas the representative of JDC successfully convinced US government to donate 15000 dollars (200000 in 2015 USD) to Persian Jewry. In September 1918 10000 <b>dollars</b> <b>more</b> was donated by the JDC of Philadelphia. Thus the casualty of famine amongst the Persian Jews was minimal in comparison to Persian gentiles. Furthermore, when the Jewish neighborhood of Broujerd was attacked by Loures JDC sent large number of donations. US ambassador Caldwell was also instrumental in helping the Jews of Broujerd.|$|E
50|$|At the house, Weems {{wrote an}} 80-page booklet that would {{influence}} {{the thoughts of}} Americans to this day: he documented the life of George Washington, and was {{the creator of the}} famous cherry tree story ("I cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet"). Weems also created the fable that Washington threw a silver <b>dollar</b> <b>more</b> than 300 feet across the Rappahannock River. He also wrote biographies on Benjamin Franklin, Francis Marion, and William Penn.|$|R

60|$|A small-town bungalow, {{the wives}} of a village doctor and a village dry-goods merchant, a provincial teacher, a colloquial brawl over paying a servant a <b>dollar</b> <b>more</b> a week. Yet this insignificance echoed cellar-plots and cabinet {{meetings}} and labor conferences in Persia and Prussia, Rome and Boston, and the orators who deemed themselves international leaders were but the raised voices of a billion Juanitas denouncing a million Carols, with a hundred thousand Vida Sherwins trying to shoo away the storm.|$|R
25|$|The {{composer}} subsequently scored Leone's {{other two}} Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy) spaghetti westerns: For a Few <b>Dollars</b> <b>More</b> (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name and depicted Leone's own intense {{vision of the}} mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music {{to be an important}} part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, A Fistful of Dollars was {{released}} 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release); For a Few <b>Dollars</b> <b>More</b> {{was released}} 10 May 1967 (17 months); and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was released 29 December 1967 (12 months). Thus, {{all three of}} Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year. The original Italian domestic version was 177 minutes long, but the international version was shown at various lengths. Most prints, specifically those shown in the United States, had a runtime of 161 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the Italian premiere version, but others, especially British prints, ran as short as 148 minutes.|$|E
25|$|On June 19, 1972, {{the press}} {{reported}} {{that one of}} the Watergate burglars was a Republican Party security aide. Former Attorney General John Mitchell, who at the time {{was the head of the}} CRP, denied any involvement with the Watergate break-in or knowledge of the five burglars. On August 1, a $25,000 cashier’s check earmarked for the Nixon re-election campaign was found in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars. Further investigation by the FBI would reveal the team had thousands of <b>dollars</b> <b>more</b> to support their travel and expenses in the months leading up to their arrests.

25|$|As {{rail lines}} pushed {{further and further}} into the wilderness, they opened up huge areas that would have {{otherwise}} lain fallow. The railroads helped establish countless towns and settlements, paved the way to abundant mineral deposits and fertile tracts of pastures and farmland, and created new markets for eastern goods. It is estimated {{that by the end}} of World War II, rail companies nationwide remunerated to the government over $1 billion <b>dollars,</b> <b>more</b> than eight times the original value of the lands granted. The principal commodity transported across the rails to California was people: by reducing the cross-country travel time to as little as six days, men with westward ambitions were no longer forced to leave their families behind. The railroads would, in time, provide equally important linkages to move the inhabitants throughout the state, interconnecting its blossoming communities.|$|E
25|$|The Nationality Room {{programs}} {{began in}} 1926 when Bowman {{decided that he}} wanted to involve the community {{as much as he could}} in constructing the Cathedral, so he proposed that each nationality that had a significant number of people in Pittsburgh would be allowed to design their nationality's room for the Cathedral. Each group had to form a Room Committee, which would be responsible for all fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided only the room and, upon completion, upkeep for perpetuity. All other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes aided by foreign governments and the rooms contain many authentic artifacts and materials from the country represented. A typical room on the 1st floor (those built between 1938 and the 1957) took between three and ten years to complete, and cost the equivalent of US$300,000 in 2006 <b>dollars.</b> <b>More</b> recent rooms have cost in the range of $750,000 and up.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Brown, who had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious medfly infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was advised by the state's agricultural industry, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection service (APHIS), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the medfly reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed and billions of <b>dollars</b> <b>more</b> were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of sterile male medflies in an attempt to disrupt the insects' reproductive cycle.|$|E
50|$|The Geary-Khamis <b>dollar,</b> <b>more</b> {{commonly}} known as the international dollar (Int'l. dollar or Intl. dollar, abbreviation: Int'l$. or Intl$.), is a hypothetical unit of currency that has the same purchasing power parity that the U.S. dollar had in the United States at a given point in time. It is widely used in economics. The year 1990 or 2000 is often used as a benchmark year for comparisons that run through time. The unit is often abbreviated e.g. 2000 US dollar (if the benchmark year is 2000) or 2000 Int'l$..|$|R
