In his 2012–13 Budget, Treasurer Swan announced that the government would deliver a $1.5 billion surplus. The government cut defence and foreign aid spending. In December 2012, Swan announced that the government no longer expected to achieve a surplus, citing falling revenue and global economic conditions.|$|E

[...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

Since the route came nowhere near US93, AASHTO instead suggested US491, noting it as {{a branch of}} US191 at Monticello, Utah. Although the next three-digit child of US91 would have been U.S. Route291, both the 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers {{in at least one}} of the affected states. At the news that the motion had passed, a New Mexico spokesperson stated, [...] "The devil's out of <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> say goodbye and good riddance."

500|$|Torres {{was called}} up for Spain's Euro 2008 squad, where {{he set up}} Villa to score Spain's first goal of the tournament {{in the first game}} in the group stage against Russia. Torres came under {{criticism}} for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> won. My job is to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world." [...] He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner David Villa in the Team of the Tournament.|$|E

[...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here.

500|$|The Croatian {{government}} {{played a}} [...] "double game" [...] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and [...] "a military solution required Bosnia as an ally, but {{a diplomatic solution}} required Bosnia as a victim". Tuđman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party held important positions in the Bosnian government including the premiership and the ministry of defence, but despite this carried out a separate policy and refused for the HVO to be integrated into ARBiH. Jerko Doko, the Bosnian defence minister, gave the HVO priority in the acquisition of military weapons. In January 1992, Tuđman had arranged for Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) who favored cooperating with the Bosniaks towards a unified Bosnian state, to be ousted and replaced by Mate Boban, who favored Croatia to annex Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A rift existed in the party between Croats from ethnically mixed areas of central and northern Bosnia and those from Herzegovina. Milivoj Gagro, prewar Croat mayor of Mostar and ally of Kljuić said: [...] "The secessionist policy [...] was consistently supported by the Herzegovina side, not by Sarajevo, Posavina, or Central Bosnia Croats. [...] Croats from Central Bosnia and Posavina, {{as well as those}} from urban centers who lived with Muslims and Serbs, thought differently. But when the war picked up, Posavina Croats were attacked, Sarajevo was surrounded [...] Kljuić was sidelined and Boban came in with idea [...] in this area. [...] When they [...] felt they could not survive any more they lifted their hands and accepted their fate. And the Herzegovina Croats promised them the stars in the sky and told them [...] "come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will give you a place." [...] And what happened? It resulted in an exodus. And all these miserable Croat refugee communities that look absolutely ugly." ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{passage from}} Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to {{his lack of}} frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance {{and as a result}} only spoke with three {{merchant}} ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet. The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast. Although Captain Thomas Thompson of HMS Leander requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible. Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away. The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory. As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard Orient, his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating. When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy {{out of sight of the}} British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed. On 28 June, Mutine [...] arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour. Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul George Baldwin, but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city. As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson. A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in Mutine. Kurayyim replied that he had not seen the French fleet, and that he would enforce the Ottoman Empire's neutrality and forbid both the British and the French from entering the harbour or landing on the coast. He was dismissive of the British warnings: [...] "It is impossible that the French should come to our country. They have no business <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are not at war with them." [...] Without Baldwin no further entries could be made, and when there was still no sign of the French on the morning of 29 June, Nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across the central Mediterranean towards Corfu, following a more northerly course than his first voyage.|$|E

[...] He estimated it would be at least three months until the plant was at least partially operational, when the less-damaged processing plants for John Brookes and East Spar are brought back online. The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational.
