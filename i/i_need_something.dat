I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, {{and there is a lot}} of people around me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E
