It can also be argued that the use of POCIS is a more relevant from an <b>ecotoxicological</b> perspective as the use of a passive sampler mimics the uptake of compounds by organisms. Another strength in using bioassays to test environmental samples is that they can provide an integrative measure of the toxic potential of a group of chemical compounds, rather than a single contaminant.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{categories}} of anatoxin-a detection methods. Biological methods have involved administration of samples to mice and other organisms more commonly used in <b>ecotoxicological</b> testing, such as brine shrimp (Artemia salina), larvae of the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus, and various insect larvae. Problems with this methodology include an inability {{to determine whether it}} is anatoxin-a or another neurotoxin that causes the resulting deaths. Large amounts of sample material are also needed for such testing. In addition to the biological methods, scientists have used chromatography to detect anatoxin-a. This is complicated by the rapid degradation of the toxin and the lack of commercially available standards for anatoxin-a.|$|E
50|$|A further {{topic of}} Dallinger’s <b>ecotoxicological</b> {{research}} has focused on aspects of microevolution and adaptation of species and populations to contaminants (metals, pesticides) in combination with different anthropogenic stressors. It could be shown, for example, that the widespread apple pest species, Cydia pomonella, has split into varied adaptable populations over small-scale areas in the alpine region under the selective pressure of pesticide application. Many of these populations have been able to acquire pesticide resistance. Another example of microevolutionary adaptation to environmental pollution has been demonstrated by Dallinger and coworkers in populations of the freshwater sludge worm, Tubifex tubifex. Due to historic and recent metal pollution in European river systems, native populations of this species have split into lineages and cryptic species that differ with respect to their metal resistance.|$|E
50|$|Amphibians, {{particularly}} anurans which {{consist of}} frogs and toads, are increasingly used as bioindicators of contaminant accumulation in pollution studies. Anurans absorb toxic chemicals through their skin and larval gill membranes and {{are sensitive to}} alterations in their environment. They have a poor ability to detoxify pesticides that are absorbed, inhaled, or ingested by eating contaminated food. This allows residues, especially of organochlorine pesticides, to accumulate in their systems. They also have permeable skin that can easily absorb toxic chemicals, making them a model organism for assessing the effects of environmental factors that may cause the declines of the amphibian population. These factors {{allow them to be}} used as bioindicator organisms to follow changes in their habitats and in <b>ecotoxicological</b> studies due to humans increasing demands on the environment.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Anderson's {{projects}} {{feature a}} broad scope, {{and are often}} far flung.

5000|$|Because the {{fathead minnow}} is fairly {{tolerant}} of harsh conditions, {{it can be}} found in bodies of water that may be uninhabitable to other fish, such as waste drainage sites. It has also been studied to investigate the effects of these waste materials on the aquatic life. [...] Natural and synthetic oestrogens, such as oestradiol and oestrone, are present in sewage treatment works effluents. In male fathead minnows, exposure to these steroidal compounds leads to an increase in plasma vitellogenin levels exceeding that of even mature female fathead minnows. Vitellogenin blood plasma levels are an indicator for determining if chemicals have an oestrogenic activity to fish. This is also accompanied by an inhibition of testicular growth, even if the exposure is in low concentrations or {{for a short period of}} time. These studies showed that the presence of natural oestrogens, likely originating from humans, represents a new <b>ecotoxicological</b> issue.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{tolerances}} that can occur; multiple and co-tolerance. Multiple tolerances can elevate an individual’s ability to tolerate several toxicants present at once. [...] This means that {{depending on the type of}} chemicals present in the environment, the concentration, and the organisms that are affected could alter the environment in multiple different ways. Co tolerance is the ability of an organism to develop a tolerance to a certain toxicant in short term tests, and obtain that tolerance for other toxicants similar to the first. Toxicant can cause co-tolerance for species if they’re closely related chemistry or have similar modes of action. It can be difficult to determine with type of tolerance is occurring if there are multiple types of toxicants in a community because they could be acting simultaneously. Basically it is difficult to understand what exactly may be going on in a community without testing it with multiple <b>ecotoxicological</b> tools with long and short term toxicity tests.|$|E
50|$|Recently, S. stercoraria was {{approved}} {{as a standard}} required test species for <b>ecotoxicological</b> testing. This includes evaluating the residues of veterinary drugs in livestock dung. Yellow dung flies are {{a key part of}} decomposing waste in pastures, which is key to preventing the spread of endoparasites and returning nutrients to the soil. The species’ diet also serves to reduce the abundance of pest flies. To test a chemical's toxicity, the chemical is mixed with bovine faeces, to which yellow dung fly eggs are added. Then, endpoints, such as sex and number of emerged adult flies, retardation of emergence, morphological change, and developmental rate, are measured and analyzed to determine toxicity. A great deal of research has been done on the effects of avermectins on populations of S. stercoraria. Avermectins are used to control endoparasites in livestock. The resulting dung contains drug residues that can have unintentional adverse effects on yellow dung fly populations, such as increased mutations and decreased offspring viability. If the use of such drugs in agriculture is not carefully monitored, considerable economic losses could occur.|$|E
50|$|In April 1968, 300 {{barrels of}} Corexit was {{shipped to the}} scene of the {{stricken}} tanker Esso Essen off the African coast. 125 barrels of it was sprayed onto the slick by aircraft over two days, after which the slick was dispersed. Corexit was later used in response to the sinking of the Greek tanker Andron off the west African coast. Following these events, Humble Oil and Refining Co. and the Enjay Chemical Company (a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) each announced the development of Corexit 7664, describing it as non-toxic to marine life- even to shrimp at concentrations of 1% per volume of seawater. <b>Ecotoxicological</b> studies had been undertaken by the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Miami. Corexit 7664's point of difference was described by research chemist Dr Edward Corino to be its water base, where previous dispersants had been hydrocarbon-based and highly toxic. James Avery, Humble Oil and Refining Company's public relations representative for the eastern region confirmed that following the Torrey Canyon oil spill, another spill in the Fore River from a tanker en route to Weymouth, south of Boston hastened Corexit 7664's development.|$|E
5000|$|During phase 3, the {{programme}} started {{investigating the}} environmental impact of the chosen Metarhizium isolate (IMI 330189). Standard toxicological tests carried out by certified laboratories showed that the strain had practically no effect on mammals, birds and fish (e.g. [...] for rats >2000 mg active ingredient per kg of body weight). Other toxicological and <b>ecotoxicological</b> tests were performed by the LUBILOSA team. An important goal was to show that its isolate only infected locusts and grasshoppers. Infection tests were therefore performed on a large number of invertebrates. The great majority could not be infected even by high doses. However, some species, like termites, honey bees, certain parasitoid wasps and silk worms, did get infected under laboratory conditions. Further experiments were carried out under semi-field and full field conditions, which showed that only silk worms suffered significant infection under those conditions. The conclusion from all these tests was that the LUBILOSA strain of Metarhizium was incapable of infecting vertebrates and infected {{only a small number of}} insect species under artificial conditions. The available studies indicate that under natural conditions, the isolate only infects species belonging to the Acrididea and the domesticated silk worm Bombyx mori.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the fate}} and <b>ecotoxicological</b> effects of {{pesticides}} largely {{depends on their}} molecular properties. We recentlydeveloped BTyPol^ (Typology of Pollutants), a classification method of organic compounds based on statistical analyses. Itcombines several environmental (sorption coefficient, degradation half-life) and one <b>ecotoxicological</b> (bioconcentration factor) parameters, to structural molecular descriptors (number of atoms in the molecule, molecular surface, dipole moment, energy oforbitals, etc.). The present study attempts to extend TyPol to the <b>ecotoxicological</b> effects of pesticides on non-target organisms,based on data analysis from available literature and databases. It revealed that relevant <b>ecotoxicological</b> endpoints for terrestrialorganisms (e. g., soil microorganisms, invertebrates) that support a range of ecosystemic services are lacking as compared toaquatic organisms. The availability of <b>ecotoxicological</b> parameters was also lower for chronic than for acute ecotoxicity endpoints. Consequently, seven parameters were included for acute (EC 50, LC 50) and chronic (NOEC) <b>ecotoxicological</b> effects forone terrestrial (Eisenia sp.) and three aquatic (Daphnia sp., algae, Lemna sp.) organisms. In this new configuration, we usedTyPol to classify 50 pesticides into different clusters that gather molecules with similar environmental behaviors and ecotoxicologicaleffects. The classification results evidenced relationships between molecular descriptors, environmental parameters, andthe added <b>ecotoxicological</b> endpoints. This proof-of-concept study also showed that TyPol in silico classification can successfullyaddress new scientific questions and be expanded with other parameters of interest...|$|E
