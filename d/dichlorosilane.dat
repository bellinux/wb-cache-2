40|$|Silicon based organic {{reagents}} {{have enjoyed}} {{a wealth of}} applications in the last thirty year. However, the development of organosilanes for asymmetric synthesis has been less prolific.

50|$|The {{modified}} Wurtz coupling of <b>dichlorosilanes</b> {{remains a}} viable and general route to high molecular weight, linear polysilane derivatives. This reaction is conducted at elevated temperature in an inert solvent using a dispersion of the alkali metal. The polymerization stops {{with the addition}} of an alcohol. The major limitation with the Wurtz-type polymerization is that the substituents must be able to tolerate the vigorous reaction conditions. The reaction works well for methyl, benzyl, and phenyl substituents. With the rigorous conditions, the yield of the product ranges from a few percent to approximately 50%. Similarly, potassium-graphite (KC8) can be used at much lower temperatures than those required for traditional Wurtz coupling. This reaction typically produces a trimodal distribution of products: a low molecular weight fraction and two higher molecular weight fractions. The low molecular weight fraction consists of five and six-membered rings, i. e. SiR25 and SiR26. Formation of these rings competes with the growth of the polymer. Another method for the synthesis of polysilanes is dehydrogenative coupling of silanes.|$|R

Remaining chlorosilane groups were reacted by a second alcohol treatment to obtain air-stable, highly condensed, and low OH_containing sols.
