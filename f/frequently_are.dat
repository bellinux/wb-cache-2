5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
25|$|Patients usually regain {{function}} in their shoulders, and experience less pain, following surgery. For some, however, the joint continues to hurt. Weakness and a {{limited range of}} motion also may persist. Those who report such symptoms <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed with failed rotator cuff syndrome.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an algebra of discontinuous functions whose first derivative exists almost everywhere: due to this fact, they can and <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> used to define generalized solutions of nonlinear problems involving functionals, ordinary and partial differential equations in mathematics, physics and engineering.|$|E

25|$|All dog breeds can inflict a bite. Breed {{is not an}} {{accurate}} predictor {{of whether or not}} a dog will bite. In the US pit bull-type and Rottweilers most <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> identified breeds in cases of severe bites. This may be due to their size. These breeds are more frequently owned by people involved in crime.|$|E
25|$|Sulfide {{deposits}} <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> a mix {{of different}} metal sulfides, such as copper, zinc, silver, lead, arsenic and other metals. (Sphalerite (ZnS2), for example, is not uncommon in copper sulfide deposits, and the metal smelted would be brass, which is both harder and more durable than copper.) The metals could theoretically be separated out, but the alloys resulting were typically much stronger than the metals individually.|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Border Collies and Australian Shepherds. English Shepherds usually have tails and a less rounded head than many Aussies. English Shepherds are never merle as Aussies <b>frequently</b> <b>are.</b> They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished from Border Collies by their very different upright, loose-eyed herding style.|$|E

25|$|The {{town has}} been closely {{associated}} with motor trials and racing. The Circuit des Remparts (see below) is held annually, {{one of the last}} such street-racing course in France, together with Pau (and Monaco). In addition to local heroes, internationally known racing drivers, such as Juan Manuel Fangio, José Froilán González, Jean-Pierre Wimille, Pierre Veyron and Maurice Trintignant, have been regular participants. The famous cars which they drove <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> presented at the modern event. The hotel and restaurant trade receives a considerable boost from the races.|$|E
25|$|Taxi drivers' {{interests}} {{and those of}} owners are not necessarily aligned. Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association represents owners of taxi licences, and drivers, who are most <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> not owners but who rent their vehicles on a daily basis, are represented by the Motor Transport Workers General Union. In 2013, day-time drivers would pay upwards of HK$380 for each shift, and night shift drivers would pay HK$350. Owners would dispute with drivers' groups as they seek to increase the daily rental charge each time taxi fares increased.|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas {{arise from}} arachnoidal cells, {{most of which}} are near the {{vicinity}} of the venous sinuses, and this is the site of greatest prevalence for meningioma formation. They most <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> attached to the dura over the superior parasagittal surface of frontal and parietal lobes, along the sphenoid ridge, in the olfactory grooves, the sylvian region, superior cerebellum along the falx cerebri, cerebellopontine angle, and the spinal cord. The tumor is usually gray, well-circumscribed, and takes on the form of the space it occupies. They usually are dome-shaped, with the base lying on the dura.|$|E

25|$|Viral vectors are {{generally}} genetically engineered viruses carrying modified viral DNA or RNA {{that has been}} rendered noninfectious, but still contain viral promoters and also the transgene, thus allowing for translation of the transgene through a viral promoter. However, because viral vectors <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. Viral vectors are often designed for permanent incorporation of the insert into the host genome, and thus leave distinct genetic markers in the host genome after incorporating the transgene. For example, retroviruses leave a characteristic retroviral integration pattern after insertion that is detectable and indicates that the viral vector has incorporated into the host genome.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{transportation}} by car {{is guided}} {{more by the}} government than by an invisible hand. Roads and the interstate highway system were built by local, {{state and federal governments}} and paid for by income taxes, property taxes, fuel taxes, and tolls. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is designed to offset market imbalances. Municipal parking is frequently subsidized. Emission standards regulate pollution by cars. US fuel economy standards exist but are not high enough to have effect. There is also a gas guzzler tax of limited scope. The United States offers tax credits for certain vehicles and these <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> hybrids or compressed natural gas cars (see Energy Policy Act of 2005).|$|E
25|$|Primary screwworms are primary, obligate parasites in the larval stage, and as {{a result}} are capable, unlike {{secondary}} screwworms, of initialising the penetration of the skin barrier to create an entry wound. Despite this, they are most commonly seen as colonisers of previously existing wounds, and <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> hatched from eggs laid at the perimeter of a wound. Once the infestation commences, a dark brown or reddish-brown discharge begins leaking from the wound, sometimes accompanied by an unpleasant smell as the flesh begins to decay. This is often the first sign in both livestock and human victims that something is amiss, and often initiates consultation with a professional. As the infestation increases, the victim begins to experience escalating tissue irritation, {{and in the case of}} domesticated animals, may be observed to become withdrawn, listless, and anorexic.|$|E

500|$|Zur's {{compositions}} <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> {{focused on}} full orchestras, choir and, in some games like Prince of Persia, ethnic instruments like Arabic flutes and the woodwind duduk. He has often {{collaborated with the}} Northwest Sinfonia orchestra from Seattle, though he has on occasion used other orchestras. Whenever Zur works with a real orchestra, he always conducts it himself. He has named some of his musical influences as classical artists such as Sergey Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Beethoven, movie composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, and jazz artists like George Gershwin and Henry McFeeny. While he would one day like to compose music {{not intended to be}} part of a larger piece of media, he finds that the pressure of a deadline and the feedback from the developers are crucial in his development process. He feels that his music sounds best when it is in the context given by the media it was made for, though he feels that performances of the music by itself transforms it [...] "from just a soundtrack to an art form on its own". Zur sometimes collaborates with other musicians while composing his game soundtracks; for example, he worked with Florence and the Machine to create a unique rendition of [...] "I’m Not Calling You A Liar" [...] for the Dragon Age II soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|MammalsThe {{valley and}} {{surrounding}} highlands provide {{some of the}} most southern pockets of snowshoe hare habitat. [...] Other local mammals include beavers, muskrats, raccoons, opossums, and grey and red squirrels. Seen far less <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> black bears, bobcats, coyotes, and red foxes. Of special note are large groups of white-tailed deer which can often be seen from the main roads. [...] The deer have become so conditioned to human presence that they are no longer frightened; feeding and interacting with the deer is strongly discouraged.|$|E
2500|$|This {{sculpture}} {{is fully}} three-dimensional and {{presumed to be}} intended for viewing from all sides: the rear view shows carefully sculpted shoulder blades and a slight naturalistic bulge that is visible above the belt at the hips. [...] Mary Ellen Miller finds that [...] "the long diagonal of line of the figure's back and shoulders is as beautiful and commanding as the frontal view". [...] The figure clearly is more free-flowing than other three-dimensional Olmec sculptures (than, for example, San Martin Pajapan Monument 1), which <b>frequently</b> <b>are</b> boxy and seemingly [...] "confined" [...] by the medium from which they are carved.|$|E
