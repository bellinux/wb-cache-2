25|$|A {{recent study}} {{performed}} experiments {{to determine the}} CS-GAGs present in normal uninjured cortex, {{as well as those}} present following injury and the resultant mature <b>glial</b> <b>scar.</b> The difference in CS-GAG types and amounts present between the two was then used to study the inhibitory effects of those CS-GAG types up regulated in <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> on neurite extension. The resulting analysis showed that the GAG profiles of normal cortex and <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> tissue were significantly different. <b>Glial</b> <b>scar</b> tissue demonstrated an up regulation of chondroitin-4,6-sulfate, chondroitin-2-sulfate, and chondroitin-6-sulfate. On the other hand, uninjured cortical tissue showed most of the CS-GAG to be chondroitin-4-sulfate but also some chondroitin and chondroitin-6-sulfate present.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glial</b> <b>scar</b> {{formation}} (gliosis) is a reactive cellular process involving astrogliosis {{that occurs}} after {{injury to the}} central nervous system. As with scarring in other organs and tissues, the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> is the body's mechanism to protect and begin the healing process in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> is {{composed}} of several components briefly discussed below.|$|E
5000|$|The Michelson Post-Injury <b>Glial</b> <b>Scarring</b> Initiative aims {{to promote}} the {{functional}} recovery of individuals with spinal cord injury. The initiative funds research into the control of <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> conducted at the Yale Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glial</b> <b>scars</b> {{can have}} {{detrimental}} effects to neuronal regrowth to aide in {{the restoration of}} sensory function. Astrocytes form a barrier preventing further growth by forming gap junctions along with producing molecules that chemically prevent axon extension.|$|R
50|$|GFAP {{has also}} been shown to be {{important}} in repair after CNS injury. More specifically for its role in the formation of <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> in a multitude of locations throughout the CNS including the eye and brain.|$|R
25|$|The chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycans}} phosphacan and neurocan {{have also}} been shown {{to play a role in}} <b>glial</b> <b>scar.</b> Phosphacan has been shown to have decreased levels in <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> when compared to uninjured cortex. This decrease is beneficial to nerve generation because phosphacan has been shown to inhibit neurite extension similarly to the other CSPGs discussed already. Alternatively, neurocan production is up regulated in astrocytes in <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> when compared to uninjured cortex and astrocytes in primary cell culture conditions. These elevated neurocan levels have been shown to remain elevated 30 days after the initial injury. This implicates neurocan as having a prolonged role in chronic scar.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of neurodegeneration, {{formation}} of the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> {{has been shown to}} have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Particularly, many neuro-developmental inhibitor molecules are secreted by the cells within the scar that prevent complete physical and functional recovery of the central nervous system after injury or disease. On the other hand, absence of the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> has been associated with impairments in the repair of the blood brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glial</b> <b>scar</b> {{formation}} is induced following {{damage to the}} nervous system. In the central nervous system, this <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> formation significantly inhibits nerve regeneration, {{which leads to a}} loss of function. Several families of molecules are released that promote and drive <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> formation. For instance, transforming growth factors B-1 and -2, interleukins, and cytokines {{play a role in the}} initiation of scar formation. The accumulation of reactive astrocytes at the site of injury and the up regulation of molecules that are inhibitory for neurite outgrowth contribute to the failure of neuroregeneration. The up-regulated molecules alter the composition of the extracellular matrix in a way that has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth extension. This scar formation involves several cell types and families of molecules.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{and other}} demyelinating {{diseases of the}} central nervous system (CNS) produce lesions (demyelinated areas in the CNS) and <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> or scleroses. They present different shapes and histological findings according to the underlying condition that produces them.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} can be pathologically {{defined as}} the presence of distributed <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> (sclerosis or scleroses, in its plural form) in the central nervous system that must show dissemination in time (DIT) and in space (DIS) to be considered MS lesions.|$|R
50|$|Reactive astrocytes {{may benefit}} or harm {{surrounding}} neural and non-neural cells. They undergo {{a series of}} changes that may alter astrocyte activities through gain or loss of functions lending to neural protection and repair, <b>glial</b> <b>scarring,</b> and regulation of CNS inflammation.|$|R
25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{function of}} the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> is to reestablish the physical and chemical integrity of the CNS. This is done by generating a barrier across the injured area that seals the nervous/non-nervous tissue boundary. This also allows for the regeneration of the selective barrier to prevent further microbial infections and spread of cellular damage. Moreover, the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> stimulates revascularization of blood capillaries to increase the nutritional, trophic, and metabolic support of the nervous tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> is a complex process. Several main classes of molecular mediators of gliosis have been identified and are briefly discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Interleukins {{are another}} {{potential}} family of scar-inducing cellular messengers. Particularly, interleukin-1, a protein produced by mononuclear phagocytes, helps {{to initiate the}} inflammatory response in astrocytes, leading to reactive astrogliosis {{and the formation of}} the <b>glial</b> <b>scar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The scars {{that give}} the name to the {{condition}} are produced by the astrocyte cells healing old lesions. These <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> are the remainings of previous demyelinating inflammatory lesions (encephalomyelitis disseminata) which are produced {{by one or more}} unknown underlying conditions.|$|R
25|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} can be pathologically {{defined as}} the presence of distributed <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> (or sclerosis) in the central nervous system disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). The gold standard for MS diagnosis is pathological correlation, though given its limited availability, other diagnosis methods are normally used.|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{suppression}} of <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> {{and a general}} enhancement of axonal outgrowth has now been accomplished in an adult rat model of spinal cord transection. Transplantation of a novel astrocyte cell type derived from glial-restricted precursors in vitro raise the eventual possibility of cellular therapy for spinal cord injury...|$|R
25|$|Recent {{work has}} also shown that {{olomoucine}} suppresses microglial proliferation within the <b>glial</b> <b>scar.</b> This is particularly important because microglia {{play an important role}} in the secondary damage following lesion to the CNS, during the time of scar formation. Microglial cells are activated via various pro-inflammatory cytokines (some discussed above). Rat spinal cord injury models have shown remarkable improvements after the administration of olomoucine. One hour-post administration, olomoucine suppressed microglial proliferation, as well as reduced the tissue edema normally present during the early stages of <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> formation. Further, 24 hours post-administration, a reduction in concentration of interleukin-1β was observed. Additionally, the administration of olomoucine has also been shown to decrease neuronal cell death.|$|E
25|$|Plaques in {{the white}} matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better {{preserved}} in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply.|$|E
25|$|Like the chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycan}}s, keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) {{production is}} up regulated in reactive astrocytes {{as part of}} <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> formation. KSPGs have {{also been shown to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting nerve regeneration. Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited.|$|E
40|$|Brains from male {{cases with}} {{dyslexia}} show symmetry of the planum temporale and predominantly left-sided cere-brocortical microdysgenesis. We now report on three women with dyslexia. In all brains, the planum temporale was again symmetrical. Also, {{in two of}} the brains, multiple foci of cerebrocortical <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> were present. In both women, many of the scars were myelinated, suggesting origination during late intrauterine or early postnatal life. In one, scars were mainly left perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal cortex. Inthe other, scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically. All three cases showed to a variable extent brain warts, molecular layer ectopias, andfocal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases. Two women had primary brain neoplasms, an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade astroqtoma, respectively, and two women showed small angiomas. Reexamina-tion of previously reported male cases disclosed one with myelinated <b>glial</b> <b>scars.</b> Two control brains with asymmetrical plana temporale showed myelinated <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> as well. The significance of the anatomical findings is discussed, and possible etiological factors are considered with known effects of autoimmune diseases on the nervous system.

5000|$|Injection of {{ethidium bromide}} kills all CNS glia (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes), but leaves axons, blood vessels, and macrophages unaffected. [...] This {{provides}} an environment conducive to axonal regeneration {{for about four}} days. After four days, CNS glia reinvade the area of injection and axonal regeneration is consequently inhibited. This method {{has been shown to}} reduce <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> following CNS trauma.|$|R
25|$|Phosphodiesterase 4 is {{a member}} of the {{phosphodiesterase}} family of proteins that cleave phosphodiester bonds. This is an important step in degrading cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a major intracellular signaling molecule; conversely, blocking PDE4 will increase cAMP. Increased intracellular cAMP levels in neurons has been previously shown to induce axonal growth. In 2004, Nikulina et al. showed that administration of rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor, can increase cAMP levels in neurons after spinal cord injury. This is partially possible because rolipram is sufficiently small to pass through the blood–brain barrier and immediately begin to catalyze reactions in neurons. 10 day administration of rolipram in spinal cord injured rodents resulted in considerable axonal growth associated with a reduction in <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> at 2 weeks post-injury. The mechanism for this reduction in <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> is currently unknown, but possible mechanisms include axonal extensions that physically prevent reactive astrocytes from proliferating, as well as chemical signaling events to reduce reactive astrogliosis.|$|R
25|$|The {{cytokine}} {{family of}} <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> inducers include interferon-γ (IFNγ) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). IFNγ {{has been shown}} to induce astrocyte proliferation and increase the extent of glial scarring in injured brain models. Further, FGF2 production increases after injury to the brain and spinal cord. FGF2 has also been shown to increase astrocyte proliferation in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) is a cytosolic protein {{that is not}} secreted. CNTF {{has been shown to}} promote the survival of neuronal cultures in vitro, and it can also act as a differentiator and trophic factor on glial cells. Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the <b>glial</b> <b>scar.</b> It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> formation following CNS damage.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.|$|E
40|$|In drug delivery, microneedles offer many unique {{characteristics}} which {{can improve the}} delivery of drugs into delicate tissues and tissue systems. These needles can be fabricated {{from a variety of}} materials including metals, ceramics, and polymers. This project aims to demonstrate a carbon nanotube based microneedle is also possible. By growing vertically aligned carbon nanotubes around a pore, these new microneedles can significantly decrease the diameter of needles used for drug delivery into delicate tissue. Needle diameter is an important factor for drug delivery into delicate tissues such as the central nervous system due to the body's natural healing reponse, <b>glial</b> <b>scarring.</b> By significantly decreasing the needle size from millimeters to nanometers, the amount and size of <b>glial</b> <b>scarring</b> can be reduced and therefore improve drug delivery. Although no complete samples were successfully fabricated in this study, much knowledge and insight was gained on the process for CNT-based microneedle fabrication. W.

50|$|There are {{multiple}} disorders associated with improper GFAP regulation, and injury can cause glial cells to react in detrimental ways. <b>Glial</b> <b>scarring</b> {{is a consequence}} of several neurodegenerative conditions, as well as injury that severs neural material. The scar is formed by astrocytes interacting with fibrous tissue to re-establish the glial margins around the central injury core and is partially caused by up-regulation of GFAP.|$|R
25|$|Nervous system repair: Upon {{injury to}} nerve cells within {{the central nervous}} system, astrocytes fill up the space to form a <b>glial</b> <b>scar,</b> and may {{contribute}} to neural repair. The role of astrocytes in CNS regeneration following injury is not well understood though. The <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> has traditionally been described as an impermeable barrier to regeneration, thus implicating a negative role in axon regeneration. However, recently, it was found through genetic ablation studies that astrocytes are actually required for regeneration to occur. Even more exciting, these authors found that the astrocyte scar is actually essential for stimulated axons (that axons that have been coaxed to grow via neurotrophic supplementation) to extend through the injured spinal cord. Interestingly, astrocytes that have been pushed into a reactive phenotype (termed astrogliosis, defined by upregulation of GFAP expression, a definition still under debate) may actually be toxic to neurons, releasing signals that can kill neurons. Much work, however, remains to elucidate their role in nervous system injury.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glial</b> <b>scar</b> also {{prevents}} neuronal regrowth. Following {{trauma to}} the CNS, axons begin to sprout and attempt to extend across the injury site in order to repair the damaged regions. However, the scar prevents axonal extensions via physical and chemical means. Astrocytes form a dense network of gap junctions that generates a physical barrier to axonal regrowth. Further, the astrocytes secrete several growth-inhibitory molecules that chemically prevent axonal extensions. Moreover, the basal membrane component is expected to generate an additional physical and chemical barrier to axonal extensions.|$|E
25|$|Multiple system atrophy can be {{explained}} as cell loss and gliosis or a proliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the central nervous system. This damage forms a scar which is then termed a <b>glial</b> <b>scar.</b> The presence of these inclusions (also known as Papp-Lantos bodies) in the movement, balance, and autonomic-control centres of the brain are the defining histopathologic hallmark of MSA. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the major filamentous component of glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions is alpha-synuclein. Mutations in this substance may play a role in the disease.|$|E
25|$|Two neuronally-important subclasses of {{transforming}} growth factor family of molecules are TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-2 that directly stimulate astrocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages. TGFβ-1 {{has been observed}} to increase immediately after injury to the central nervous system, whereas TGFβ-2 expression occurs more slowly near the injury site. Further, TGFβ-2 {{has been shown to}} stimulate growth-inhibitory proteoglycans by astrocytes. Experimental reduction of TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-2 has been shown to partially reduce <b>glial</b> <b>scarring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Astrocytes {{have also}} been implicated in {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS). Astrocytes are responsible for demyelination {{and the destruction of}} oligodendrocytes that is associated with the disease. This demyelinating effect {{is a result of the}} secretion of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) from activated astrocyte cells onto neighboring neurons. Astrocytes that remain in an activated state form <b>glial</b> <b>scars</b> that also prevent the re-myelination of neurons, as they are a physical impediment to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs).|$|R
40|$|The {{pathology}} {{of multiple}} sclerosis (MS) was defined {{more than a}} century ago as a chronic inflammatory process which is associated with widespread primary demyelination and <b>glial</b> <b>scarring.</b> In this short review we discuss controversial issues on (i) the relationship between inflammation and demyelination, (ii) the various possible mechanisms of myelin destruction, and (iii) axonal involvement in this disease.
