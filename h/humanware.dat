That is, "Regular"is defined the users once or more a week, and "Non Regular" is defined the users less than once a week. So, we compare, and consider the difference of both. The findings in this study can be summarized as follows : 1) We compare the ratio of "Regular" and that of "Non Regular" by a cross-table. The former is larger than the latter in men, middle-aged, older, housewives, persons without any job, and people going to classical music concerts, art galleries or museums. 2) We compare the degree of satisfaction of "Regular" and that of "Non Regular". The degree of total satisfaction of "Regular" is larger than that of "Non Regular". The degree of satisfaction with the hardware of "Regular" is as large as that of "Non Regular". The degree of satisfaction with the software of "Regular" is larger than that of "Non Regular".

Then the WBAN {{is used for}} monitoring biometrics and movements of human body. Keeping in mind the resource constrained devices, WBANs are treated just like wireless sensor networks when considering a solution for key management. However, WBANs differ from traditional wireless sensor networks in scale, topology and security requirements. Also, the WBANs can also use random values from biometric measurements for the generation of keys. These differences render the key management schemes of WSNs inefficient and overly complex for WBANs scenario.

In this study, firm’s technological capability is determined completely with four components (T – Technoware, H – <b>Humanware,</b> I – Inforware, O- Orgaware) and their criteria using Technology Atlas method, which was developed by Asian and Pacific Center for Technology Transfer. The contribution degrees toward technological capability of each component and criteria in specific industry are determined efficiently rely on fuzzy-AHP. Besides, aggregation of group judgment using a new technique with triangular intuition fuzzy number (IFN) representation makes the decisions more accuracy and efficiency. Our proposed model helps the firm’s managers can easily evaluate their current technological capability keep track of their technological growth, compares with the industrial level and guides to the technological renovation strategy which is one factor to raise competitive advantage. Index Terms—technological capability assessment, group aggregation, analytic hierarchy process, intuitionistic fuzzy. I...|$|E
