40|$|Sensory {{analysis}} of honey {{may be used}} as a complement to physico-chemical and pollen analyses. It is used to confirm quality, verify the absence of defects, evaluate the conformity to established sensory profiles of unifloral honeys and also to understand consumer preferences. This paper will present a guide to sensory analysis methods for assessing the organoleptic properties of honey and the general procedures required to evaluate them. The standards for honey sensory analysis were developed in reference to specific scientific articles or ISO standards. General requirements for tasting procedures are defined by controlled experimental protocols regarding the design of test booths and best prac- tice for storage, preparation and presentation of honey samples. The assessors should be selected and trained for each method. They must follow the tasting procedures and rules when evaluating and reporting the visual, olfactory, olfac- tory-gustatory and tactile characteristics of honey (including their intensity) and confirm the absence of defects. Two methods for descriptive analysis are reported: the semi-quantitative method which uses detailed descriptors for visual, odor and flavor, and the profile method which employs twelve descriptors related to the botanical origin and whose intensity is scored using a horizontal line scale of 10 cm. Assessment of conformity evaluates a honey’s conformity to the botanical origin and the absence of defects.

40|$|Glucose and {{fructose}} are {{the most}} important monosaccharides in honey, these sugars combined in various forms comprise the di- and trisaccharide fractions of <b>floral</b> <b>honey.</b> Frutose/glucose ratio can influence the flavor of honey since fructose is sweeter than glucose. Honeys with higher fructose/glucose ratios remain liquid for longer periods. Several Chromatographic methods have been used to evaluate the sugar content of honey, although the Integrated Pulsed Amperometric Detection (IPAD) only recently became to be used. In order to characterize the sugar content in honey from different botanical origins a Dionex ICS 3000 ion chromatograph was used. Separation was performed in a column “CarboPacTM PA 20 3 x 150 mm”, with a precolumn “CarboPacTM PA 20 3 x 30 mm”. Electrochemical detector in Integrated Pulsed Amperometric Detection (IPAD) mode was used. The elution was performed with a gradient with two NaOH solutions (10 and 200 mM). Standard solutions of glucose, fructose and sucrose, were used to identify and quantify the individual sugar components in the honey samples. The method showed a good separation between the compounds (resolution> 3. 3 and more than 9000 theoretical plates). The response was linear in the range (0. 05 to 1. 00 mg/L for fructose and glucose and 0. 01 to 0. 20 mg/L for sucrose). The detection limits were 0. 014 mg/L for glucose, 0. 007 mg/L for fructose and 0. 003 mg/L for sucrose.

The report is extended to study its effect on various aspects of GAS (morphology, virulence, aggregation) at its minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (132 μg/ml). 3 FCA was found to alter the growth pattern of GAS in solid and liquid medium and increased the rate of auto-aggregation. Electron microscopy unveiled the increase in extra polymeric substances around cell. Gene expression studies showed down-regulation of covR gene, which is speculated to be the prime target for the antibiofilm activity. Increased hyaluronic acid production and down regulation of srtB gene is attributed to the enhanced rate of auto-aggregation. The virulence genes (srv, mga, luxS and hasA) were also found to be over expressed, which was manifested with the increased susceptibility of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to 3 FCA treated GAS. The toxicity of 3 FCA was ruled out with no adverse effect on C. elegans. Though 3 FCA possess antibiofilm activity against GAS, it was also found to increase the virulence of GAS. This study demonstrates that, covR mediated antibiofilm activity may increase the virulence of GAS.

We have calculated the basic statistics such as the mean and standard deviation for each sample. Samples have been evaluated according to the Council Directive 2001 / 110 /EC, which lays down limit values for the parameters of honey. Only four out of 21 honey samples complied with the requirements of Council Directive 2001 / 110 /EC. These were three samples obtained from the regular shopping network and one obtained directly from the local beekeeper. Six samples did not meet the requirements for the sum of fructose and glucose, two samples could not be determined due to the failure to specify the honey type, and fourteen samples failed the requirement of sucrose content. We have further assessed whether honey samples comply with legislative requirements relating to this product or consumer misleading practices take place. Our analysed samples often lacked indication whether it is a <b>floral</b> <b>honey</b> or honeydew honey; this information was missing in eight out of 21 samples. Samples 5 and 9 did not mention the name of manufacturer. Sample 10 did not mention the country of origin...|$|E
40|$|O mel é um produto natural de abelhas fabricado a partir do néctar das flores (mel floral) e de secreções de partes vivas das plantas, ou de excreções de insetos sugadores de partes vivas das plantas (mel de melato). O melato é uma fonte alternativa de alimento bastante utilizada pela abelha. Em Santa Catarina, o mel de melato é muito conhecido, sendo produzido nos meses {{de janeiro}} a abril, em ciclos bianuais. Foram colhidas aleatoriamente 25 amostras de mel, no período de janeiro/ 93 a junho/ 96, de diferentes apiários e datas de colheita. Foram determinados os teores de umidade, pH, cinzas e açúcares redutores. Os resultados foram utilizados na aplicação da equação de Kirkwood para classificar o mel como floral ou de melato. As amostras também foram analisadas quanto à rotação óptica para classificação de acordo com White. Das 25 amostras analisadas, 11 foram classificadas como mel de melato de acordo com Kirkwood e White. O estudo estatístico, feito pela aplicação do teste exato de Fisher, indicou que, apesar da divergência em 4 amostras, estes métodos são equivalentes e ambos podem ser usados. Honey {{is a natural}} product made by bees using flower's nectar (<b>floral</b> <b>honey)</b> or {{excretion}} of alive parts of plants or either excretion produced by sucking insects from alive parts of plants (honeydew honey). Honeydew is an alternative food source used by bees. In Santa Catarina state, honeydew honey is produced from january to april, each two years. In order to identify the presence of honeydew honey, 25 samples were sampled randomly from january/ 93 to june/ 96. They were colected from different apiaries in different periods of time and tested for moisture, pH, ash, reducing sugars, {{and the results were}} used in the application of Kirkwood equation to classify honey as floral or honeydew. They were analised for polarimetry, to classify them according to Kirkwood and White. The statistical study was done by the application of exact test of Fisher and, in spite of some divergences found to classify 4 samples, the statistical study showed correlation between Kirkwood and White methods, indicating that both can be used...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on biologically active {{compounds}} determination. 26 samples of honey, one sample of propolis and one sample of royal jelly were analyzed. Honey were harvested in year 2006 and 2007 and bought in retail chain, special shops and directly from bee-keeper. Samples were analyzed by titration, spectrofotometry, LC/MS and RP-HPLC methods. The study {{was focused on}} analysis of antioxidants. Followed groups of antioxidants were determined: flavonoids, catechins, carotenoids, vitamins E, C, A. Authenticity of quality was determined by hydroxymethylfurfural analysis. Average values of total antioxidant capacity ranged (12. 75 - 137. 49) mmol. 100 g- 1. Average values of total phenolic ranged (8. 51 - 61. 34) mg. 100 g- 1 and average values of total flavonoids ranged (0. 75 - 6. 04) mg. 100 g- 1. Honey samples contained (41. 83 - 585. 10) g. 100 g- 1 of rutin, (9. 30 - 313. 40) g. 100 g- 1 of myricetin, (6. 5 - 171. 90) g. 100 g- 1 of luteolin, (3. 19 - 436. 37) g. 100 g- 1 of quercetin, (2. 10 - 242. 66) g. 100 g- 1 of apigenin, (0. 15 - 105. 12) g. 100 g- 1 of caempferol and (0. 07 - 17. 52) mg. 100 g- 1 of naringenin. From group of catechins there were measured (5. 98 - 310) g. 100 g- 1 of catechin, (17. 77 - 486. 29) g. 100 g- 1 of epicatechin, (0. 18 - 64. 90) g. 100 g- 1 of catechin gallate and (0. 59 - 140. 56) g. 100 g- 1 of epicatechin gallate. From lipophilic compounds the most abundant in honey samples was tocopherol, its value ranged (29. 20 - 8531. 17) g. 100 g- 1. Content of ascorbic acid ranged (0. 65 - 4. 65) mg. 100 g- 1. Content of hydroxymethyl. furfural. ranged (0. 26 - 4. 06) mg. 100 g- 1. By LC/MS method luteolin, naringenin, protocatechin acid, coffee acid and p-cumaric acid in honeydew were detected and, furthermore, kyanidin and pinocembrin in <b>floral</b> <b>honey</b> were found. Mono-floral honey contained biologically active compounds the most, imperceptibly less contained multi-floral honey and honeydew honey.

40|$|Botanical {{origin of}} the nectar {{predominantly}} affects the chemical composition of honey. Analytical techniques used for reliable honey authentication are mostly time consuming and expensive. Additionally, they cannot provide 100 % efficiency in accurate authentication. Therefore, alternatives for the determination of <b>floral</b> origin of <b>honey</b> need to be developed. This study aims to discriminate characteristic Anatolian honey samples from different botanical origins based on the differences in their molecular content, rather than giving numerical information about the constituents of samples. Another scope {{of the study is}} to differentiate inauthentic honey samples from the natural ones precisely. All samples were tested via unsupervised pattern recognition procedures like hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Discrimination of sample groups was achieved successfully with hierarchical clustering over the spectral range of 1800 - 750 cm- 1 which suggests a good predictive capability of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometry for the determination of <b>honey</b> <b>floral</b> source.
