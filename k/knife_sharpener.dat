5000|$|Later that day, Elmer {{returns to}} his house (hitching a ride in a truck from the Duluth Van and Storage Co.). Daffy greets Elmer {{at the front door}} and welcomes him to his new future-antic push button home. Elmer sees that his house is {{different}} and asks Daffy what he's done, but Daffy quickly pushes a button and a machine removes Elmer's hat and coat. Daffy then guides Elmer to a massaging chair. Elmer likes it at first, but Daffy pushes a button and Elmer receives an aggressive massage, which dazes him. The chair then automatically puts a cigar in Elmer's mouth and lights it, but the smoke activates a robot fire extinguisher from another room which douses Elmer with a bucket of water.

By the time Oscar was 48 he had become skilled as a poacher, hunter, angler, trapper, wood-cutter, beer maker and edible plant harvester.

5000|$|Spyderco {{was founded}} by Sal Glesser. (The name Spyderco was named after Sal noticed that many high {{performance}} sports cars had 'Spyder' in the name, this in turn created the name Spyderco to signify high performance cutting tools.) The first product Spyderco produced was the Portable Hand in 1976, this [...] "spider-shaped device", {{was a series of}} angles, ball joints and alligator clips that helped people such as jewelers and hobbyists to work with small parts. Spyderco's Founder, Sal Glesser, and his wife Gail, converted an old bread delivery truck into a motor-home and traveled to shows. As they became more successful, they graduated from the bread truck to a truck and trailer. They settled in Golden in November 1978. Spyderco began producing <b>knife</b> <b>sharpeners</b> in 1978 and produced their first folding knife, the C01 Worker, in 1981.

50|$|Diamond stones can {{be useful}} in the {{sharpening}} process. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance known and as such can be used to sharpen almost any material. (Coarse diamond sharpening stones can be used for flattening waterstones.) Alternatively, tungsten carbide blades can be used in knife sharpening. Clamp-style sharpening tools use a clamp with several holes with predefined angles. The stone is mounted on a rod and is pulled through these holes, so that the angle remains consistent. Another system is the crock stick setup, where two sticks are put into a plastic or wooden base to form a V shape. When the knife is pulled up the V, the angle is held so long as the blade is held perpendicular to the base. Several cutlery manufacturers now offer electric <b>knife</b> <b>sharpeners</b> with multiple stages with at least one grinding stage. These electric sharpeners are typically used in the kitchen but have the ability to sharpen blades such as pocket or tactical knives. The main benefit of using an electric sharpener is speed with many models that can complete the sharpening process in one to two minutes.

500|$|Hans Hendricksz Bouwer was {{the first}} to list [...] "dodos", most likely {{referring}} to the Rodrigues solitaire, as part of the fauna of Rodrigues in 1601. Sir Thomas Herbert mentioned [...] "dodos" [...] on Rodrigues again in 1634, and they were also mentioned in 1700. The next account, which {{was the first}} referring to the bird as the [...] "solitaire", was published in François Leguat's 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to the East Indies. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees, who were the first to colonise the island from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain. His description of the Rodrigues solitaire and its behaviour is the most detailed account of the bird in life, and he also described other species that are now extinct. Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild. He later left for Mauritius, but was too late to observe dodos there. The Huguenots praised the Rodrigues solitaires for their flavour, especially that of the young, and used their gizzard stones as <b>knife</b> <b>sharpeners.</b> D'Héguerty later claimed these were also useful in medicine, and referred to them as bezoars. The second most detailed description of the bird was found in an anonymous document rediscovered in 1874 called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue, which has been attributed to Julien Tafforet, a mariner marooned on Rodrigues in 1726. His observations are considered credible, though it is known he had a copy of Leguat's memoirs with him during his stay.|$|R
