40|$|Many {{real world}} {{problems}} have a structure where small problem instances are embedded within large problem instances, or where solution quality for large problem instances is loosely correlated {{to that of}} small problem instances. This structure can be exploited because smaller problem instances typically have smaller search spaces and are cheaper to evaluate. We present an evolutionary algorithm, <b>INCREA,</b> {{which is designed to}} incrementally solve a large, noisy, computationally expensive problem by deriving its initial population through recursively running itself on problem instances of smaller sizes. The <b>INCREA</b> algorithm also expands and shrinks its population each generation and cuts off work that doesn’t appear to promise a fruitful result. For further efficiency, it addresses noisy solution quality efficiently by focusing on resolving it for small, potentially reusable solutions which have a much lower cost of evaluation. We compare <b>INCREA</b> to a general purpose evolutionary algorithm and find that in most cases <b>INCREA</b> arrives at the same solution in significantly less time...|$|R

40|$|PetaBricks [4, 21, 7, 3, 5] is an implicitly {{parallel}} programming language which, {{through the process}} of autotuning, can automatically optimize programs for fast QoS-aware execution on any hardware. In this thesis we develop and evaluate two PetaBricks autotuners: <b>INCREA</b> and SiblingRivalry. <b>INCREA,</b> based on a novel bottom-up evolutionary algorithm, optimizes programs offline at compile time. SiblingRivalry improves on <b>INCREA</b> by optimizing online during a program's execution, dynamically adapting to changes in hardware and the operating system. Continuous adaptation is achieved through racing, where half of available resources are devoted to always-on learning. We evaluate <b>INCREA</b> and SiblingRivalry on a large number of real-world benchmarks, and show that our autotuners can significantly speed up PetaBricks programs with respect to many non-tuned and mis-tuned baselines. Our results indicate the need for a continuous learning loop that can optimize efficiently by exploiting online knowledge of a program's performance. The results leave open {{the question of how to}} solve the online optimization problem on all cores, i. e. without racing. by Maciej Pacula. Thesis (M. Eng.)

50|$|Historically, {{the land}} now {{occupied}} by the park, which had been used for agriculture and as a quarry, belonged to a farmhouse called Cascina <b>Increa.</b> This <b>Increa</b> farm still exists, close to the park, and is a rare surviving example of rural architecture during the Renaissance. Beginning in 1960, aggregates were extracted from the quarry. The first attempts to share this land began between 1985 and 1987, when the land was bought by the Brugherio Commune. The park opened in 1994, and since then there have been over twenty years of improvements that transformed it into an urban park.|$|R
