25|$|Multiple-word {{descriptive}} identifiers with embedded spaces such as <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> or char table {{cannot be}} used in most programming languages because the spaces between the words would be parsed as delimiters between tokens. The alternative of running the words together as in endoffile or chartable is difficult to understand and possibly misleading; for example, chartable is an English word (able to be charted).|$|E
25|$|The name of {{the file}} system {{originates}} from the file system's prominent usage of an index table, the File Allocation Table, statically allocated {{at the time of}} formatting. The table contains entries for each cluster, a contiguous area of disk storage. Each entry contains either the number of the next cluster in the file, or else a marker indicating <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file,</b> unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk. The root directory of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory; the operating system can then traverse the FAT table, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a cluster chain {{until the end of the}} file is reached. In much the same way, sub-directories are implemented as special files containing the directory entries of their respective files.|$|E
50|$|EOM {{is similar}} in concept to the EOF, or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file.</b> The EOF is placed {{at the end of}} a file to signify to the user where the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> is.|$|E

5000|$|Note: If {{you have}} {{previously}} got an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> on the stream, [...] will not reset it but will return {{an error in}} many implementations.- use the [...] method to clear the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> bit first. This is a relatively common mistake and if [...] is not performing as expected, {{it is wise to}} clear the fail bit, as shown below.|$|E

50|$|Moving {{inside the}} editor {{can be done}} using the {{keyboard}} by using the arrow keys. Keys such as Page Up, or Page Down, scroll the text up or down (towards the beginning or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>file,</b> respectively). The commands CTRL-W CTRL-Y, and CTRL-W CTRL-V move the cursor to the beginning or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>file</b> respectively, while the commands CTRL-A and CTRL-E move the cursor to {{the beginning and the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the line that the cursor is located on.|$|R

50|$|QCP files {{have the}} same {{signature}} as RIFF files: A SOF (start of file) header of 52494646 ("RIFF"), and an EOF (<b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file)</b> of 0000.|$|E
5000|$|While {{no longer}} {{technically}} required {{to indicate the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>file,</b> many text editors and program languages still support this convention, or can be configured to insert this character at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>file</b> when editing, or at least properly cope with them in text files. In such cases, it is often termed a [...] "soft" [...] EOF, as {{it does not necessarily}} represent the physical <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>file,</b> but is more a marker indicating that [...] "there is no useful data beyond this point". In reality, more data may exist beyond this character up to the actual <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the data in the file system, thus {{it can be used to}} hide file content when the file is entered at the console or opened in editors. Many file format standards (e.g. PNG or GIF) include the SUB character in their headers to perform precisely this function. Some modern text file formats (e.g. CSV-1203) still recommend a trailing EOF character to be appended as the last character in the file. However, typing [...] does not embed an EOF character into a file in either MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows, nor do the APIs of those systems use the character to denote the actual <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>file.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the heading}} <b>of</b> a source <b>file,</b> the keyword [...] {{is used instead}} of [...] At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>file,</b> the {{functions}} to be exported are listed in [...] clause.|$|R

50|$|In {{the above}} example, TEX would process the /mycat/mypgm file {{searching for the}} !hello label(*). TEX would {{continue}} processing the file until a return statement or exit statement was executed or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> was reached.|$|E
50|$|Explicit {{concatenation}} allows FDnames to {{be connected}} using a plus-sign, as NAMEA+NAMEB. In this case MTS transparently returns the contents of NAMEA followed by the contents of NAMEB or writes to NAMEB after writing to NAMEA reaches an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> or other error condition.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} example, TEX would process the /mycat/mypgm file {{searching for the}} !hello2 label(*). TEX would {{continue}} processing until an exit statement or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> was reached. An error would be thrown if a return statement was executed {{and there were no}} CALLs active.|$|E

50|$|An EOT {{is often}} used to {{initiate}} other functions, such as releasing circuits, disconnecting terminals, or placing receive terminals in a standby condition. Its most common use today is to cause a Unix terminal driver to signal <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> and thus exit programs that are awaiting input.|$|E
50|$|SYS$COMMAND - Does {{not have}} a direct {{analogue}} in the Unix model. Used interactively, it will read from the terminal. Used in a batch file when run interactively, it will read from the terminal. Used in a batch file run noninteractively, it will read from the SYS$INPUT stream (if one is defined), otherwise it will read nothing and return <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When the read (...) command fails, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> for instance, {{the failure}} {{will be passed}} up the chain, and write (...) will fail as well. The while, being a control structure, stops on failure, meaning it stops when the file is empty. For comparison, {{consider}} a similar example written in pseudocode (using syntax close to C++ and derived languages such as Java): ...|$|E
5000|$|EXIT (DR DOS 6.0 {{and higher}} only) : Finishes CONFIG.SYS {{processing}} before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>file</b> {{has been reached}} (except for SWITCHES and SHELL directive processing under some conditions).|$|R
5000|$|If proper XML {{validation}} {{is not an}} issue, and a file {{contains only}} PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing (...) tag at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>file.</b>|$|R
