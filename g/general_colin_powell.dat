25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1993 Aspin began to tell the White House that the five-year Defense budget, {{reflecting}} {{the results of the}} bottom-up review, would exceed the more than $1 trillion projected by the Clinton administration. In December 1993 he put the anticipated shortfall at no less than $50 billion, the consequence of inaccurate inflation estimates, a military pay raise, and failure to account for other Pentagon costs, including peacekeeping operations. The size of the force needed to meet the two regional wars scenario contributed to the projected budget shortfall. Furthermore, Aspin was on record as favoring the use of U.S. troops in regional conflicts, as opposed to other decisionmakers, including <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell,</b> chairman of the JCS. Aspin's departure from office early in 1994 left further decisions on the Defense budget to his successor. The final FY 1994 budget amounted to a little under $252 billion in total obligational authority.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failed}} August 1991 coup attempt in Russia, defense specialists {{identified}} {{the need for}} an institution such as the Marshall Center. The United States European Command (EUCOM) began to develop proposals to expand defense and security contacts with the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia in order to positively influence the development of security structures appropriate for democratic states. In February 1992, a proposal was submitted to then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> to use the facilities of the former U.S. Army Russia Institute (USARI) to create a European center for security studies in order to rapidly develop opportunities to work with European and Eurasian defense establishments. He endorsed the plan on March 17, 1992. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz approved the proposal that summer, and the staffs began developing a charter for the proposed center.|$|E

500|$|Although New Jersey {{performed}} her job expertly {{during the}} intervention in Lebanon some {{have criticized the}} decision to have New Jersey shell Druze and Syrian forces. Members of this camp allege that this action forced {{a shift in the}} previously neutral U.S. forces by convincing local Lebanese Muslims that the United States had taken the Christian side; New Jerseys shells had killed hundreds of people, mostly Shiites and Druze. In his memoir, <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> (at the time an assistant to Caspar Weinberger) noted that [...] "When the shells started falling on the Shiites, they assumed the American ‘referee’ had taken sides." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, and I thought it was my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E
500|$|Commonwealth {{citizens}} not {{subjects of}} the Queen and foreigners may be made Honorary Members. Queen Elizabeth II has established the custom of awarding an honorary GCB to visiting heads of state, for example Gustav Heinemann, and Josip Broz Tito (in 1972), Ronald Reagan (in 1989), Lech Wałęsa (in 1991), Censu Tabone, President of Malta, in 1992, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, George H.

Turkish President Abdullah Gül, Slovenian President Dr Danilo Türk Mexican President Felipe Calderón, and South African President Jacob Zuma. Foreign generals are also often given honorary appointments to the Order, for example: Marshal Ferdinand Foch and Marshal Joseph Joffre during World War I; Marshal Georgy Zhukov, King Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and General Douglas MacArthur during World War II; and General Norman Schwarzkopf and <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> after the Gulf War. A more controversial member of the Order was Robert Mugabe, whose honour was stripped by the Queen, {{on the advice of}} the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, on 25 June 2008 [...] "as a mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights and abject disregard for the democratic process in Zimbabwe over which President Mugabe has presided." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially, Operation Desert Shield {{involved}} a sea interdiction campaign that saw international warships detaining and inspecting tankers from Iraq. As the buildup continued, Schwarzkopf was occupied with planning an offensive operation against the Iraqi units along the border, sometimes working 18-hour days in planning, assisted by a close group of aides. He frequently met with subordinates and Saudi commanders. Schwarzkopf planned counters both for Iraq's large armored forces and air forces, {{as well as}} its elite Republican Guard forces. While planning, Schwarzkopf remained in frequent contact with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> (both Vietnam veterans) concerning Schwarzkopf's plans for the offensive. Schwarzkopf devised an operational plan, dubbed [...] "Operation Desert Storm," [...] to be based on overwhelming force and strong infantry attacks supported by artillery and armor. It incorporated the desert warfare strategies used by British commander Bernard Montgomery in his defeat of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel at the Second Battle of El Alamein in World War II. By November 8, Bush agreed to commit 400,000 U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia at Schwarzkopf's insistence. Schwarzkopf believed larger numbers of troops would reduce the likelihood of high casualties. He planned a strategic bombing campaign to precede an offensive into Kuwait, simultaneously striking the forward Iraqi forces and their supply lines. In the meantime, diplomatic solutions began to break down, and the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, January 15, 1991, passed without a solution.|$|E

[...] Following this theme, Saturday Night Live performed a sketch in which Darrell Hammond reprised his role as Trump, holding a press conference announcing Millionaire winner John Carpenter as his running mate. [...] Soon thereafter, the actual Trump floated possible running mates and members of his presidential cabinet during a November 28 episode of Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer. He identified Senator John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, as a possible Secretary of Defense. [...] Trump said he would consider Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and mentioned retired <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> as a possible Secretary of State. [...] He praised General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and discussed him as either Secretary of Treasury or running mate. [...] He again mentioned Oprah Winfrey as a possible running mate. [...] During the interview, Trump expressed his willingness to spend $100 million to self-finance a full-scale campaign. [...] The Reform Party scheduled a debate of the candidates seeking the presidential nomination on December 3 in Portland, Oregon.

Similarly, during the Second Boer War of 1899–1902, the British army under Lord Kitchener systematically destroyed Boer farms and homesteads in order to prevent Boer guerrillas from obtaining food and supplies, and to demoralize them by leaving their women and children homeless and starving in the open.
