5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance <b>deferral</b> for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deferrals</b> are the {{consequence}} of the revenue recognition principle which dictates that revenues be recognized in {{the period in which}} they occur, and the matching principle which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. <b>Deferrals</b> are the result of cash flows occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under accrual accounting. As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either liabilities or assets. Because of the similarity between <b>deferrals</b> and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.|$|R

5|$|Watford's weak {{financial}} position was exposed in 2002–03, following {{the collapse of}} ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage <b>deferral</b> helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw {{a large number of}} players released that summer. After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford's league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005. His successor, Aidy Boothroyd, led the club to Championship survival.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's <b>deferral</b> in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was interpreted as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Never Let Me Go {{was given}} a {{production}} budget of US$15 million. Principal photography for the film started in April 2009 and lasted a few weeks. Production design was done by Mark Digby, and Adam Kimmel was assigned to cinematography. The commercial director was Duncan Reid, who works for Ingenious Media, and the film was shot by crewmembers of the English company DNA Films. On 8 May 2009, the production moved to Norfolk for filming. The beach at Holkham is also featured in the film. Knightley previously shot scenes at nearby Holkham Hall for her 2008 film The Duchess. A location on Hill Road In Clevedon was used, and a shop was converted into a travel agency. They also filmed {{on the beach and}} the Victorian pier in Clevedon. The pier is featured on the film poster and the cover of the rereleased book. A large property on the Bexhill-on-Sea seafront was used on 12 and 13 May 2009 to act as the exterior for the residence of Madame, where Tommy and Kathy go to apply for a <b>deferral.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the tax on}} {{interest}} income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, {{in some cases the}} benefit derived from tax <b>deferral</b> may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.|$|E

40|$|I {{investigate}} whether implementing SOP 97 - 2, the revenue-recognition {{standard for the}} software industry, reduces earnings informativeness. This standard is particularly important for two reasons: First, its provisions coincide with provisions of SAB 101, the current general revenue-recognition standard. Second, the software industry provides a laboratory setting for examining multiple-element firms, whose revenue-recognition challenges keep mounting {{as more and more}} firms bundle multiple products and services. I find that implementing SOP 97 - 2 leads to additional revenue <b>deferrals</b> and a decline in earnings informativeness. However, the market prices these <b>deferrals</b> as revenues, as if these amounts had not been deferred. Moreover, the proforma earnings, which I calculate by undoing the revenue <b>deferrals,</b> more strongly correspond with market returns than do the reported earnings. My findings indicate that the accounting numbers calculated using the pre-SOP 97 - 2 revenue-recognition rules more strongly correspond with market returns than do those calculated using SOP 97 - 2. My findings should interest FASB in its project on developing a new revenue-recognition standard...|$|R
