5|$|Development of Igor quickly ceased once it {{was named}} as a nearby {{disturbance}} produced moderate wind shear over the storm, displacing convection from <b>its</b> <b>center.</b> Embedded within a monsoon trough over the eastern Atlantic, the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on September9. Intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of Igor; it would remain so throughout {{the remainder of the}} cyclone's existence. Contrary to its earlier movement, the storm's forward motion markedly increased. Following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around <b>its</b> <b>center,</b> Igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection near <b>its</b> <b>center,</b> though its main area of convection and clouds extended to its north. Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening {{trend in the}} far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east of}} Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off <b>its</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} hierarchical clustering algorithms {{for land}} cover mapping problem using multi-spectral satellite images. In unsupervised techniques, the automatic generation of number of clusters and <b>its</b> <b>centers</b> {{for a huge}} database is not exploited to their full potential. Hence, a hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses splitting and merging techniques is proposed. Initially, the splitting method is used {{to search for the}} best possible number of clusters and <b>its</b> <b>centers</b> using Mean Shift Clustering (MSC), Niche Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) and Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO). Using these clusters and <b>its</b> <b>centers,</b> the merging method is used to group the data points based on a parametric method (k-means algorithm). A performance comparison of the proposed hierarchical clustering algorithms (MSC, NPSO and GSO) is presented using two typical multi-spectral satellite images - Landsat 7 thematic mapper and QuickBird. From the results obtained, we conclude that the proposed GSO based hierarchical clustering algorithm is more accurate and robust...|$|R

The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from <b>its</b> <b>center</b> of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
