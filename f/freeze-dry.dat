The farmers would help the process by covering the crops to protect them from dew, and by stomping on them to release the excess water quickly. In addition to fruits, vegetables and roots, the Inca also preserved meat by drying and salting it, making for complete nutritional stores.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the viability after <b>freeze-drying</b> and during storage of delicate or recalcitrant strains safeguarded at biological resource centers. To achieve this objective, a joint experimental strategy was established among the different involved partner collections of the EMbaRC project. Five bacterial strains considered as recalcitrant to <b>freeze-drying</b> were subjected to a standardized <b>freeze-drying</b> protocol and to seven agreed protocol variants. Viability of these strains was determined before and after <b>freeze-drying</b> (within 1 week, after 6 and 12 months, and after accelerated storage) for each of the protocols. Furthermore, strains were exchanged between partners to perform experiments with different freeze-dryer-dependent parameters. Of all tested variables, choice of the lyoprotectant had the biggest impact on viability after <b>freeze-drying</b> and during storage. For nearly all tested strains, skim milk as lyoprotectant resulted in lowest viability after <b>freeze-drying</b> and storage. On the other hand, best <b>freeze-drying</b> and storage conditions were strain and device dependent. For Aeromonas salmonicida CECT 894 (T), best survival was obtained when horse serum supplemented with trehalose was used as lyoprotectant, while Aliivibrio fischeri LMG 4414 (T) should be freeze-dried in skim milk supplemented with marine broth in a 1 : 1 ratio. <b>Freeze-drying</b> Campylobacter fetus CIP 53. 96 (T) using skim milk supplemented with trehalose as lyoprotectant resulted in best recovery. Xanthomonas fragariae DSM 3587 (T) expressed high viability after <b>freeze-drying</b> and storage for all tested lyoprotectants and could not be considered as recalcitrant.

50|$|Modern {{freeze-drying}} {{was developed}} during World War II. Blood serum {{being sent to}} Europe from the US for medical treatment of the wounded required refrigeration, {{but because of the}} lack of simultaneous refrigeration and transport, many serum supplies were spoiling before reaching their intended recipients. The freeze-drying process was developed as a commercial technique that enabled serum to be rendered chemically stable and viable without having to be refrigerated. Shortly thereafter, the <b>freeze-dry</b> process was applied to penicillin and bone, and lyophilization became recognized as an important technique for preservation of biologicals. Since that time, freeze-drying has been used as a preservation or processing technique for a wide variety of products. These applications include the following but are not limited to: the processing of food, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic kits; the restoration of water damaged documents; the preparation of river-bottom sludge for hydrocarbon analysis; the manufacturing of ceramics used in the semiconductor industry; the production of synthetic skin; the manufacture of sulfur-coated vials; and the restoration of historic/reclaimed boat hulls.|$|E
5000|$|In a lab, this {{is often}} done by placing the {{material}} in a freeze-drying flask and rotating the flask in a bath, called a shell freezer, which is cooled by mechanical refrigeration, dry ice in aqueous methanol, or liquid nitrogen. On a larger scale, freezing is usually done using a freeze-drying machine. In this step, {{it is important to}} cool the material below its triple point, the lowest temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of the material can coexist. This ensures that sublimation rather than melting will occur in the following steps. Larger crystals are easier to <b>freeze-dry.</b> To produce larger crystals, the product should be frozen slowly or can be cycled up and down in temperature. This cycling process is called annealing. However, in the case of food, or objects with formerly-living cells, large ice crystals will break the cell walls (a problem discovered, and solved, by Clarence Birdseye), resulting in the destruction of more cells, which can result in increasingly poor texture and nutritive content. In this case, the freezing is done rapidly, in order to lower the material to below its eutectic point quickly, thus avoiding the formation of ice crystals. Usually, the freezing temperatures are between −50 °C and −80 °C (-58 °F and -112 °F) [...] The freezing phase is the most critical in the whole freeze-drying process, because the product can be spoiled if improperly done.|$|E

To design efficient and safe <b>freeze-drying</b> cycles, local temperature and moisture {{content in the}} product bed have to be known, but both are difficult to measure in the industry. Mathematical modeling of heat and mass transfer helps to determine local <b>freeze-drying</b> conditions and predict effects of operation policy, and equipment and recipe changes on drying time and product quality. Representative pellets situated at different positions in the product slab were considered. One-dimensional transfer in the slab and radial transfer in the pellets were assumed. Coupled heat and vapor transfer equations between the temperature-controlled shelf, the product bulk, the sub-limationfront inside the pellets, and the chamber were established and solved numerically.
