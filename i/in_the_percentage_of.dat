40|$|Efalizumab is an mAb {{directed}} against CD 11 a, a molecule involved in T-cell activation and extravasation from blood into tissue. Ten patients with severe atopic dermatitis {{were treated with}} efalizumab for 84 days, and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were analyzed for expression of activation and adhesion markers. Efalizumab treatment led to decreases in CD 11 a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on naive, central memory, and effector memory CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets. MFI for CD 18 was decreased in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> cells positive for cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) were increased fourfold in all CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets. Increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells expressing β 7 and CD 49 d were also observed. No significant changes were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells that produced either IFN-γ or IL- 4. In summary, efalizumab treatment resulted in (i) decreases in CD 11 a and CD 18 expression in all circulating T-cell subsets and (ii) increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> blood T cells expressing tissue homing markers (CLA, β 7, CD 49 d).
