To determine whether hPL and hCG are stored in cytoplasmic secretion gra-nules, we have compared the localization of hPL and hCG in placental homogenates following differential and density-gradient centrifugations to those of prolactin (PRL) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in human and rat pituitary homogenates. In the differential centrifugation studies, 93. 1 ± 4. 1 % (mean ± SE) of the hPL and 79. 4 ± 6. 0 % of the hCG were detected in the postmicrosomal supernatant of placental homogenates. In contrast, 95 - 98 % of the hPRL and hLH in the pituitary homogenates were detected in particulate fractions. Following centrifugation on sucrose-density gradients, particulate hPL and hCG were distributed diffusely throughout the gradients, while greater than 90 % of the pituitary hormones sedimented as single peaks with densities of 1. 22 g/cm 3. When <b>human</b> <b>placental</b> and rat pituitary tissues were homogenized together prior to differential and density-gradient centrifugations, similar marked differences were obseri. ed between {{the distribution of the}} placental and pituitary hormones. These results strongly suggest that the placental hormones hPL and hCG, unlike pituitary PRL and LH, are not stored in large secretory granules.

Placentas lacking GATA- 3 accumulate <b>placental</b> <b>lactogen</b> I and proliferin mRNAs to a level 50 % below that reached in the wild-type placenta.

Placentas lacking GATA- 2 secrete significantly less angiogenic activity than wild-type placentas as measured in an endothelial cell migration assay, consistent with a reduction in expression of the angiogenic hormone proliferin. Furthermore, within the same uterus the decidual tissue adjacent to mutant placentas displays markedly reduced neovascularization compared to the decidual tissue next to wild-type placentas. These results indicate that GATA- 2 and GATA- 3 are important in vivo regulators of trophoblast-specific gene expression and placental function, and reveal a difference in the effect of these two factors in regulating the synthesis of related placental hormones...|$|R
50|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is a normal}} phenomenon emerging in the second trimester of pregnancy, which in cases of GDM progresses thereafter to levels seen in a non-pregnant person with type 2 diabetes. It is thought to secure glucose supply to the growing fetus. Women with GDM have an insulin resistance that they cannot compensate for with increased production in the β-cells of the pancreas. Placental hormones, {{and to a lesser}} extent increased fat deposits during pregnancy, seem to mediate insulin resistance during pregnancy. Cortisol and progesterone are the main culprits, but <b>human</b> <b>placental</b> <b>lactogen,</b> prolactin and estradiol contribute, too. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis reveals that, in combination with other placental hormones, leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and resistin are involved in the decrease in insulin sensitivity occurring during pregnancy, with tumor necrosis factor alpha named as the strongest independent predictor of insulin sensitivity in pregnancy. An inverse correlation with the changes in insulin sensitivity from the time before conception through late gestation accounts for about half of the variance in the decrease in insulin sensitivity during gestation: in other words, low levels or alteration of TNF alpha factors corresponds with a greater chance of, or predisposition to, insulin resistance or sensitivity.

50|$|During pregnancy, {{pronounced}} breast {{growth and}} maturation occurs in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. Estrogen and progesterone levels increase dramatically, reaching levels by late pregnancy that are several hundred-fold higher than usual menstrual cycle levels. Estrogen and progesterone cause the secretion of {{high levels of}} prolactin from the anterior pituitary, which reach levels as high as 20 times greater than normal menstrual cycle levels. IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels also increase dramatically during pregnancy, due to secretion of placental growth hormone (PGH). Further ductal development, by estrogen, again in conjunction with GH/IGF-1, occurs during pregnancy. In addition, the concert of estrogen, progesterone (again specifically through PRB), prolactin, and other lactogens such as <b>human</b> <b>placental</b> <b>lactogen</b> (hPL) and PGH, in conjunction with GH/IGF-1, as well as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), acting together, mediate the completion of lobuloalveolar development of the breasts during pregnancy. Both PR and prolactin receptor (PRLR) knockout mice fail to show lobuloalveolar development, and progesterone and prolactin {{have been found to}} be synergistic in mediating growth of alveoli, demonstrating the essential role of both of these hormones in this aspect of breast development. Growth hormone receptor (GHR) knockout mice also show greatly impaired lobuloalveolar development. In addition to their role in lobuloalveolar growth, prolactin and hPL act to increase the size of the nipple-areolar complex during pregnancy. By the end of the fourth month of pregnancy, at which time lobuloalveolar maturation is complete, the breasts are fully prepared for lactation and breastfeeding.|$|E
