40|$|Distinguishing between hybrid {{introgression}} {{and incomplete}} lineage sorting causing incongruence among gene trees {{in that they}} exhibit topological differences requires application of statistical approaches {{that are based on}} biologically relevant models. Such study is especially challenging in hybrid systems, where usual vectors mediating interspecific gene transfers [...] hybrids with Mendelian heredity [...] are absent or unknown. Here we study a complex of hybridizing species, which are known to produce clonal hybrids, to discover how one of the species, Cobitis tanaitica, has achieved a pattern of mito-nuclear mosaic genome over the whole geographic range. We appplied three distinct methods, including the method using solely the information on gene tree topologies, and found that the contrasting mito-nuclear signal might not have resulted from the retention of ancestral polymorphism. Instead, we found two signs of hybridization events related to C. tanaitica; one concerning nuclear gene flow and the other suggested mitochondrial capture. Interestingly, clonal inheritance (gynogenesis) of contemporary hybrids prevents genomic introgressions and non-clonal hybrids are either absent or too rare to be detected among European Cobitis. Our analyses therefore suggest that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridizations</b> are rather old episodes, mediated by previously existing hybrids whose inheritance was not entirely clonal.

40|$|The Boechera holboellii complex {{comprises}} B. holboellii and B. drummondii, both {{of which}} can reproduce through sex or apomixis. Sexuality is associated with diploidy, whereas apomictic individuals can either be diploid, aneuploid or triploid. Aneuploid individuals are found in geographically and genetically distinct populations and contain a single extra chromosome. It is unknown whether the supernumerary chromosomes are shared by common descent (single origin) or have originated via <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridizations</b> associated with the repeated transition from diploidy to triploidy. Diploid plants containing the extra chromosome(s) reproduce apomictically, suggesting that the supernumerary elements are associated with apomixis. In this study we compared flow cytometry data, chromosome morphology, and DNA sequences of sexual diploid and apomictic aneuploids {{in order to establish}} whether the extra chromosome fits the classical concept of a B chromosome. Karyotype analyses revealed that the supernumerary chromosome in the metaphase complement is heterochromatic and often smaller than the A chromosomes, and differs in length between apomictic plants from different populations. DNA sequence analyses furthermore demonstrated elevated levels of non-synonymous substitutions in one of the alleles, likely that on the aneuploid chromosome. Although the extra chromosome in apomictic Boechera does not go through normal reductional meiosis, in which it may get eliminated or accumulated by a B-chromosome-specific process, its variable size and heterochromatic nature does meet the remaining criteria for a genuine B chromosome in other species. Its prevalence and conserved genetic composition nonetheless implies that this chromosome, if truly a B, may be atypical with respect to its influence on its carriers. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

Species classification for seeds collected from spruce stands in which <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridization</b> between white and Sitka spruces (P. sitchensis) {{may have occurred}} is important for determining appropriate cultural regimens in the nursery. If, for instance, white spruce grown at container nurseries in southwestern British Columbia are not given an extended photoperiod, leader growth ceases early in the first growing season, and seedlings do not reach the minimum height specifications. [...] But, if an extended photoperiod is provided for Sitka spruce, seedlings become unacceptably tall {{by the end of}} the first growing season [...] Species classification of seedlots collected in areas where hybridization of white and Sitka spruces has been reported has depended on (i) easily measured cone scale characters of seed trees, especially free scale length, (ii) visual judgements of morphological characters, e.g., growth rhythm, shoot and root weight, and needle serration, or (iii) some combination of (i) and (ii) (Yeh and Arnott 1986). Useful to a degree, these classification procedures have important limitations; genetic composition of the seeds produced by a stand is determined by both the seed trees and the pollen parents, and species classification of hybrid seedlots and estimates of their level of introgression on the basis of seed-tree characteristics can be unreliable when hybrid seedlots vary in their introgressiveness in consequence of spatial and temporal variations in contributions from the pollen parent (Yeh and Arnott 1986). Secondly, morphological characters are markedly influenced by ontogenetic and environmental influences, so that to discern spruce hybrid seedlot composition with accuracy, hybrid seedlots must differ substantially in morphology from both parent species. Yeh and Arnott (1986) pointed out the difficulties of estimating accurately the degree of introgression between white and Sitka spruces; introgression may have occurred at low levels, and/or hybrid seed lots may vary in their degree of introgression in consequence of repeated backcrossing with parental species.|$|E
