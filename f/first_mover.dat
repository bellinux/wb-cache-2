40|$|Abstract In this paper, we adopt {{a variant}} of the trust game by Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe (1995) and the {{dictator}} game by Cox (2004) to study if income inequality can activate in-group favoritism and, if so, whether such a bias is strong enough to survive the removal of income inequality. We find evidence of in-group favoritism only on the part of rich <b>first</b> <b>movers.</b> Rich <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> trust their in-group members significantly more in the presence of income inequality not only before but also after they gain enough experience. Poor <b>first</b> <b>movers,</b> in contrast, do not exhibit such in-group bias. They do not discriminate between in-group and out-group at the very outset of the experiment, and once they become experienced, they behave with significantly more trust toward the rich than toward the poor. We also find that in-group and out-group favoritism established in the past can be alleviated, but not completely removed, by an equal income distribution...|$|R

40|$|It is {{traditional}} in experimental games to allow participants to choose only actions or possibly communicate intended play. In sequential two-person games, we require <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> {{to express a}} preference between responder choices. We find that responder behavior differs substantially according to whether <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> express a hope for favorable or unfavorable treatment. We find that such preference expression after favorable first-mover play on average increases both the social surplus and the lowest payoff received by 15 - 20 %. Expressed preferences for favorable responder behavior by <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> who have not behaved favorably are largely ignored, however, and may even be counter-productive. Our results replicate earlier findings, in that subjects assign a high positive weight to another person’s payoffs when ahead and misbehavior elicits a strong negative response. Logit regressions estimate the weight placed on another (nonmisbehaving) person’s payoffs to be positive, even when one is behind. While the degree of positive reciprocity is not significant either with or without expressed preferences, {{there is evidence that}} positive reciprocity is enhanced when a preference for favorable treatment is expressed...|$|R
40|$|Working Paper GATE 2009 - 19 This paper {{analyzes}} {{which type}} of intrinsic preferences drive an agent's behavior in a sequential public good game {{depending on whether the}} agent is <b>ﬁrst</b> or second <b>mover.</b> Theoretical predictions are based on heterogeneity of individuals in terms of social and risk preferences. We modelize preferences according to the inequity aversion model of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and to the assumption of constant relative risk aversion. Risk aversion is signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with the contribution decision of <b>ﬁrst</b> <b>movers.</b> Second movers with sufficiently high advantageous inequity aversion free-ride less and reciprocate more than others. Both results are predicted by our model. Nevertheless, no effect of disadvantageous inequity aversion of <b>ﬁrst</b> <b>movers</b> is found in the data while theory predicted it. Our results underline the importance of taking into account the order of agents' play to correctly understand {{which type of}} preferences inﬂuences cooperation in voluntary contribution mechanisms.

In extensive form games <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> benefit substantially from having the opportunity to burn money in advance. The effect is much weaker in the normal form game. However, in two control treatments <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> who can select between two related games gain an advantage although standard forward induction arguments do not have any bite. These results suggest that we need to make further theoretical advances to understand the role of physical timing and first-mover advantages in games. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

60|$|It was {{preceded by}} a speech from Brissot, full of unexampled {{insolence}} towards all the sovereign states of Germany, if not of Europe.

This Brissot {{had been in the}} lowest and basest employ under the deposed monarchy,--a sort of thief-taker, or spy of police,--in which character he acted after the manner of persons in that description. He had been employed by his master, the Lieutenant de Police, for a considerable time in London, in the same or some such honorable occupation. The Revolution, which has brought forward all merit of that kind, raised him, with others of a similar class and disposition, to fame and eminence. On the Revolution he became a publisher of an infamous newspaper, which he still continues. He is charged, and I believe justly, as the <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> of the troubles in Hispaniola. There is no wickedness, if I am rightly informed, in which he is not versed, and of which he is not perfectly capable.

60|$|That {{archbishop}} {{no sooner}} {{came into the}} kingdom than he discovered designs very different from those which the Pope had raised him to promote. He formed schemes of a very deep and extensive nature, and became the <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> in all the affairs which distinguish {{the remainder of this}} reign. In the oath which he administered to John on his absolution, he did not confine himself solely to the ecclesiastical grievances, but made him swear to amend his civil government, to raise no tax without the consent of the Great Council, and to punish no man but by the judgment of his court. In these terms we may Bee the Great Charter traced in miniature. A new scene of contention was opened; new pretensions were started; a new scheme was displayed. One dispute was hardly closed, when he was involved in another; and this unfortunate king soon discovered that to renounce his dignity was not the way to secure his repose. For, being cleared of the excommunication, he resolved to pursue the war in France, in which he was not without a prospect of success; but the barons refused upon new pretences, and not a man would serve. The king, incensed to find himself equally opposed in his lawful and unlawful commands, prepared to avenge himself in his accustomed manner, and to reduce the barons to obedience by carrying war into their estates. But he found by this experiment that his power was at an end. The Archbishop followed him, confronted him with the liberties of his people, reminded him of his late oath, and threatened to excommunicate every person who should obey him in his illegal proceedings. The king, first provoked, afterwards terrified at this resolution, forbore to prosecute the recusants.|$|E

This force of character was inspired, as all such spirit must ever be, from above. Government gave the impulse. As well may we fancy, that of itself the sea will swell, and that without winds the billows will insult the adverse shore, as that the gross mass of the people will be moved, and elevated, and continue by a steady and permanent direction to bear upon one point, without the influence of superior authority, or superior mind.|$|E

That is, the agents have incentives to inflate the perceived level of trust (the signal) in order to induce a more favorable outcome for themselves. In the experiment we study the behavior of subjects in a modified investment game which is played sequentially and simultaneously. While the sequential treatment allows for strategic use of trust, in the simultaneous treatment the <b>first</b> <b>mover’s</b> action is not observed and hence does not signal her belief.
