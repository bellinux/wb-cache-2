30|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of unconventional reservoir rock tremendously affects its <b>hydrofracturing</b> behavior. A visual representation and accurate {{characterization of the}} three-dimensional (3 D) growth and distribution of <b>hydrofracturing</b> cracks within heterogeneous rocks is of particular use to the design and implementation of <b>hydrofracturing</b> stimulation of unconventional reservoirs. However, because of the difficulties involved in visually representing and quantitatively characterizing a 3 D <b>hydrofracturing</b> crack-network, this issue remains a challenge. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for physically visualizing and quantitatively characterizing the 3 D <b>hydrofracturing</b> crack-network distributed through a heterogeneous structure based on a natural glutenite sample. This method incorporates X-ray microfocus computed tomography (μCT), 3 D printing models and <b>hydrofracturing</b> triaxial tests to represent visually the heterogeneous structure, and the 3 D crack growth and distribution within a transparent rock model during <b>hydrofracturing.</b> The coupled effects of material heterogeneity and confining geostress on the 3 D crack initiation and propagation were analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} breakdown pressure of a heterogeneous rock model is significantly affected by material heterogeneity and confining geostress. The measured breakdown pressures of heterogeneous models are apparently different from those predicted by traditional theories. This study helps to elucidate the quantitative visualization and characterization of the mechanism and influencing factors that determine the <b>hydrofracturing</b> crack initiation and propagation in heterogeneous reservoir rocks.|$|R

50|$|Not all {{volumetric}} expansion {{is caused by}} the pressure of the freezing water; it can be caused by stresses in water that remains unfrozen. When ice growth induces stresses in the pore water that breaks the rock, the result is called <b>hydrofracture.</b> Hydrofracturing is favoured by large interconnected pores or large hydraulic gradients in the rock. If there are small pores, a very quick freezing of water in parts of the rock may expel water, and if the water is expelled faster than it can migrate, pressure may rise, fracturing the rock.|$|E
30|$|<b>Hydrofracturing</b> is {{the primary}} method of {{hydrocarbon}} reservoir stimulation that enhances unconventional gas recovery. Unconventional natural gas reservoirs usually are composed of different minerals and have a composite or heterogeneous microstructure (Fouche et al. 2004; He et al. 2015). As a result, the initiation and propagation of <b>hydrofracturing</b> cracks are usually influenced by the contrast between Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of different components (Garcia et al. 2013; Sarmadivaleh and Rasouli 2015; Stanchits et al. 2014). Understanding the initiation and propagation of hydraulically induced cracks is key to predicting and measuring <b>hydrofracturing</b> behavior of low-permeability reservoirs.|$|R
30|$|Geostress has {{significant}} influence {{on the characteristics of}} <b>hydrofracturing</b> cracks in the heterogeneous media. When the confining pressure is high (i.e., 5  MPa), a bi-winged crack formed. However, when the confining pressure was < 5  MPa, only a radial crack formed.

30|$|Metamorphism is a {{significant}} crustal process that results in the reconstruction of crustal rocks through various chemical reactions and deformation. Although chemical reactions and deformation in metamorphism have been studied separately in most existing research; however, their interplay has {{an important role in}} metamorphism. This study examines <b>hydrofracturing</b> caused by reactions between rodingite and serpentinite during regional metamorphism. The same type of interaction between irreversible reactions and <b>hydrofracturing</b> has been analyzed in a metabasite–marble system from a contact metamorphic aureole in the Hirao Limestone in Kitakyushu, Japan (Nishiyama 1989 a). <b>Hydrofracturing</b> is driven by rapid increments of fluid pressure and is therefore likely to occur in contact metamorphic aureoles owing to rapid and irreversible reactions. This paper aims to show the same type of <b>hydrofracturing</b> can occur even in a regional metamorphic terrane, provided the reactions occur irreversibly under the constant solid volume conditions. For this purpose, the reaction zones between rodingite and serpentinite in the Nomo metamorphic rocks, western Kyushu, Japan, were used as a case study.|$|R
30|$|The {{singular}} value decomposition (SVD) {{method is}} a powerful tool by which reaction relations among minerals with complex compositions can be systematically derived {{and the amount of}} mobile (open) components evaluated. Incorporation of molar volume data into the SVD matrix can assure the constant solid volume condition. The resulting reactions evolve H 2 O, which strongly suggests that it is the cause for <b>hydrofracturing</b> leading to the formation of tremolite veins in the serpentinite. Heterogeneities in mineral compositions in the reaction zone imply that rapid irreversible reactions occurred during the formation of the reaction zone. This rapid progress of reactions is a necessary condition for <b>hydrofracturing</b> to occur. If the reaction proceeds slowly, the liberated water will escape from the reaction zone into serpentinite by porous flow, resulting in the relaxation of excess fluid pressure. Thus, tremolite vein associated with the reaction zone between the serpentinite and rodingite {{is a good example of}} the interplay between irreversible reactions and <b>hydrofracturing.</b> Our analysis clearly indicates that <b>hydrofracturing</b> can occur even in regional metamorphism if the reactions liberating H 2 O occur irreversibly.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydrofracture</b> {{systems are}} being {{increasingly}} recognized within subglacial to ice-marginal settings and represent a visible {{expression of the}} passage of pressurized meltwater through these glacial environments. Such structures provide a clear record of the fluctuating hydrostatic pressure and of the resulting brittle fracturing of the host sediment/bedrock and the pene-contemporaneous liquefaction and introduction of sediment-fill. A detailed macro- and microstructural study of a <b>hydrofracture</b> system cutting Devonian sandstone bedrock exposed at the Meads of St John, near Inverness (NE Scotland), has revealed that this complex multiphase system was active over a prolonged period and accommodated several phases of fluid flow.

A model is proposed linking the evolution of this <b>hydrofracture</b> system to the retreat of the overlying Findhorn glacier. The results of this study also indicate that the development and repeated reactivation of subglacial <b>hydrofracture</b> systems can have a dramatic effect on the permeability of the bed, influencing the potential for overpressure build-up within the subglacial hydrogeological system, and facilitating the migration of meltwater beneath glaciers and ice sheet...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed study of a complex <b>hydrofracture</b> system and host diamictons exposed within a longitudinal section through an elongate drumlin located to the west of Cemlyn Bay, Anglesey, NW Wales. This complex, laterally extensive sand, silt and clay filled <b>hydrofracture</b> system was active over a prolonged period and is thought to have developed beneath the Late Devensian (Weichselian) Irish Sea Ice Stream as it overrode this part of NW Anglesey. The sediment-fill to the <b>hydrofracture</b> system is deformed with kinematic indicators (folds, thrusts, augen) recording a SW-directed sense of shear, consistent with the regional ice flow direction across this part of the island. The lack of any geomorphological evidence for active retreat of the Irish Sea ice across Anglesey has led to the conclusion that hydrofracturing at the Cemlyn Bay site occurred within the bed of the Irish Sea Ice Stream whilst this relatively faster flowing corridor of ice was actively overriding the island. Shear imposed by the overriding ice {{led to the development of}} a subglacial shear zone which facilitated the propagation of the <b>hydrofracture</b> system with the laterally extensive feeder sills occurring parallel to Y-type Riedel shears. Although a subglacial setting beneath the active Irish Sea Ice Stream can be argued for the Cemlyn Bay <b>hydrofracture</b> system, its relationship to the formation of the ‘host’ drumlin remains uncertain. However, evidence presented here suggests that hydrofracturing may have occurred during the later stages or post landform development in response to the migration of overpressurised meltwater within the bed of the Irish Sea ice; possibly accompanying the local thinning and shutdown of the Irish Sea Ice Stream on Anglesey...|$|E

However, the success rate of the <b>hydrofracturing</b> campaigns seems not to be that high as generally claimed by contractors. One reason amongst others might be that the selection of zones for <b>hydrofracturing</b> in the individual borehole is based on pre-hydrofracturing investigation using conventional electrical logs only. Thereby, the zones selected are the occurring resistivity minima interpreted as weak zones with some fracturing. However, resistivity minima can also be caused solely by lithological reasons, which then in most cases could have been seen on a gamma log as corresponding increased gamma radiation.

40|$|Fractures {{generated}} by internal fluid pressure, for example, dykes, mineral veins, many joints and man-made hydraulic fractures, {{are referred to}} as hydrofractures. Together with shear fractures, they contribute significantly to the permeability of fluid reservoirs such as those of petroleum, geothermal water, and groundwater. Analytical and numerical models show that – in homogeneous host rocks – any significant overpressure in hydrofractures theoretically generates very high crack tip tensile stresses. Consequently, overpressured hydrofractures should propagate and help to form interconnected fracture systems that would then contribute to the permeability of fluid reservoirs. Field observations, however, show that in heterogeneous and anisotropic, e. g., layered, rocks many hydrofractures become arrested or offset at layer contacts and do not form vertically interconnected networks. The most important factors that contribute to <b>hydrofracture</b> arrest are discontinuities (including contacts), stiffness changes between layers, and stress barriers, where the local stress field is unfavourable to <b>hydrofracture</b> propagation. A necessary condition for a <b>hydrofracture</b> to propagate to the surface is that the stress field along its potential path is everywhere favourable to extension-fracture formation so that the probability of <b>hydrofracture</b> arrest is minimised.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Since the 1970 s, the sudden, rapid {{collapse}} of 20 % of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula {{has led to}} large-scale thinning and acceleration of its tributary glaciers. The leading hypothesis for the {{collapse of}} most of these ice shelves {{is the process of}} <b>hydrofracturing,</b> whereby a water-filled crevasse is opened by the hydrostatic pressure acting at the crevasse tip. This process has been linked to observed atmospheric warming through the increased supply of meltwater. Importantly, the low-density firn layer near the ice-shelf surface, providing a porous medium in which meltwater can percolate and refreeze, has to be filled in with refrozen meltwater first, before <b>hydrofracturing</b> can occur at all. Here we build upon this notion of firn air depletion as a precursor of ice-shelf collapse, by using a firn model to show that pore space was depleted in the firn layer on former ice shelves, which enabled their collapse due to <b>hydrofracturing.</b> Two climate scenario runs with the same model indicate that during the 21 st century most Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves, and some minor ice shelves elsewhere, are more likely to become susceptible to collapse following firn air depletion. If warming continues into the 22 nd century, similar depletion will become widespread on ice shelves around East Antarctica. Our model further suggests that a projected increase in snowfall will protect the Ross and Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelves from <b>hydrofracturing</b> in the coming two centuries...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{time-lapse}} seismic cross well and single well experiments {{were conducted in}} a diatomite reservoir to monitor the injection of CO{sub 2 } into a <b>hydrofracture</b> zone, based on P- and S-wave data. A high-frequency piezo-electric P-wave source and an orbital-vibrator S-wave source were used to generate waves that were recorded by hydrophones as well as three-component geophones. The injection well was located about 12 m from the source well. During the pre-injection phase water was injected into the hydrofrac-zone. The set of seismic experiments was repeated after a time interval of 7 months during which CO{sub 2 } was injected into the hydrofractured zone. The questions to be answered ranged from the detectability of the geologic structure in the diatomic reservoir to the detectability of CO{sub 2 } within the <b>hydrofracture.</b> Furthermore {{it was intended to}} determine which experiment (cross well or single well) is best suited to resolve these features. During the pre-injection experiment, the P-wave velocities exhibited relatively low values between 1700 - 1900 m/s, which decreased to 1600 - 1800 m/s during the post-injection phase (- 5 %). The analysis of the pre-injection S-wave data revealed slow S-wave velocities between 600 - 800 m/s, while the post-injection data revealed velocities between 500 - 700 m/s (- 6 %). These velocity estimates produced high Poisson ratios between 0. 36 and 0. 46 for this highly porous ({approx} 50 %) material. Differencing post- and pre-injection data revealed an increase in Poisson ratio of up to 5 %. Both, velocity and Poisson estimates indicate the dissolution of CO{sub 2 } in the liquid phase of the reservoir accompanied by a pore-pressure increase. The single well data supported the findings of the cross well experiments. P- and S-wave velocities as well as Poisson ratios were comparable to the estimates of the cross well data. The cross well experiment did not detect the presence of the <b>hydrofracture</b> but appeared to be sensitive to overall changes in the reservoir and possibly the presence of a fault. In contrast, the single well reflection data revealed an arrival that could indicate the presence of the <b>hydrofracture</b> between the source and receiver wells, while it did not detect the presence of the fault, possibly due to out of plane reflections...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to improve the}} microseismic mapping capability for <b>hydrofracture</b> monitoring by using full-waveform information and understand fracturing mechanisms via microsesimic source mechanism inversion. First, we develop an array-based correlation approach to improve the detection of small magnitude events with mechanisms and locations similar to a nearby template event. Second, we extend the correlation detector to the subspace detector by including waveforms from multiple template events. Empirical procedures are presented for building the signal subspace from clusters of events. The distribution of the detection statistics is analyzed to determine subspace detection parameters. The benefits of the subspace detector are demonstrated on a dual-array <b>hydrofracture</b> monitoring dataset. Next, a full-waveform approach is developed for complete moment tensor inversion. By using synthetic data, we show that, for events in the near-field of a single monitoring well, a stable, complete moment tensor can be retrieved by matching the waveforms without additional constraints. At far-field range, we demonstrate that the off-plane moment tensor component is poorly constrained by waveforms recorded at one well. Therefore, additional constraints must be introduced. The complete moment tensor inversion approach is demonstrated with a single well dataset from the Bonner sands hydrofracturing. Moment tensor inversion results show that most events have a dominant double-couple component with the fracture plane orientation close to the average fracture trend derived from the multiple event locations. It suggests that in a reservoir with a high horizontal differential stress like the Bonner sands, the microseismicity occurs predominantly by shearing along natural fractures subparallel to the average fracture trend. Finally, the full-waveform based complete moment tensor inversion method is applied to a dual-array <b>hydrofracture</b> monitoring dataset in Barnett shale at Fort Worth Basin. The determined microseismic source mechanisms reveal both tensile opening on hydraulic fracture strands trending subparallel to the unperturbed maximum horizontal principal stress direction and the reactivation of pre-existing natural fractures along the WNW and N-S directions. Two main contributions are: 1) Improving <b>hydrofracture</b> mapping by developing advanced event detection and relocation algorithms using full waveforms; 2) Understanding the fracturing mechanisms through complete moment tensor inversion and geomechanical analysis. by Fuxian Song.
