A Belleville washer is, then, a type of spring shaped like a washer. It is the <b>frusto-conical</b> shape that gives the washer a spring characteristic.|$|E
40|$|A {{conventional}} {{meat grinder}} contains a chopper knife and a chopper plate, the chopper knife rides {{on the inner}} surface of the chopper plate and directs the bone fragments, sinews and gristle inwardly toward the central portion of the chopper plate as it chops the meat. The central portion of the chopper plate has a funnel-shaped, <b>frusto-conical</b> central passageway within which the bone fragments, gristle and sinews and collected and are urged outward, first passing through the <b>frusto-conical</b> passageway and out the small end of the passageway, into opposed discharge channels which passes through {{the hub of the}} plate and communicates with a discharge tube whose distal end is closed or partially closed by a removeable stopper or adjustable clamp...|$|E
40|$|A {{surgical}} tissue macerating {{and removal}} tool is described {{which has a}} rotating rod with a cutting member {{at one end and}} which disposed in a tube which is then contained in an extension of the tool handle. A <b>frusto-conical</b> member extends into the extension at the cutter member end of the rotating rod with its small end engaging the tube. The portion of the <b>frusto-conical</b> member outside of the extension forms a tissue engaging member and may be cut-off at an angle to the axis of the rod to form a tissue engaging edge. Apertures are provided in the extension adjacent the frusto-concial member so that treatment fluid supplied in the annular space between the tube and the extension may flow to the operative site. An aperture is provided in the frustoconical member between the extension and the tube so that fluid may also flow into the tube where it mixes with macerated tissue being directed through an aperture in the tube to a passageway which may have suction applied to help remove macerated material...|$|E
40|$|A daze {{fastener}} {{system for}} connecting {{two or more}} structural elements wherein the structural elements and fastener parts have substantially different {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} physical property characteristics is employed in this invention. By providing <b>frusto-conical</b> abutting surfaces between the structural elements and fastener parts any differences in thermal expansion/contraction between the parts is translated to sliding motion and avoids deleterious thermal stresses in the connection. An essential feature for isotropic homogeneous material connections is that at least two sets of mating surfaces are required wherein each set of mating surfaces has line element extensions that pass through a common point...|$|E
40|$|EP 208942 A UPAB: 19930922 The handle {{is made of}} two {{materials}} of different hardnesses. The harder material grips the tool shank and is sufficiently hard to resist deformation by the force applied when the tool is being used. The softer material undergoes a slight elastic deformation when subjected to operating forces. The outer surface of the handle has two gripping zones (W) formed of the softer material. These two zones lie adjacent to an intermediate gripper zone (4) of harder material. The intermediate zone pref. has the largest dia., with the softer zones being of <b>frusto-conical</b> shape. ADVANTAGE - Improved grip, comfortable hold, and capable of withstanding high torque. 7 / 1...|$|E
40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} system for controlling the force where a moving object engages a stationary stop {{and where the}} system utilized telescopic tubular members, {{energy absorbing}} diaphragm elements, force regulating disc springs, and a return spring to return the telescoping member to its start position after stroking is presented. The energy absorbing system has <b>frusto-conical</b> diaphragm elements frictionally engaging the shaft and are opposed by a force regulating set of disc springs. In principle, this force feedback mechanism serves to keep the stroking load at a reasonable level even if the friction coefficient increases greatly. This force feedback device also serves to desensitize the singular and combined effects of manufacturing tolerances, sliding surface wear, temperature changes, dynamic effects, and lubricity...|$|E
40|$|An {{integral}} lightweight combustion chamber/nozzle assembly for {{a rocket}} engine has a refractory metal shell defining a chamber of generally <b>frusto-conical</b> contour. The shell communicates at its larger {{end with a}} rocket body, and terminates at its smaller end in a tube of generally cylindrical contour, which is open at its terminus and {{which serves as a}} nozzle for the rocket engine. The entire inner surface of the refractory metal shell has a thermal and oxidation barrier layer applied thereto. An ablative silica phenolic insert is bonded to the exposed surface of the thermal and oxidation barrier layer. The ablative phenolic insert provides a chosen inner contour for the combustion chamber and has a taper toward the open terminus of the nozzle. A process for fabricating the integral, lightweight combustion chamber/nozzle assembly is simple and efficient, and results in economy in respect of both resources and time...|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} use in {{separating}} solid particles or liquid droplets from a gaseous medium, including an elongated cylindrical container having a contoured flow control plug located adjacent a bottom end with material introducing means located adjacent a top end. A stream of gaseous medium with entrained particulate material is introduced adjacent the top end and is caused to flow helically downward adjacent the inner wall of the container toward the contoured flow control plug. The plug {{is in the form}} of an inverted <b>frusto-conical</b> section surmounted by an upright, concave radiused cone which presents, below the concave cone, a high pressure region in which the particulate material is entrapped and retained and forming, above the tip of the concave cone, a stable and high speed vortex extending to an exhaust tube which projects downwardly into the chamber beyond the gaseous medium inlet. The plug also causes the gaseous medium to traverse the chamber several times before it leaves the vortex. Georgia Tech Research Institut...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{introduces a}} shaft seal in which leaf seal elements are constructed from slotted shim material formed and layered into a <b>frusto-conical</b> assembly. Limited elastic deflection of seal leaves with increasing system pressure close large startup clearance to a small, non-contacting, steady state running clearance. At shutdown seal elements resiliently retract as differential seal pressure diminishes. Large seal clearance during startup and shutdown provides {{a mechanism for}} rub avoidance. Minimum operating clearance improves performance and non-contacting operation promises long seal life. Design features of this seal, sample calculations at differential pressures up to 2400 psid and benefit comparison with brush and labyrinth seals is documented in paper, AIAA 2005 3985, presented at the Advanced Seal Technology session of the Joint Propulsion Conference in Tucson this past July. In this presentation use of bimetallic leaf material will be discussed. Frictional heating of bimetallic leaf seals during a seal rub can relieve the rub condition to some extent with a change in seal shape. Improved leaf seal rub tolerance is expected with bimetallic material...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{developed an}} inverted <b>frusto-conical</b> shaking bioreactor (IFSB) which had high mammalian cell culture performance {{when compared with}} a mechanically stirred tank reactor (STR) or a flat-bottom shaking bioreactor (FBSB). Here, we determined the mixing time (t) and volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (k(L) a) of this IFSB at various speeds, and simulated the fluid hydrodynamics, including the shear stress and specific surface area, by computational fluid dynamics. The shortest mixing time was observed in a STR. The maximum k(L) a value of 12 /h was achieved in the IFSB at an aeration rate of 4 L/h, demonstrating that our IFSB has enhanced oxygen transfer capabilities needed {{to meet the demands}} of mammalian cells. Simulation studies revealed a 3 % greater specific surface area and a 21 % lower shear strain in the IFSB compared to an FBSB under the same conditions. Additionally, the conical angle of the vessel, which significantly affected cell growth and recombinant protein production, was tested here. We conclude that, compared to the STR and FBSB, the IFSB has an increased liquid surface area for oxygen uptake and exhaust CO 2 stripping, an enhanced k(L) a for cell robust growth to a high cell density, and a lower shear stress to alleviate cell damage...|$|E
