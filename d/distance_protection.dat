50|$|<b>Distance</b> <b>protection</b> detects both voltage and current. A fault on {{a circuit}} will {{generally}} create a sag in the voltage level. If {{the ratio of}} voltage to current measured at the relay terminals, which equates to an impedance, lands within a predetermined level the circuit breaker will operate. This is useful for reasonable length lines, lines longer than 10 miles, because its operating characteristics {{are based on the}} line characteristics. This means that when a fault appears on the line the impedance setting in the relay is compared to the apparent impedance of the line from the relay terminals to the fault. If the relay setting is determined to be below the apparent impedance it is determined that the fault is within the zone of protection. When the transmission line length is too short, less than 10 miles, <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> becomes more difficult to coordinate. In these instances the best choice of protection is current differential protection.|$|E

It is shown that all these protections make up a protection system, to which a setting concept uniform for the entire power system has to be applied.

To achieve this at normal bit error rates requires at least a four bit hamming <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> for all packet data. In other words, all combinations of four randomly spaced bit-flips within a packet boundary must be detected and result in an invalidated packet. Several strategies were combined to achieve the 4-bit hamming distance for 64b/66b packets: 1) strong type fields were chosen with 4-bit hamming distance, 2) the scrambler polynomial was chosen to be compatible with the CRC-32 used for packet protection and 3) protocol violations adjacent to the packet boundaries are required to invalidate the packet. The combination of CRC-32 and the chosen scrambler polynomial were evaluated by exhaustively enumerating all 4-bit error patterns for all possible packet sizes with an optimized C program.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{reports the}} results of {{comprehensive}} studies carried out to explore the impact of midpoint FACTS Controllers (STATCOM and SVC) on the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> {{in order to identify}} important issues that protection engineers need to consider when designing and setting a generator protection system. In addition, practical, feasible and simple solutions to mitigate the adverse impact of midpoint FACTS Controllers on the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> are explored. 	The results of these studies show that midpoint FACTS Controllers have an adverse effect on the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection.</b> This adverse effect, which can be in the form of underreach, overreach or a time delay, varies according to the fault type, fault location and generator loading. Moreover, it has been found that the adverse effect of the midpoint FACTS Controllers extends to affect the coordination between the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> and the generator steady-state overexcited capability limit. 	The Support Vector Machines classification technique is proposed as a replacement for the existing generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> relay in order to alleviate potential problems. It has been demonstrated that this technique is a very promising solution, as it is fast, reliable and has a high performance efficiency. This will result in enhancing the coordination between the generator phase backup protection and the generator steady-state overexcited capability limit in the presence of midpoint FACTS Controllers. 	The thesis also presents {{the results of}} investigations carried out to explore the impact of the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> relay on the generator overexcitation thermal capability. The results of these investigations reveal that with the relay settings according to the current standards, the generator is over-protected and the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> relay restricts the generator overexcitation thermal capability during system disturbances. This restriction does not allow the supply of the maximum reactive power of the generating unit during such events. The restriction on the generator overexcitation thermal capability caused by the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> relay highlights the necessity to revise the relay settings. The proposed solution in this thesis is to reduce the generator <b>distance</b> phase backup <b>protection</b> relay reach in order to provide secure performance during system disturbances...|$|R

When the fault {{occurs in the}} line, the substation zone II <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> detects the fault line and sends the judgement conclusion to the adjacent substation by the inner-substation protection channel: Send the information ‘the fault occurs in this line’ to the opposite station of the fault line and sent the information ‘the fault occurs in the other line’ to the other adjacent substations. Only when the substation area protection judges the position of fault in the protection region of the zone-II <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> and the received the ‘the fault occurs in this line’ information from adjacent substation, the line can be determined as the fault line which can be cutoff by the zone II <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> quickly. For example, when the fault occurs in the line L 3 in Fig.  5, the distance zone-II of the protection 5 and protection 6 on the both sides of L 3 will operate and receive the ‘fault occurs in this line’ information from the neighbor substation. Hence line L 3 is taken for the fault line and can be cutoff fast. The <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> 3 and 8 may also operate during the fault of line L 3 because of the setting method that ensures the sensitivity of terminal protection scope. However, the protection 3 and 8 will receive the information ‘the fault occurs in the other line’ from the opposite substation, the line L 2 and L 4 cannot be judged as fault line.
