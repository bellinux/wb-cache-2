5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E

5|$|Mahakala is {{both the}} most {{primitive}} dromaeosaurid ever described and the smallest. This evidence, combined with {{the small size of}} other primitive relatives such as Microraptor and the troodontid Anchiornis, indicates that the common ancestor of dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and birds (which is called the ancestral paravian) may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> small, at around 65cm in length and 600 to 700grams of mass.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Domitian {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> popular among the soldiers, {{spending}} an estimated {{three years of}} his reign among the army on campaigns—more than any emperor since Augustus—and raising their pay by one-third.

5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period.

5|$|This violent {{collision}} formed {{most of the}} galaxy's (metal-rich) {{galactic halo}} and extended disk.

Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy had a very close passage 2–4 billion years ago. This event produced high levels of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk– even some globular clusters– and disturbed M33's outer disk.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> different.|$|E

5|$|After William's {{death the}} Historia was copied and {{circulated}} in the crusader states and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, James of Vitry {{had access to}} a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by Guy of Bazoches, Matthew Paris, and Roger of Wendover in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> widely read in its original form. In England, however, the Historia was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi, and the chronicle of Roger Hoveden; this version was written around 1220.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{adversely affected by}} human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the president should be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E

5|$|In the English Civil War {{the town}} and the castle were held by the Royalists under Colonel Edmund Wyndham, a {{personal}} acquaintance of the King. British history might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> different had his wife, Lady (Crystabella) Wyndham, been a little more accurate with a musket shot that missed Cromwell but killed his aide de camp. Eventually, with many buildings destroyed in the town, the castle and its valuable contents were surrendered to the Parliamentarians on 21 July 1645. The castle itself was deliberately destroyed (slighted) the following year, while in 1651 Colonel Wyndham made arrangements for Charles II to flee to France following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus. It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> unusual for a former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a thematic strategos, and {{there is reason to}} doubt the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an—otherwise unknown—daughter in marriage.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Norse sagas telling {{parts of}} the story of Augvald include the Saga of Olaf Tryggvason (both by Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla and by Oddr Snorrason), the Saga of Half & His Heroes and the Flateyjarbok. He also appears in the later Historia rerum Norvegicarum and other works of the Icelandic {{historian}} Thormodus Torfæus, who lived and worked in Kopervik, Karmøy. In addition, Augvald is mentioned in the Avaldsnes parish register, and in local Karmøy legends. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> sceptical about the reliability of the legendary sagas, which were dismissed as being of little value even in the early 20th century, before the establishment of general source criticism. The legendary sagas' value as sources has not been re-evaluated in recent times.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others {{probably}} all became extinct {{due to a}} combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
