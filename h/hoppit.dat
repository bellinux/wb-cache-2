5000|$|<b>Hoppit</b> (2000) {{argues that}} around 1700 {{instead of a}} Country [...] "party" [...] England had a Country persuasion. The main points of {{agreement}} were demands {{that the government should}} be frugal and efficient, opposition to high taxes, a concern for personal liberty, a quest for more frequent elections, a faith that the local militia would substitute for a dangerous standing army, and a desire for such moral reforms as temperance in an age of drunkenness, and less Sabbath breaking. The Country leaders stressed the civic duty of the upper class to engage in politics to strengthen the national interest.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke's Two Treatises were rarely cited. Historian Julian <b>Hoppit</b> {{said of the}} book, [...] "except among some Whigs, even as a {{contribution}} to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')". John Kenyon, in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were [...] "mentioned so rarely {{in the early stages of}} the Glorious Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them" [...] and that [...] "no one, including most Whigs, were ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke". In contrast, Kenyon adds that Algernon Sidney's Discourses Concerning Government were [...] "certainly much more influential than Locke's Two Treatises".|$|E
5000|$|Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, [...] (26 August 1676 - 18 March 1745), {{known before}} 1742 as Sir Robert Walpole, was a British statesman who is {{generally}} regarded as the de facto first Prime Minister of Great Britain. Although the exact dates of his dominance are a matter of scholarly debate, the period of 1721-42 is often used. He dominated the Walpole-Townshend ministry and the Whig government of 1730-42 and holds the record as the longest-serving Prime Minister in British history. Speck says that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Ministeris rightly {{regarded as one of}} the major feats of British political history... Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, and his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons.He was a Whig from the gentry class, who was first elected to Parliament in 1701, and held many senior positions. He was a country squire and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his [...] "reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence." [...] <b>Hoppit</b> says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes, growing exports, and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes, as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps.|$|E
