40|$|The {{need for}} {{lightweight}} crush resistant structures has inspired researchers to conduct both experimental and numerical studies on axial crush characteristics of aluminium tubes {{as well as}} polymer matrix composite tubes. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> containing a composite overwrap over an aluminium tube have higher energy absorption than either aluminium or composite tubes. However, the published research on <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> was limited in scope and the beneficial effect of combining composite and aluminium has not been fully investigated. The objective of this research was to conduct a systematic numerical study on the axial crush characteristics of both square aluminium and square aluminium-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> over a wide range of design parameters, such as triggering mechanism, aluminium tube thickness, overwrap thickness and fiber orientation angle in the overwrap. The numerical models were developed using LS-DYNA and validated using the experimental data available on aluminium and aluminium-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes.</b> The parametric study involved both aluminium and aluminium-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes.</b> It was shown that the transition from symmetric to asymmetric folding pattern occurred at lower aluminium tube thickness when a composite overwrap was used on the aluminium tube. For the aluminium-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes,</b> the folding initiation force, mean crush force and energy absorbed of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> were significantly higher than those of the aluminium tubes. These three crush resistance parameters depended on overwrap thickness as well as fiber orientation angle. As the fiber orientation angle increased toward the loading path, the mean crush force decreased linearly. The contribution of this research is {{in the development of a}} numerical technique for modeling quasi-static crushing aluminium-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes.</b> In addition, parametric studies were conducted using the aforementioned design parameters. Empirical equations were developed to predict the mean crush force of aluminium-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes,</b> which would be beneficial in designing crush-resistant structural members.

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 47 - 51) The {{study of}} axial crush behavior {{of metal and}} composite tube has become {{a basis for the}} design of crashworthy structure in automotive and aircraft applications. Unlike metals, polymer composite material displays little or no plastic deformation characteristics. Research has showed that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>tube</b> usually made of inner aluminum tube over-wrapped with Eglass fiber reinforced epoxy have significantly higher energy absorption than either aluminum tube or composite tube. It is therefore important to have a predictive design tool that could simulate the response of the hybrid structure under impact or crush load. This thesis is aimed at the development and validation of finite element simulation methods for <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes.</b> The axial crushing behavior and the energy absorption capacity of the aluminum-composite <b>hybrid</b> <b>tube</b> under quasi static and impact loading is studied using the LS-Dyna finite element solver. A square aluminum tube externally wrapped with E glass/epoxy composite layer at ± 45 ° to tube axis is used for finite element analysis. A modified Chang-Chang failure model is used for the composite layers, exhibiting reasonable correlation with the experimental results. Simulations are carried out on composite and aluminum tubes separately. The results indicate that the energy absorption and crush behavior of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> are better than either the composite tubes or the aluminum tubes.

40|$|A thin polymer bilayer {{film was}} {{transformed}} into micro- and nano-tubes using strain driven self-rolling phenomena of polystyrene (PS) /poly (4 -vinyl pyridine) (P 4 VP) film. Polymer bilayer was produced by consecutive deposition of PS and P 4 VP, from toluene and chloroform solutions, respectively, by dip-coating technique. The object formation proceeds from a opening in the film made by photolithography or by mechanical scratching followed by immersion of patterned sample in dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) solution. DBSA forms supramolecular complexes with pyridine rings of P 4 VP and increases the specific volume of the polymer. Since the solution is neutral to PS layer, bilayer film develops strain due to unequal swelling of polymers in solution of DBSA and hence the film bends and scrolls {{in order to minimize}} its free energy and form tubes. The length of the tubes and the direction of rolling are determined by mechanical patterning of the film. UV-photolithography is used to fabricate patterns of polymer bilayer in order to create tube in a precise manner. The kinetics of the tube formation was studied with respect to acidity of the solution and UV dose. Rate of rolling increased with the acidity of the solution. Tube diameter and rate of rolling decreased with the increase of the UV exposure time. Films with 2 -dimensional gradients of layer thicknesses were prepared to study a broad range of parameters in a single experiment. Furthermore, polymer micro-toroids and triangles were also fabricated using self-rolling approach of PS/P 4 VP layer. Moreover, the kinetics of toroid formation is also studied in the present work. The equilibrium dimensions of toroid are determined by the balance of the bending and the stretching energies of the film. The width of the rolled-up bilayer is larger for the films with higher values of the bending modulus and smaller values of the effective stretching modulus. Moreover, self-rolling phenomena of polymer layer was also explored as a template to fabricate metal, ceramic and metal/ceramic <b>hybrid</b> <b>tube.</b> In order to fabricate metallic and V bimetallic tube, the cross-linked polymer film is capped by metallic layer. After rolling, polymer template is removed by pyrolysis resulting in pure metal microtubes. The fabrication of silica and silica/gold <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> of high aspect ratio is also demonstrated. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used as a precursor of the silica and it is converted into silica by pyrolysis at high temperature. Entire polymer moiety is also removed at this temperature. In order to fabricate <b>hybrid</b> <b>tube</b> of silica with gold, a thin gold layer is deposited on the polymer layer by physical vapour deposition. Self-rolling of polymer bilayers is a very convenient approach for interfacing the interior of microtubes with external electrical circuits and it can be used in particular for creating devices as micro-bubble generators exploiting electrolytic decomposition of fluids. A demonstration of microbubble generation inside the polymer tube is shown in this work. Possibility to functionalize the hidden walls of the tubes {{is one of the major}} advantages of the self-rolling approach. One can modify the surface of the film prior to rolling by magnetron sputtering of metal and upon rolling, tube and toroids with metallized inner surface could be obtained. The tube and toroids with metallic inner surface are promising for the future research as IR-frequency range resonators. Polymer and metallic microtubes fabricated by self-rolling approach may find applications in such fields as IR-waveguiding, microfluidics, enzyme bi-reaction, chemical and biochemical sensing.

Tubes and fillers used in the experiments were prepared using the tube rolling and foaming from powder compacts methods, respectively. The composite was prepared using E-glass fiber fabric (2 x 2 twill fiber construction of 165 g/m 2 areal density) and polyester matrix with a 45 / 45 fiber angle to the tube axis. The quasi-static crush tests were conducted axially on the empty, hybrid and foam filled tubes at 25 mm/min crosshead speed. The deformation sequences of the tubes were further recorded during the tests in order to identify the crushing modes of the tubes. Two failure mechanisms literally known as progressive crushing and catastrophic failure (compression shear) were observed during the crushing of empty composite tubes. The progressive crushing mode leaded to higher crushing loads hence Specific Absorbed Energies (SAE). The predominant progressive crushing mode of empty tubes of thinner wall section was attributed to the surface end defects introduced during sectioning of the <b>tubes.</b> In <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes,</b> the deformation mode of Al tube was found to be a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation, leading to higher SAE values than the sum of the SAEs of empty composite and empty metal tube.

Results further showed that when the progressive crushing mode was taken into account <b>hybrid</b> <b>tubes</b> had lower SAE values than those of empty composite tubes.
