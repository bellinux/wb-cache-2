5|$|An {{inspection}} includes {{external and}} internal inspection for damage, corrosion, and correct colour and markings. The failure criteria {{vary according to the}} published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, overheating, <b>dents,</b> gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line corrosion, general corrosion, cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent markings, and colour coding.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent some}} {{of his time in}} Missouri visiting Dent's family and became engaged to Dent's sister, Julia, in 1844. Four years later on August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in St. Louis. Grant's {{abolitionist}} father Jesse, who disapproved of the <b>Dents</b> owning slaves, refused to attend their wedding, which took place without either of Grant's parents. Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates, all dressed in their blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin. At the end of the month, Julia was nevertheless warmly received by Grant's family in Bethel, Ohio. They had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. ("Buck"), Ellen ("Nellie"), and Jesse. After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis when he decided, with a wife to support, that he would remain in the army.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for <b>dents,</b> cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E

5|$|The stellate plan found {{popularity}} in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, {{with the exception of}} the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees. The upper tiers of the seven-tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 <b>dents.</b> The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at Lakshmeshwara are examples of extreme variants of a basic dravida articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge <b>dents</b> showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|The cannonade started {{fires in}} the main {{fortress}} and rapidly disabled Russian guns. Once Russian fire started to decrease, the gunboats moved into position behind the fortresses and began to bombard them as well. In {{the course of the}} morning, the three French vessels fired some 3,000 shells into the fort, and by 12:00, it had been neutralized by the combined firepower of the Anglo-French fleet. A single Russian hoisted a white flag above the fort to indicate their surrender, and Kokhanovitch walked out to speak with the French ground commander. According to historian James Grant, around 1,100 Russians of the 1,500-man garrison survived the battle and were allowed to leave without their weapons. Herbert Wilson puts the Russian casualties much lower, at 45 dead and 130 wounded. For the French and British, the only men killed were the two aboard Dévastation, with a further 25 wounded, all of whom were aboard the floating batteries. In the course of the battle, Dévastation was hit 75 times, while Lave received 66 hits and Tonnante was hit around the same number of times. None of the ships emerged from the battle with more than minor <b>dents</b> in their armour plate.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{name was}} probably <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens, the actual {{name of the}} nearby <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens which does not overlook the Val d'Hérens. The nearby north face of the <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens is glaciated while the <b>Dent</b> Blanche holds much less snow, it was even called <b>Dent</b> Noire (Black Tooth) on the Woerl Atlas of 1842. In fact on older maps, {{in the area where}} lie both summits, only the name Weisszahnhorn (from German: White Tooth Peak) was indicated, the French name (<b>Dent</b> Blanche) appearing in 1820 only. Because cartographers usually made their observations far away from the mountainous remote areas and also because the <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens is sometime hidden behind the <b>Dent</b> Blanche thus less visible, the latter received the name. The inhabitants of the lower Val d'Hérens called the actual <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens, <b>Dent</b> Blanche, but the ones of the upper Val d'Hérens called the mountain, <b>Dent</b> de Rong or <b>Dent</b> d'Erins, contributing to the general confusion. The actual names are official since the completion of the Dufour map in 1862.|$|R

25|$|Damage of {{any sort}} (e.g., holes, edge <b>dents,</b> repairs, cleaning, re-engraving or gouges) can {{substantially}} reduce {{the value of a}} coin.

Although Voima {{had been involved in}} minor collisions and other incidents in the past, she had not been grounded until 11 April 2003, when she ran aground while assisting a small German cargo ship in difficult conditions outside Helsinki.
