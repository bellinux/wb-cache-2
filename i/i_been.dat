500|$|Over {{the next}} few years Dylan {{returned}} to his roots with two albums covering folk and blues numbers: Good as <b>I</b> <b>Been</b> to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song [...] "Lone Pilgrim", written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits. The album from it, MTV Unplugged, included [...] "John Brown", an unreleased 1962 song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] <b>I</b> <b>been</b> inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', <b>I</b> <b>been</b> real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees."

[...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating thing for me was that Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet.

500|$|In April 1920, at the League's request, Nansen began organising the {{repatriation}} of around {{half a million}} prisoners of war, stranded {{in various parts of}} the world. Of these, 300,000 were in Russia which, gripped by revolution and civil war, had little interest in their fate. Nansen was able to report to the Assembly in November 1920 that around 200,000 men had been returned to their homes. [...] "Never in my life", he said, [...] "have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> brought into touch with so formidable an amount of suffering." [...] Nansen continued this work for a further two years until, in his final report to the Assembly in 1922, he was able to state that 427,886 prisoners had been repatriated to around 30 different countries.

[...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain.

Stengel urged the fans, [...] "Come out and see my amazin' Mets. <b>I</b> <b>been</b> in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose I never knew existed before." [...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team.

500|$|In November 1934, the {{governor}} general {{informed him that}} the King had offered him a knighthood, [...] "for services to cricket", The citation made a veiled reference to Woodfull's actions during the bodyline episode.

In later life he said [...] "Had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> awarded it for being an educationalist, then I would have accepted it. But under no circumstances would I accept it for playing cricket. In 1963, he was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to education. In 1965, while on holiday {{with his wife and}} daughter Jill, he collapsed and died while playing golf in Tweed Heads, New South Wales.

[...] Some Israeli supporters said that Clinton never should have kissed the wife of the Palestinian leader, especially after such inflammatory remarks. The following day, Clinton denounced Suha Arafat's allegations, and said that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat had told her Suha Arafat had been referring to 'tear gas' and not 'poison gas'. The kiss became a campaign issue, especially with Jewish voters. [...] Clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake, saying that to not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident.

This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad?

Bill Lamb from About.com noted that before Rihanna's vocals start, {{there is an}} internal buildup of [...] "dreamy drum machine rhythms". Overall he described the backing track as [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "atmospheric". The song was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake and incorporates themes of [...] "sex and romance". Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the vocal delivery and lyrical content of the song as [...] "sassy". Lamb as said that [...] "lyrically, [...] amounts to romantic, sexual sweet nothings". Rihanna called the collaboration [...] "young and playful", something which Stacy Anderson from Spin and Nick Levine of Digital Spy both picked up, when commenting on the sexual innuendos in the lyrics. In particular, [...] Anderson and Levine noted an arithmetic-based joke during Drake's guest vocal, where he says [...] "The square root of 69 is 8 something, right / 'Cuz <b>I</b> <b>been</b> trying to work it out".

During [...] "Sodomy", a hymn-like paean to all that is [...] "dirty" [...] about sex, the cast strikes evocative religious positions: the Pietà and Christ on the cross. Before the song, Woof recites a modified rosary. [...] In Act II, when Berger gives imaginary pills to various famous figures, he offers [...] "a pill for the Pope". [...] In [...] "Going Down", after being kicked out of school, Berger compares himself to Lucifer: [...] "Just like the angel that fell / Banished forever to hell / Today have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> expelled / From high school heaven." [...] Claude becomes a classic Christ figure at various points in the script. [...] In Act I, Claude enters, saying, [...] "I am the Son of God.

He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it [...] "an exhortation... to embrace the positive and reject the negative." [...] Reisch described The Wall as [...] "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness." [...] The Wall protagonist, Pink, is unable {{to deal with the}} circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is [...] "crazy, over the rainbow". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: [...] "have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> guilty all this time?" [...] Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for [...] "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, [...] "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.|$|E
