40|$|Due to {{technical}} restrictions and restraints of land conditions, measuring meteorological data on remote areas {{is a challenge}} that hardly anyone undertakes. In the present thesis the possibility of real-time temperature measuring and reporting utilizing radioamateur communication infrastructure is presented. Basic information concerning <b>frost</b> <b>hollows</b> and climatic conditions in them is introduced in second chapter, including the process of cold air pool creation and factors that influence it. The problems of measuring meteorological data in <b>frost</b> <b>hollows</b> are also described. Based on these the guidelines for a device for measurement of meteorological data are developed, giving individual characteristics and functionalities of such a device. Possiblities for reporting and storing the measured data in realtime are thorougly discussed. In addition, the recommendations are developed for hardware and software device design, for setting up the device in the environment, and for establishing the connection with communication network. Radioamateur digital communication network APRS is introduced, including its history, activity and functionalities. Basic components of a network are given. Data transfer over the network using protocol AX. 25 is described in detail. Using the above mentioned guidelines an actual device is designed and developed. Behaviour of the device is described in general; individual parts of the device are thoroughly explained. Structure of data on memory card and data sent over the APRS network is explained in detail. ...|$|R

In April 2014, 11 different native grasses and 30 different wildflowers were direct seeded into isolated trial areas. After 7 months, surveys showed that desirable plants were germinating {{at an average of}} 80 plants per square metre and seed was spreading into adjoining areas of Scottsdale Reserve.|$|R

5000|$|The terms {{climate and}} weather are {{sometimes}} used interchangeably in modern languages, but {{have very different}} scientific meanings. Weather is the record of temperature, rainfall, and humidity as reported daily online, by newspapers, and by television. Conversely, climate is the average of data collected from weather reports, usually over a 30-year period, that reflects these observations. The weather data used to determine climate is based on particular weather stations that are generally chosen to reflect the conditions {{that exist in the}} surrounding region (Müller 1982). However, exposed high ridges and local <b>frost</b> <b>hollows</b> are not considered regarding regional weather stations because they represent microclimates and are significantly different from regional climate even though they are important for small flora and fauna.|$|R
50|$|Water {{enters the}} alps as snow or rain. Bogs and <b>frost</b> <b>hollows</b> collect {{the water as}} snow melt and run off. A key element of these bogs is Sphagnum Moss, which acts as a sponge, {{absorbing}} up to twenty times its weight in water. These bogs then release the water over summer, ensuring creeks flow {{throughout most of the}} year maintaining the alps’ creeks and streams. The greatest risk to this system is damage to the Sphagnum bogs. Trampling by feral animals (pigs, cattle, horses, humans) reduces their ability to absorb and then release water; instead of a steady release, water flows increase significantly in spring, leading to erosion and scouring of river beds, and ceases over summer and autumn, leading to localised drought. Fire can remove riparian vegetation, also increasing run-off and erosion.|$|R

In May and June of 2011 and 2012 we investigated the occurrence of late frosts at different levels above the ground. The number of days and amount of hourly frost records were counted and the sum of sub-zero temperatures was calculated. Our study confirmed that sub-zero temperatures mostly occur at levels near the ground. Therefore, on the sites exposed to late frosts, such as mountain <b>frost</b> <b>hollows,</b> in addition to common-sized planting stock we recommend to consider also the use of large-sized transplants (saplings), since their terminal buds are mostly above the zone near the ground most endangered by frost...|$|R
5000|$|Like exposed high {{ridges and}} local <b>frost</b> <b>hollow</b> microclimates, soil climate {{is also a}} special kind of microclimate. It refers to the moisture, temperature, and other climatic {{indicators}} that are found within the pores of soil. For example, in well-drained soils, the soil climate is a somewhat subdued version of the regional climate. In waterlogged soils, soil climate is not related to regional climate because the temperature and oxygenation of waterlogged soils is more dependent on local groundwater paths and rates than on atmospheric conditions. Estimates of other types of soil climate are now beginning to find their way into the classification of soils, the models for soil formation, and into the study of soil biology.|$|E

Almost all of these areas have been built over by suburbs, or modified by farming. The main plants from the grasslands were Stipa, Danthonia and Themeda (spear grass, wallaby grass and kangaroo grass). Trees do not exists on the grasslands due to the <b>frost</b> <b>hollow</b> effect where cold heavy air sinks on frosty mornings killing off larger vegetation.

50|$|It is a {{rare species}} found from Capertee and Bathurst in central New South Wales, south through central and {{southern}} tablelands, with an isolated population near Woodend in Victoria. It has a very patchy and scattered distribution, {{as much of the}} land throughout its range has been cleared for agriculture. Eucalyptus aggregata grows in woodland and is associated with candlebark (Eucalyptus rubida), ribbon gum (E. viminalis), black sally (E. stellulata) broad-leaved peppermint (E. dives) and snow gum (E. pauciflora), with a grassy understory of river tussock (Poa labillardieri) and silver top wallaby grass (Joycea pallida). The soil is generally poorly drained, alluvial or swampy, with the black gum growing in low-lying areas.

40|$|Dynamics of field-layer vegetation, and {{the growth}} of planted, pure and mixed stands of Scots pine and Norway spruce in {{relation}} to microsite conditions, were studied during 31 years from planting, on a high-altitude site with a harsh climate in Swedish Lapland.

50|$|The Isel valley has a {{temperate}} climate {{like much of}} the UK. However {{it is one of}} the driest and sunniest parts of the Lake District. Summers are typically warm with some rain, with late spring to mid-summer tending to be the driest time of the year. Winters can be mild and wet, but due to the areas topography, a cold winter such as the winter of 2009-2010 will give the area lower temperatures and much more snow than areas further north and west. The sheltered valley acts as a <b>frost</b> <b>hollow</b> in winter, with regular temperature inversions leading to valley fog whilst higher up the slopes of the valley it stays clear. In summer the south facing slopes and sheltered valley bottom will achieve warmer temperatures than surrounding areas, but this is lost with rising elevation due to the cooling effects of increasing height above sea level.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} rest of the British Isles, Northampton {{experiences}} a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The official Met Office weather station for Northampton is the Moulton Park Weather Station at the University of Northampton. Situated at an elevation of around 130 m above sea level compared to Northampton town centre at 50 to 60 m, it is one of the highest points in the Borough, and so may not be a perfect representation of other parts of the town. Its hilltop location means less pooling of cold air on calm clear nights, and lower maxima during summer. The absolute maximum recorded is 34.7 C on 3 August 1990.

50|$|As {{with the}} rest of the British Isles and Northamptonshire, Corby {{experiences}} a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Metoffice weather station for which online records are available is Caldecott, about 3 mi north-north west of Corby town centre and in the Welland valley on the Northamptonshire-Leicestershire border. Observations have now ceased, and the nearest operational weather station is Wittering, some 13 mi to the north east. The exact situation of the weather station at Caldecott is at 53 m and in a valley location, meaning generally higher daytime temperatures than Corby itself (at 100-130 m altitude) but also higher frost averages. Caldecott is in fact frostier than the <b>frost</b> <b>hollow</b> at Shawbury (70.2 frost days vs. 64 frost days at Shawbury), where England's lowest December temperature was recorded. However, given temperatures between the 1961-90 period (displayed below) and 1971-2000 period have typically increased by 0.5 to 0.7 Celsius, offset by the fall in temperature of a similar value between the 53 m of the weather station and the 120 or so of Corby town centre, the figures should provide accurate representation (in daytime values at least) of the town proper for the 1971-2000 period.|$|E
40|$|Weather {{and climate}} {{networks}} traditionally follow rigorous siting guidelines, with individual stations {{located away from}} <b>frost</b> <b>hollows,</b> trees or urban areas. However, the diverse nature of the UK landscape suggests that the feasibility of siting stations that are truly representative of regional climate and free from distorting local effects is increasingly difficult. Whilst the urban heat island is a well-studied phenomenon and usually accounted for, the effect of warm urban air advected downwind is rarely considered, particularly at rural stations adjacent to urban areas. Until recently, urban heat advection (UHA) was viewed as an urban boundary-layer process through {{the formation of an}} urban plume that rises above the surface as it is advected. However, these dynamic UHA effects are shown to also have an impact on surface observations. Results show a significant difference in temperatures anomalies (p< 0. 001) between observations taken downwind of urban and rural areas. For example, urban heat advection from small urbanized areas (~ 1 km 2) under low cloud cover and wind speeds of 2 – 3 m s− 1 is found to increase mean nocturnal air temperatures by 0. 6 oC at a horizontal distance of 0. 5 km. Fundamentally, these UHA results highlight the importance of careful interpretation of long-term temperature data taken near small urban areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} referring to floristic, vegetation and habitat diversity in Bohemian Massif has resulted to a revision and detailed classification of ecological phenomena. Each phenomenon represents an open nonhierarchical system of lithological, hydrological, topoclimatic and biotic aberrations, that differ from common features of surrounded “zonal“ environment. Two main groups of ecological phenomena have been distinguished: (i) large-scale ecological geo-phenomena originated by prominent lithological factors, and (ii) meso-scale ecological topo-phenomena produced by local action of hydrology, topoclimate, and air currents. With regard to the first group, the following geo-phenomena play a particular role in the Central European vegetation: (a) sandstone, (b) limestone and dolomite (karst phenomenon), (c) marl (flysch and loess), (d) neovolcanic, and (e) serpentinite phenomena. With regard to the latter group, the following meso-scale phenomena contribute to the diversity of habitats in landscape scenery: (f) river (or valley), (g) summit, (h) <b>frost</b> <b>hollow,</b> and (i) scree (and glacial cirque) phenomena. The “insular“ feature of the ecological phenomena in vegetation cover is expressed mainly by the occurrence of treeless ecosystems, such as swamps, bogs, marshes, steppes, rock faces and scree ecosystems, etc. Relatively higher species richness can indicate most of ecological phenomena (they should be detected by {{the distance from the}} regional species-area curve), and by the presence of rare plant species, especially by the relic and/or endemic species, which survive on extreme habitats due to the lower competition of prevailing dominant woody or graminoid species...|$|E

Area of study: The Jizera Mts., an area heavily disturbed by air pollution situated on the Czech-Polish border close to Germany Materials and methods: Two types of planting stock were tested in a mountain <b>frost</b> <b>hollow</b> on an acidic mountain humic podsol: (a) the bare-rooted saplings 131 – 140 cm tall and (b) common-sized containerized transplants 26 – 35 cm. One half of the saplings and common-sized transplants were left untreated {{and the other half}} were fertilized with a low dose (30 g per tree) of a slow release fertilizer based on methylene urea and potassium magnesium phosphate. Growth performance and nutrition of plantations were investigated. Main results: Due to serious deformations and stem breakages inflicted by snow and frost, the prospects of common-sized transplants seem much worse than those of saplings. The height growth of saplings was significantly more rapid than that of common-sized transplants. As for growth, neither the saplings nor common-sized transplants did significantly respond to fertilizing. The effects of fertilizing on nutrition of rowans were unconvincing. The extreme temperature events during growth seasons and snow deformations in winters might be the decisive factors influencing growth performance of rowans under referred conditions. Research highlights: On the frost-exposed sites, the height of taller saplings might partly compensate for a missing shelter of forest stand since the terminal leaders are above ground-frost zone.

Occurrence of Pinus contorta was recorded in nine counties, twenty and twenty-three districts of municipalities with extended powers. The total stand area was found to 128. 66 hectares.

40|$|Increasing {{rates of}} {{interspecific}} hybridisation can {{be detrimental to}} the viability of small plant populations and {{increase the risk of}} local extinction. This may occur by means of demographic swamping if the production of unfit hybrids reduces seed set and recruitment of the pure-bred genotypes of the rare species. Alternatively, if hybrids are fertile, this may also occur by genetic swamping whereby introgression erodes the genetic integrity of the rare species resulting in its assimilation by more abundant congeners. The rates of hybrid production can vary widely between individuals and populations due to local differences in ecological and population parameters (e. g. phenology, isolation distances, plant-pollinator interactions, relative frequency of parentals). For small populations, alterations of these parameters may result in more frequent hybridisation with cross-compatible congeners, which may affect the conservation of rare species because the frequency of hybridisation is expected to directly influence time to local extinction. Habitat fragmentation can {{play a critical role in}} altering a number of ecological and population parameters by reducing population size and plant densities, altering the frequencies of parentals, and modification of soil characteristics which can shift the flowering times of co-occurring species. All of these factors can potentially increase rates of interspecific pollen flow thereby increasing the rate of hybrid production within remnant populations. However, few studies have empirically explored the extrinsic ecological and population conditions influencing hybrid production in fragmented landscapes. Examining the processes promoting hybridisation in fragmented systems is critical for understanding the relationship between ecological/population parameters and the scale and rapidity of interspecific hybridisation. Such knowledge on the conditions promoting hybridisation and the subsequent effects on population fitness may be useful for understanding how anthropogenic activities can affect important evolutionary and ecological interactions and important for managing the demographic and genetic viability of remnant populations. I examined the influence of habitat fragmentation and associated ecological and population parameters on interspecific pollen dispersal, hybrid production and reproductive success of remnant populations of the uncommon tree Black Gum (Eucalyptus aggregata; Myrtaceae) in South-Eastern Australia. Black gum putatively hybridises with two more common species, Candlebark (Eucalyptus rubida) and Ribbon gum (Eucalyptus viminalis) that co-occur at most E. aggregata sites. The three species often exist in mosaic distributions with E. aggregata inhabiting poorly drained flats and <b>frost</b> <b>hollows,</b> E. rubida on surrounding rocky to well drained skeletal soils, and E. viminalis on moist soil along watercourses. The extent and size of most E. aggregata populations has been reduced due to land clearing for agriculture and grazing. They range from scattered trees in farmland to large undisturbed open woodland populations and exhibit a variety of population densities, absolute population sizes and relative frequencies of parental species at both local and landscape scales. This range provided a good opportunity to identify the ecological and population parameters influencing hybrid production at the individual, within population, and inter-population scales. An array of evidence including, morphological intermediacy, genetic admixture identified by both allozyme and microsatellite markers and direct interspecific paternity assignments, unequivocally indicates E. aggregata is hybridising with E. rubida and E. viminalis.
