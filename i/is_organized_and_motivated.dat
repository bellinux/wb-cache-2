This contribution is based on the hypothesis that the remittances of the migrants living abroad <b>are</b> <b>organized</b> <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> by altruism to contribute to the improvement of the social welfare. We have used a utility function, and an altruistic preference function to show that altruism is the main driving force for diasporans to continue supporting various development projects in their countries of origin. The main result is that, altruistic diasporans are the key strategic agents that make the nexus between migration and development a reality. </p...|$|R

Qualitative studies analyzed 17 strategic communication documents and nine interviews with members and staff to identify major themes relating to goals, activities, and values driving advocates and their organizations. Five major focus issues were identified: building consumer and carer participation, voice and recognition for consumers and carers, influencing and improving mental health systems, effective collaboration and partnerships, and building organizational strength. Findings demonstrate what drives consumer and carer advocates and their organizations to contribute to an <b>organized,</b> strong, <b>and</b> unified movement.

We find that the present system works well and that information providers are largely rewarded by benefits directly received from a related task.

General lessons for user-based innovation systems includes the clear willingness of users to openly reveal their proprietary information. This bodes well for the efficiency of useronly innovation systems, and is rational behavior if the information has low competitive value and/or if information providers think that other users know the same thing they do, and would reveal the information if they did not. 3 How Open Source Software Works Karim Lakhani and Eric von Hippel How Open Source software works: "Free" user-to-user assistance Karim Lakhani and Eric von Hippel 1. 0 : Overview and Problem Statement Some very successful "open source" software products have been and are being developed, distributed, and supported in the field by and for users themselves [...] no supplier required.

While grassroots organizations draw energy and power from their deep community ties, they don't necessarily intersect with others groups doing complementary work. That's where the Center for Community Change comes in. With staff and organizers around the country, we identify and connect the most creative, innovative and powerful models, providing them with resources, expertise, strategy, training and support to shape social movements and bring about meaningful change. With nearly 50 years of experience, CCC is a center for the community organizing field, building community and developing strong leaders, and changing policy, culture, and people's lives for the better. Though all the different facets of our work may seem complex, we can boil it down to one simple phrase: We do what it takes. This report includes examples of just that [...] pushing the limits of what we thought possible to create the change we want to see. We highlight some of the wide-ranging work done by CCC and our 501 (c) (4) sister organization, the Center for Community Change Action, with our extraordinary grassroots partners and national allies.

40|$|There is a {{significant}} relationship between quality working climate and organisational performance. Total Quality Management (TQM) emphasizes continuous improvement which requires participation of everyone in the company in the development of shared mission, vision, plans and in the quest for continuous improvement. High educational institutions are complex organizations with a strong sence of tradition and distinct culture. Employees at all levels <b>are</b> <b>organized</b> <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> with knowledge <b>and</b> responsibility for managing and improving organizational processes. Integrated Universities have specific organizational structure and the concept regarding TQM implementation at Integrated University is consisted of two parts: (a) TQM in education area (at Faculty level), (b) TQM in administrative areas (centralised administration). Our field of work is in implementing TQM in administrative areas (further to be extended in educational and especially research areas). TQM emphasizes teamwork and employee empowerment. Adoption of TQM will help institutions of higher education maintain their competetiveness, eliminate inneficiencies in the organization, help focus on the market needs. This paper is to discover a quality working climate that will explicate the conditions for an overall quality TQM concept. Main issue is the lack of employee awareness {{about the importance of the}} TQM implementation process and achieving duedates set on purpose by the Quality manager. Basically, administration„s excuse for not doing their work „on time“ is the additional work that requires additional working hours. A need for setting deadlines is identifyed, but it is not usefull if it is not highlighted and supported by the top-management. Top-management„s interaction in the whole process of setting new job description tasks in the job specifications of employees, creates a higher level of employee comitment about the task and their involvement in the process. TQM is for systems enhancement, sustaining continuous organisational improvement and also as one part of the recognition and reward process. TQM is a new management philosophy and methods that using organization can improve. Changes from quality control to quality management are bound with changes in the way of thinking, in the means of management and working methods, in conscience. Service-oriented organizations including higher education institutions, which have a greater degree of employee-customer interactions, should concentrate on the more qualitative and softer aspects of working culture, customer care and personal interactions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the combined predictive validity of intelligence and personality factors on multiple measures of academic achievement. Students in a college {{of higher education in}} the Netherlands (N 0137) completed a survey that measured intelligence, the Big Five personality traits, motivation, and four specific personality traits. Student performance was measured with grade point average (GPA) and time to graduation, as well as with five specific performance measures: regular exams, skills training, team projects, internships, and a written thesis. Results show that 33 % of the variance in GPA and 30 % of the variance in time to graduation can be explained by combining intelligence, personality, and motivational predictors. Conscientiousness is the best predictor across a broad spectrum of academic achievement measures and explains five times as much variance in GPA as does intelligence. The practical implications are that institutes of higher education should collect personality data on students at the outset and then help students accordingly. Highly conscientious students who <b>are</b> <b>organized</b> <b>and</b> internally <b>motivated</b> might potentially be offered more challenging honours programs with corresponding special commendations on their diplomas, whereas students who score low on conscientious would receive more structure through student study groups, frequent deadlines, shorter assignments, group assignments, clearly defined learning goals, and less second chances for passing examinations...|$|R
30|$|These {{three factors}} {{seem to be}} {{fundamental}} {{to the success of}} any organization as there is growing evidence that the level of employee engagement correlates to the economic performance of the company [17]. We are becoming increasingly aware that the most efficient way of increasing productivity and ensuring success in contemporary expert organizations is to invest and take enough care of human capital since it helps organization to make the right choices and to weather the storm [18, 19]. Even in manufacturing the issue is no longer how factories might be able to produce things more efficiently, but how well they <b>are</b> able to <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> <b>motivate</b> those doing the work. The key task of the management of any organization is to increase its productivity, and that is precisely why the key principles of management must be understood and assimilated throughout the organization. Otherwise it will function only at half capacity.|$|R
40|$|Educational {{administration}} has been shaped by the metaphor of organization.

Schools as formal organizations seek legitimacy by appearing "rational, " emphasizing accountability and control of both students and teachers. In organizations there are assumptions that hierarchy equals expertise and moral superiority, that tie ties among people are contractual, and that motivation is external and driven by self-interest.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{responsibilities}} and social interactions in auditing political accountability in Swedish municipalities and regions. Can local audit institutions and their practices help to strengthen democratic leadership and responsibility? Case-studies {{have been performed}} in ten municipalities, one county council and one regional unit across Sweden during the period 2003 to 2007. They were selected with regard to variation in size, political majority and through informed observers’ knowledge of their auditing strategies and structures. Documents describing their audit institution were also used in the selection process. The regional political unit is an innovation in public sector organization in Sweden. It comprises many municipalities in several earlier county councils forged into one regional politico-administrative unit, mainly concerned with citizens’ healthcare. All political units in the study have democratically elected bodies and are legally similarly state regulated. The field-studies started with interviews in the audit institutions of municipalities and regions. The responsible politically elected auditors have repeatedly been interviewed throughout the period of research to ascertain developments. Questions have been asked about how they select challenges to be audited, their use of and experience with professional auditors and their relations with the political bodies and professional organizations in their municipalities and regions. Documents from the audit institutions have been perused and their use in formal, political decision-making pursued and registered. The {{results of the study}} show that auditing processes have impact on the organizing of services in the researched political units. But it differs, and is significantly related to local practices of organizing processes. More successful <b>are</b> <b>organized</b> when audit institutions relate well to professionals in services, invite them to participate as equals in auditing dialogs. It creates learning, for auditors as well as for responsible persons in the services. Important is also that municipal auditing is supported by legitimate political bodies and get the resources to contract professional advice by relevant external actors. This is not always the case, either for lack of asking for it or lack of political understanding of the necessity of learning by auditing. Successful auditing practices, in the complex organization of very specialized production of local welfare for citizens, depend on the leadership capability and legitimacy of political auditors to create trust and motive for specialists to engage in common endeavors, organized across, what Max Weber calls, ‘iron cages’ of bureaucratic organization. The democratic ethos of welfare states demands that resources politically are reserved for the ‘have-nots’ rather than for the ‘haves’. Due to centralized ‘iron cages’, the general principles of welfare states today cannot cope with this localization. Since the 1970 s, it has become the remit of welfare municipalities and regions. In Sweden ‘have-nots’ usually have multiple needs. An auditing focus on the ‘have-nots’, in line with the democratic ethos of welfare states, signifies more successful auditing practices. Auditors know ‘for whom or what’ they audit <b>and</b> <b>are</b> able to <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> <b>motivate</b> so that specialized, bureaucratic organizations combine their competences and skills. The results of the investigation show that auditing in few researched units are high on the learning curve of competent, inter-organizational political accountability. Several are moving upwards, but most are on the lower end on the curve...|$|R
