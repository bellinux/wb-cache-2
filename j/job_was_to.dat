5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> appease the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson {{was not the}} charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Having {{graduated}} from the LSE in 1952, Levin worked briefly as a tour guide, and then joined the BBC's North American Service. His <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> read all the newspapers and weekly magazines, selecting articles that might be useful for broadcasting.|$|E

5000|$|Each team {{consists}} of 11 players as in soccer. They are further {{broken down into}} 5 forwards, 3 midfielders, 2 defenders, and 1 goalie. The forwards <b>job</b> <b>is</b> primarily <b>to</b> score points, the midfielder’s <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assist the forwards {{as well as the}} defenders. [...] The goalie’s <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> protect the goal against scoring, while the defenders protect his or her respective side as well as aiding the goalie in protecting the home side.|$|R

5|$|When Large {{volunteered for}} the SAS in 1957 {{it was not a}} unit that was well known outside of {{military}} circles– a fact that Large took advantage of by initially telling his wife that the Regiment's <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> air drop supplies to troops in the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that his <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on {{over the years by}} clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on {{assignment}} in the Caribbean and South America. His <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> monitor {{the health and}} physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E
5|$|His <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> prepare staff {{studies on}} {{upcoming}} potential operations. While {{he did do}} naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} Brazilian and Argentine Grands Prix, Rinland {{returned}} to Europe full-time {{to take the}} official post of the team's Technical Director. His long-term task was to establish an English-based design office for the team, but his initial <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> improve the competitiveness of the FG01 {{through a series of}} technical upgrades. However, Rinland subsequently left the team after a few weeks, after falling out with the team's management over the car's lack of competitiveness.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Hamburg scene {{revolved}} around the Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond (pronounced vagabond in German) and the Pacific Hotel, {{as well as the}} less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> entice customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed {{because of the lack of}} an offside rule. The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name their <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> man mark the kick through.|$|E

5|$|Pablo Miño was {{released}} from prison, but Curto refused to release García, saying that Miño had extenuating circumstances which García did not. Miño's <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> give García the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked and locked, and did not see García's work before the explosion. Curto stopped short of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage.|$|E
5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver {{trumpets}} {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848. Nine {{of these are}} draped with red silk damask banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.|$|E

5|$|The second voyage was {{to reduce}} the {{garrison}} and replace HM Sloop Hound, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop Penguin, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in Endeavour. Endeavour sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of Penguin, and four ship's carpenters whose <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reassemble Penguin on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April Endeavour and Hound sailed for England with their crew. One of Penguin's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.|$|E
5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
5|$|At 13:45, Chain Home radar {{picked up}} the German raids. No. 11 Group {{scrambled}} one Spitfire from RAF Hawkinge on the channel coast. Flown by No. 92 Squadron Pilot Officer Alan Wright, his <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> climb {{as quickly as possible}} over the sea and act as a spotter. He was to report on the direction, height, composition and strength of the German formation. The radar operators assessed the strengths of the three largest formations at 30, 50, and 60 plus. Five smaller formations added up to 85 plus. In fact, the British estimate of 225 aircraft proved too small. The German force was 475 aircraft strong. Shortly before 14:00, the German formation left the French coast. Park ordered his forces to repeat the earlier interception tactic. Four pairs of squadrons were ordered to patrol Sheerness, Chelmsford, Hornchurch and RAF Kenley.|$|E
