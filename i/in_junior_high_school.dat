40|$|English Activities {{have been}} {{implemented}} nationwide, since the present Course of Study, revised in 2002, provided for "Period for Integrated Study". The investigation by the Ministry of Education. Culture, Sports, Science and Technology showed that by 2007, 95. 8 % of elementary schools carried out English Activities in some way either as part of "Period for Integrated Study" or in other classes. Although almost all of elementary schools have implemented English Activities, the content to be taught as part of English Activities in elementary schools is not fixed in the present Course of Study. In 2001. MEXT published "Practical Handbook for English Activities". However, MEXT does not give clear guidelines about the goal and components of English Activities in the handbook. Some of the local governments and elementary schools established curricula {{on the basis of}} the handbook published by MEXT, and implemented English Activities according to their curricula. Therefore the components of English Activities are different among local governments or elementary schools. That is, students get various experiences in elementary schools. For this reason, teachers <b>in</b> <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> have difficulties to teach English because of students' various backgrounds. Therefore, in order to teach English more effectively in both elementary and <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools,</b> curricula of English Activities that are connected to those of English <b>in</b> <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> are needed. <b>In</b> order to develop them, the opinions of English teachers <b>in</b> <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> are necessary. <b>In</b> this paper, it was examined to what extent English teachers <b>in</b> <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> want students to learn English in elementary schools by the questionnaire...|$|R
