40|$|The <b>false</b> <b>truffle</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{problems}} in the production of the Agaricus brasiliensis in Brazil and the control of this fungal competitor has been rather difficult due to difficulties in the isolation and cultivation of this pathogen. This experiment was conducted in three stages, the first consisting of the isolation of Diehliomyces microsporus starting from portions of the fruiting body and through the ascospores suspension; second, D. microsporus cultivated in vitro at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 ºC in six different culture media (CSDA, OCDA, PCDA, ODA, PDA, CDA); third, D. microsporus was inoculated on sterilized compost for formation of the fruiting body. The colony formation from tissue of D. microsporus starting from portions of fruiting body was more efficient than germination of the ascospores. Compost medium (CDA) allowed a larger diameter of the D. microsporus colony, followed by the medium made up of compost and potato mixture, favoring a denser composition. The largest mycelial growth speed of D. microsporus occurred when the culture was incubated at 28 and 30 ºC. Incubation temperatures lower than 15 ºC or above 35 ºC inhibited the mycelial growth of D. microsporus completely. The fruiting bodies were obtained easily in sterilized compost and later inoculated along with mycelial competitor...|$|E

50|$|In fungi, a basidiocarp, basidiome or basidioma (plural: basidiomata) is the {{sporocarp}} of a basidiomycete, the multicellular {{structure on}} which the spore-producing hymenium is borne. Basidiocarps are characteristic of the hymenomycetes; rusts and smuts do not produce such structures. As with other sporocarps, epigeous (above-ground) basidiocarps that are {{visible to the naked}} eye (especially those with a more or less agaricoid morphology) are commonly referred to as mushrooms, while hypogeous (underground) basidiocarps are usually called <b>false</b> <b>truffles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fruitbodies are termed [...] "epigeous" [...] if {{they grow}} on the ground, {{like those of}} {{ordinary}} mushrooms, while others which grow underground are [...] "hypogeous".

40|$|BACKGROUND: False {{truffles}} are ecologically {{important as}} mycorrhizal partners {{of trees and}} evolutionarily highly interesting {{as the result of}} a shift from epigeous mushroom-like to underground fruiting bodies. Since its first description by Vittadini in 1831, inappropriate species concepts in the highly diverse <b>false</b> <b>truffle</b> genus Hymenogaster has led to continued confusion, caused by a large variety of prevailing taxonomical opinions. METHODOLOGY: In this study, we reconsidered the species delimitations in Hymenogaster based on a comprehensive collection of Central European taxa comprising more than 140 fruiting bodies from 20 years of field work. The ITS rDNA sequence dataset was subjected to phylogenetic analysis as well as clustering optimization using OPTSIL software. CONCLUSIONS: Among distinct species concepts from the literature used to create reference partitions for clustering optimization, the broadest concept resulted in the highest agreement with the ITS data. Our results indicate a highly variable morphology of H. citrinus and H. griseus, most likely linked to environmental influences on the phenology (maturity, habitat, soil type and growing season). In particular, taxa described in the 19 (th) century frequently appear as conspecific. Conversely, H. niveus appears as species complex comprising seven cryptic species with almost identical macro- and micromorphology. H. intermedius and H. huthii are described as novel species, each of which with a distinct morphology intermediate between two species complexes. A revised taxonomy for one of the most taxonomically difficult genera of Basidiomycetes is proposed, including an updated identification key. The (semi-) automated selection among species concepts used here is of importance for the revision of taxonomically problematic organism groups in general...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Ramaria is a genus of {{epigeous}} fungi {{common to}} the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America. The extensively branched basidiocarps and the positive chemical reaction of the context in ferric sulfate are distinguishing characteristics of the genus. The genus is estimated to contain between 200 - 300 species and is divided into four subgenera, i.) R. subgenus Ramaria, ii.) R. subgenus Laeticolora, iii.) R. subgenus Lentoramaria and iv.) R. subgenus Echinoramaria, according to macroscopic, microscopic and macrochemical characters. The systematics of Ramaria is problematic and confounded by intraspecific and possibly ontogenetic variation in several morphological traits. To test generic and intrageneric taxonomic classifications, two gene regions were sequenced and subjected to maximum parsimony analyses. The nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA (nuc LSU rDNA) {{was used to test}} and refine generic, subgeneric and selected species concepts of Ramaria and the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal DNA (mt SSU rDNA) was used as an independent locus to test the monophyly of Ramaria. Cladistic analyses of both loci indicated that Ramaria is paraphyletic due to several non-ramarioid taxa nested within the genus including Clavariadelphus, Gautieria, Gomphus and Kavinia. In the nuc LSU rDNA analyses, R. subgenus Ramaria species formed a monophyletic Glade and were indicated {{for the first time to}} be a sister group to Gautieria. Ramaria subgenus Ramaria and Gautieria were derived from R. subgenus Laeticolora, which formed a paraphyletic grade that included Gomphus. Ramaria subgenus Lentoramaria species also formed a paraphyletic grade in the nuc LSU rDNA analyses. The Phallales and Clavariadelphus were indicated as sister taxa to the R. stricta complex and Kavinia and R. abietina of R. subgenus Echinoramaria grouped with the basal species, R. pinicola, of R. subgenus Lentoramaria. In the mt SSU rDNA analyses, Gautieria and Gomphus again nested within Ramaria; however, the Phallales were indicated as a sister taxon to the Gomphales. A single evolutionary origin of the terrestrial habit was inferred for Ramaria with the terrestrial species, R. rainierensis, bridging the gap between the lignicolous R. subgenus Lentoramaria and the terrestrial R. subgenus Laeticolora. Species concepts tested included R. amyloidea and R. celerivirescens both of R. subgenus Laeticolora that differ primarily in the presence of clamp connections. The results supported these two taxa as distinct, sister species. These analyses were consistent with the ramarioid morphology as ancestral for the Gomphales with unique derivations of the club, <b>false</b> <b>truffle</b> and gomphoid morphologies...|$|E
5000|$|Basic {{divisions}} of Agaricomycotina were formerly based entirely upon the growth {{form of the}} mushroom. Molecular phylogenetic investigation (as well as supporting evidence from [...] and chemotaxonomy) has since demonstrated that similar types of basidiomycete growth form are often examples of convergent evolution and do not always reflect a close relationship between different groups of fungi. For example, agarics have arisen independently in the Agaricales, the Boletales, the Russulales, and other groups, while secotioid fungi and <b>false</b> <b>truffles</b> have arisen independently many times just within the Agaricales. http://www.mykoweb.com/articles/Homobasidiomycete_clades.html ...|$|R
5000|$|The gasteroid fungi are a {{group of}} fungi in the Basidiomycota. Species were {{formerly}} placed in the obsolete class Gasteromycetes Fr. (literally [...] "stomach fungi"), or the equally obsolete order Gasteromycetales Rea, because they produce their spores inside their basidiocarps (fruit bodies) rather than on an outer surface. The class is artificial, however, since species - which include puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns, and <b>false</b> <b>truffles</b> - are not closely related to each other. Because they are often studied as a group, it has been convenient to retain the informal (non-taxonomic) name of [...] "gasteroid fungi".|$|R
5000|$|The order Boletales {{originally}} was erected to describe boletes, {{but based on}} [...] and molecular phylogenetic characteristics, {{a large number of}} nonbolete species have recently been established to belong to this group, as well.

Taxonomic studies using secondary metabolites and later molecular phylogenetic evidence moved several physically dissimilar groups into Boletales, including the Sclerodermataceae (earthballs) and the Rhizopogonaceae (<b>false</b> <b>truffles).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nia {{vibrissa}} {{was originally}} described in 1959 from submerged wood {{off the coast}} of Florida.

It was initially thought to be a deuteromycete (an asexual or mould-like fungus), but was subsequently found to be the sexual state of a basidiomycete, one of the few such known from the marine environment. Since its fruit bodies are enclosed and its spores are passively released, Nia vibrissa was considered to be a gasteromycete and was placed in its own family within the Melanogastrales, a now obsolete order of terrestrial <b>false</b> <b>truffles.</b>|$|R
