60|$|And so it {{came about}} that Jacob Welse crossed over the Chilcoot in an early day, and {{disappeared}} into the vast unknown. A year later he emerged at the Russian missions clustered about the mouth of the Yukon on Bering Sea. He had journeyed down a river three thousand miles long, he had seen things, and dreamed a great dream. But he held his tongue and went to work, and one day the defiant whistle of a crazy stern-wheel tub saluted the midnight sun on the dank river-stretch by Fort o' Yukon. It was a magnificent adventure. How he achieved it only Jacob Welse can tell; but with the impossible to begin with, plus the impossible, he added steamer to steamer and heaped enterprise upon enterprise. Along many a thousand miles of river and tributary he built trading-posts and warehouses. He forced the white man's axe {{into the hands of the}} aborigines, and in every village and between the villages rose the cords of four-foot firewood for his boilers. On an island in Bering Sea, where the river and the ocean meet, he established a great <b>distributing</b> <b>station,</b> and on the North Pacific he put big ocean steamships; while in his offices in Seattle and San Francisco it took clerks by the score to keep the order and system of his business.|$|E

50|$|By 1908, {{the company}} had {{approximately}} 400 miles of transmission lines running from Devil's Hole through Lockport and Rochester to Syracuse, a total distance of 167 miles from the <b>distributing</b> <b>station.</b> It had branch lines running to West Seneca, Batavia, Caledonia, Avon, Auburn, and Baldwinsville near Syracuse.

50|$|The fifth or Harlem Branch {{developed}} from the opening on July 7, 1892, of a small <b>distributing</b> <b>station</b> in part of a room at 2059 Lexington Avenue {{on the corner of}} 125th Street, between five and six hundred volumes being drawn off from Bond Street and Jackson Square Branches. During the lifetime of the NYFCL it moved from there, to two rooms at 1943 Madison Avenue, to 18 East 125th Street (July 1895) and finally to 218 East 125th Street (May 1899). A sixth branch of the system was opened on February 25, 1893, in the parish house of the Church of the Holy Communion at 49 West 20th Street, and was named the Muhlenberg Branch in memory of the first rector of the church, William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796-1877). Before taking up his ministry among the poor in 1845, Muhlenberg had been a nationally known educator (college preparatory schools). The seventh branch also found its first outside support from a church. This was the Bloomingdale Branch, opened on June 3, 1896, at 816 Amsterdam Avenue. In 1898, the Bloomingdale Branch moved to the first building to be constructed with NYFCL funds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In group communications, {{the cause}} and effect of {{messages}} has to be maintained to guarantee correct operation order in <b>distributed</b> <b>stations.</b> Previous research about Delta-Causal Ordering (DCO) can provide causal-ordered and time-bounded message delivery for real-time applications, in which the receiver delivers causal-ordered messages to applications by ignoring lost and late messages. The DCO doesn't recover the lost messages, which may degrade the performance of causal ordering, especially on wireless networks. In this article, we propose Reliable Delta-Causal Ordering (RDCO) to repair the lost messages, which may {{increase the number of}} in-causal-order messages. Our simulation results show that the RDCO can improve the DCO in effectiveness of causal ordering about 15 percentages...|$|R
40|$|International audience[1] The {{transition}} zone {{differs from the}} rest of the mantle by high positive P and S wave velocity gradients. However, by applying S receiver function technique to recordings of about 50 globally <b>distributed</b> <b>stations,</b> in 7 regions we obtain evidence of negative discontinuity at a depth around 500 km. Four of these regions correspond to the well known hotspots. No other hotspots are sampled by our observations at this depth. Our modeling suggests that the negative discontinuity is hardly an effect of anisotropy of wadsleyite. More likely, it is caused by isotropic S velocity reduction of around 0. 2 km/s. Origin of the low velocity can be related to enhanced water content in wadsleyite...|$|R
