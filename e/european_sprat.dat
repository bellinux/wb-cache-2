50|$|The gulf {{is famous}} for <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> production.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>European</b> <b>sprat,</b> Sprattus sprattus, is {{the type}} species for the genus Sprattus.|$|E
50|$|A common {{preparation}} {{is made with}} bismarck herring or soused herring. Other varieties use Brathering, rollmops, <b>European</b> <b>sprat,</b> salmon, smoked Atlantic mackerel, other fried fish varieties (e.g. fish burgers). Prawns are sometimes used, as are various other species of food fish. Fischbrötchen are commonly served at fast food stands or take-out restaurants.|$|E
50|$|In Northern Europe, <b>European</b> <b>sprats</b> are {{commonly}} smoked and preserved in oil, which retains a strong smoky flavor.|$|R
50|$|Fishing is an {{economic}} mainstay {{in parts of the}} East of Romania and along the Black Sea coast, with important fish markets in places such as Constanta, Galati and Tulcea. Fish such as <b>european</b> anchovy, <b>sprat,</b> pontic shad, mullet, goby, whiting, garfish, Black-Sea Turbot or horse mackerel are landed at ports such as Constanta.|$|R
25|$|Another {{major and}} {{historical}} {{activity in the}} gulf is fishing, especially on the northern coast near Vyborg, Primorsk and on the southern coast near Ust-Luga. Commercial fish species are herring, <b>sprats,</b> <b>European</b> smelt, whitefishes, carp bream, roaches, perch, European eel, lamprey and others. In 2005, the catchment was 2000 tons by the ships of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast alone.|$|R

He first made inventions for {{small-scale}} home industry, but was soon {{picked up by the}} large-scale industry in Stavanger. Among his inventions there was a device to cut <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> for the tinned food industry in the city.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>sprat,</b> Sprattus sprattus, {{also known}} as bristling, brisling or skipper, is a small, herring-like, marine fish. Found in European waters, it has silver grey scales and white-grey flesh. Specific seas in which the species occurs include the Irish Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea and Sea of the Hebrides. [...] The fish has about 12% fat in its flesh and {{is a source of}} many vitamins. When used for food it can be canned, salted, fried, grilled, baked, marinated, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Europe has 344 fresh-water {{fish species}}, about 200 of them endemic. Some 277 fish {{species have been}} {{introduced}} to Europe, and over one-third of Europe's current fish fauna is composed of introduced species, whereas {{more than a third}} of Europe's freshwater fish species are at risk of extinction, according to new data released by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Jawless fishes include brook lamprey, river lamprey, sea lamprey. Sharks and skates are uncommon in European waters. Sturgeons are most diverse in eastern Europe. The common bony fishes include herrings (shads, <b>European</b> <b>sprat,</b> Atlantic herring, European anchovy), eels (European conger, European eel, Mediterranean moray), carps (barbel, bitterling, bleak, roach, chub, common dace, Eurasian minnow, gudgeons, rudd, stone loach, spined loach, tench, the Scandinavian tench also known as bakkleburg are the largest in Europe. silver- and carp bream and others - more than 50% of the freshwater fish species belong to this order). Another diverse group are the Perciformes (European perch, zander, ruffe, sand goby). Other common freshwater fish include catfishes (Wels catfish and less common Aristotle catfish), the northern pike, burbot, and others.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the spring diet composition and feeding strategy of the <b>European</b> <b>sprat,</b> Sprattus sprattus. Diet composition of <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> was investigated {{for the first time}} in the central Black Sea coast of Turkey. Examined of the 115 specimens (6 - 9. 1 cm total length) of stomach, 12 (10. 4 %) had emty. Diet analysis was described based on gravimetric percentages (W%), frequency of abundance (N%), frequency of occurrence (%F) and relative importance index (IRI%). Feeding strategy was analyzed and graphically (Costello) represented, considering the frequency of abundance (N%) and frequency of occurrence (%F) indexes and grouping prey into higher taxonomic categories. Twenty species were identified, belonging to four prey groups: Polychaeta, Crustacea, Mollusca and Chaetognatha. Finally copepods proved to be the most important food item considering the above-cited indexes. All other prey taxa were identified as accidental preys. At least seven copepod species were identified, where Calanus euxinus appeared all round with %IRI≥ 50. Also results of feeding strategy analyses revealed a trophic specialization toward a single prey...|$|E
30|$|The main {{marine species}} in {{worldwide}} capture over years were {{the families of}} Gardidae (Alaska Pollock, Atlantic Cod, Blue Whiting, Pacific Cod), Engraulidae (Anchoveta, Japaneese Anchovy), Scombridae (Skipjack Tuna, Chub Mackerel, Yellowfish Tuna, Atlantic Mackerel, Seerfishes Nei), Clupeidae (Sardinellas Nei, Atlantic Herring, European Pilchard, Araucanian Herring, <b>European</b> <b>Sprat,</b> Pacific Herring), Carangidae (Scads Nei), Trichiuridae (Largehead Hairtail), Ommastrephidae (Humboldt Squid, Argentine Shortfin Squid), Nemipteridae (Threadfin Breams Nei), Scomberesocidae (Pacific Saury), Portunidae (Gazami Crab), Akiami Paste Shrimp (FAO 2016). Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012). Thus, due to the abundance of aforeisaid species in worldwide fishing production, an attention must be paid on better utilization of a big amount of by-products rested after their processing.|$|E
40|$|Marine {{environmental}} conditions are naturally changing throughout the year, affecting life cycles of hosts aswell as parasites. In particular,water temperature is positively correlatedwith the development ofmany parasites and pathogenic bacteria, increasing {{the risk of}} infection and diseases during summer. Interannual temperature fluctuations are likely to alter host?parasite interactions, which may result in profound impacts on sensitive ecosystems. In this context we investigated the parasite and bacterial Vibrionaceae communities of four common small fish species (three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> Sprattus sprattus and lesser sand eel Ammodytes tobianus) in the Northern Wadden Sea {{over a period of}} two years. Overall, we found significantly increased relative diversities of infectious species at higher temperature differentials. On the taxon-specific level some macroparasite species (trematodes, nematodes) showed a shift in infection peaks that followed the water temperatures of preceding months, whereas other parasite groups showed no effects of temperature differentials on infection parameters. Our results show that even subtle changes in seasonal temperatures may shift and modify the phenology of parasites as well as opportunistic pathogens that can have far reaching consequences for sensitive ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of marketed fishery {{products}} sometimes makes the recognition of species difficult, especially in processed food. So the consumer can be exposed to several commercial and health frauds. The European law obliges to indicate the species by specific commercial names only in fresh and prepared fishery products, but not in processed ones, in which the species can be named using generic denominations. In the present study, {{the use of a}} PCR-RFLP technique for species identification in anchovy paste, a widespread product in Italy, is described. After the PCR amplification of a common 272 bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from different fish species used as standards (European anchovy, European pilchard, <b>European</b> <b>sprat,</b> twaite shad, round sardinella, Atlantic horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel), the amplicons were digested using four restriction enzymes (MspI, HincII, Eam 1104 I and Alw 26 I). These patterns were compared with patterns from DNA extracted from anchovy pastes purchased from the market enabling to detect the presence of species different from anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in some of them. The suitability of extending the obligation to indicate the species using specific commercial denominations even to processed fishery products is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic {{structure of the}} <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus) {{by means of a}} 530 -bp sequence of the mitochondrial control region from 210 fish originating from seven sampling localities of its distributional range. Phylogeographical analysis of 128 haplotypes showed a phylogenetic separation into two major clades with the Strait of Sicily acting as a barrier to gene flow between them. While no population differentiation was observed based on analysis of molecular variance and net nucleotide differences between samples of the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay nor between the Black Sea and the Bosporus, a strong population differentiation between these samples and two samples from the Mediterranean Sea was found. Further, the biggest genetic distance was observed within the Mediterranean Sea between the populations of the Gulf of Lyon and the Adriatic Sea, indicating genetic isolation of these regions. Low genetic diversities and star-like haplotype networks of both Mediterranean Sea populations point towards recent demographic expansion scenarios after low population size, which is further supported by negative FS values and unimodal mismatch distributions with a low mean. Along the northeast Atlantic coast, a northwards range expansion of a large and stable population can be assumed. The history of a diverse but differentiated Black Sea population remains unknown due to uncertainties in the palaeo-oceanography of this sea. Our genetic data did not confirm the presently used classification into subspecies but are only preliminary in the absence of nuclear genetic analyses...|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} "Quirks," a generic, individual-based model synthesizing over 40 {{years of}} empirical and theoretical {{insights into the}} foraging behavior and growth physiology of marine fish larvae. In Quirks, different types of larvae are defined by {{a short list of}} their biological traits, and all foraging and growth processes (including the effects of key environmental factors) are modeled following one unified set of mechanistic rules. This approach facilitates ecologically meaningful comparisons between different species and environments. We applied Quirks to model young exogenously feeding larvae of four species: 5. 5 -mm European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), 7 -mm Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), 13 -mm Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and 7 -mm <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus). Modeled growth estimates explained the majority of variability among 53 published empirical growth estimates, and displayed very little bias: 0. 65 % ± 1. 2 % d(- 1) (mean ± standard error). Prey organisms of ∼ 67 % the maximum ingestible prey length were optimal for all larval types, in terms of the expected ingestion per encounter. Nevertheless, the foraging rate integrated over all favorable prey sizes was highest when smaller organisms made up > 95 % of the prey biomass under the assumption of constant normalized size spectrum slopes. The overall effect of turbulence was consistently negative, because its detrimental influence on prey pursuit success exceeded its beneficial influence on prey encounter rate. Model sensitivity to endogenous traits and exogenous environmental factors was measured and is discussed in depth. Quirks is free software and open source code is provided...|$|E
40|$|As {{condition}} {{is a key}} variable in population dynamics (especially for survival, growth and reproduction), the use of well-defined and accurate fish condition indices is capital. In particular, condition indices (morphometric, bioenergetic and biochemical) have never been compared and validated for the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, the European pilchard Sardina pilchardus and the <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> Sprattus sprattus. The accuracy of two indirect methods, the morphometric relative condition index Kn and the bioenergetics index determined with the Distell Fish Fatmeter was investigated by comparing with a direct measure of relative lipid content carried out with a thin layer chromatography-flame ionization detector. Estimations from the fatmeter correlated quite well with the relative lipid contents of all species, regardless of the reproductive period (R 2 = 0. 69 for anchovy, R 2 = 0. 75 for sprat and R 2 = 0. 48 for sardine). Kn correlated more poorly with relative lipid content (R 2 = 0. 22 for anchovy and R 2 = 0. 41 for sardine, ns for sprat), especially during the reproductive period, pointing out the difficulty for such an index to precisely reflect changes in fat allocation. During the reproductive period, changes in Kn could reflect other processes, such as changes in protein content. Therefore, these different types of commonly used indices do not reflect exactly {{the same type of}} energy stores. The high repeatability of the fatmeter was brought to light, so that only one measurement on each fish side may be necessary to evaluate the relative lipid content of a small pelagic fish. Finally, fatmeter measurements were not affected by freezing storage up to one month for anchovy (R 2 = 0. 66) and sardine (R 2 = 0. 90), making it possible to use frozen samples of both commercial and scientific survey. In contrast, the freezing storage for sprat should be avoided. Based on this study, the Fatmeter appears to be a suitable indirect method to assess condition and fat content of sardine and anchovy on a large number of individuals...|$|E
40|$|Microplastic is {{considered}} a potential threat to marine life as it is ingested by {{a wide variety of}} species. Most studies on microplastic ingestion are short-term investigations and little is currently known about how this potential threat has developed over the last decades where global plastic production has increased exponentially. Here we present the first long-term study on microplastic in the marine environment, covering three decades from 1987 to 2015, based on a unique sample set originally collected and conserved for food web studies. We investigated the microplastic concentration in plankton samples and in digestive tracts of two economically and ecologically important planktivorous forage fish species, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus), in the Baltic Sea, an ecosystem which is under high anthropogenic pressure and has undergone considerable changes over the past decades. Surprisingly, neither the concentration of microplastic in the plankton samples nor in the digestive tracts changed significantly over the investigated time period. Average microplastic concentration in the plankton samples was 0. 21 ± 0. 15 particlesm- 3. Of 814 fish examined, 20 % contained plastic particles, of which 95 % were characterized as microplastic (< 5 mm) and of these 93 % were fibres. There {{were no significant differences in}} the plastic content between species, locations, or time of day the fish were caught. However, fish size and microplastic in the digestive tracts were positively correlated, and the fish contained more plastic during summer than during spring, which may be explained by increased food uptake with size and seasonal differences in feeding activity. This study highlights that even though microplastic has been present in the Baltic environment and the digestive tracts of fishes for decades, the levels have not changed in this period. This underscores the need for greater understanding of how plastic is cycled through marine ecosystems. The stability of plastic concentration and contamination over time observed here indicates that the type and level of microplastic pollution may be more closely correlated to specific human activities in a region than to global plastic production and utilization as such...|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus) was a main {{target species}} of the German GLOBEC program that {{investigated}} the trophodynamic structure and function of the Baltic and North Seas {{under the influence of}} physical forcing. This review summarizes literature on the ecophysiology of sprat with an emphasis on describing how environmental factors influence the life-history strategy of this small pelagic fish. Ontogenetic changes in feeding and growth, and the impacts of abiotic and biotic factors on vital rates are discussed with particular emphasis on the role of temperature as a constraint to life-history scheduling of this species in the Baltic Sea. A combination of field and laboratory data suggests that optimal thermal windows for growth and survival change during early life and are wider for eggs (5 – 17 °C) than in young (8 - to 12 -mm) early feeding larvae (5 – 12 °C). As larvae become able to successfully capture larger prey, thermal windows expand to include warmer waters. For example, 12 - to 16 -mm larvae can grow well at 16 °C and larger, transitional-larvae and early juveniles display the highest rates of feeding and growth at ∼ 18 – 22 °C. Gaps in knowledge are identified including the need for additional laboratory studies on the physiology and behavior of larvae (studies that will be particularly critical for biophysical modeling activities) and research addressing the role of overwinter survival as a factor shaping phenology and setting limits on the productivity of this species in areas located at the northern limits of its latitudinal range (such as the Baltic Sea). Based on stage- and temperature-specific mortality and growth potential of early life stages, our analysis suggests that young-of-the year sprat would benefit from inhabiting warmer, near-shore environments rather than the deeper-water spawning grounds such as the Bornholm Basin (central Baltic Sea). Utilization of warmer, nearshore waters (or a general increase in Baltic Sea temperatures) is expected to accelerate growth rates but also enhance the possibility for density-dependent regulation of recruitment (e. g., top-down control of zooplankton resources) acting during the late-larval and juvenile stages, particularly when sprat stocks are at high levels. Highlights ► Field, laboratory and modeling research on the ecophysiology of all sprat life stages is summarized. ► Environmental factors influencing growth and survival are revealed. ► Ontogenetic changes in thermal tolerance and prey requirements constrain life cycle scheduling. ► Gaps in knowledge are identified and future research efforts recommended on sprat recruitment dynamics. ► Exploring seasonal energy allocation will allow a mechanistic understanding of climate impacts...|$|E
