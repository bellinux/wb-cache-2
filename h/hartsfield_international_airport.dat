25|$|In {{the midst}} of Eastern's turmoil American Airlines CEO Bob Crandall sought a new hub in order to utilize new {{aircraft}} which AA had on order. AA studies indicated that Delta Air Lines would provide strong competition on most routes from Eastern's hub at Atlanta <b>Hartsfield</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> in Atlanta, Georgia, but that MIA had many key routes only served by Eastern. American {{announced that it would}} establish a base at MIA in August 1988. Lorenzo considered selling Eastern's profitable Latin American routes to AA as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization of Eastern in early 1989, but backed out in a last-ditch effort to rebuild the MIA hub. The effort quickly proved futile, and American purchased the routes (including the route authority between Miami and London then held by Eastern sister company Continental Airlines) in a liquidation of Eastern which was completed in 1990. Later in the 1990s, American transferred more employees and equipment to MIA from its failed domestic hubs at Nashville, Tennessee and Raleigh–Durham, North Carolina. Today Miami is American's largest air freight hub and is the main connecting point in the airline's north–south international route network.|$|E

When inhaled, fine particulate matter can enter the blood stream from the lungs and {{increase the risk of}} illness and premature mortality. This thesis examines the potential of two jet fuel types, ultra low sulfur jet fuel and synthetic paraffinic kerosene, to reduce aviation's contribution to ambient particulate matter concentrations. Scaling factors were developed for airport criteria pollutant emissions to model alternative jet fuels in aircraft and ground support equipment. These linear scaling factors were based on currently published studies comparing standard diesel and jet fuels with alternative jet fuels. It was found that alternative jet fuels lower or maintain all air pollutant emissions considered (primary particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) for both aircraft and ground support equipment. To quantify the potential benefits of changing fuel composition on ambient particulate matter concentrations, a study of the Atlanta <b>Hartsfield</b> Jackson <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> was completed using both emissions inventory analysis and atmospheric modeling. The atmospheric modeling captures both primary particulate matter and other emissions that react in the atmosphere to form secondary particulate matter. It was found that the use of an ultra low sulfur jet fuel in aircraft gas turbines could reduce the primary particulate matter inventory by 37 % and synthetic paraffinic kerosene could reduce the primary particulate matter inventory by 64 %. The atmospheric modeling predicts that an ultra low sulfur jet fuel in aircraft could reduce ambient particulate matter concentrations due to aircraft by up to 57 % and synthetic paraffinic kerosene could reduce particulate matter concentrations due to aircraft by up to 67 %. Thus, this study indicates that the majority of air quality benefits at Atlanta <b>Hartsfield</b> Jackson <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> that could be derived from the two fuels considered can be captured by removing the sulfur from jet fuel through the use of an ultra low sulfur jet fuel. by Pearl Donohoo.

Simulator runs were made to evaluate the system that includes a head-up display (HUD) to show the pilot a graphical overlay of the runway along with guidance and steering information to a chosen exit. Fourteen pilots (airline, corporate jet, and research pilots) collectively flew a total of 560 rollout and turnoff runs using all eight runways at <b>Hartsfield</b> Atlanta <b>International</b> <b>Airport.</b> The runs consisted of 280 runs for each of two runway visual ranges (RVRs) (300 and 1200 ft).

For the runs conducted with the HUD information, the runway occupancy times were lower and more consistent. The effect was more pronounced as visibility decreased. For the 1200 -ft visibility, the runway occupancy times were 13 % lower with HUD information (46. 1 versus 52. 8 sec).
