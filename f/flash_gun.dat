50|$|Electronic flash was {{developed}} in the late 1950s while flashbulbs were still in general use. Early units were expensive and often large and heavy as the power unit was a separate unit to the <b>flash</b> <b>gun</b> head and was powered by a large lead-acid battery, and usually carried by the photographer by means of a shoulder strap. Towards the end of the 1960s, the size had dropped {{to the point where they}} were matching the size of conventional bulb flash guns (though the price, having dropped, was still an obstacle). The electronic flash system eventually superseded bulb guns as prices came down, rendering flashbulbs virtually obsolete.|$|E

5000|$|Set Decorator Roger Christian {{found the}} handles for the Graflex <b>Flash</b> <b>Gun</b> in a {{photography}} shop in Great Marlborough Street, in London's West End. He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few [...] "greebles" [...] (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. George Lucas {{decided he wanted}} to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where Star Wars filming began. It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.|$|E
50|$|The Sony Handycam NEX-VG10 (model {{variants}} NEX-VG10E, NEX-VG10A, NEX-VG10J) was {{the large}} sensor interchangeable-lens video camera made and distributed by Sony in 2010-2011. It uses Sony E-mount camera lenses that were first {{used on the}} Sony NEX-3 and Sony NEX-5. It is capable of shooting in 1920×1080 full high definition using a large APS-C sensor. The video is captured in the AVCHD format. When capturing still photos the NEX-VG10 is capable of 14-megapixel stills. The camera kit comes with an 18-200 mm lens that will also be compatible with the NEX Mirrorless interchangeable lens camera systems. The 16 mm ultra wide and 18-55 mm lens E-mount lenses will also work with full auto-focus support. The built-on microphone is made of four directional mics that record in two-way stereo {{with the ability to}} capture both front and back sounds. The mic handle also has support for a hot shoe to connect a supported <b>flash</b> <b>gun</b> and a cold shoe to add on extra accessories. There will also be a 3.5 mm microphone jack to add an external microphone for more accurate sound capture. First shipments of the NEX-VG10 commenced in September 2010. Its launch price is 1999 US dollars and it comes in a kit with a Sony SAL-18200 lens with hood and a free download of Vegas Movie Studio.|$|E

40|$|The {{very first}} {{acceleration}} {{in the first}} half cell of the RF gun cavity plays the most crucial role in the beam dynamics for the whole linear accelerator because the electron beam starts from zero velocity at the cathode, so the space charge force has the biggest effect. The operating emission phase of the electron beam changes with the length of the half cell. For a longer half cell length, the operating emission phase is shifted towards 0 ◦. Since field emission is concen-trated around an RF phase of 90 ◦, where the field strength is maximum, the emission phases of beam and dark current can be separated by increasing the half cell length. For the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (<b>FLASH)</b> <b>gun</b> with 1. 3 GHz resonance frequency, the RF field distribu-tion has been calculated numerically for varying half cell length. Using the RF distribution, the transverse beam emittance has been calculated numerically. The transverse emittance does not change dramatically in the range of 64 - 70 mm half cell length. A reduction of dark current for a longer cell length is demonstrated with simulations. In addition, a modification of the dark current distribution in the momentum spectrum allows an improved collimation of the dark current...|$|E
40|$|State {{of the art}} {{and motivations}} For {{the last two decades}} the process of high {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) has driven a massive advance in atomic and molecular and optical physics [1]. A strong laser pulse can stimulate the production of high energy, ultrashort (less than 1 fs) pulses of light by driving the atomic electrons to produce high harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency. Recently, HHG was used to generate the shortest ever light pulse- just 67 attoseconds (67 × 10 − 18 s) in duration [2]. The attosecond is the fundamental time scale of electronic motion. Thus by investigating processes which evolve on this time scale we are pushing the boundaries both of our understanding of fundamental processes and experimental techniques, and in doing so we are learning to ‘view’ electrons in real time, and to manipulate their motion with light. Furthermore, producing ultrashort laser pulses pushes the field ever further, effectively creating an ultrafast <b>flash</b> <b>gun</b> for photographing electrons ’ motion. Traditionally, codes affording a detailed description of atomic structure have been restricted to describing few-photon processes in reasonably short-wavelength laser fields (in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) to visible range). This is because interactions involving long wavelength ligh...|$|E

40|$|The first {{screening}} results {{concerning the}} corrosion behaviour (Ni 2 + release) of an industrial Ni-Ag arm series treated with two different galvanic coatings [Ni bright + flash of Au 23 kt - Ni bright + <b>flash</b> <b>Gun</b> (Ni-Sn) ], and then finished {{with three different}} final treatments (a coating of diluted epoxy varnish; a coating of standard epoxy varnish; a coating of standard epoxy varnish spread on an electrophoretic primer) was reported. The samples were analyzed {{by means of a}} technique - the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) - that gives some detailed indications not only on the corrosion rates, but also on the start and the mechanism of the corrosion process. First results, obtained by applying the EIS technique to a monitoring system meant to optimizing a pass or fail test, seem to be through-and-through promising: notwithstanding the sample immersion on the synthetic swear solution is a too drastic treatment in comparison with the common use of the metallic glass parts - which foresee in any case an occasional and/or preserved contact with the skin - the EIS technique is able to distinguish the sample that release or not Ni 2 + below of 0. 5 µg/cm² week. Before proposing to standardize the method, the obtained results will require the repeatability and reproducibility evaluation of data obtained until now...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{devise a}} method to measure tear {{meniscus}} curvature by a non-invasive specular technique.  METHODS—A photographic system was devised. The system consisted of a camera and an illuminated target {{with a series of}} black and white stripes oriented parallel to the axis of the lower tear meniscus. The target was mounted on a <b>flash</b> <b>gun</b> close to the objective of a Brown macrocamera and calibrated using a graduated series of glass capillaries of known diameter, ground down to expose the inner wall. It was then applied to normal human eyes (n= 45) to measure the tear meniscus curvature. A video system was also assessed which provided qualitative online information about the tear meniscus.  RESULTS—Using the photographic system, measured values for capillary radii were in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations (r 2 = 0. 996, p< 0. 0001). The radii of curvature of lower tear menisci in normal human subjects (mean 0. 365  (SD 0. 153) mm, range 0. 128 - 0. 736; n= 45) were similar to those reported in the literature. Both systems demonstrated variations in meniscus shape. The video system provided stable images of human menisci over prolonged periods of time and promises to be useful for the analysis of dynamic changes in meniscus volume.  CONCLUSIONS—Reflective meniscometry is a non-invasive technique providing quantitative information about tear meniscus shape and volume and of potential value in the study of ocular surface disease.    Keywords: tear meniscus; reflective meniscometry; radius of curvature; tear kinetic...|$|E

5000|$|The all-glass PF1 bulb was {{introduced}} in 1954. [...] Eliminating both the metal base, and the multiple manufacturing steps needed to attach it to the glass bulb, cut the cost substantially compared to the larger M series bulbs. The design required a fibre ring around the base to hold the contact wires {{against the side of}} the glass base. An adapter was available allowing the bulb to fit into <b>flash</b> <b>guns</b> that accepted the bayonet capped bulbs. The PF1 (along with the M2) had a faster ignition time (less delay between shutter contact and peak output), so it could be used with X synch below 1/30 of a second—while most bulbs require a shutter speed of 1/15 on X synch to keep the shutter open long enough for the bulb to ignite and burn. A smaller version, the AG-1 {{was introduced}} in 1958 which did not require the fibre ring. Though it was smaller and had reduced light output, it was cheaper to manufacture and rapidly supplanted the PF1.|$|R
