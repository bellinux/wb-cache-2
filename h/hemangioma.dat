Describe arguments for the trophoblast origin of <b>hemangiomas.</b> 3. Give arguments for the angioblast theory for the origin of <b>hemangiomas.</b> 4. Identify key genes involved in the origin of <b>hemangiomas.</b> BACKGROUND: <b>Hemangiomas</b> of infancy are common endothelial tumors. They differ from vascular malformations in their tissue architecture and biological properties. To date, there is no universally accepted theory that explains the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of <b>hemangiomas.</b> METHODS: Theories from the medical literature from 1981 to 2004 were gathered, categorized, and reviewed. RESULTS: Current research is mostly on the cellular and genetic levels. The most authoritative theories focus on angioblast origins, trophoblast origins, mutations in cytokine regulatory pathways, and field defects {{as the cause of}} the deranged angiogenesis of <b>hemangiomas.</b> CONCLUSIONS: To date, no single theory can easily explain all the characteristics of <b>hemangiomas,</b> such as predilection for the female sex, usual occurrence after birth, spontaneous involution, abnormal tissue architecture, and distribution within a developmental field. <b>Hemangiomas</b> are probably the final common expression of several pathophysiological mechanisms taking effect alone or in combination...|$|R
40|$|Infantile <b>hemangiomas,</b> {{occurring}} at birth {{or during the}} first weeks of life, are benign vascular tumors with an initial proliferative phase and a later involutional phase. The massive proliferation on the key regions and unpredicted regression may threaten life. Thus, early management of infantile <b>hemangiomas</b> is necessary for affected infancies. Recent studies showed that propranolol for infantile <b>hemangiomas</b> ha d high efficacy for disappearance or reduction of infantile <b>hemangiomas.</b> However, a most recent study demonstrated existence of propranolol-resistant infantile <b>hemangiomas.</b> Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated efficacy of established early pulsed dye laser treatment for infantile <b>hemangiomas</b> in the 50 Japanese infancies which were applied in the period from 2000 to 2005, because our series included from the plaque subtype to the more proliferative tumor subtype.

The intracranial lesions were evaluated {{in terms of their}} location, signal intensity characteristics, enhancement pattern, and degree of involution following treatment. Additional findings associated with PHACE syndrome were also noted and a literature review of intracranial infantile <b>hemangiomas</b> and PHACE syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: The intracranial masses were primarily in or adjacent to the internal auditory canal and demonstrated imaging characteristics and treatment response similar to the ipsilateral orbital lesions. Ipsilateral internal carotid artery hypoplasia, ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere hypoplasia, and/or other head and neck <b>hemangiomas</b> were present in all patients.

Thin basement membranes and glomeruloid architecture {{are typical of}} glomeruloid <b>hemangiomas,</b> whereas papillae with thick mantles of a basement membrane-like matrix enveloping pericytes are prominent in papillary <b>hemangiomas.</b> Thus, collagen IV staining patterns provide further evidence that papillary and glomeruloid <b>hemangiomas</b> represent distinct histopa-thological entities. This additional technique should allow pathologists to readily distinguish between the lesions and make a proper diagnosis. What is important is that glomeruloid hemangiomas-often presenting in a spectrum of multiple cutaneous vascular lesions, including cherry hemangiomas-are a hallmark of POEMS (acronym for polyneuropathy, oganomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome and/or multicentric Castleman's disease, whereas papillary <b>hemangiomas</b> clinically present as innocent solitary cutaneous <b>hemangiomas</b> in otherwise healthy individuals...|$|R

Lesions were evaluated regarding size, enhancement pattern, signal intensity and ADC maps in conventional and diffusion MR. ResultsAll <b>hemangiomas</b> showed hyperintense signal at diffusion MR with different b values. In typical and atypical <b>hemangiomas,</b> diffusion MR showed hyperintense signal that persisted with increasing b values. Both types showed hyperintense signal or mixed signals in ADC maps. Mean ADC values (for both types) were 2. 47, 2. 36, 2. 31 and 2. 10 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s for b 200, 500, 800 and 1000, respectively.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Estudar as características morfológicas e quantitativas dos <b>hemangiomas</b> hepáticos na ressonância magnética. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS: Foram estudados, prospectivamente, 57 <b>hemangiomas</b> hepáticos presentes em 27 pacientes, com ressonância magnética de alto campo (1, 5 T) utilizando seqüência spin-eco, imagens ponderadas em T 1 e T 2, com tempos de eco de até 160 ms. Foram avaliadas as características morfológicas dos <b>hemangiomas,</b> classificando-os em típicos ou atípicos. Também foram avaliadas características quantitativas das lesões (relação intensidade de sinal lesão/fígado, valores de tempo de relaxação T 2 e índice simplificado T 2) e feitas comparações entre tais características nos <b>hemangiomas</b> morfologicamente típicos e atípicos, e naqueles com dimensões £ 2, 0 cm e > 2, 0 cm. RESULTADOS: Do total de <b>hemangiomas</b> estudados, 78, 9 % apresentaram características morfológicas típicas. Não houve diferença significante entre as características quantitativas de <b>hemangiomas</b> morfologicamente típicos e atípicos. <b>Hemangiomas</b> com dimensões £ 2, 0 cm e > 2, 0 cm apresentaram comportamento semelhante em relação ao tempo de relaxação T 2 e ao índice simplificado T 2.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with 57 <b>hemangiomas</b> were prospectively studied with magnetic resonance imaging using a system operating at 1. 5 T. T 1 - and T 2 -weighted spin-echo images were obtained, including heavily T 2 -weighted images with TE of 160 ms. The morphological characteristics of the <b>hemangiomas</b> were studied and the lesions were classified as typical or atypical. Quantitative parameters (T 2 relaxation time, simplified T 2 index and lesion/liver signal intensity ratio) were also calculated. The values obtained for typical and atypical <b>hemangiomas</b> were compared {{as well as for}} the <b>hemangiomas</b> measuring £ 2. 0 cm and > 2. 0 cm. RESULTS: 78. 9 % of <b>hemangiomas</b> showed typical morphological features.

In cases of infantile hemangiomas that compromise of vital structures, symptoms may improve with involution of the <b>hemangioma.</b> For example, respiratory distress would improve with involution of a space occupying <b>hemangioma</b> involving the airway and high output heart failure may lessen with involution of a hepatic <b>hemangioma</b> and ultimately treatment may be tapered or discontinued. In other cases, such as an untreated eyelid <b>hemangioma,</b> resultant amblyopia does not improve with involution of the cutaneous lesion.

40|$|Context: Vascular {{anomalies}} present diagnostic {{challenges to}} histopathologists. Mulliken and Glowacki′s classification categorizes vascular lesions into <b>hemangiomas</b> and vascular malformations. Aim: This study explored diagnostic clues in the histomorphology of <b>hemangiomas</b> and vascular malformations. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 cases of benign vascular lesions were retrieved from 12 years period. A total of 94 cases, where complete clinical details and representative paraffin sections were available, {{were included in}} this study. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stain and Verhoeff′s stain for elastic tissue were done on all cases and lesions were classified into <b>hemangiomas</b> or arterio-venous malformations (AVM). Mast cell density in all lesions was calculated from toluidine blue stained sections. Results: Ten cases of <b>hemangiomas</b> were reclassified as AVM {{on the basis of}} presence and absence of arteriovenous structures. Intra-lesional nerves were seen in significantly higher number of AVMs compared to <b>hemangiomas.</b> Medium and thick sized nerve bundles were seen in 56 % of AVMs, while they were not seen in any of the <b>hemangiomas.</b> Mean mast cell density was significantly higher in proliferating <b>hemangiomas</b> (53. 12 ± 27. 83 cells/mm 2) compared to involuting <b>hemangiomas</b> (11. 43 ± 7. 9 cells/mm 2). Conclusions: Use of elastic tissue stains are useful ancillary tools to distinguish between AVMs and <b>hemangiomas.</b> The presence of arteries and arterioles {{are an integral part of}} AVMs. The presence of the intra-lesional nerves can be useful to distinguish between AVMs and <b>hemangiomas</b> even on H and E stained sections.
