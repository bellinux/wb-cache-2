50|$|The Landmap Project began late 1999 as a {{joint project}} between Mimas, UCL Department of <b>Geomatic</b> <b>Engineering,</b> and other project partners. The project {{produced}} orthorectified satellite image mosaics of Landsat, SPOT and ERS radar data {{and a high}} resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the British Isles. The DEM was quality assured using a Kinematic Global Positioning Survey (KGPS). The outputs of the Landmap Project were provided as a basic download service to the UK and Irish academic community.|$|E
50|$|Geomatics Engineering, <b>Geomatic</b> <b>Engineering,</b> Geospatial Engineering is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} engineering discipline {{that focuses on}} spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.|$|E
50|$|The {{educational}} activities of this faculty started in 1954 as Geomatics Institute. This was {{shortly after the}} establishment of the Geomatics Organization of Iran. The mission of the newly established Geomatics Institute was mainly to train professional geomatics workforce for governmental organizations. In 1980, this institute joined the newly established K. N. Toosi University of Technology. Initially it was known as the Faculty of Civil Engineering and the geodesy and geomatics engineering was one of the departments. With the expansion of the university, in 2001, this department made an independent faculty under the name of Geodesy and <b>Geomatic</b> <b>Engineering</b> to meet the growing demand.|$|E
50|$|The {{department}} {{has been in}} operation since establishment of the campus. Initially a three-year diploma course in Civil Engineering was offered. A four-year Bachelor program in Civil Engineering was launched in 2056 B.S. A four-year bachelor program in <b>Geomatics</b> <b>Engineering</b> was started in 2069 B.S. and the department was renamed as the Department of Civil and <b>Geomatics</b> <b>Engineering.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Geomatics is a {{field that}} {{incorporates}} several others such as the older field of land surveying engineering {{along with many other}} aspects of spatial data management ranging from data science and cartography to geography. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term [...] "surveying" [...] no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. Like how the profession of mechanics is a part of mechanical engineering, surveying is a part of <b>geomatic</b> <b>engineering.</b> As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.|$|E

Extensive work has been carried out to attain the best possible results, using all the existing software in the Department of <b>Geomatic</b> <b>Engineering,</b> University College London.

New routines were written in C language, as additions to the existing software, to allow for the special problems that arise in urban areas. The final results overcome the problem of double mapping (or occlusions) and will potentially enable even greater success to be achieved. A simple accuracy assessment of the results has been made.
