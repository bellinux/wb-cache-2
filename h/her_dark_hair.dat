5|$|In November 1987, Kai and Martin {{became known}} as The Glamour Girls, and she {{underwent}} an image change that involved bleaching <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> platinum blonde {{at the suggestion of}} their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face the Fabulous Moolah's team. Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women's Tag Team Championship. The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988, with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold. Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women's division.|$|E
25|$|Norma is lured from Dr Stillingfleet by {{an ad in}} the {{newspaper}} to meet David, and is again drugged. Frances kills David. She sets it up to appear that Norma did it, but the blood on the knife was congealed when Norma found herself holding it. With police and family gathered in the flat, Poirot announces that Andrew did die in Africa. Robert Orwell poses as her father to gain the wealth of the family. He had David paint portraits of him and his late wife in the style of a painter popular 20 years earlier as part of the ruse. Most cruelly {{he and his wife have}} been giving Norma various drugs that give her hallucinations and an altered sense of time, to set her up as guilty. Further, the wife had poisoned herself hoping to pin that on Norma, too. Louise wrote to Andrew on learning he was back in England, so Frances killed Louise; this is the murder Norma feared she did. The woman posing as stepmother was also Frances, who used a blonde wig to cover <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> when changing roles. Poirot takes the wig from her bag to make that point. Murder of the two who could expose the imposters was just one of her crimes. Sonia is exonerated when she finds the papers Sir Roderick misplaced, and the two will marry. Poirot had chosen Dr Stillingfleet to help him with Norma in hopes the two would marry, and they will.|$|E
500|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, where Björk premiered the song, {{she wore}} a very large dress which {{unfolded}} during her performance of [...] "Oceania" [...] to eventually occupy the entire stadium, and showed {{a map of the}} world in sign of union. Additionally, Björk wore [...] "bluish-purple glittery eye shadow across her lids. <b>Her</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> dangled in tiny twists that framed her pixieish, freckled face". Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony, the song was downloaded more than 11,000 times on the iTunes Store. Jake Coyle from Today commented that her dress was [...] "reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001". According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time, if it weren't for the fireworks {{at the end of the}} song, he was legitimately unsure if people in the audience would have cheered. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: [...] "They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyoncé-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance". [...] "Oceania" [...] was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007–08).|$|E

2500|$|J.R. Weguelin's [...] "Tired Dancer" [...] is {{very clear}} and rich. [...] The girl has flung herself upon a marble seat beneath a marble pillar; her loose dress of dark red gause forms a {{brilliant}} patch against the marble, and yet it does not hide the limbs beneath. [...] <b>Her</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> is crowned with clustering yellow flowers, the face is utterly asleep, and the right arm flung out straight upon the marble slab behind her well conveys the idea of complete weariness. [...] The execution of the marble {{is a kind of}} reminiscence of Alma Tadema's work.|$|E

6000|$|... 'What {{did he say}} in that one?' the Pussum asked, leaning forward, <b>her</b> <b>dark,</b> soft <b>hair</b> {{falling and}} {{swinging}} against her face.

5000|$|The Grudge, {{a horror}} series by {{director}} Takashi Shimizu, {{is all about}} the hauntings of a woman in white; Kayako Saeki's ghost appears as a woman in white and her face is almost always hidden by <b>her</b> long <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R

Also, she appears to be very dominating with her brother, though she deeply cares for him. She fulfills the role of piloting her twin-seat Machina, the massive Deceive. Also, she appears to have developed a crush on Koichi, though she never dares to admit it. Before being given a hairpin by Koichi, she could only be differentiated from her brother through <b>her</b> <b>darker</b> <b>hair</b> color and the fact that she speaks in Kansai dialect.|$|R
