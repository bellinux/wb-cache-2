5|$|A {{political}} party {{known as the}} South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose {{the economic and political}} power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{appointed}} 32 federal judges, {{including four}} Associate Justices and one Chief <b>Justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of the United States, and 27 judges to the United States district courts. Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts {{during his time}} in office.|$|E
5|$|The voivodes {{presided over}} the noblemen's general assemblies, which were {{annually}} held at a meadow near Torda (Turda). The Transylvanian noblemen were exempted from taxation in 1324. They were also granted the right to administer <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peasants living in their estates in 1342. The prelates acquired the same right in their domains {{in the second half}} of the 14th century. From the early 15th century, the voivodes rarely visited Transylvania, leaving the administration of the counties to their deputies, the vice-voivodes.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of other moral values, such as caring; {{that there is such}} an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as Archdeacon of Ely, with the {{appointment}} occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent Barre as a royal <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during Richard's absence on the Third Crusade. Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he {{did not return to}} his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{appointed}} one <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street {{lawyer and}} conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed {{him to be}} attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone. Stone {{proved to be a}} firm believer in judicial restraint and was {{regarded as one of the}} court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice.|$|E

5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} do <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided {{to build their own}} studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued {{that it did not}} adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for a single theatrical release, on 13 March 2008, Warner Bros. announced that the film adaptation of Deathly Hallows would be split into two parts to do <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book and {{out of respect for}} its fans.Yates, director ofthe previous two films,was confirmed to return as director, and Kloves was confirmed as screenwriter. For {{the first time in the}} series, Rowling was credited as a producer alongside Heyman and Barron, however Yates noted that her participation in the filmmaking process did not change from the previous films. Pre-production began on 26 January 2009, while principal photography began on 19 February at Leavesden Studios, where the previous six instalments were filmed. Pinewood Studios became the second studio location for shooting the seventh film. The premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was held on 11 November 2010, at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, and the film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 19 November.|$|E

5|$|Peace {{having been}} restored, a grand {{ceremonial}} procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding {{through the streets}} on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot. Manuel dispensed <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, {{at the head of}} a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria, of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.* P. Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 67* J. H. Norwich, A short history of Byzantium Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration.|$|E
5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of <b>Justice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E
