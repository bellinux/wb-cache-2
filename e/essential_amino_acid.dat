5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized in{{directly from the}} <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E

25|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acids</b> can {{be divided}} into three categories: <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> non-essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> and {{conditional}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> cannot be made by the body, and must be supplied by food. Non-essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are made by the body from <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> or in the normal breakdown of proteins. Conditional <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are usually not essential, except in times of illness, stress, or for someone challenged with a lifelong medical condition.|$|R

25|$|Wheat {{proteins}} have a {{low quality}} for human nutrition, {{according to the new}} protein quality method (DIAAS) promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Wheat proteins are deficient in the <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> lysine, and contain adequate amounts of the other essential amino acids, at least for adults. Because the proteins present in the wheat endosperm (gluten proteins) are particularly poor in lysine, white flours are more deficient in lysine compared with whole grains. Significant efforts in plant breeding are being made to develop lysine-rich wheat varieties, without success as of 2017. Supplementation with proteins from other food sources (mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency, since the limitation of a single <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> causes the others to break down and become excreted, which is especially important during the period of growth.|$|E
25|$|Severe niacin {{deficiency}} typically {{manifests itself}} as the disease pellagra. Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves vitamin B2 and B6, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency. An excess of leucine, an <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Arginine is a conditionally <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{in humans}} and rodents, {{as it may}} be {{required}} depending on the health status or life cycle of the individual. For example, while healthy adults can supply their own requirement for arginine, immature and rapidly growing individuals require arginine in their diet, and it is also essential under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury and sepsis, or when the small intestine and kidneys, which are the major sites of arginine biosynthesis have been damaged. It is, however, an <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> for birds, as {{they do not have a}} urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which needs to be processed through the urea cycle, and if there is not enough arginine present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.|$|E

Synthesis for BCAAs occurs in all locations of plants, within the plastids of the cell, as determined by presence of mRNAs which encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway.|$|R
5000|$|The {{biological}} value of proteins in general, hence also of grain-proteins, is fundamentally {{determined by the}} ratio between the <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{to be found in}} cereals and the requirement of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of the living creature, consuming protein...the most important way of raising the {{biological value}} ... is given by the technique of complementing.|$|R
25|$|In humans, {{arginine}} {{is classified}} as a semiessential or conditionally <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize or create arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people {{do not need to}} supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline.|$|E
25|$|Ingested {{methylmercury}} {{is readily}} and completely {{absorbed by the}} gastrointestinal tract. It is mostly found complexed with free cysteine and with proteins and peptides containing that amino acid. The methylmercuric-cysteinyl complex is recognized by amino acid transporting proteins in the body as methionine, another <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b> Because of this mimicry, it is transported freely throughout the body including across the blood–brain barrier and across the placenta, where it is absorbed by the developing fetus. Also for this reason {{as well as its}} strong binding to proteins, methylmercury is not readily eliminated. Methylmercury has a half-life in human blood of about 50 days.|$|E
25|$|Initially, a T. gondii {{infection}} stimulates {{production of}} IL-2 and IFN-γ by the innate immune system. Continuous IFN-γ production {{is necessary for}} control of both acute and chronic T. gondii infection. These two cytokines elicit a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell mediated immune response. IL-12 is also produced during T. gondii infection to activate natural killer (NK) cells. Tryptophan is an <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> for T. gondii, which it scavenges from host cells. IFN-γ induces the activation of indole-amine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), two enzymes {{that are responsible for}} the degradation of tryptophan. Immune pressure eventually leads the parasite to form cysts that normally are deposited in the muscles and in the brain of the hosts.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other insects}} {{of the order}} Hemiptera, A.pisum {{utilizes}} an endosymbiotic bacterium to overcome the nutritional deficiencies of phloem sap. A. pisum feeds on phloem sap of host plants including Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Pisum sativa (pea), Trifolium pretense (red clover), and Vicia faba (broad bean). The phloem saps of these plants are nutritionally rich in carbohydrates but poor in terms of nitrogen. The ratio of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> to nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in these phloem saps ranges from 1:4-1:20. This ratio of <b>essential</b> to nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> is severely disproportional compared to the 1:1 ratio present in animal tissues and necessary for survival. Animals, including A. pisum, can produce nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> de novo but cannot synthesize nine <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> that must be obtained through their diets: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. In addition to these nine <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> A. pisum is unable to synthesize arginine due to missing urea cycle genes. The endosymbiotic relationship with Buchnera allows A. pisum to overcome this lack of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in the phloem sap When provided with nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> Buchnera converts nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> into <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{to be returned to}} A. pisum. This nutritional provisioning has been examined genomically (metabolic complementary, discussed below) and experimentally. Isolated bacteriocytes containing Buchnera have been shown to actively take up 14C labeled glutamine (a nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acid)</b> where it is then converted into glutamic acid. This glutamic acid is then taken up by the individual Buchnera cells and used to synthesize the <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and valine as well as nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> that can be returned to A. pisum. Mutual nutrient provisioning is likely the main reason for the persistence of this symbiosis.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The work {{provides}} a critical evaluation of current knowledge {{on the use}} of ketoacids and <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in patients with chronic renal failure. It is demonstrated that there are not enough data to support any positive benefits of ketoacids over <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> On the contrary, data on nitrogen balance in children and weight increments in infants clearly indicate that <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are preferable to ketoacids.

40|$|Patients on peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) are predisposed to disturbances in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism {{and development of}} malnutrition which are unfavorable prognostic factors. Studying the serum level of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in patients on PD. The total of 56 PD patients (mean age 42. 4 ± 11. 5 years, treatment duration 24. 0 ± 14. 2 months) was examined simultaneously with 12 practically healthy volunteers (mean age 39. 4 ± 10. 7 years). Analysis of the dietary interviews and 3 -day dietary journals was carried out. The levels of essential and conditionally <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in both serum and daily volume of {{peritoneal dialysis}} solution were determined using liquid chromatography. Dietary protein consumption in PD patients was 1. 06 ± 0. 09  vs. 1. 21 ± 0. 05  g/kg/day (р 0. 05), and increased level of histidine – 32. 7 ± 6. 8 vs. 14. 6 ± 0. 5  mg/L in the control. The ratios essential/nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and branched/replaceable <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> as well as Fisher’s index were 0. 54 ± 0. 05, 0. 25 ± 0. 05 and 2. 0 ± 05, correspondingly, vs. 1. 35 ± 0. 15, 0. 55 ± 0. 05 and 3. 2 ± 0. 2 in the control (р< 0. 05). Daily excretion of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> with dialysis solution fluctuated between 314 and 522  mg, and that of conditionally <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> – between 156 and 337  mg. Direct correlation was revealed between daily excretion of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> on the one hand, and both peritoneal transport (р= 0. 001) and daily excretion of isoleucine, threonine, histidine, and their serum levels, on the other (р= 0. 04, р= 0. 001, and р= 0. 01, accordingly). Direct correlation between daily excretion of <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and that of tyrosine and its serum level was only near reliable value (р= 0. 055).

25|$|Vitamin B12-dependent MTR {{reactions}} {{may also}} have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate methionine (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, {{if it is not}} regenerated from homocysteine by a B12 dependent reaction) is needed to make S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of myelin sheath phospholipids. Although production of SAMe is not B12 dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> methionine) is assisted by B12. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain neurotransmitters, catecholamines and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B12 deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an <b>essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E
