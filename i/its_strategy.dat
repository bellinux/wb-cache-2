They also initiated a {{hearts and minds}} campaign, named the Aldeamentos Programme, which was a forced relocation program. But on November 9, 1972, FRELIMO – not numbering more than 8,000 fighters – launched a large offensive in Tete Province. The response from the Portuguese military was fierce, leading to reprisal attacks {{in an attempt to}} unbalance the local population's continuing faith in FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} events {{consisted of}} an aerial bombardment, followed by small-scale Israeli harassment of the Egyptian lines, {{and later a}} ground assault (Operation Pleshet). The original plan was to attack on June 1–2, but this was canceled due to an impending ceasefire, and re-attempted on June 2–3. The Israelis, under the Givati Brigade's umbrella command, attacked in two main forces: one from the north (3 companies) and one from the south (4 reinforced companies). The Israelis had little intelligence on their enemy and were forced to retreat. They failed to capture territory, and suffered heavy casualties. However, following the operation, Egypt changed <b>its</b> <b>strategy</b> from offensive to defensive, thus halting their advance northwards.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the German commanders were {{reluctant}} to bomb London, fearing retaliation against Berlin. On 24 August 1940, a single aircraft, tasked to bomb Tilbury, accidentally bombed Stepney, Bethnal Green and the City. The following night the RAF retaliated by mounting a forty aircraft raid on Berlin, with a second attack three days later. The Luftwaffe changed <b>its</b> <b>strategy</b> from attacking shipping and airfields to attacking cities. The City and West End were designated 'Target Area B'; the East End and docks were 'Target Area A'. The first raid occurred at 4:30p.m. on 7 September and consisted of 150 Dornier and Heinkel bombers and large numbers of fighters. This {{was followed by a}} second wave of 170 bombers. Silvertown and Canning Town bore the brunt of this first attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Isdud was {{occupied}} by the Egyptian army on May 29, 1948, and became the Egyptians' northernmost position during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. While the Israelis failed to capture territory, and suffered heavy casualties, Egypt changed <b>its</b> <b>strategy</b> from offensive to defensive, thus halting their advance northwards. Egyptian and Israeli forces clashed in the surrounding area, with the Egyptians being unable to hold the Ad Halom bridge over the Lachish River. Israeli forces surrounded the town during Operation Pleshet, and shelled and bombed it from the air. For three nights from 18 October the Israeli Air Force bombed Isdud and several other locations. Fearing encirclement, Egyptian forces retreated on October 28, 1948 {{and the majority of}} the residents fled. The 300 townspeople who remained were driven southwards by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|This failure {{prompted}} the German command to rethink <b>its</b> <b>strategy.</b> To reinforce {{the troops and}} replace the losses, additional personnel were transferred from the 163rd Infantry Division based in Southern Finland. With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by Luftflotte 5, {{as well as a}} supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them back out of the town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In order not to lose momentum, the SS Division Nord pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a micro-simulation method to evaluate potential ITS applications. Based on the commercial PARAMICS model, a capability-enhanced PARAMICS simulation environment {{has been developed}} through integrating a number of plug- in modules implemented with Application Programming Interfaces (API). This enhanced PARAMICS simulation can thus have capabilities to model not only the target traffic conditions and operations but also various potential <b>ITS</b> <b>strategies.</b> An evaluation study {{on the effectiveness of}} potential <b>ITS</b> <b>strategies</b> under the incident scenarios is conducted over a corridor network located at the city of Irvine, California. The potential <b>ITS</b> <b>strategies</b> include incident management, local adaptive ramp metering, coordinated ramp metering, traveler information systems, and the combination of above. Based on the calibrated simulation model, we implement and evaluate these scenarios. The evaluation results show that all <b>ITS</b> <b>strategies</b> have positive effects on the network performance. Because of the network topology (one major freeway with two parallel arterial streets), real-time traveler information system has the greatest benefits among all single ITS components. The combination of several ITS components, such as the corridor control and the combination scenarios, can generate better benefits. ...|$|R

50|$|Sequential {{equilibrium}} is a {{refinement of}} Nash Equilibrium for extensive form games due to David M. Kreps and Robert Wilson.

A profile of strategies and beliefs is called an assessment for the game.Informally speaking, an assessment is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium if <b>its</b> <b>strategies</b> are sensible given its beliefs and its beliefs are confirmed on the outcome path given by <b>its</b> <b>strategies.</b> The definition of sequential equilibrium further requires that there be arbitrarily small perturbations of beliefs and associated strategies with the same property.|$|R
