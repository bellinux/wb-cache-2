5|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> {{break the}} word of a prince spoken in public place, for my honour's sake. And {{therefore}} I say again, I will marry as soon as I can conveniently, if God take not him away with whom I mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let happen.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never,</b> ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
60|$|COLONEL. [In {{a towering}} passion.] If {{you lose your}} temper like this, <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>never</b> play with you again.|$|R

5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> desire any reward {{whatever}} for my service.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> gloat {{in victory}} or pity myself in defeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} {{come to my}} parties, <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>never</b> forgive you," [...] said Fanny, as Polly paused, while Tom chuckled {{inwardly}} {{at the idea of}} calling visits from a brother [...] "dissipation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{reading my}} journal, and {{laughing}} at my presents, and then putting {{the blame on}} Maud. It 's the meanest thing I ever saw; and <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>never</b> forgive you as long as I live!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Aug. O <b>never,</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>I</b> rise, <b>Never</b> <b>will</b> <b>I</b> cease my mourning, Never wipe my weeping eyes, Till my plighted lord's returning! <b>Never,</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>I</b> rise! ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> take {{an unfair}} {{advantage}} in order to win.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be a {{party to}} factions, hatred, or jealousies with my people; and will side with the oppressed against the oppressor.|$|E
25|$|You see, {{he was not}} my type, but {{his insistence}} and his love for me {{convinced}} me to love him... and now, it seems <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> meet someone like him ever again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{did it on}} purpose, you horrid boy! <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>never</b> let {{you have}} {{anything}} to do with my fun again!" [...] cried Fan, in a passion, trying to catch and shake him, while he dodged and chuckled in high glee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll not stay!' cried Clara, {{with all}} the vehemence of her Dynevor nature. 'I'll go {{straight}} home to Northwold to-morrow morning--to-night if I could. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>will!</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> came here for this!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I'm very sorry," [...] murmured Mrs. Bowman, [...] "and {{anything}} that I can do <b>I</b> <b>will.</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{expected to see}} Charles again. And it was so sudden; it took me unawares. I hope we shall still be friends." ...|$|R
25|$|I've {{studied the}} ideas of Confucius, Buddha, and Jesus; I respect them as saints, but even if there's a heaven made by them, it's not a nation created by our nation, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> take our nation there.|$|E
25|$|I regret nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I {{did what}} I had to do. Placed before the same {{circumstances}} today, I would do {{exactly the same}} thing. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> deny what I did and what happened. It was not a youthful indiscretion.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> {{forget his}} arrival {{running across the}} back of the stage, and his catlike way of holding himself {{opposite}} the ramp. He wore a white sash over an ultramarine costume, had large wild eyes and hollow cheeks under a turban topped with a spray of feathers, bulging thighs, immaculate tights. This was already Nijinsky in Firebird.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> have <b>never</b> a noble, No lineage counted great; Fishers and {{choppers}} and ploughmen Shall {{constitute a}} state.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever {{happens to}} your works, the dam, <b>I</b> think, <b>will</b> <b>never</b> give way," [...] {{continued}} Lumley; [...] "it {{seems to me}} unnecessarily strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--well--Nick; we {{will not}} dispute on this point, but let bye-gones be bye-gones. What has happened, has happened, and <b>I</b> hope <b>will</b> <b>never</b> occur again." ...|$|R
25|$|After a {{new record}} deal with Myrrh Records, they {{followed}} with an experimental acoustic album Swing, Swang, Swung in 1994. The album was recorded in producer's (John & Dino Elefante) garage and featured a stripped down, blues based sound. Also, the band's first Spanish album Nunca Te Dire Adiós (<b>I</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Never</b> Say Goodbye) was released in 1995—rising the band's popularity in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, {{could not think of}} a solution. For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
60|$|JONES. [Fingering the purse, half angrily.] Well, then, you stow it, old girl. The kids 'll {{get along}} better with you than when I 'm here. If <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> ha' known {{as much as}} I do now, <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> <b>never</b> ha' had one o' them. What's the use o' bringin' 'em into a state o' things like this? It's a crime, that's what it is; but you find it out too late; that's what's the matter with this 'ere world.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> no more.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> {{look over}} the {{accumulation}} before you come, and <b>I</b> hope you <b>will</b> <b>never</b> see your little friend again but in print.|$|R
25|$|Granting no {{concession}} to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally and provocatively to the court, {{and says that}} the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his moral concern for them as fellow citizens. That material wealth {{is a consequence of}} goodness; that the god does not permit a better man to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he is the social gadfly required by Athens: “All day long, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> cease to settle here, there, and everywhere — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you.” In support of the moral mission assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his daimonion continually forbids him to act unethically. That statement implicitly validates Meletus' accusation that Socrates believes in novel deities not of the Athenian pantheon.|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon {{later told}} her {{daughter}} Julie, [...] "Watergate {{is the only}} crisis that ever got me down... And I know <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> {{live to see the}} vindication." ...|$|E
500|$|In their {{respective}} capacities {{as a former}} president and a former First Lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the inauguration of Donald Trump with their daughter, Chelsea. The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, [...] "I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> stop believing in our country & its future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [*--Literally translated, {{this famous}} chant, now, I think, [...] {{published}} {{for the first}} time, which, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>will</b> <b>never</b> [...] again pass the lips of a Zulu impi, means: ...|$|R
6000|$|Polly {{clutched}} Fan at that, {{and held}} her tight, saying sternly, [...] "If you ever breathe a word, drop a hint, look a look that will tell him or any one else about me, <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> yes, as sure as my name is Mary Milton <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> proclaim from the housetops that you like Ar" [...] Polly got no further, for Fan's hand was on her mouth, and Fan's alarmed voice vehemently protested, [...] "I won't! I promise solemnly <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>never</b> {{say a word to}} a mortal creature. Don't be so fierce, Polly; you quite frighten me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{the fact}} in a fiction,--you are the truth more strange and admirable than fiction. Consent {{only to be}} what you are. <b>I</b> alone <b>will</b> <b>never</b> stand in your way." ...|$|R
