5|$|Both Douglas <b>fir</b> and Suillus lakei are {{non-native}} {{introduced species}} in Europe. The fungus {{has been found}} in several central and south European countries following the intentional introduction of Douglas <b>fir.</b> These include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia. It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic. Suillus lakei has also been reported in the South Island of New Zealand, and South America (Argentina and Chile).|$|E

(buckwheat), and Juniperus spp. (juniper).|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas <b>fir</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white <b>fir</b> (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo), Silver <b>fir</b> (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
50|$|<b>Firs</b> (Abies) are a genus of 48-56 {{species of}} {{evergreen}} coniferous {{trees in the}} family Pinaceae.

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand <b>fir</b> and Douglas <b>fir</b> dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas <b>fir</b> and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand <b>fir</b> is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand <b>fir</b> is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver <b>fir</b> and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine <b>fir,</b> Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|The forested {{sections}} {{fall into}} three major climatic zones. The west and northwest {{are dominated by}} spruce and <b>fir</b> and the southwest by redcedar and hemlock; the areas east of the Continental Divide are a combination of mixed pine, spruce, <b>fir</b> and prairie zones. The cedar-hemlock groves along the Lake McDonald valley are the easternmost examples of this Pacific climatic ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble <b>fir</b> (Abies procera), Pacific silver <b>fir</b> (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E

5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white <b>fir,</b> Douglas <b>fir,</b> and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E

50|$|Douglas <b>firs</b> are medium-size to {{extremely}} large evergreen trees, 20 - 100 m tall (although only coast Douglas <b>firs</b> reach {{such great}} height). The leaves are flat, soft, linear, 2 - 4 cm long, generally resembling {{those of the}} <b>firs,</b> occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which {{can be useful in}} recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start high off the ground. Douglas <b>firs</b> in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.|$|R
5|$|In North America, it {{is common}} east of the Rocky Mountains, but rare in the Pacific Northwest.

5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as <b>firs</b> (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas <b>firs</b> (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly <b>firs,</b> Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas <b>firs</b> as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|R

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and <b>fir,</b> and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the <b>fir,</b> and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of <b>fir</b> and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, <b>fir,</b> and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the <b>fir</b> that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
