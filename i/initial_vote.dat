5|$|Six {{men were}} {{candidates}} for the Greenback nomination. James B. Weaver, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, Benjamin F.

Chambers, a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran, was likewise nominated for vice president on the <b>initial</b> <b>vote.</b> More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over women's suffrage, Chinese immigration, {{and the extent to which}} the government should regulate working conditions.|$|E

30|$|Consider a {{cooperative}} network of M nodesa {{that are trying}} to reach consensus over the occurrence of an event. Each node has its own initial decision, based on its one-time sensing. The goal of the network is for each node to reach a decision that is equal to the majority of the <b>initial</b> <b>votes.</b> For instance, in {{a cooperative}} fire detection scenario, each node has an initial opinion as to if there is a fire or not. However, as a network, they may act based only on the majority vote. Therefore, it is desirable that every node reaches the majority of the <b>initial</b> <b>votes</b> without a group leader. As it may happen in realistic scenarios, the nodes may not have any information on their own or the others’ sensing quality. Therefore, the main goal is that each node reaches the majority of the <b>initial</b> <b>votes.</b> Considering sensing quality of the nodes is among possible extensions of this work.|$|R
5|$|On December 3, 1855, the {{legislature}} convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation {{to move the}} capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, {{the legislature}} re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask {{the people of the}} territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a runoff. The <b>initial</b> <b>vote</b> set up a runoff between Eugene and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was ignored, and the capital remained in Salem.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{district}} realignment {{after the}} 2010 census, Bilbray ran as the incumbent in the 52nd congressional district in 2012. An all-parties primary {{was held on}} June 5, 2012. A runoff between Bilbray and current Port of San Diego Commissioner Scott Peters, a Democrat, was held on November 6. The <b>initial</b> <b>vote</b> was very close, so that a winner was not declared until ten days after the election as provisional ballots were counted. On November 16, with Peters ahead by 51% to 49%, Bilbray conceded defeat.|$|E
25|$|In August, 2015, San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos {{announced}} plans to introduce an ordinance that would set a “San Francisco Right-of-Way Policy” that would make citations for bicyclists who safely yield at stop signs the lowest law enforcement priority. Running a stop sign would still be illegal, but the police would be discouraged from enforcing it, making this a proxy for a stop-as-yield law. The bill was passed in an <b>initial</b> <b>vote</b> by the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2015. However, on January 20, 2016, the Mayor vetoed the bill.|$|E
25|$|Stevenson ran for Governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986, losing both {{elections}} to James R. Thompson.

Stevenson promptly petitioned the Illinois Supreme Court for a recount and presented evidence of widespread election irregularities, including {{evidence of a}} failed punch card system for tabulation of votes. Three days before the gubernatorial inauguration, the court denied the recount by a one-vote margin, asserting that the Illinois recount statute was unconstitutional.|$|E

[...] NARAS replaced the nomination with the song with the next highest <b>initial</b> <b>vote</b> count, [...] "All is Love", which was written by Karen O and Nick Zinner for the film Where the Wild Things Are. Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a D+. His review consisted solely of two motivational posters: one reading [...] "Life: Its not about the destination, but the journey" [...] to describe the song's content, and a mock poster reading [...] "Success: Everything is easy when you're cute" [...] for his actual review. He later expanded his review, calling it [...] "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn’t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification". Milliken gave the song a higher grade because [...] "she’s a pretty good singer for someone her age".|$|E

Although a 75% voter turnout was recorded, observers reported many irregularities and abuses across the country, such as organized multiple voting and extra votes for Yanukovych after the polls closed.
