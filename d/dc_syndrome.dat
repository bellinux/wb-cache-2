40|$|International audienceTwo cases (a {{young male}} and a girl, {{suffering}} intractable epilepsy) of diffuse subcortical laminar heterotopia, or so-called double cortex (DC) {{have been investigated}} using magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG confirmed involvement of both cortices (hetero- and normocortex) in the genesis of interictal spikes, and, according to the heterogeneity of <b>DC</b> <b>syndrome,</b> some differences were observed: spike initiation in the normocortex and latter involvement of the heterotopic cortex in the man, and rather a cancellation in both cortices in the girl. In addition, participation of heterotopic cortex in physiological activities could be demonstrated in the man...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – Cortical dysgenesis is {{increasingly}} recognised {{as a cause}} of epilepsy. We report a case with double cortex heterotopia and secondarily generalized seizures with a generalised spike wave pattern. During the course of the disease, the child developed electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep. From the first examination, sleep pattern revealed increased frequency and amplitude of spindle activity, more evident in anterior areas. The role of the thalamocortical pathway in increased sleep spindle activity is discussed with emphasis on the possible role of altered thalamocortical pathways in abnormal cortical migration. A strong suspicion of cortical dysgenesis may therefore be based on specific EEG sleep patterns. Key words: sleep, spindles, epilepsy, EEG, cortical dysgenesis, double cortex syndrome Double cortex (<b>DC)</b> <b>syndrome,</b> i. e. sub-cortical laminar heterotopia, is a rare genetic disorder of neuronal migratio...|$|E
40|$|Dyskeratosis {{congenital}} (DC) {{is a rare}} condition {{characterized by}} reticulate skin hyperpigmentation, mucosal leukoplakia, and nail dystrophy. More serious features are bone marrow involvement with pancytopenia and a predisposition to malignancy. The purpose of this case report is to describe the oral and dental findings in children with <b>DC</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A 10 -year-old male diagnosed with DC was admitted because of extensive caries and toothache. Inadequate oral hygiene and extensive caries were observed in oral examination of the patient. Plaque accumulation was seen in gingival border of maxillary teeth. Papillary atrophy on the tongue was observed. Short and blunted roots of mandible incisors and upper and lower molars were determined on the radiographic examination. Dryness on the lips and commisuras, ectropion on his eyes, and epiphora were observed. Hematologic tests were performed and showed aplastic anemia {{at the age of}} 2. At the age of 4, the bone marrow transplantation was performed. Dermatological findings occurred after the bone marrow transplantation. The skin of the patient was thin, dry, and wrinkled in some areas. He had palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and syndactylia on his fingers. Endodontic treatment procedures were applied and other extensive caries are still being restored. The patient will be given full preventive care during regular follow-up. Oral hygiene was improved to the optimum level...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes are {{critical}} regulators and effectors of innate and adaptive immune responses. Monocyte expansion {{has been described}} in many pathological states while monocyte and <b>DC</b> deficiency <b>syndromes</b> are relatively recent additions to the catalogue of human primary immunodeficiency disorders. Clinically applicable screening tests to diagnose and monitor these conditions are lacking. Conventional strategies for identifying human DCs and monocytes {{have been based on}} the use of a lineage gate to exclude lymphocytes, thus preventing simultaneous detection of DCs, monocytes and lymphocyte subsets. Here we demonstrate that CD 4 is a reliable lineage marker for the human peripheral blood antigen presenting cell compartment {{that can be used to}} identify DCs and monocytes in parallel with lymphocytes. Based on this principle, simple modification of a standard lymphocyte phenotyping assay permits simultaneous enumeration of four lymphocyte and five DC/monocyte populations from a single sample. This approach is applicable to clinical samples and facilitates the diagnosis of DC and monocyte disorders in a wide range of clinical settings, including genetic deficiency, neoplasia and inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the X-linked gene doublecortin lead to “double cortex ” <b>syndrome</b> (<b>DC)</b> {{in females}} and to X-linked {{lissencephaly}} (XLIS) in males. Because most patients with DC and XLIS are sporadic, representing de novo double-cortin mutations, we considered {{that some of}} these patients could be somatic or germline mosaics. Among a population of 20 patients and their families, we found evidence for mosaic doublecortin mutations in 6 individuals. Germline mosaicism was identified in two unaffected women, each with two affected children. Additionally, one affected male with DC was found to be a somatic mosaic, which presumably spared him from the more severe phenotype of lissencephaly. The high rate of mosaicism indicates {{that there may be a}} significant recurrence risk for DC/XLIS in families at risk, even when the mother is unaffected...|$|R
40|$|Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), {{also known}} as double cortex <b>syndrome</b> (<b>DC),</b> is listed as a "rare disease" by the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center of the National Institutes of Health with an {{incidence}} of 1 to 200, 000 people in the population. The cause of the disease is mutation in the DCX gene ({{also known as}} DBCN, XLIS) on chromosome Xq 22. 3 -q 23. SBH is an X-linked dominant disorder. Traditionally, genetic testing for SBH {{has been done in}} the order of the probability of detection of mutation according to the radiologic features, but the success rate could be variable with this time-consuming approach. In this study, novel mutation chrX: 110644366 C>A in the DCX gene was identified in a 4 -year-old Russian girl with sporadic SBH. The present report demonstrates that whole-exome sequencing may be a useful tool for the identification of previously known and de novo mutations in children with SBH as well as malformations of cortical development. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of amaurosis and paresis was observed amongst sheep, and occasionally cattle, {{which had been}} grazing on pastures consisting mainly of Helichrysum argyrosphaerum <b>DC.</b> A similar <b>syndrome</b> was produced by feeding the suspect plant to sheep, thereby providing proof of its toxicity. Although none of the sheep became blind and only one developed paralysis, typical spongy lesions were detected in the brains and optic fasciculi of all the experimental animals. The lesion had specific predilection sites, such as the white matter around the lateral ventricles, the optic tracts plus chiasm, the pyramidal tracts and the brachium pontis. Enlargement of the optic fasciculi furthermore gave rise to malacia, papilloedema and retinal changes. Some aged sheep developed cataracts approximately 2 - 3 months after the initial outbreaks of amaurosis had occurred. Circumstantial and histopathological {{evidence suggests that the}} cataracts may be due to chronic Helichrysum poisoning, but this could not be confirmed in the present investigation.

40|$|The Protection of telomeres 1 (POT 1) {{protein is}} a {{single-stranded}} telomere binding protein {{that is essential}} for proper maintenance of telomere length. Disruption of POT 1 function leads to chromosome instability and loss of cellular viability. Here, we show that targeted deletion of the mouse Pot 1 b gene results in increased apoptosis in highly proliferative tissues. In the setting of telomerase haploinsufficiency, loss of Pot 1 b results in depletion of germ cells and complete bone marrow failure due to increased apoptosis, culminating in premature death. Pot 1 b−/− mTR+/− hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells display markedly reduced survival potential in vitro. Accelerated telomere shortening, increased G overhang and elevated number of chromosome end-to-end fusions that initiate an ATR-dependent DNA damage response were also observed. These results indicate an essential role for Pot 1 b in the maintenance of genome integrity and the long-term viability of proliferative tissues {{in the setting of}} telomerase deficiency. Interestingly, these phenotypes closely resemble those found in the human disease dyskeratosis congenita (<b>DC),</b> an inherited <b>syndrome</b> characterized by bone marrow failure, hyperpigmentation, and nail dystrophy. We anticipate that this mouse will serve as a useful model to further understand the pathophysiology of DC...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic linear {{chromosomes}} face {{two problems}} that pose threats to genome integrity: (i) the end-protection problem, in which chromosome ends {{are recognized as}} double-stranded breaks by DNA damage responses, and (ii) the end-replication problem, in which loss of the chromosome extreme ends occurs in each cell division due to failure of DNA polymerases to replicate these termini. The shelterin complex solves both the end-protection problem and regulates access of telomerase to solve the end-replication problem. Decreased telomerase activity in stem cells causes dyskeratosis congenita (DC), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by telomere lengths < 1 st percentile. Accordingly, germline mutations in telomerase subunit genes (TERC and TERT) or telomerase biogenesis genes (DKC 1, NOP 10, NHP 2, and WRAP 53) are commonly associated with DC. Mutations in telomere biology genes (TINF 2, CTC 1, and RTEL 1) are also observed in DC. In ~ 30 % of DC cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. TPP 1, encoded by the ACD gene, is {{a component of the}} shelterin complex. Like other shelterin proteins, TPP 1 protects the ends of chromosomes from illicit fusion events. In addition, TPP 1 is uniquely responsible for recruiting telomerase to telomeres. A group of amino acids on the surface of TPP 1, termed the TEL patch, is critical for telomerase recruitment and telomerase processivity. These functions of TPP 1 make it an excellent candidate for harboring causative mutations of DC. Here, I report the identification of a single-amino acid deletion in the TEL patch and a missense mutation in the TIN 2 -binding domain of TPP 1 in a patient suffering from a severe variant of <b>DC,</b> Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson <b>syndrome.</b> I further showed that the deletion abrogates both telomerase recruitment and enzymatic processivity, whereas the missense mutation does not {{have a significant effect on}} these functions. The missense mutation, on the other hand, inhibits the interaction between TPP 1 and TIN 2, another shelterin component responsible for recruitment of TPP 1 to telomeres. Therefore, inhibition of this interaction may exert an indirect effect on the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres due to reduced TPP 1. Thus, I propose that both the single-amino acid deletion and the missense mutation contribute to the severe phenotype of the proband...|$|R
40|$|Between 1984 and 1988, 21 {{patients}} underwent catheter ablation {{for drug}} refractory arrhythmias. Nine patients presented atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia, nine had supraventricular tachycardia (one AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, one reciprocating tachycardia due to concealed accessory pathway and seven WPW syndrome). Three had ventricular tachycardia. Fourteen patients {{were treated with}} direct current shock ablation (DC) and seven patients with radiofrequency ablation (RF). Eight patients underwent ablation of the His bundle. In six patients permanent AV block could be induced and in two first-degree AV block. All became asymptomatic (two with additional antiarrhythmic drug therapy). In four patients with WPW <b>syndrome</b> <b>DC</b> ablation of the accessory pathway was attempted. In one patient a permanent block in the accessory pathway and in another an intermittent block were obtained. In the two remaining patients with accessory pathways the ablation failed to interrupt the retrograde conduction: in one the retrograde conduction was modified; however, in the other no change could be demonstrated. Two patients underwent ventricular foci ablation, with one partial success (arrhythmia controlled with associated drug therapy) and one failure. Three patients had RF His bundle ablation (two for atrial flutter and one for atrial fibrillation). One complete atrioventricular block, one first degree AV block and one first degree AV block associated with right bundle branch block were induced. Recurrence of tachyarrhythmias was prevented only in the patient with complete atrioventricular block. RF ablation of accessory pathway was performed in three patients.
