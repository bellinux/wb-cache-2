25|$|The fan and <b>fly-whisk</b> are items used {{to comfort}} and cool, an {{important}} accessory for a divine king {{especially in a}} tropical country. The Royal Fan (พัดวาลวิชนี) was created by order of King Rama I. The fan is gilded with gold, the handle enamelled in green and red. Traditionally a fan was made by bending a talipot palm's frond at a right angle; the royal fan mimics this traditional form. The Royal <b>Fly-whisk</b> of the yak's tail (พระแส้หางจามรี) {{was made in the}} reign of King Rama IV to augment the five items of the regalia. Evidently associated with the same idea of divine comfort as the fan, it is actually derived from the ancient chāmara of India. According to tradition, the <b>fly-whisk</b> was used by the king to repel any maleficent forces that might bring discomfort to his subjects. The hair on the royal <b>fly-whisk</b> has since been replaced by those of a white elephant.|$|E

On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul—whom the dey had hit with a <b>fly-whisk</b> when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants—a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fly-whisks</b> are in use {{in parts}} of the {{contemporary}} Middle East, such as Egypt, by some classes of society, e.g. outdoor merchants and shop keepers, especially in summer when flies become bothersome. Those have a wooden handle and plant fibers attached to them. The more expensive ones are made from horse hair. In the eastern parts of the Indian subcontinent it is made from the tail-hairs of the yak.|$|R

60|$|This king held a bow in {{his hand}} with an arrow set upon its string, just as I did, for we were out hunting, and as I shall have to narrate presently, lions are no respecters of persons. By his side, leaning {{against the back of}} the chariot, was a tall, sharp-pointed wand of cedar wood with a knob of some green {{precious}} stone, probably an emerald, fashioned to the likeness of an apple. This was the royal sceptre. Immediately behind the chariot walked several great nobles. One of them carried a golden footstool, another a parasol, furled at the moment; another a spare bow and a quiver of arrows, and another a jewelled <b>fly-whisk</b> made of palm fibre.|$|E
60|$|The horse {{family of}} the present day is divided, like most other families, into two factions, which may be {{described}} for variety's sake {{as those of the}} true horses and the donkeys, these latter including also the zebras, quaggas, and various other unfamiliar creatures whose names, in very choice Latin, are only known to the more diligent visitors at the Sunday Zoo. Now everybody must have noticed that the chief broad distinction between these two great groups consists in the feathering of the tail. The domestic donkey, with his near congeners, the zebra and co., have smooth short-haired tails, ending in a single bunch or <b>fly-whisk</b> of long hairs collected together in a tufted bundle at the extreme tip. The horse, on the other hand, besides having horny patches or callosities on both fore and hind legs, while the donkeys have them on the fore legs only, has a hairy tail, in which the long hairs are almost equally distributed from top to bottom, thus giving it its peculiarly bushy and brushy appearance. But Prjevalsky's horse, as one would naturally expect from an early intermediate form, stands half-way in this respect between the two groups, and acts the thankless part of a family mediator; for it has most of its long tail-hairs collected in a final flourish, like the donkey, but several of them spring from the middle distance, as in the genuine Arab, though never from the very top, thus showing an approach to the true horsey habit without actually attaining that final pinnacle of equine glory. So far as one can make out from the somewhat rude handicraft of my prehistoric Phidias the horse of the quaternary epoch had much the same caudal peculiarity; his tail was bushy, but only in the lower half. He was still in the intermediate stage between horse and donkey, a natural mule still struggling up aspiringly toward perfect horsehood. In all other matters the two creatures--the cave man's horse and Prjevalsky's--closely agree. Both display large heads, thick necks, coarse manes, and a general disregard of 'points' which would strike disgust and dismay into the stout breasts of Messrs. Tattersall. In fact over a T.Y.C. it may be confidently asserted, in the pure Saxon of the sporting papers, that Prjevalsky's and the cave man's lot wouldn't be in it. Nevertheless a candid critic would be forced to admit that, in spite of clumsiness, they both mean staying.|$|E

500|$|Wildebeest provide several {{useful animal}} products. The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard. Wildebeest are killed for food, {{especially}} to make biltong in Southern Africa. This dried game meat is a delicacy {{and an important}} food item in Africa. The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is the most tender during the autumn season. Wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find. Cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into 11 pieces. The estimated price for wildebeest meat was about US$0.47 per kilogram around 2008. The silky, flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make <b>fly-whisks</b> or [...] "chowries".|$|R

It is also used as an accessory in the ritual aspects of folk performance traditions, especially folk-theatre forms like Palagaan where it can double as a prop.|$|E
500|$|Though {{they are}} not present in their natural habitat in such large numbers today, black {{wildebeest}} were at one time the main herbivores in the ecosystem and a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. Nowadays they are economically important for human beings as they are a major tourist attraction {{as well as providing}} animal products such as leather and meat. The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard. Wildebeest meat is dried to make biltong, an important part of South African cuisine. The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is at its best during the autumn season. The wildebeest can provide ten times as much meat as the Thomson's gazelle.

5000|$|When {{the king}} goes forth he rides upon an elephant. He is {{accompanied}} by banners, <b>fly-whisks,</b> flags and drums and he is shaded with a white parasol. The soldiers of his guard are well-appointed. The inhabitants of the country say that their state was founded more than four hundred years ago. Subsequently the descendants became weaker, but in the king's household {{there was a man}} of virtue to whom the populace turned. When the king heard of this he imprisoned this man, but his chains snapped unaccountably. The king took him for a supernatural being and, not daring to injure him, exiled him from the country, whereupon he fled to India. The king of India gave him his eldest daughter in marriage. Not long afterwards, when the king of Lang-ya died, the chief ministers welcomed back the exile and made him king. Liangshu, translation by Paul Wheatley ...|$|R
50|$|Scholars are {{appointed}} by the temple to read various religious texts. One of them {{referred to as the}} Bhagavata Vishyam Pandit, along with six adhyapakas (teachers) recite the Dravida Prabandha text daily. These people belong to the Vaishnavite families of Simhachalam. Scholars who read out chapters from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Bhagavata Purana are known as Parayandars (Parayana reading pandits). Apart from these, vedic scholars are also appointed for regular recital of the Rigveda, Samaveda, and Yajurveda. In the medieval period, a group of sanis or devadasis used to perform four important tasks: performing dance and music, singing mangalagitas and namasankirtanas, waving <b>fly-whisks</b> to the deity, and cleaning and decorating the temple's premises. They were looked upon with respect as the temple's dancers. Women were either gifted as sanis or voluntarily dedicated themselves for the same. They either remained unmarried (referred to as the sampradaya sanis) or had an independent marital life, working in the temple on a part-time basis. At present, the temple does not encourage the presence of such dancers.|$|R
