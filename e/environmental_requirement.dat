The SRA also has an overarching responsibility {{for the state of}} the environment in the road transport sector. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the implementation of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in SRA road maintenance contracts and to develop an improved model for the implementation of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements,</b> making it easier for the SRA to establish an optimal contracting strategy for routine road maintenance. Using several qualitative methodologies, the thesis is mainly based on a content analysis of 18 tender documents, two case studies consisting of five cases and a questionnaire. The study shows that the SRA have stipulated <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in procurements of routine road maintenance since 1997. The formulation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> was initially carried out at the Regional Road Management Directorates. However, in the case of trucks and construction vehicles relevant organisations were given the opportunity to actively participate in the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements.</b> The contractors in the study fulfil about three-quarters of the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in the contracts. The main reasons for not complying with the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> are: i) absence of consultation with municipalities and competent authorities, and ii) inadequate communication of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> to subcontractors. The benefit to the environment of laying down <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> for road maintenance is difficult to assess, due to unclear <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> {{and the fact that the}} SRA does not systematically follow up the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements.</b> The findings of the research indicate that the SRA have made a serious effort to integrate environmental aspects in their maintenance contracts through the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements.</b> However, the SRA need to adopt a more systematic approach towards road maintenance contracts in order to make green procurement an effective tool for environmental adaptation of road maintenance. The thesis proposes an improved process for development, implementation and follow-up of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements.</b> The proposed process can be summarised in five criteria that need to be fulfilled in order to achieve an environmentally efficient application of environmental requirements: i) the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> have to be based on legislation, environmental quality objectives, identified environmental problems and/or research, ii) environmental indicators and baselines have to be established in order to facilitate follow-up of compliance with the <b>requirements,</b> iii) the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> have to be stated clearly in order to limit misinterpretations and to facilitate follow-up, iv) the contractors have to develop working processes, routines and training based on the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements,</b> v) routines for following-up compliance with the <b>requirements</b> and the <b>environmental</b> effectiveness need to be developed, and there has to be a feedback of the results. Furthermore, the purchasing function needs to be integrated with the implementation of the contracts. Although, having faced several problems during the introduction of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements,</b> the SRA have managed to meet the main arguments that are used for justification of green procurement. However, if slightly changed, the process of green procurement has the potential of becoming an important tool in the work for enhancing the environmental performance of the SRA. QC 2010101...|$|R

However, while a low level of encouragement of participation hinders employees from the exchange with coworkers and leaders, the efficacy of networking on social capital acquirement will be impaired.

40|$|Mombasa and Kisite Mpunguti marine {{national}} parks and reserves (hereinafter ‘Mombasa MNPR’ and ‘Kisite Mpunguti MNPR’) consist of biodiversity rich ecosystems such as coral reefs and sea grass beds, with high ecological and economical value. Marine tourist activities taking place within these areas are connected with a risk of harming the marine environment. Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR have the objectives of conserving marine biodiversity as well as supporting tourism. In order to properly integrate these objectives, {{it is important that}} marine tourist activities are adequately regulated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how marine tourist activities, directly influencing the marine environment in Kisite Mpunguti MNPR and Mombasa MNPR, are regulated. An investigation is made of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements,</b> in legal rules as well as more informal norms (e. g. codes of conduct), and how these requirements are enforced. A legal investigation has been performed through a judicial dogmatic methodology and empirical findings have been collected through semi-structured interviews during a minor field study in Kenya. The findings of the study illustrate the roles of <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in legal rules as well as more informal norms in regulating marine tourist activities in Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR. Legal <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> that tourists and tourist activity organizers must comply with during marine tourist activities are primarily identified in provisions prescribing offences under the Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act and the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act, 1999. Other legal <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> could also have a role in regulating marine tourist activities, but this appears unclear. It might for example be possible to prescribe legal <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in licenses or permissions, but it seems uncertain whether this is done in practice. Furthermore, the findings show that it is mainly Kenya Wildlife Service (hereinafter ‘KWS’), of the studied government agencies, that enforces legal <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in relation to marine tourist activities taking place in Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR. The enforcement is primarily performed through supervision, education, collaboration with tourist activity organizers, warnings and suspension. KWS appears to enforce <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in legal rules as well as more informal norms. Some of these <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> are applied by KWS in Mombasa MNPR as well as Kisite Mpunguti MNPR, meanwhile other requirements differ between the areas. The findings also show that, in Mombasa MNPR, <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in norms of tourist activity organizers have a role in regulating marine tourist activities. Tourist activity organizers as well as KWS seem involved in enforcing these <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements.</b> Finally, the findings illustrate that <b>environmental</b> <b>requirements</b> in different types of norms (legal rules and more informal norms) seem to interact in the regulation of marine tourist activities in Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR...|$|R

NASA is entering a period of increase in its number of planetary missions and {{it is important to understand}} how our qualification requirements will evolve with and track these new environments. Environmental conditions are described for NASA projects in several ways for the different periods of the mission life cycle. At the beginning, the mission manager defines survivability requirements based on the mission length, orbit, launch date, launch vehicle, and other factors. such as the use of reactor engines. Margins are then applied to these values (temperature extremes, vibration extremes, radiation tolerances, etc,) and a new set of conditions is generalized for design requirements. Mission assurance documents will then assign an additional margin for reliability, and a third set of values is provided for during testing. A fourth set of environmental condition values may evolve intermittently from heritage hardware that has been tested to a level beyond the actual mission requirement. These various sets of environment figures can make it quite confusing and difficult to capture common hardware environmental requirements. <b>Environmental</b> <b>requirement</b> information can be found in a wide variety of places. The most obvious is with the individual projects. We can easily get answers to questions about temperature extremes being used and radiation tolerance goals, but it is more difficult to map the answers to the process that created these requirements: for design, for qualification, and for actual environment with no margin applied.

40|$|The {{results of}} a survey show that {{both public and private}} {{building}} clients in Sweden, to varying extents, include environmental requirements in their procurement documents. The requirements identified have been classified into six categories primarily related to building and demolition waste, building material, contractors' environmental work, ecological aspects, construction work and other. One conclusion is that requirements regarding the separation of waste and a contractor's environmental policy are considered important, since they are stipulated in the majority of projects. Another finding is that requirements related to operation and especially to energy use are not considered sufficiently. Structured interviews were conducted with three of the clients who at that time of the survey had developed the most complete procurement documents with regard to environmental requirements. The aim of the interviews was to investigate how the stipulation of requirements, the evaluation of environmental aspects and the verification of environmental requirements were carried out.

Humidifiers are used to maintain the pre-set humidity levels in a conditioned space by introducing steam or atomized water into the space. An WAC system containing both electric humidifier and air side economizer cycle can appear to be energy efficient, but {{has the potential of}} being inefficient due to lack of proper controls. The economizer, which often operates independently of the humidifier, introduces large quantities of cool and dry ambient air into the space to reduce the mechanical cooling energy, but because of the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirement</b> of the space, the air has to be humidified. The humidification energy could offset the energy savings from the reduction in mechanical cooling energy. The solution for this potential problem is a control scheme that makes the operation of the economizer and electric humidifier interdependent.

40|$|Abstract: Sustainable product {{development}} (SPD) requires that product designs achieve minimal or zero environmental impacts, {{in addition to}} satisfying the traditional design criteria, such as product functionality, quality, features, costs, and time to market. Environmental evaluations must, therefore, {{be incorporated into the}} design stage. In this research, a product design process model is proposed that includes three design requirements, two design tasks, and three comprehensive assessment streams. The functional requirement is derived from the customers’ needs, reflecting the product’s functional purpose; the <b>environmental</b> <b>requirement</b> reflects society’s need for protecting natural resources and the environment; and, the economic requirement ensures the company’s basic business goals. Accordingly, SPD aims to simultaneously carry out the two tasks of designing products ’ physical and lifecycle structures. In the assessment phase of product design, three assessment streams, including lifecycle quality (LCQ) analysis, lifecycle assessment (LCA) and lifecycle cost (LCC), are conducted with respect to the functional, environmental, and economic evaluations. A process-based analysis concept is proposed for the analysis of LCQ, LCA, and LCC evaluations. A simplified LCA is used for the environmental evaluations. Detailed assessment techniques are also developed for effective design evaluations. A case study example is provided to illustrate the methods and models.

Different parameters such as pH, flotation time, different collectors, distilled water, tap water, and different salts were investigated to achieve a high separation efficiency.

Results of flotation revealed that 63 % by weight of the input dredged sediment can be safely and successfully separated, thus, meeting the standard <b>environmental</b> <b>requirement</b> of current Flemish (Belgium) regulation "bodemsaneringsdecreet" (February 1995). This dredged fraction could not be achieved before a flotation time of 15 min. Increasing flotation time would impart less metal content but with a lower yield. In the case of applying the settling technique, 55 % by weight of the dredged sample meeting the same standard specification was obtained. Results are explained in the light of a model, which assumes that sediment contains organic matter together with heavy metals, clay, and sand.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimate of}} the availability of crop residue resources is very important for the development of bioenergy in China, a large agricultural nation. Previous efforts to evaluate the bioenergy potential from converting straws to energy were mainly based on agricultural statistical data on the provincial/county level. Straw yield calculations generated by most of those works significantly overstate the amount of crop straws for ignoring <b>environmental</b> <b>requirement</b> and harvest constrain. The paper presents a GIS-based approach for the assessment of the availability and distribution of crop residues in China, taking into account a number of conservation issues: resources (total amount, spatial and temporal distribution), economy (transportation costs), environment, and technology. All data are converted into unified geographic unit (100 m x 100 m pixels), and integrated analysis is implemented with GIS software. The results indicate that considering conservation requirements, the production of net available crop residues is about 505. 5 million tons per year. The bioenergy potential is about 253. 7 million tons standard coal per year (7. 4 EJ/year), which account for 8. 27 % of total energy consumption of the country in 2009. The results and dataset will present significant support for energy planning both at national and regional scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
