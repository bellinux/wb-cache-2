40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of civil engineering structures in karst regions confronts many problems due to unpredictable location, dimensions and geometry of the karst structure and voids. Karst terrain {{is one of the}} most intricate grounds to be assessed for civil engineering purposes. Conventional methods of site exploration like desk studies, site reconnaissance, borings, test pits, geophysical techniques, have their advantages and disadvantages; none of them are 100 % accurate; therefore they should be used in concert, adapted to each project, the available budget and the undertaken risk. As not two sides are identical in karst, site investigation should be tailored to each site. Factors that should be considered when designing site investigation in karst are: maturity of karst landforms, depth of the karst features, overburden thickness, lateral extent of the karst features, hydrogeology of the area, laoding, etc. The main problems confronted by engineers designing structures on or in karst terrain are: difficulties in excavation and <b>grading</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> over pinnacled rockheads; collapse of the roof over subsurface voids, subsidence of cover soil over sinkhole, difficulties in founding a structure over an irregular or pinnacled rockhead, loss of water from dam reservoirs, pollution of groundwater, etc. ...|$|E

The Corps of Engineers was also ready to connect the water and sewer lines, <b>grade</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> and roads, and install plantings and sod. During the next nine months, these items were all finished, and the interior painted. The masonry approaches were also completed, and the roadways and sidewalks paved. The G.B.

40|$|Abstract: Gear form {{grinding}} is a finish machining method for hard tooth {{surface with a}} form wheel. Wheel dressing is an important process in gear {{form grinding}}, and affects the precision of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> gear directly. Based on the envelope theory the mathematical model of the dressed wheel surface {{was built in the}} case of wheel dressing errors. Then the real profile of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> tooth in <b>the</b> transverse plan was solved and its deviations from the designed profile were evaluated. Finally the effects of each dressing error on the precision of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> gear were analyzed using the proposed mathematical model. The results provided theoretical foundation for the precision control during manufacturing a gear form grinding machine. A grinding experiment was implemented using the gear form grinding machine and <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> gear was measured by a three-coordinate measuring machine.

50|$|Berwick's first {{secondary}} school was the private Berwick Academy, established in South Berwick in 1798.

It was destroyed in June 1927 by a fire started in its boiler while classes were in session. The present building was constructed in 1927-28, with classes held in the interim at the local Knights of Pythias hall.

When <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> ring is a perfect field, and the given morphism behaves nicely with respect to covering theory (as do irreducible morphisms with indecomposable domain or indecomposable codomain), it is shown that the degree of the morphism is finite if and only if its associated natural transformation has a representable kernel. As a corollary, generalisations of known results on the degrees of irreducible morphisms over perfect fields are given. Finally, this study is applied to the composition of paths of irreducible morphisms in relationship to the powers of the radical...|$|R
