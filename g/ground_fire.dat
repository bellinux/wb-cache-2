5|$|At 09:12, JG 2 {{crossed the}} front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an {{enormous}} volume of Allied <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> The entire area was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artillery, since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting, but also had been attacked by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that it had been}} impossible for any passenger aboard the Hughes Airwest DC-9 to survive the collision, disintegration, and crash of the aircraft. Though a severe <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> ravaged both crash sites, the NTSB {{determined that}} all of the victims had died in the crash itself.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew {{with five}} Olympus engines, the {{standard}} four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 {{destined for the}} BAC TSR-2 in an underslung nacelle. This aircraft was destroyed in a <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> at Filton on 3 December 1962.|$|E
30|$|Fire is {{the primary}} tool used to manage {{mountain}} date palm populations for harvest. Harvesters in some areas report setting <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> to remove palm leaves that are too old and damaged to be harvested, while promoting the growth of new leaves (see also Roveta 2008). Harvesters also benefit from low-intensity <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> set by livestock herders to promote fodder or from accidental fires that spread. Harvesters report {{that the quality of}} palm leaves is higher after <b>ground</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>fires</b> are fed by {{subterranean}} roots, duff {{and other}} buried organic matter. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. <b>Ground</b> <b>fires</b> typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as peat fires in Kalimantan and Eastern Sumatra, Indonesia, which {{resulted from a}} riceland creation project that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.|$|R

5|$|During {{the course}} of 1942, the ZNDH flew some 4,800 sorties, of which 30% were combat missions, with 35 {{aircraft}} being lost. Of these losses, 19 were to Partisan <b>ground</b> <b>fire,</b> 12 to accidents and four deserted. By {{the end of the}} year the ZNDH aircraft park consisted of 191 aircraft, formed into 14 squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Geschwaderkommodore Major Gerhard Michalski {{commanded}} the force. Five pilots {{were shot down}} by <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended up near Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed. Reduced in number, 8–10 fighters of IV./JG 4 continued to their target. After 10 minutes, they located a fairly large airfield and attacked, believing it to be Le Culot. It was in fact Sint-Truiden.|$|E
5|$|No. 351 Squadron flew {{its first}} mission on 13 October 1944; it {{involved}} six aircraft attacking an Axis supply convoy {{near the village}} of Aržano. On 20 October, aircraft from the squadron, supported by Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, conducted rocket and strafing attacks on enemy columns near Metković that were withdrawing {{in the face of the}} advancing Partisan 26th Dalmatian Division. The mission was a success, but one aircraft was lost to <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>Fires</b> burn {{in natural}} litter, duff, roots or {{sometimes}} high organic soils. Once started {{they are very}} difficult to detect and control.|$|R

25|$|Lieutenant Trollope {{and his men}} withdrew along Davis Street, {{running behind}} the houses with Argentine Marines in hot pursuit, and went to <b>ground</b> <b>firing</b> up the road when it became obvious they could not reach Government House.|$|R
5|$|On 12 March Braham and Gregory were {{returning}} from a 1000-mile trip and were hit by <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> over Bayeux. They nursed the Mosquito back to England on one engine—the other having burned out. Just two days later he attended Buckingham Palace where he was awarded a second bar to his DFC from George VI. Both Braham's wife Joan and his father attended.|$|E
5|$|Some of No. 111 Squadron dived {{onto the}} Dorniers, but one Hurricane was shot down, {{either by the}} Dorniers or British <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> Pilot Flight Lieutenant Stanley Connors was killed. The rest pulled up and away to avoid {{friendly}} fire. They flew to {{the northern edge of}} the airfield to catch the raiders as they emerged. Two Hurricanes from No. 615 were taking off under the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Dorniers were {{to carry}} twenty 110-lb bombs each {{fitted with a}} fuse that would allow for {{function}} if released from 50 feet or higher; the type of bomb previously used by the Staffel had to release from twice this height, making the unit's Do 17s correspondingly more vulnerable to <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighting}} of <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> killed the larvae of acorn moths and acorn weevils by burning them during their dormancy {{period in the}} soil. The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak's acorns.|$|R
5000|$|Older {{installations}} {{are known}} to cause fires in areas where falling large trees or branches regularly cause breaks in lines and or in insulation leading to short circuits which can then lead to burning insulation dripping to ground and starting <b>ground</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. <b>Ground</b> <b>fires</b> spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|R
5|$|The {{campaign}} ended {{after the}} French surrender on 25 June 1940. Allied air power had been ineffective and disorganised, {{and as a}} result, Stuka losses were mainly due to <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> Some 120 machines, one-third of the Stuka force, were destroyed or damaged by all causes from 10 May to 25 June 1940.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} air {{activity}} over German-held territory. RAF Bomber Command flew 92 sorties against German invasion targets at Boulogne, Calais, Ostend, Dunkirk, and Antwerp. The remaining sorties were directed at Brussels marshalling yards, Hamm and Krefeld. One Armstrong Whitworth Whitley failed to return. It {{was lost to}} <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> over the Netherlands. A total of 157 sorties were flown overall. By the September 1940, some 10–13% of invasion barges had been sunk.|$|E
5|$|Altogether JG 1 lost 25 {{pilots and}} 29 {{aircraft}}. This return for around 60 enemy aircraft (54 on the ground) cannot {{be considered a}} complete success, although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant. Just nine of the fighters lost by JG 1 are confirmed to have been shot down in combat with Spitfires. It is possible a further three were shot down by Spitfires, or perhaps <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> Two Spitfires were shot down and destroyed, with two more damaged. One pilot of each Squadron (308 and 317) was killed. The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32.|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} before European {{settlement}} (i. e., before 1900) {{the structure of}} the old-growth forests in the drier Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forest types of the Rocky Mountain Trench were quite different than they are today. In pre-settlement times, light <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> swept through these area...|$|R
50|$|The Zeros came in {{strafing}} immediately afterward. I saw two Brewsters {{trying to}} fight the Zeros. One was shot down {{and the other was}} saved by <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> covering his tail. Both looked like they were tied to a string while the Zeros made passes at them.|$|R
50|$|The first launch, of Viking 1, on 3 May 1949 {{came after}} a very {{prolonged}} and trying period of <b>ground</b> <b>firing</b> tests, and attained an altitude of 50 mi. The altitude was limited by a premature engine cut-off, eventually traced to steam leakage from the turbine casing.|$|R
5|$|Altogether, the Luftwaffe lost between 69 and 71 {{aircraft}} {{destroyed or}} {{damaged beyond repair}} {{as a result of}} its operations over Britain on 18 August 1940. Of this total, 59 were lost to certain or probable action by fighters while two fell to <b>ground</b> <b>fire,</b> four to a combination of both and one collided with a British training aircraft. The remaining three crashed in German-held territory owing to technical failures. Altogether, the losses represented seven per cent of the force committed. Around 29 aircraft crashed in England. Personnel losses were 94 German crews killed, 40 captured and 25 returned with wounds. Some 27 to 31 German aircraft returned with damage.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, however, {{a second}} attempt to {{resupply}} B Company {{resulted in an}} Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy <b>ground</b> <b>fire,</b> and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply.|$|E
5|$|Between 27 and 34 RAF {{fighters were}} destroyed. A {{specialist}} {{source of the}} battle indicated the figure to be 31 destroyed or beyond repair. Of these, 25 fell to German fighters, two to return fire from the bombers. One was shot down by British <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> in error {{and the loss of}} the remainder cannot be established. Some 26 of the fighters lost were Hurricanes, and five were Spitfires. Personnel losses for the RAF amounted to 10 British fighter pilots killed on the day, and another who died of wounds. Around 19 pilots were wounded, 11 so seriously that they did not take part {{in the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
5000|$|The many-flowered grass-pink (Calopogon multiflorus) is {{a species}} of orchid. It is a {{perennial}} forb that requires recurring <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> to maintain its habitat. It falls under the genus Calopogon, meaning [...] "beautiful beard" [...] in Greek, referring to the stamen-like bristles or beard on the lip.|$|R
25|$|In November 2008, three <b>ground</b> <b>firing</b> trial were {{conducted}} at Avibras facility, {{the tests were}} part of the stage of proof requirements and were successful. The improvement of the propulsion system of the missile is being conducted jointly by the IAE (Institute of Aeronautics and Space), and Mectron, Avibrás.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the flatwoods and the role that <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> have played in {{maintaining}} them are discussed. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} areal and temporal extent of burns as recorded uniformly by remote sensors. Thermal infrared, color infrared, and Ektachrome imagery were obtained from sensors flown by a NASA aircraft at 15, 000 feet over a test site in Osceola County, Florida, in March 1968. The overall pattern of burning can be sequenced and mapped uniformly from the imagery. By comparing the various imagery, areal and temporal extent of burned areas can be determined. It was concluded that remote sensed imagery provides more accurate and areally comprehensive media for assessing the impact of <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> on the landscape of the flatwoods region than are available from any other data source...|$|R
5|$|On 12 January, one of {{the most}} unusual aerial battles of the Vietnam War took place. Two Soviet-built An-2 Colt biplanes of the North Vietnamese Air Force {{attacked}} Lima Site 85 atop a craggy peak known as Phou Pha Thi. An Air America Bell 205 helicopter, which had taken off to avoid air-dropped 120mm mortar rounds, then began chasing {{one of the}} Colts which had already been struck by <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> The aircraft crashed while making evasive maneuvers. The Bell then went after the other Colt, and the helicopter's crew chief fired an AK-47 through a sliding window, shooting the biplane down.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December 1950, Hudner and Brown {{were among}} a group of pilots on patrol near the Chosin Reservoir when Brown's Corsair was struck by <b>ground</b> <b>fire</b> from Chinese troops and crashed. In an attempt to save Brown from his burning aircraft, Hudner {{intentionally}} crash-landed his own aircraft on a snowy mountain in freezing temperatures to help Brown. In spite of these efforts, Brown died of his injuries and Hudner was forced to evacuate, having also been injured in the landing.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier {{served in}} the Falklands War, and the Balkans conflicts; on all {{occasions}} it mainly operated from aircraft carriers positioned within the conflict zone. Its usage in the Falklands War was its most high profile and important success, where {{it was the only}} fixed-wing fighter available to protect the British Task Force. The Sea Harriers shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the conflict with two lost to enemy <b>ground</b> <b>fire.</b> They were also used to launch ground attacks {{in the same manner as}} the Harriers operated by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
50|$|Areas {{with large}} trees and {{branches}} falling on lines {{are a problem}} for aerial bundled cables as the line degrades over time. Due to the very large strain forces cracking and breaking insulation can lead to short circuit failures which can then lead to <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> due to dripping of molten insulation.|$|R
2500|$|A {{study of}} the fire scars present in tree ring samples {{indicates}} that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been <b>ground</b> <b>fires</b> that serve to clear forest debris. The area is a climax community. Recent [...] pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.|$|R
50|$|Iraqi {{anti-aircraft}} defenses, including man-portable air-defense systems, were surprisingly ineffective against enemy {{aircraft and}} the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action. Two of these losses {{are the result of}} aircraft colliding with the ground while evading Iraqi <b>ground</b> <b>fired</b> weapons. One of these losses is a confirmed air-air victory.|$|R
