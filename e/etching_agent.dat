Depletion gilding is most often used to treat alloys of gold with copper and/or silver. Unlike gold, both copper and silver readily react with a variety of chemicals.

When anodized in a 0.5 weight percent HF solution for 20 minutes, well-aligned titanium oxide nanotube arrays can be fabricated {{with an average}} tube diameter of 60 nm and length of 250 nm. Based on X-ray Diffraction, nanotubes grown through anodization are amorphous.As HF is highly corrosive and harmful chemical, NH4F is now being used as the <b>etching</b> <b>agent</b> in lieu of HF. In a typical synthesis process, a formamide based non aqueous electrolyte is produced containing 0.2M NH4F and 5 vol% of DI water. The anodization process is carried out under 25V at 20oC for 20 hours, in a two electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a highly pure and thoroughly cleaned titanium plate as the anode, a copper plate or platinum wire as the cathode and the aforesaid electrolyte. The as prepared sample is annealed in air at 400oC to get anatase phase.Hollow TiO2 nanofibers can be also prepared by coating carbon nanofibers with titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4). The product is then heated at 550 °C for several hours in air to remove the carbon core and form TiO2 nanocrystals. When chiral carbon nanofibers are used as templates, the resulting TiO2 fibers are also chiral, i.e., they respond differently to left and right-hand circularly polarized light. Such optical activity is common for organic, but not for inorganic molecules or nanostructures; the latter are preferred for optical applications because of their superior mechanical and thermal stability.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{microstructure}} specific materials is always {{associated with the}} ability to selectively remove material over small scale-lengths. Localized etching whether it is chemical or physical, wet or dry, parallel or sequential is central to every modern microstructuring method.

Alternatively the surface is prepared/treated in a manner that changes its "quality" locally making it more susceptible or more resistive to a particular <b>etching</b> <b>agent.</b> The whole surface is subsequently exposed to the <b>etching</b> <b>agent</b> which can be a uniform accelerated ion beam, a laser beam or an acid.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} six phosphoric acid-etching agents on dentin, the independent variables being two acid concentrations (10 % and 32 %- 37 %) and three thickener conditions (no thickener, silica, and polymer). The tested hypothesis was {{that the use of}} different etchants with similar concentrations of phosphoric acid would result in similar depths of dentin demineralization. METHODS: Thirty dentin disks were obtained from extracted human teeth by microtome sectioning. The dentin surfaces were etched with one of the <b>etching</b> <b>agents,</b> fixed, dehydrated and dried. The specimens were observed using a FE-SEM. The mean deepest demineralization of intertubular dentin was measured from fracture surfaces of the disks. These values were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan's Test. The morphological appearance of the dentin surfaces was compared using the following observation criteria: 1) Presence of a cuff of peritubular dentin; 2) Relative thickness of the layer containing residual collagen or smear layer particles; and 3) Formation of a submicron hiatus {{at the bottom of the}} exposed collagen network. The pH of each of the <b>etching</b> <b>agents</b> was measured. A correlation analysis was made of the pH vs. the depth of dentin demineralization. RESULTS: Silica-thickened etchants did not demineralize dentin as deeply as did polymer-thickened etchants and unthickened etchants. High magnifications revealed three distinct zones within the demineralized dentin layer; an upper porous zone of residual smear layer or denatured collagen and residual silica particles (in groups etched with silica-thickened etchants), an intermediate area with randomly oriented collagen fibers, and a lower zone with submicron hiatus, few collagen fibers, and scattered hydroxyapatite inclusions. This hiatus was observable in all the specimens etched with the polymer-thickened etchants, in 90 % of the specimens etched with the unthickened phosphoric acid liquids, and in 60 % of the specimens etched with the silica-thickened gels. SIGNIFICANCE: The results obtained suggest that similar concentrations of phosphoric acid etchants containing distinct thickeners result in different demineralization depths as well as different morphology of etched dentin. status: publishe...|$|R
