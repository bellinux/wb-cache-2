They went on to defeat The Hype Bros in their second match as a team on the September 12th episode of SmackDown and again in October 8th at <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell. On the SmackDown after <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell, Benjamin and Gable defeated The Hype Bros, Breezango and The Ascension to become number one contenders to the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On November 7, Benjamin and Gable faced The Usos for the titles where they won via count out but did not win the titles.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the event was a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Triple H choked Batista with a chain and {{hit him in the}} back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire. Batista regained the {{momentum}} by grabbing Triple H's sledgehammer and hitting him with it. Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title. After the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match, Triple H was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
5|$|At Breaking Point, Punk {{defeated}} The Undertaker in a submission {{match to}} retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Undertaker originally won the match with his Hell's Gate submission hold. SmackDown general manager Theodore Long restarted the match after stating that the ban that former general manager Vickie Guerrero had placed on the move was still in effect. Punk won the match with his Anaconda Vise when referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell despite Undertaker never submitting (reminiscent to the Montreal Screwjob, {{which took place in}} the same venue in 1997). The feud between the two continued and at the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell PPV, Punk lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match. He lost two subsequent rematches against The Undertaker on SmackDown and in a Fatal Four Way match at Bragging Rights also involving Batista and Rey Mysterio.|$|E

The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics.

5|$|Nikki {{dropped the}} {{championship}} to Charlotte, on September 20, at Night of Champions, ending her reign at 301 days, {{and failed to}} regain the title in a rematch on October 25 at <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell. Shortly after, Nikki went on a hiatus from both television and in-ring competition due to a neck injury which would require surgery, but returned for one night on December 21, to accept the Slammy Award for Diva of the Year. During this time, Brie continued to compete in singles competition, and in tag team matches with Fox.|$|E
5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference from Big Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining {{he was tired}} of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing him when the WWE Champion should be the focus of the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell, and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E

5|$|On the June 16 {{episode of}} Raw, Cena {{defeated}} Kane in a stretcher match {{to qualify for}} the ladder match for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank, where Cena won his 15th world championship. Cena then retained the title at Battleground in a fatal four-way match against Roman Reigns, Randy Orton and Kane. At SummerSlam, Cena lost the championship to Brock Lesnar in a squash match, during which Lesnar hit Cena with sixteen suplexes and two F-5s, ending his reign at 49 days. Cena invoked his title rematch clause against Lesnar for Night of Champions, nearly winning before Seth Rollins attacked him to cause a disqualification, although he became the first wrestler to defeat Lesnar in two WWE pay-per-view events. Cena then began feuding with Dean Ambrose for the right to face Rollins at <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell, but Ambrose won the right by defeating Cena in a No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Cena would instead face Randy Orton in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then turned}} his sights to Heyman's other client, Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel. On September 15, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a No Disqualication, Handicap {{elimination}} match at Night of Champions, {{in which he}} made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left. In the process of attacking Heyman, Ryback attacked Punk and placed Heyman on top of Punk for the pinfall. A month later, at Battleground, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a low blow, while the referee was distracted by Heyman attempting to interfere in the match. On October 14, Punk defeated Axel in a Beat the Clock challenge match to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell pay-per-view, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one Handicap match in the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Bad Blood {{featured}} World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defending the title against Kevin Nash {{in a ring}} surrounded by a steel structure of metal dubbed as the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match. The buildup to the match began two months prior at Backlash, where Triple H nailed Kevin Nash with the sledgehammer during the Six man Tag team match, enabling Triple H to Pin Nash for the victory. The following month at Judgment Day, Nash defeated Triple H in a standard wrestling match, also called a singles match, via disqualification but didn't win the championship. The following night on an episode of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, after Triple H successfully defended the World title against Ric Flair, General Manager Steve Austin, a fictitious match maker and rules enforcer, announced that due to Kevin Nash winning the match at Judgment Day by disqualification, Nash would face Triple H again at Bad Blood for the World Heavyweight title in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match to avoid disqualifications. On the May 26, 2003 episode of Raw, the staged rivalry between the two wrestlers intensified when Randy Orton and Triple H, {{both of whom were}} members of Evolution, an alliance of wrestlers that also consisted of Ric Flair, attacked Nash. The following week during an episode of Raw, Nash gained redemption over the previous week's attack when he alongside Shawn Michaels and The Hurricane defeated Evolution in a tag team match. After the match, Nash lifted and sat Triple H on his shoulders and then slammed him back-first down to the mat, a maneuver Nash calls the Jacknife powerbomb. On June 9, 2003 during an episode of Raw, Austin announced that Mick Foley, a professional wrestler who had retired three years prior at No Way Out 2000, would officiate the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> a Cell match as the guest referee.|$|E

500|$|Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell</b> {{became popular}} almost immediately. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader, offered to publish [...] "Love is Hell", {{a series of}} relationship-themed Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell</b> strips, <b>in</b> book form. Released a month later, the book was an {{underground}} success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Work is Hell soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell</b> Co., which handled merchandising for Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell.</b> Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell,</b> Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell.</b> At {{the end of its}} run, Life <b>in</b> <b>Hell</b> was carried <b>in</b> 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including School is Hell, Childhood is Hell, The Big Book of Hell, and The Huge Book of Hell.

After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work.
