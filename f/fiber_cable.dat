5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> {{connection to the}} archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} {{designed in}} the project could allow countries to avoid using expensive <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> {{that would have to}} be installed underground to allow users to connect to the Internet.

25|$|Three key {{characteristics}} of fiber optic waveguides {{can be affected}} by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> jackets and buffer tubes protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure {{the reliability of the}} signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.|$|E

25|$|In March 2012 an LNGS seminar was held, {{confirming}} the <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> was not fully screwed in during data gathering. LVD researchers compared the timing data for cosmic high-energy muons hitting both the OPERA {{and the nearby}} LVD detector between 2007–2008, 2008–2011, and 2011–2012. The shift obtained for the 2008–2011 period agreed with the OPERA anomaly. The researchers also found photographs showing the cable had been loose by October 13, 2011.|$|E
25|$|The fiber {{is used in}} woven {{rope and}} in cable, where the fibers are kept {{parallel}} within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables {{have been used in}} suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable,</b> as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.|$|E
25|$|Telenor and the NSC {{conducted}} a feasibility study in 2002 for connecting SvalSat {{to the mainland}} by fiber. It was estimated to cost between NOK400 and 500 million, or US$50 million, which presumed the laying of one cable with satellite used as backup. A stakeholder meeting was held on 24 and 25 July, which saw representatives from NASA, the Integrated Programme Office (IPO), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Later that year the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System selected Helsinki over Svalbard for its ground station, {{largely because of the}} former's connection to the fiber network. NSC was in October offered various prices between US$30 and 40 million for the laying of a single <b>fiber</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

25|$|Researchers from OPERA {{measured}} the remaining delays and calibrations {{not included in}} the CERN calculation: those shown in Fig.4. The neutrinos were detected in an underground lab, but the common clock from the GPS satellites was visible only above ground level. The clock value noted above-ground had to be transmitted to the underground detector with an 8km <b>fiber</b> <b>cable.</b> The delays associated with this transfer of time had to be accounted for in the calculation. How much the error could vary (the standard deviation of the errors) mattered to the analysis, and had to be calculated for each part of the timing chain separately. Special techniques were used to measure the length of the fiber and its consequent delay, required as part of the overall calculation.|$|E
25|$|Data {{communications}} {{are provided}} by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> and coaxial cable built by Neighbourhood Cable in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchanges—Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), Sebastopol (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 homes will be directly connected to the network via optical fibre cable.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable,</b> {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Fiber</b> <b>cable</b> {{can be very}} flexible, but {{traditional}} fiber's loss increases greatly if {{the fiber}} is bent with a radius smaller than around 30mm. This creates a problem when the cable is bent around corners or wound around a spool, making FTTX installations more complicated. [...] "Bendable fibers", targeted towards easier installation in home environments, have been standardized as ITU-T G.657. This type of fiber can be bent with a radius as low as 7.5mm without adverse impact. Even more bendable fibers have been developed.|$|E
2500|$|The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a twin {{submarine}} communications cable which connects Svalbard to {{the mainland}} of Norway. The two optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> consist of two segments, from Harstad to Breivika in Andøy, and from Breivika to Hotellneset near Longyearbyen in Svalbard. The segments from Harstad to Breivika are [...] long, respectively, and the segments from Breivika to Hotellneset [...] Each consists of eight fiber pairs and there are installed twenty optical communications repeaters on each segment. Each segment has a speed of 10gigabits per second (Gb/s), with a future potential capacity of 2,500Gbit/s. The system is now the sole telecommunications link to the archipelago.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> system {{runs from}} Harstad via Breivika {{on the island}} of Andøya to Hotellneset on Svalbard.

The lengths for Segment 1 and 2 are , respectively, and for Segment 1A and 2A [...] Both cables have eight fiber pairs, of which only one is in use. Use of additional pairs requires new equipment to be installed in Harstad and Hotellneset. Segment 2 is redundant to Segment 1 and is only used if the former should fall out. Near shore the cables are armored.|$|E
