500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime.

50|$|Scribes held a {{prominent}} position in Maya courts and {{had their own}} patron deities (see Howler monkey gods and Maya maize god). They {{are likely to have}} come from aristocratic families. It appears that some scribes were attached to the royal house, while others were serving at temples and were, perhaps, counted among the priests. It seems likely that they were organized hierarchically. Maya art often depicts rulers with trappings indicating they were scribes or at least able to write, such as having pen bundles in their headdresses. Additionally, many rulers have been found in conjunction with writing tools such as shell or clay <b>ink</b> <b>pots.</b>|$|R
500|$|Commoners were illiterate; scribes {{were drawn}} from the elite. It is not known if {{all members of the}} {{aristocracy}} could read and write, although at least some women could, since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art. Maya scribes were called aj tz'ib, meaning [...] "one who writes or paints". There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write. Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record; Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, king of Tikal, was interred with his paint pot. Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements. A palace at Copán has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes; it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding <b>ink</b> <b>pots.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A Bible box [...] {{is a small}} {{container}} {{that is used to}} store a bible. About the size of a bible, this box could be used to transport in safety what was a very costly book. Many varieties had a slanted or angled top with a lower lip, meant to hold the Bible for reading, when the box was placed on a table. In a sense it then served as a portable lectern. Over the years the typical Bible box was also used or specifically built to contain writing implements such as a quill, <b>ink</b> <b>pot,</b> blotting paper and writing paper. The level or slanted surface of the box then served as a desktop, for writing as well as reading.|$|E

There is some {{evidence to show that}} the most decorative pieces were produced {{towards the end of the}} red-mark period and the early puce-mark periods: earlier pieces often feature the more geometric shapes, while later pieces, though retaining the neo-rococo shapes of the early puce-mark period, feature less extravagant decoration that was possibly more fitting of the first years of the Victorian age.|$|R

Hugo Steiner-Prag was an internationally acclaimed book artist, known for his illustrations, typography, and book designs. He was also a distinguished painter, stage designer, teacher and art organizer. Born Hugo Steiner in Prague in 1880, he eventually added the name of his native city to his last name to distinguish himself from other artists with the same name. He entered the Prague Academy of the Arts in 1897 and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich in 1900 before transferring to the Lehr- und Versuchsstätten in Munich, where he later taught. During this time he worked on the illustration of E. T. A. Hoffmann's "Die Elixiere des Teufels," the success of which cemented his reputation as an illustrator and book designer. Between 1907 and 1933 he was a professor at the Academy of Graphic Arts in Leipzig, until the Nazis ousted him from his position. He also served as art director of the Propylaeen publishing house in Berlin and in 1927, became the president and organizer of the International Book Art Exhibition in Leipzig. He organized various other important book art exhibits in Paris, Cologne, Barcelona and New York. After 1933, Steiner-Prag returned to his native city of Prague, where he established a private school for book arts and graphic design, called the Officina Pragensis. In 1938, he was asked to set up a similar school in Stockholm, which he accepted due to the political situation in Prague. He then immigrated to New York in 1941 after an arduous trip through Russia, and was a professor at New York University. Steiner-Prag died from a heart attack in 1945. Riegers, Erwined (Ed.).
