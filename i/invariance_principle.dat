Using that mathematical tool Ambartsumian resolved a number of nonlinear problems of the light diffusion. The <b>invariance</b> <b>principle</b> formulated by Ambartsumian and various modifications of this principle presently are being widely used to solve extremely complicated problems in astrophysics, mathematical and theoretical physics, electronics, geophysics, atmospheric physics, and other areas of science. These problems and the associated mathematical apparatus are constantly becoming more complicated, but the basis is still Ambartsumian's <b>invariance</b> <b>principle.</b> In their book Invariant Imbedding, R.E.
