5|$|On 24 November 2008, 14 league {{games into}} the 2008–09 season, Fàbregas was named as the {{successor}} to William Gallas as club captain. However, just as Arsenal were <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the title race after a poor start to the season, the Spaniard was ruled out for four months after sustaining a knee injury against Liverpool. The Gunners eventually finished the season without any silverware, coming in fourth {{in the league and}} being knocked out at the semi-finals of the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. In tandem with Arsenal's policy to groom its young players, the team that Fàbregas led into the new season consisted mostly of the same young nucleus as before, with the likes of Nicklas Bendtner, Gaël Clichy, Abou Diaby, Denílson, Samir Nasri, Alex Song and Theo Walcott in tow.|$|E
5|$|The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Lex Luger {{challenged}} Yokozuna. Mr. Perfect {{was revealed}} to be the guest referee for the match, while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper. After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring. After <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the ring, Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from {{a corner of the}} ring. Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger's head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna's managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger, and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them. Luger covered Yokozuna, but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count. When Luger pushed him, Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring, thereby turning heel.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, as Beckham was <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Capello's {{good books}} after {{successfully}} fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival to the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.|$|E
25|$|After the Combinations tour, {{the band}} {{originally}} {{planned to take}} a break before starting work on their third album. At this time, relationships with their label was not at the best, and the band's personal lives were <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> control. However, at the urging of their good friend and A, Eisley went back into the studio later in 2008 to record their third album. During the recording process, the band did a few one-off shows. Notably, they performed a benefit with the Seattle Symphony with Mateo Messina in 2008 and headlined a show at Baylor University in the spring of 2009, their first real show since the end of their Combinations tour.|$|E

25|$|After {{a year of}} {{financial}} suffering and an eye of <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the pros' good graces for them to attend the ABA's upcoming revival of the Pro Spectaculars, the ABA gave in and changed the way it would decide its top pro for the upcoming 1984 season. Brian had easily won the title for 1983 and the car, a 1984 Trans Am, legitimizing the {{process in which the}} ABA required for Number 1 pro in 1983 since he was even before the Grand National the top money earner. However, this system was not used again for 1984 and the ABA went back to the system of how well a pro does during a season having a bearing on who wins ABA number one pro.|$|E
25|$|After being sacked by Bayern Munich, Rehhagel {{took over}} as manager of Kaiserslautern in 1996, after a season where the club had won the DFB-Pokal but had also been relegated from the top-flight {{following}} a catastrophic season in the Bundesliga. Rehhagel injected new energy into the team, which saw Kaiserslautern comfortably <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the top-flight in 1997, winning the second division by 10 points. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1997–98 season, Kaiserslautern were seen as dark horses for a place in the UEFA Cup, but Rehhagel's team simply steamrollered the Bundesliga opposition all season. With sparkling offence and sheer never-ending energy (half a dozen games were won in injury time), Kaiserslautern won a sensational German championship in 1998, the first and so far only German championship triumph by a team that had just been promoted the previous season. Rehhagel coached Kaiserslautern to some less spectacular, but very decent results over the next year, such as leading the team to the quarter finals of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, but then big internal conflicts within the club, rows with some players, and a massive smear campaign, caused him to resign his position in 2000. Rehhagel finished with a record of 87 wins, 39 draws, and 48 losses.|$|E
25|$|United {{went into}} the second leg {{with a couple of}} injury {{concerns}} in the centre of their defence. Nemanja Vidić was still carrying an injury from the first leg, while Rio Ferdinand had a suspected foot injury that he picked up in the Reds' match against Middlesbrough at the weekend. Nevertheless, Ferdinand was deemed to be fit enough to start the match, and lined up alongside Gerard Piqué in the centre of defence. Mikaël Silvestre also found a place in the starting lineup, making his first start for nearly seven months, following a knee ligament injury, and Gary Neville also made a return to the first team squad, being selected on the bench. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes were left on the bench, as Alex Ferguson obviously had an eye on the following weekend's match against Arsenal. Manchester United started the match brightly, creating numerous opportunities in the first few minutes. However, on the half-hour, the referee Tom Henning Øvrebø awarded the visiting side a penalty for a trip on Mancini by Wes Brown, which Daniele De Rossi stepped up to take. Live action replays however showed no contact between Brown and Mancini. Fortunately for United, the Italian midfielder blazed the ball over the crossbar, wasting what would end up being Roma's best chance of <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the tie.|$|E

500|$|After just a {{month at}} Stalybridge, Foster {{returned}} to the highest tier in non-League football, joining Oxford United in February 2007. He made his Oxford debut two weeks after signing for the club, starting in a 1–0 home defeat to Kidderminster Harriers. He played nine times during the club's 2006–07 campaign, scoring once in a 2–0 win over St Albans City at Clarence Park. At {{the end of the}} season, he signed a new one-year contract with Oxford keeping him contracted to the club throughout the 2007–08 season. Foster featured off the bench in the club's first two fixtures of the season, but only made one further appearance during September 2007 – with Oxford manager Jim Smith stating that Foster needed to [...] "improve the way he leads his life" [...] in order to [...] "stand a chance" [...] of <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Oxford first-team. After this, Foster witnessed an upturn in form, featuring regularly {{until the end of the}} season, although he was given a one match suspension following his sending off against Northwich Victoria in March 2008. At the end of the 2007–08 season, in which he made 39 appearances, he won Oxford's Supporters Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards.

500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women who feel the same way".|$|E
