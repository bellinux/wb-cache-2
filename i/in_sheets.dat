Mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys, it is used in jet engines, high-speed airframes and dental implants. The most common alloy for seamless tubing is Titanium 3/2.5 containing 2.5% vanadium, the titanium alloy of choice in the aerospace, defense and bicycle industries. Another common alloy, primarily produced <b>in</b> <b>sheets,</b> is Titanium 6AL-4V, a titanium alloy with 6% aluminium and 4% vanadium.|$|E
5|$|The stamps were {{designed}} by Richard J. King and recess printed by Waterlow and Sons, London, until 1961, and thereafter by De La Rue & Co, Dublin. The designs feature the Flight of the Angel Victor– Messenger of St. Patrick– carrying the Voice of the Irish 'Vox Hiberniæ' over the world flying over four well-known Irish historical landmarks, one {{from each of the}} four provinces of Ireland: Lough Derg (3d and 8d values), Rock of Cashel (1d, 1/3 and 1/5 values), Glendalough (1/- value) and Croagh Patrick (6d value). These were printed <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of 60 stamps with an 'e' watermark.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E

Thus, it is necessary to develop an easier and more economical method to process these materials. As an example, punching holes <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> glass was studied. Because punching holes <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> glass by ordinary methods is impossible, we present a method for punching holes <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> glass under static high pressure.

Conventional mechanical and hydraulic dampers require additional machine power and higher loads, which make critical their use in many applications.

5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> or {{patches and}} do not cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of the}} cumuliform category, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by cracks <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} the Hegde’s instability mechanics for the prediction of forming limit <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. Design/methodology/approach: Hegde’s Instability Mechanics (HIM) paves way for explaining the effects of diffuse instability and localization due to necking <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. For different ranges of stress ratios, the ratio of strain differentials has been computed and hence the forming limits are predicted. Findings: Basing the formulation of HIM on the von Misess yield criterion and applying the interface theory (briefed in appendix) the state-of- the-art purpose is deemed to be well served and demonstrated. Interface theory to explain in simple terms, gives the optimal decision variables in an ‘n’ dimensional hyper-space. The concept of HIM is demonstrated on isotropic and anisotropic materials. The anisotropic materials show better stability than isotropic materials <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. However the geometric instability is analyzed with the assumptions that the thickness stresses are negligible and biaxial state of stress persists <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. Practical implications: The observations {{are based on the}} theoretical findings for which the experimental validation exists in the reviewed references. Originality/value: To the sincere knowledge of authors, is both different and unique of its kind <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> forming mechanics needing horizontal exploration by potential researchers...|$|R
25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 a 1 and 2-cent Washington-head were issued, {{again on}} unwatermarked paper with gauge 11 perforations. These two stamps were issued <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of 170 and {{were made from}} coil waste printed on the rotary press. Images {{produced}} from curved printing plates are slightly longer than images produced from a flat plate as the surface and images elongate from the bending. The only way to distinguish this printing from the 1918 perf.11 printing is to measure {{the parameters of the}} stamp designs which measure 19½ mm wide by 20mm tall, or by placing it next to and comparing it with a flat-plate printing.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{designing}} and printing the new stamp {{was carried out}} in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.|$|E
