These are sub-divided into six categories of effect: earth, water, wind, fire, plants and people. The six categories have an individual [...] "manna meter" [...] which needs to be filled to a certain level to enable specific powers for usage.

With some of the most <b>devastating</b> <b>powers</b> in the game, Doomsayers are one of the more potent arcane backgrounds. Doomsayers are detailed in the Children o' the Atom sourcebook.|$|R
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, the kilij {{was tested}} against the jian. The kilij cleanly sliced through a pig carcass {{with all of}} its four swings, leading the hosts to call it the only weapon they could compare to the katana. Meanwhile, the rapier-like jian could cleanly pierce through and cut up another pig carcass, piercing the aorta, and severing bone. The edge was given to the kilij for its <b>devastating</b> cutting <b>power.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Cooney, who is {{naturally}} left-handed, used an orthodox stance. This {{provided him with}} a powerful jab and a lethal left hook, but a comparatively weak right, which he seldom used except in combinations. Most of his fights ended in quick knockouts; while this benefited him {{in the beginning of}} his career, it left him unprepared for his fight with Larry Holmes. [...] Despite his <b>devastating</b> punching <b>power,</b> Cooney's moderate stamina and lack of experience proved to be his downfall.|$|R

50|$|Librarians are {{responsible}} for maintaining the records of their Chapter. They can use their talents to filter out dangerous mutant psykers from the Imperium's recruits. With better equipment such as Aegis hood circuitry, superior willpower, protection and training, along with Space Marine enhancements, Librarians are much less susceptible to the perils of the Warp than their Imperial Guard counterparts. On the battlefield, they are fearsome opponents that can unleash <b>devastating</b> psychic <b>powers</b> and augment their own physical prowess.

It was also used on the Shenyang J-6, the Chinese copy of the MiG-19, with a third gun in the nose. The Chinese {{manufactured}} their own version, the Type-30, basically similar though with slightly different characteristics.Although its rate of fire makes it more suited for air-to-ground use, it is, by all accounts, a formidable weapon combining reasonable accuracy and <b>devastating</b> hitting <b>power.</b> It also appears that {{a version of the}} gun was modified for use in space, with successful testing on a military Almaz station.|$|R

5000|$|The Cry has {{received}} the widest critical acclaim of any of FitzGerald's novels to date, with Doug Johnstone from The Independent on Sunday stating: [...] "Astonishingly good. It is utterly harrowing, completely plausible, constantly nerve-shredding ... It plays on the deepest, darkest fears of all parents about their children, and embeds that everyday terror in a plot so up-to-the-minute that you'll swear it's been lifted {{from the pages of}} a newspaper ... The Cry is a remarkable novel - its <b>devastating</b> <b>power</b> all the stronger for its realistic rendering. Brilliant stuff." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of weapon in the show, these golden, {{metallic}} guns are nearly omnipresent. They are shaped like a globe with a ridge over the top, and feature a pointed end with a handle on the opposite side. They appear to be heavy, and a character moving or brandishing one creates a distinctive sound of dragging cast iron or brass. These weapons vary in size from handheld {{all the way up to}} very large, wrapping around the body and carried similarly to a large marching band drum. These weapons are <b>devastating</b> in <b>power,</b> and are capable of exploding a person into blood (which appears as green) in a single shot. They destroy most objects with the exception of memory chips and memory eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Standing 6'1" [...] (1.85 m) and {{weighing}} around 195 lb, he was large for a heavyweight of his era. This benefited him tremendously {{as he was}} nearly three inches (8 cm) taller than most of his opponents. He was a patient fighter who usually waited for his opponent {{to make the first}} move, while setting up his punch. He was known as the best counter-punching heavyweight of his era, but known even more for his <b>devastating</b> one-punch <b>power,</b> winning most often by knockout. Some at the time felt he may have had greater one-punch power than even John L. Sullivan or Peter Maher. However, he was less tough, durable, and was not as aggressive or tenacious as Sullivan, the reigning champion at that time.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the natural {{disaster}} is <b>devastating.</b> Wireless <b>power</b> transfer technology is very promising to reduce this impact by providing power backup for communication devices. This paper presents {{the assessment of the}} wireless power transfer technologies for long distance energy transfer. The review of several wireless power transfer technologies (WPTT), namely inductive, capacitive, acoustic, and optical, are presented. The WPTTs are evaluated in the context of several criteria, specifically, propagation area, power level, and efficiency. From the evaluation, it is evident that, optical WPTT is highly suitable for long distance power transfer. It can cover a large area with considerable power. Moreover, it can be merged with the PV technology on the receiving end, which proves its superiority over other technologies in the context of application compatibility...|$|R
50|$|On 26 December 2004, {{the world}} {{witnessed}} the <b>devastating</b> <b>power</b> of tsunami, affecting many countries, bordering the Indian Ocean region.

A photographer who was standing on the wall escaped narrowly from getting hurt. Apart from that no major damages were there.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the reason}} Kenshi may {{have been sent to}} Geminar is that on {{occasion}} while in his Sacred Mechanoid, which unlike the others seems more organic, he sometimes goes into a berserker mode, causing his Sacred Mechanoid to turn black and grow huge with more <b>devastating</b> <b>power.</b> It also matches a prophecy involving a white warrior and a black warrior who may save or destroy the world. Originally it was thought the black warrior was Doll, but after Kenshi transforms and manages to instill fear into his enemies with his power, it becomes clear that he is in fact both.|$|E
50|$|Most psykers {{among the}} forces of Chaos, {{especially}} among its Marine legions, are sorcerers.

They perform various tasks from summoning daemons to unleashing <b>devastating</b> <b>power</b> attacks upon the enemy. However, not all Chaos legions use psykers. The World Eaters, denounce magic and psychic ability in favour of close combat, and the Iron Warriors sneer at sorcery. In addition, the Chaos God Khorne despises sorcery and it is easy for his minions to come to blows with those of Tzeentch.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom {{insisted on}} special {{status as a}} longstanding belligerent during the war, {{concerned}} {{that if it were}} treated equally with the <b>devastated</b> continental <b>powers</b> it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by William L. Clayton, promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany. However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.|$|R
