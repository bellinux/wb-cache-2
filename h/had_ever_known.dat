5|$|Steve and Miranda Parker adopted Bridget {{when she}} was 6 years old, along with her older brother Riley. Being adopted never worried Bridget and it was {{irrelevant}} to her day-to-day life as Steve and Miranda were the only parents she <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gale {{married again}} in 1945, {{this time to}} Minnie Grace, the {{daughter}} of Count Gregorini-Bigham of Bologna and the widow of Prince Charles Louis of Beauvau-Craon. From September 1945 to July 1947 he was the European Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Gale retired from the British Army with the honorary rank of lieutenant general in October 1947, and took up a position with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In 1954 Harold Macmillan persuaded Gale to become chairman of the Basildon, Essex New Town Development Corporation, a post Gale served in until 1964. Macmillan described Gale {{as one of the}} most efficient officers he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> Gale and Minnie lived in La Tour de Peilz, Vaud, Switzerland, where he died on 8 April 1971. His papers are in the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives.|$|E

5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 off-season, the Avalanche named Greg Sherman the new {{general manager}} and Joe Sacco the new head coach. The {{following}} month, top scorer Ryan Smyth {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Kings and Joe Sakic, the only team captain the Avs <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known,</b> retired after 21 seasons in the NHL. The Avs named Adam Foote team captain to replace him. Sakic's jersey retirement ceremony took place on October 1, 2009, before the season opener at home against the San Jose Sharks in front of a sold out crowd where the Avalanche won 5–2. The Avalanche started the season off strong until the Olympic break. Three Avs played in Vancouver: Paul Stastny for the United States, Ruslan Salei for Belarus and Peter Budaj for Slovakia. Following the Winter Olympics, the Avs struggled but eventually clinched a playoff spot with 95 points on the season, a 26-point improvement from the previous year's effort, and good enough for eighth place in the Western Conference. The Avalanche fell in the Western Conference Quarter-finals to the top-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games.|$|E
25|$|Arbuckle {{was brought}} to trial for {{manslaughter}} in November 1921 {{in one of the}} most publicized trials California and the city of San Francisco <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> Arbuckle's lawyers argued that Virginia Rappe had died of natural causes, caused by too much alcohol. In December, after over 40 hours of deliberations, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Arbuckle's second trial in January–February 1922 the following year also ended in a hung jury, but he was finally found not guilty by a jury in the March–April 1922 third trial after only five minutes of deliberations.|$|E

25|$|Herborg, {{the queen}} of the Huns, told her that she had lost her husband and seven of her sons in the south. She had also lost her father, mother and four {{brothers}} at sea. She had buried all of them with her own hands, {{and there was no one}} to console her. Within the same six months, the queen had even been taken as war booty and had had to bind the shoes of a queen who beat her and abused her. The king was the best lord she <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> and his queen the worst woman.|$|E
25|$|During the Russo-Turkish War, Senyavin {{was present}} at Fidonisi and Ochakov and went to Saint Petersburg to inform the Empress about the former victory. He was {{promoted}} to adjudant general in 1788. Although he distinguished himself {{in command of the}} battleship Navarchia during the Battle of Caliacria, he had no patience with Ushakov's cautious and cunctatory approach and paid little attention to his authority, which resulted in his confinement to a guardhouse and the threat of his reduction in rank. At last Potemkin effected a reconciliation between Senyavin and his peer, remarking in his letter to Ushakov that Senyavin could become the greatest admiral that Russia <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 1964 US presidential election, {{supporters}} of Republican nominee Barry Goldwater sent an estimate 2 million telegrams to Graham's hometown of Montreat, North Carolina and sought the preacher's endorsement. Supportive of Johnson's domestic policies, {{and hoping to}} preserve his friendship with the President, Graham resisted pressure to endorse Goldwater and stayed neutral in the election. Following Johnson's election victory, Graham's role as the main White House pastor was solidified. At one point, Johnson even considered making Graham {{a member of his}} cabinet and grooming him to be his successor, though Graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher. Graham's biographer David Aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to Johnson than any other President he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{the murder}} of Æthelbald {{by one of his}} bodyguards in 757, a civil war broke out which was {{concluded}} with the victory of Offa. Offa was forced to build anew the hegemony over the southern English of his predecessor, and he did this so successfully that he became the greatest king Mercia <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> Not only did he win battles and dominate Southern England, but also he took an active hand in administering the affairs of his kingdom by founding market towns and overseeing the first major issues of gold coins in Britain; he assumed a role in the administration of the Catholic Church in England (sponsoring the short-lived archbishopric of Lichfield), and even negotiated with Charlemagne as an equal. Offa is credited with the construction of Offa's Dyke, marking the border between Wales and Mercia.|$|E
25|$|Katie Starks {{was born}} September 25, 1909 in Redwater, Texas. Katie was 36 {{at the time}} of the attack. She was married to Virgil Starks and lived at their {{farmhouse}} of five years on 500 acres of farmland off Highway 67 East almost 10 miles northeast of Texarkana. Her sister, Mrs. Allen, lived directly across the street from her. She was the daughter of Jim Strickland. She and Virgil went to school together growing up because their parents lived on neighboring farms in Red Springs, Texas. A friend had stated that she and Virgil were two of the best people he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> After discovering her husband dead, she ran to telephone police. She rung the phone twice when she was shot two times in the face. One bullet went through the right cheek beside the nose, emerging behind the left ear, and the other went in her lower jaw below the lip, breaking her jaw and splintering several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She ran to a neighbor's house who then took her to the hospital where she recovered.|$|E

[...] Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.|$|E
500|$|In May 1778, Morris {{convinced}} his captors to admit him to parole {{and was sent}} to Flatbush, Long Island, where he stayed with a Mr. Clarkson. In his memoir, Morris noted that Clarkson was [...] "a man of science and large property, ... who owned the most extensive private library that [...] <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> in the United States." [...] While still in captivity Morris found this situation rather comfortable and took every advantage of the library he so admired.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{announced}} his retirement on October 9, 1997. He had {{said that if he}} ever felt he could not give his team the same enthusiasm he had given it for years, he would retire.

500|$|On {{the day of}} Johnson's {{entrance}} {{interview for}} Pembroke, his anxious father introduced him to his future tutor, William Jorden, hoping to make an impression. During the interview, his father was [...] "very full of the merits of his son, and told the company {{he was a good}} scholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin verses", which caused Johnson significant embarrassment. Michael's praise was unnecessary; Johnson's interview went so well that one of the interviewers, a 26-year-old William Adams (Jorden's cousin, later Master of Pembroke), claimed that Johnson was [...] "the best qualified for the University that he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> come there". Throughout the interview, Johnson sat quietly while listening to his father and the interviewers, until he interrupted and quoted Macrobius. The interviewers were surprised that [...] "a School-boy should know Macrobius", and he was accepted immediately.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, on the House floor, Moran {{called for}} the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the {{military}} policy of discharging soldiers on active duty who are openly homosexual. He spoke about a letter penned by a gay soldier who was then serving in the Afghanistan War, who had [...] "learned that a fellow soldier was also gay, only after {{he was killed by}} an IED in Iraq. The partner of the deceased soldier wrote the unit to say how much the victim had loved the military; how they were the only family he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known...</b> This immutable human trait, sexual orientation, like the color of one's skin, does not affect one’s integrity, their honor, our commitment to their country. Soldiers serving their country in combat should not have their sacrifices compounded by having to struggle with an antiquated [...] "Don’t ask, don’t tell" [...] policy. Let's do the right and honorable thing and repeal this policy." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Göring {{had sent}} a telegram, a few hours earlier, asking Hitler for {{permission}} to assume leadership of the Reich—an act that Hitler, under the prodding of Martin Bormann, interpreted as a demand to step down or face a coup. On 27 April, Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin, Hermann Fegelein, was caught in civilian clothes preparing to desert; {{he was arrested and}} brought back to the Führerbunker. On the evening of 28 April, the BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies. Hitler, who had long considered Himmler to be second only to Joseph Goebbels in loyalty (he called Himmler [...] "the loyal Heinrich"), flew into a rage at this apparent betrayal. Hitler told those who were still with him in the bunker complex that Himmler's act was the worst treachery he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> and ordered his arrest. Fegelein was court-martialed and shot.|$|E
