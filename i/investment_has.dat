5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, {{with a high}} level of <b>investment,</b> <b>has</b> led the country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.|$|E
