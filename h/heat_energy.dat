The {{objective of the}} modeling {{is to improve the}} quality and quantity of <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> and emission data, especially for the benefit of local decision making. The model incorporates fuel and energy statistics, building register data, demographic parameters and technical characters of heating into a single framework, allowing explorations of fuel and heat source changes, heating electricity procurement and energy conservation. The case area of the study is the province of North Karelia in Eastern Finland. A model structure, with calibration and evaluation procedures is presented, and extensive municipal estimates of <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> and related greenhouse gas emission are produced.

While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time.

5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E

The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. <b>Heat</b> <b>energy</b> from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok.

5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues.

In this paper, a study on the effects of external {{wall insulation}} thickness on annual cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> uses under different Chinese climates is reported. Firstly, two indexes: Energy Gain Ratio (EGR) and Relative Variation Ratio (RVR) of the sum of annual cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> uses, to assess the effects of external wall insulation thickness on energy saving potential are introduced. Secondly, a model space having four different exterior zones facing four different orientations in an office building is presented and the settings of the model space described. Lastly, the simulated annual cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> uses for the four different exterior zones at different external wall insulation thicknesses under three different climates in China, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, are reported. The results suggested that energy saving was significant by increasing the external wall insulation thickness in exterior zones facing all orientations under Beijing's climate, since the <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> use was dominant and can be reduced remarkably with the increase in insulation thickness. Under Shanghai's climate, increasing external wall insulation thickness to over 26. mm would not reduce the sum of annual <b>heating</b> and cooling <b>energy</b> uses in the south-facing exterior zone, but would help save energy in exterior zones facing the other three orientations.
