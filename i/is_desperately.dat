Belgians expect to be {{attacked}} on the Ghent front tomorrow. Germans already have a bridgehead over canal west of Eecloo. There can be no question of the Belgian withdrawal to Yser. One battalion on march NE of Ypres was practically wiped out today in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without adequate fighter support very costly. Whole of their supplies are east of Yser. They strongly represent attempt {{should be made to}} restore the situation on Leie by British counter-attack for which opportunity may last another few hours only.|$|E
5|$|At Christmas, Kurt elects {{not to go}} back home, and so {{his father}} comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and {{spend some time with}} him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has {{prostate}} cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity. He <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> and hopelessly {{in love with}} Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often {{using it as a}} weapon against them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use it against her, in particular Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton), who has a bad attitude towards most of the people she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E

25|$|The James Ivory film The Wild Party (1975) {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} but incorrectly {{cited as a}} film dramatization of the Arbuckle–Rappe scandal. In fact it is loosely based on the 1926 poem by Joseph Moncure March. In this film, James Coco portrays a heavy-set silent-film comedian named Jolly Grimm whose career is on the skids, but who <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> planning a comeback. Raquel Welch portrays his mistress, who ultimately goads him into shooting her. This film was loosely based on the misconceptions surrounding the Arbuckle scandal, yet it bears almost no resemblance to the documented facts of the case.|$|E

25|$|Myshkin {{follows the}} Yepanchins {{back to their}} dacha, where {{eventually}} Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins {{to talk to him}} very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Yepanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastassya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle {{has turned out to be}} completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastassya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya and <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.|$|E

500|$|Edward's {{motivation}} {{stems from}} a love for his brother, Alphonse, whom he <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> seeking to restore to human form after their mistake. He is extremely idealistic, and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of [...] "Equivalent Exchange," [...] which states that every outcome requires an equal payment. Edward also behaves in a childish manner when confronted about his short height, tending to overreact to any negative comment regarding the subject, usually attacking people {{in a fit of}} rage. Unlike regular alchemists who use transmutation circles, Edward has the ability to create alchemical currents in his body simply by connecting his hands {{as a result of his}} failed human transmutation which gave him such trait. In addition to this, Edward is a formidable fighter as a result of his training with Izumi, who had extensively trained both brothers in martial arts.|$|E

Ric held the interviews open until Maddy was well enough, and today she's going to make sure she gets the job. Maddy's going to show them that they can throw anything at her and she'll cope...even after being stabbed. Linden wants Maddy to be careful and take things easy, as she nearly died, but Maddy wants to get back to work.|$|E

2500|$|References in the Bible {{point to}} an {{awareness}} of human sacrifice {{in the history of}} ancient near-eastern practice. During a battle with the Israelites the King of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (olah, as used of the Temple sacrifice) (2 Kings 3:27) The Bible then recounts that following the King's sacrifice [...] "There was great indignation [...] against Israel", and that the Israelites had to raise their siege of the Moabite capital and go away. This verse had perplexed many later Jewish and Christian commentators who tried to explain why should the Moabite King's sacrifice make God angry at the Israelites. Whatever the explanation, evidently at the time of writing such an act of sacrificing the firstborn son and heir was considered as an emergency measure, to be performed in exceptional cases where Divine favor <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> needed - and that in such cases it might be effective.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{critic and}} {{literary}} historian Gelu Ionescu (himself {{a member of}} the Radio Free Europe staff), Negoiţescu, Goma and Vianu were the only figures of their day to question [...] "the legitimacy of the system", a situation which he believed was rooted in [...] "the character of Romanians", particularly their [...] "fear". Himself an author and dissident, Virgil Tănase reflected back on the period: [...] "Corrupted and sagged by a too lengthy and complacent convenience , Romanian writers viewed Paul Goma's effort with mistrust. A letter from Ion Negoiţescu and the support of Nicolae Breban, that <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> little..." [...] While political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu attributes to Goma and Negoiţescu's [...] "quixotic stances, all the more heroic since [...] could not count on solidarity or support from colleagues", the status of a singular reaction against the local prolongation of Stalinism, Matei Călinescu's account partly connects this issue with Negoiţescu having [...] "miscalculated the reaction of his friends" [...] by believing his gesture would be reciprocated. In his Scriitori contemporani, Negoiţescu himself compared the attitudes of local intellectuals with those in other communist countries, assessing that Romanians were weaker to react against their regime's demands, and arguing that, when faced with political pressures, Romanian institutions were [...] "the first to yield".|$|E
2500|$|Thorium-based {{nuclear power}} {{reactors}} have also become {{an area of}} active research in recent years. It is being backed by many scientists and researchers, and Professor James Hansen, the former Director at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said, “After studying climate change for over four decades, it’s {{clear to me that}} the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> needed as {{an essential part of the}} solution”. Thorium is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than uranium, and its ore, monazite, is commonly found in sands along bodies of water. Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium. While uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, thorium is taken from open pits. Monazite is present in countries such as Australia, the United States and India, in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years. [...] As an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors, thorium has been proven to add to proliferation, produces radioactive waste for deep geological repositories like technetium-99 (half-life over 200,000 years), and has a longer fuel cycle.|$|E

Now, Guan Hai and the rebels have besieged Kong Rong; he <b>is</b> <b>desperately</b> in need of help. You are known for your kindness, righteousness, and willingness to help those in need.

[...] Liu Bei's facial expression turned serious and he said, [...] "So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!" [...] He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, [...] "You are a young friend of mine." [...] When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, [...] "I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong's kindness in this way." ...|$|E
