40|$|We mainly study a taxpayer's optimal {{strategies}} of tax evasion and its relevant properties, {{in order to}} deduce some effective suggestions and theoretical bases for the tax authority to restrain tax evasion. Based on the Christiansen static model of tax evasion, we formulate a two-period model where the discovery of tax evasion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>period</b> induces a tax audit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>period</b> if {{it has not been}} done before. The taxpayer has to choose the amount of tax evasion in each <b>period</b> to maximize <b>the</b> total expected utility of <b>the</b> two <b>periods.</b> We show that the threat of having the first-period evasion discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>period</b> diminishes attractiveness of tax evasion in both periods. We also discuss the policy of audit power enhancement, where <b>the</b> audit probability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>period</b> will be increased if tax evasion is discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>period.</b> We find that this policy may play two roles. First, it can reduce the incentive of tax evasion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>period</b> if tax evasion is discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>period.</b> Second, a high potential increase of the audit probability may contain tax evasion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>period</b> but may cause more evasion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>period...</b>|$|R
