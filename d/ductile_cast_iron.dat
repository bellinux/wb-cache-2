40|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of improving and adjusting their mechanical properties using austempering heat treatments, <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> are very attractive materials for structural applications. However, for this class of materials, very few fatigue data are available for designers in the International Standards. Therefore, at least in the preliminary design phase, simple expressions to estimate the fatigue properties of these materials, taking advantage of their static properties, can be useful for designers. In the recent literature, a simple method was proposed to estimate the strain-life curve of steels based only on the Brinell hardness and the elastic modulus of the material.

40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis is first, to determine material constants of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> (EN-GJS- 400 - 15,EN-GJS- 500 - 7, EN-GJS- 600 - 3) for estimating fatigue damage. These constants are obtained from experimental results. These results are stress versus strain tests, strain versus crack initiation life tests,and consequently, Smith, Watson and Topper damage parameter, PSWT can be calculated. Using data fitting, the constants can be estimated, thus Uniform Material Law for <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is fulfilled. Endurance limit stress is obtained {{based on research}} report termed Synthetic Wöhler Lines(SWL). It is {{found out that the}} endurance limit stress is a function of yield limit stress. Endurance life cycle is set as three millions for the three materials. Secondly, fatigue life assessment is done for diesel engine pump part made of the three <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> Finite element calculation is done to get elastic stress concentration factor, Kt, and plastic notch factor Kp. Neuber ´s rule is used to determine local stress at notch subjected to constant amplitude load test and variable amplitude loading. The constant amplitude loading is conducted at a stress ratio of R= 0 on the pump part. The test results show that fatigue life assessment based on the material constants is accurate. On the basis of the accuracy of constant amplitude test results, it is possible to determine for fatigue life for variable amplitude loading which is the real loading on the pump part. The variable amplitude loading is normally standardized for computational efficiency. This standardized loading is termed as CORAL (COmmon RAil Loading) sequence. CORAL is used to calculate fatigue life of pump part and is inputted to a Fatigue Life Evaluation computer program. This program uses rain flow cycle counting method. It can be concluded that the material constants for <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> fit well which is proved by experimental tests by constant amplitude loading on pump part.

50|$|Developed in 1948, nodular or <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has its {{graphite}} in {{the form}} of very tiny nodules with the graphite {{in the form}} of concentric layers forming the nodules.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Ductile iron {{discovery}} in 1948 gave {{a new lease}} on life to the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> family. In fact these <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> are characterised both by a high castability and by high toughness values, combining <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and steel good properties. <b>Ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> are also characterised by high fatigue crack propagation resistance, although this property is still not widely investigated. In the present work we considered three different ferritic-perlitic <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons,</b> characterised by different ferrite/perlite volume fractions. Their fatigue crack propagation resistance was investigated by means of fatigue crack propagation tests according to ASTM E 647 standard, considering three different stress ratios (R = Kmin/Kmax = 0. 1; 0. 5; 0. 75). Crack surfaces were extensively analysed by means of a scanning electron microscope.

Both chemical composition and manufacturing conditions control matrix microstructure, and ferritic, pearlitic, ferritic-pearlitic, martensitic, bainitic, austenitic and austempered ductile irons can be obtained. Considering crack propagation resistance of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons,</b> their peculiar behaviour is due to the graphite elements shape, that is approximately spheroidal. Due to their morphology, graphite elements can act as crack arresters: as a consequence <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> {{are characterized}} by high ductility and toughness values and can be used for loading conditions that could be considered as critical for other <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> types (e. g. fatigue loading conditions). Up to some years ago, microstructure analysis was mainly performed by means of semi-quantitative procedures applied to metallographically prepared specimens, with the characteristics evaluation that was mainly based on the operator expertise. Only recently there has been an increasing interest in numerical procedures of image analysis for quantitative evaluation of materials. In this work the problem of the estimation of the morphological parameters of elements such as graphite nodules, domains of chemical etching and metallic matrix has been taken up by a variational approach of image segmentation by active contours. Considering ductile irons, images obtained by means of a light optical microscope (LOM) on metallographically prepared specimens show both graphite elements (spheroids, nodules, lamaellas etc.) and microstructure elements (ferrite grains, pearlite lamaellas, etc.) and some artefacts due the preparing procedure that should be distinguished by more interesting elements. An automatic identification procedure is here proposed to distinguish the nodules from the metallic matrix and to evaluate the nodules shape parameters of interest and the composition of the metallic matrix (ferrite/pearlite volume fraction) ...|$|R

Protective internal linings and external coatings are often applied to ductile iron pipes to inhibit corrosion: the standard internal lining is cement mortar and standard external coatings include bonded zinc, asphalt or water-based paint. In highly corrosive environments loose polyethylene sleeving (LPS) to encase the pipe may also be used. Life expectancy of unprotected ductile iron pipes depends on the corrosiveness of soil present and tends to be shorter where soil is highly corrosive.
