In fact goats are more vulnerable to these parasites than either cattle or sheep. If a goat suffers from an infestation of worms, the effects on its health are serious, and sometimes fatal. Blood sucking worms, which live in the animal?s gut are the most common problem. These can make the goat anaemic and unhealthy, unable to grow or breed properly. Controlling internal parasites is therefore one of the most important factors in goat production. Many farmers use deworming medicines, and if used regularly these can help to maintain a healthy flock. There are also other management practices that reduce the risk of worm infestation. Worm eggs and larvae are spread in the dung of the animal, so hygiene in goat pens is important. Farmers should avoid grazing there goats on wet or swampy ground. Bushy areas are more likely to be free from worms. Dr Kanemanema, District Veterinary Officer in Lusaka, Zambia, explained more about the problem of internal parasites, and how they can be tackled, to Chris Kakunta.

BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Muzumbwe Kanemanema, District Veterinary Officer based in Lusaka, Zambia, on how farmers can reduce worm infestation in their goat flocks. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kanemanema	In goats we have round worm infestation, tape worm infestation and they do cause a lot of harm to goat production. Kakunta	For a lay man, a small scale farmer, how can they know that their goats are infested with worms? Kanemanema	A lay man or a farmer will realise that his goats are infested with worms from, one: goats might be showing signs of diarrhoea. The faecal matter will not be forming those round pellets, it will be in form of diarrhoea. And the second thing is the coats; the hair will be looking dry and they might be showing signs of pot belly. If the infestation is too high the worms might even be showing in the dung. From the faeces which the goats will drop, a farmer might notice that there are small round worms there. Kakunta	Now in the event that the farmer notices these symptoms what should they do? Kanemanema	Once a farmer notices these symptoms then he should look for medicines we call dewormers, medicines which get rid of worms. These medicines are in various preparations, there are some preparations which are in oral form which can be given in liquid form or in tablet form. Other preparations are in the injectable form. Kakunta	Apart from the medicines that you have talked about what else can a farmer do? Perhaps prevention at this point would be important? Kanemanema	Yes prevention normally when you are keeping goats is very important and a routine procedure should be arrived at where goats are dewormed every so often, especially during the rainy season because the worm infestation is too high during rainy season, or the wet season favours the worm multiplication. Kakunta	Now in terms of this regime, perhaps you can elaborate more so that our listeners would be able to follow how exactly this prevention can be done successfully? Kanemanema	With the use of dewormers goat farmers should deworm their goats at least 3 times in a year. And these 3 times, one should be at the beginning of the rainy season, then the second one should be at the middle of the rainy season and the third one should be at the end of the rainy season. If a farmer does this he will find that his goats will be more healthy and their production would be very good. He will realise profits out of it. Kakunta	As we come close to the end of the interview Dr Kanemanema, could you perhaps <b>just</b> <b>recap</b> some of the important factors that a farmer should follow in keeping the goats healthy especially with internal parasites? Kanemanema	Yes the farmer should make sure that his animals or his goats are dewormed in the frequency we have mentioned and then maybe the housing also matters, it will help on the prevention of these infestations. Because if the goats are going to be sleeping around in the dung, say if one goat is infested and is shedding those eggs and larvae in the faeces then the other goats might pick it. So housing should be in such a way that the dung is dropping down, whereby the animals are not coming into contact with the dung. Kakunta	What type of housing are we talking about? Kanemanema	A raised house where the floor should actually be allowing dung to go down. Kakunta	Can farmers manage to construct such a structure? Kanemanema	It is very easy to construct, it is wooden constructed and you know goat dung is in pellets, just the gaps in between the poles down there should be allowing these pellets to drop down. Kakunta	So a simple wooden structure can actually go a long way in preventing worm infestation? Kanemanema	Very much. End of track.

The proof is a reduction from the MAX-LABEL-COVER problem. <b>Just</b> to <b>recap,</b> let us begin by defining the problem instance. The MAX-LABEL-COVER(K,L) Problem: An instance to the MAX-LABEL-COVER(K,L) problem comprises of a bipartite graph G(U, V, E) with U and V being the two partitions, and a projection function πv→u: L → K on each edge (u, v). The objective is to obtain a labeling of the vertices (a function f: U → K, V → L) which satisfies maximum fraction of the edges. Edge (u, v) is satisfied by labeling f {{if and only if}} f(u) = πv→u(f(v)). Figure 1 describes such an instance. The following theorem has been proved by Raz. Theorem 1. 1. [3] Given any constant η> 0, there exists a constant q = q(η) such that the 1 vs η decision problem for MAX-LABEL-COVER(K,L) is NP-Hard with |K|, |L | ≤ q. Moreover, the constant q is actually bounded by poly(1 /η). Improved results on parallel repetition are proved by Holenstein [2] and Feige et al. [1]. Further, the hardness result holds (as {{we have seen in the}} first homework) even under the assumptions that G is left and right regular and |U | = |V |. We use this stronger result in our reduction to prove the soundness. Also, it is important to note that the size of the label sets K and L are bounded by a function which depends only on η. This means that for a fixed value of η, the sizes of K and L are at most a constant. We now reduce an instance G of MAX-LABEL-COVER(K,L) to an instance H of MAX-COVERAGE such that Opt(G) = 1 ⇒ Opt(H) = 1 (Completeness) Opt(G) < η ⇒ Opt(H) < 3 / 4 + ɛ (Soundness) where ɛ is a function of only η. We can see that once we prove completeness and soundness, we are through (by application of Theorem 1. 1). Note that we have overloaded G to denote both the instance of the MAX-LABEL-COVER(K,L) problem, as well as the graph in the instance...|$|R
