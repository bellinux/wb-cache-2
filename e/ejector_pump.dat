40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research was to provide a detailed understanding of the performance of gas turbine engines inside indoor sea-level test beds. In particular the evaluation of both thrust correction factors and the estimation of the mass flow entering the test cell were {{at the core of the}} research. The project has been fully sponsored by Rolls-Royce pIc. Initially, their principal objective was to assess the relevance and accuracy of CFD when applied to thrust measurement inside indoor test beds with an intended outcome of minimising the use of expensive experimental measurements. The different system interfaces and accounting systems for in-flight conditions, available in the open literature have been developed and adapted for indoor environments. This has led to the definition of three different thrust correction equations using alternative definitions of thrust correction factor. Aero-dynamic principles have been applied for the derivation of one-dimensional relationships for the calculation of each thrust correction factor using generic engine-cell performance and dimensions. A one-dimensional analytical model has been developed to represent the enginedetuner <b>ejector</b> <b>pump.</b> This is able to characterise the engine-cell system performance and is used as the main tool for providing a matching procedure capable of predicting the cell entrainment ratio. By processing experimental data relevant to different engine-cell configurations through the <b>ejector</b> <b>pump</b> analytical model, a method for achieving the entrainment ratio control inside the cell has been identified. The CFD work has been concentrated into three main activities: • A quantitative extrapolation of the thrust correction factors including, the pre-entry force, the external and the total bellmouth force, the throat stream force, the intake momentum drag and the base drag. • The representation of the engine-detuner ejector performance for a variety of engine-cell configurations. • The modelling of the generic test cell components including the inlet stack, the cascade elbow, the exhaust stack & the blast basket. The outcomes of this research have been very successful in enhancing the validity of the thrust correction equations developed [...] In particular, the use of a one-dimensional approach in their estimation has been shown to be fully justified. The work has also emphasised the value of CFD in supporting the derivation of the matching procedure for predicting and controlling cell entrainment ratio. Indeed, one of the strongest outcomes of this work has been the conclusion that both the engine-cell characteristic lines computed with the one-dimensional model and those computed with CFD for different cell configurations are almost identical. In addition, the use of CFD as a tool for the quantitative evaluation of the thrust correction factors has been established.

In addition to pumping, the steam generator may also be used for microrocket thrust generation in micropropulsion applications. In this thesis, the design, fabrication, testing, and successful demonstration of the MEMS steam generator are presented. The device consists of a mixing section for the peroxide and catalyst streams, a reactor section where the peroxide decomposes, and finally a nozzle section where the gaseous products of the decomposition are accelerated to the required velocities. To design the device, multidomain (chemical, thermal, and fluidic) numerically-implemented modeling is used to study the underlying physics and arrive at an optimized, microfabricatable design. The modeling takes into account the key challenges of thermal management, achieving fast mixing, and boundary layer compensation. The device is then fabricated from a stack of four silicon wafers and one Pyrex wafer using deep reactive ion etching and wafer bonding. The modeling also guides the design of a micabased ceramic package which provides both thermal insulation and piping ports. The system is then experimentally tested using high-test hydrogen peroxide and ferrous chloride tetrahydrate solution as the catalyst. The overall initial peroxide mass fraction is varied between 83 % and 71 %. The device is characterized using temperature measurements, refractive index analysis, and visual inspection during operation. Successful performance is demonstrated via the full decomposition of the peroxide and the complete vaporization of the water produced. The experimental results are also compared with those from the simulation. Good agreement is observed between experiment and theory, providing comprehensive model verification.

40|$|Modeling droplet {{condensation}} via CFD codes {{can be very}} tedious, time consuming, and inaccurate. CFD codes may be {{tedious and}} time consuming {{in terms of using}} Lagrangian particle tracking approaches or particle sizing bins. Also since many codes ignore conduction through the droplet and or the degradating effect of heat and mass transfer if noncondensible species are present, the solutions may be inaccurate. The modeling of a condensing spray chamber where the significant size of the water droplets and the time and distance these droplets take to fall, can make the effect of droplet conduction a physical factor that needs to be considered in the model. Furthermore the presence of even a relatively small amount of noncondensible has been shown {{to reduce the amount of}} condensation [Ref 1]. It is desirable then to create a modeling tool that addresses these issues. The path taken to create such a tool is illustrated. The application of this tool and subsequent results are based on the spray chamber in the Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility (B 2) located at NASA's Plum Brook Station that tested an RL- 10 engine. The platform upon which the condensation physics is modeled is SINDAFLUINT. The use of SINDAFLUINT enables the ability to model various aspects of the entire testing facility, including the rocket exhaust duct flow and heat transfer to the exhaust duct wall. The <b>ejector</b> <b>pumping</b> system of the spray chamber is also easily implemented via SINDAFLUINT. The goal is to create a transient one dimensional flow and heat transfer model beginning at the rocket, continuing through the condensing spray chamber, and finally ending with the <b>ejector</b> <b>pumping</b> system. However the model of the condensing spray chamber may be run independently of the rocket and ejector systems detail, with only appropriate mass flow boundary conditions placed at the entrance and exit of the condensing spray chamber model. The model of the condensing spray chamber takes into account droplet conduction as well as the degrading effect of mass and heat transfer due to the presence of noncondensibles. The one dimension model of the condensing spray chamber makes no presupposition on the pressure profile within the chamber, allowing the implemented droplet physics of heat and mass transfer coupled to the SINDAFLUINT solver to determine a transient pressure profile of the condensing spray chamber.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was to study the possibility of applying a vacuum drying system operated by water <b>ejector</b> <b>pump</b> to dry agricultural product commercially. The objective aimed to {{examine the impact of}} some variables on water ejector pump's performance and predict the best point for drying. The effect of four dependent variables, i. e. vacuum, temperature, water pressure and make-up air quantity on the moisture removal in a drying chamber was studied. The performances of a water injection vacuum drying system, the forms of moisture extraction ratio (MER) and specific moisture extraction ratio (SMER) were evaluated at the steady state (or constant drying rate) of water in a tray-dryer chamber. Four values of the vacuum in the range of 17 kPa (- 60 cmHg) to atmospheric pressure (0 cmHg) combined with four values of temperature setting in the range of 40 to 70 oC, were used. The result revealed that the air temperature was the most influential effect on the MER and SMER compared to the vacuum pressure in the chamber. The vacuum pressure offered the least effect to the MER and SMER of the system. However, breeding the fresh air into the chamber while retaining the preset value of vacuum increased the MER and SMER. The MER and SMER at the chamber's temperature of 50, 60, 70 oC when compared to the values at 40 oC, were increased about 50, 120, 200 % and by 40, 100, 150 % respectively. With reference to the values of MER and SMER at the vacuum pressure of 17 kPa (- 60 cmHg), it was found that at 44 kPa (- 40 cmHg) and 70 kPa (- 20 cmHg), the MER decreased by 8 and 7 % respectively. In contrary to the same reference vacuum pressure of 17 kPa (- 60 cmHg), the SMER, at 44 kPa (- 40 cmHg) and 70 kPa (- 20 cmHg) were increased by 7 and 3 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This thesis extends {{previous}} {{work that has}} been carried out in an air-water system in a gas-liquid ejector. The thesis presents the experimental programme undertaken and contains a survey of the available literature on the effects of liquid physical properties in gas-liquid ejector systems. The survey concentrates on the effects of coalescence inhibition and touches on viscosity effects. Due to the lack of research in such systems, the literature review was extended to look at the work carried out in stagnant fluids and in other systems such as stirred tank reactors and bubble columns. This was used to identify a fluid that would represent a non-coalescing system. The experimental work was split into three parts: the effect a) of flow parameters on gas holdup and bubble size in an air-water system; b) of coalescence inhibition and c) of liquid viscosity on ejector performance. Parameters measured in order to establish the ejector performance in the coalescence inhibited and viscous solutions were gas entrainment, <b>ejector</b> <b>pumping</b> efficiency, bubble size, gas holdup and mass transfer. A non-coalescing fluid was simulated using a 0. 08 M Magnesium Sulphate solution. It is believed, based on results reported by various researchers that this concentration was sufficient to achieve a near non-coalescing fluid. Various experiments were carried out and the above mentioned parameters measured to assess the ejector performance against a pure water system. Experimental results showed that coalescence inhibition has little effect on gas entrainment or gas holdup (and hence slip-velocity). However, the Sauter mean diameter decreases with the non-coalescing nature and the bubbles were seen to be more spherical and appeared more rigid. Values of kLa are similar between coalescing and non-coalescing systems; this is due to an increase in a {{and at the same time}} a corresponding decrease in kL which may be due to a decrease in diffusivity. Newtonian CMC solution provided a viscous system over a range of viscosities (3 - 10 mPas). Comparisons were made with water (1 mPas) for the ejector performance parameters. Experimental results showed that viscosity has a small effect on gas entrainment and <b>ejector</b> <b>pumping</b> efficiency and little effect on gas holdup (and hence slip-velocity). Sauter mean diameter was found to decrease with an increase in liquid viscosity, producing more spherical bubbles. Values of kLa were smaller for an increase in viscosity, despite an increase in a. This is due to a more significant decrease in kL due to the effect of liquid viscosity reducing the diffusivity...|$|R
50|$|In Britain, where steam hauled trains {{generally}} have vacuum operated brakes, {{it was quite}} common for turntables to be operated by vacuum motors worked from the locomotive's vacuum <b>ejector</b> or <b>pump</b> via a flexible hose or pipe although a few manually and electrically operated examples exist. The major manufacturers were Ransomes and Rapier, Ipswich and Cowans Sheldon, Carlisle. The GWR was the railway company that built several tables for its own use; {{there is little evidence}} any other companies did so.|$|R
50|$|The air <b>ejector</b> or Venturi <b>pump</b> {{is similar}} to the steam ejector but uses {{high-pressure}} air as the working fluid. Multistage air ejectors can be used, but since air cannot easily be condensed at room temperature, an air ejector is usually limited to two stages.|$|R
