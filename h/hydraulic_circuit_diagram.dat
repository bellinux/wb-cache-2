A general structure of the diagnostic system is implemented, which is the extension of an existing diagnostic system we developed in recent years.

30|$|Two {{types of}} {{circuits}} {{are commonly used}} to control hydraulic actuators: open and closed. In open circuits, power generated by a motor is reduced and regulated by a valve and is transmitted to a hydraulic actuator. Much of the power is dissipated in the valve, resulting in lower efficiency and larger system designs. Figure  1 shows a schematic of an open <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit.</b> In closed circuits (known as electro-hydrostatic actuators or EHAs) a servomotor generates and directly controls the power. Figure  2 shows a schematic of a closed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> (EHA). Closed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> offer three advantages: (1) the systems are simple and small; (2) the efficiency is high; (3) valve-related nonlinearities are omitted. However, there is a drawback in EHAs; the control performance of EHAs is worse than that of open <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Therefore, control performance of EHAs is improved in this study.|$|R

50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{a system}} {{comprising}} an interconnected set of discrete components that transport liquid. The purpose of this system may be to control where fluid flows (as in a network of tubes of coolant in a thermodynamic system) or to control fluid pressure (as in hydraulic amplifiers). For example, hydraulic machinery uses <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuits</b> (in which <b>hydraulic</b> fluid is pushed, under pressure, through hydraulic pumps, pipes, tubes, hoses, hydraulic motors, hydraulic cylinders, and so on) to move heavy loads. The approach of describing a fluid system in terms of discrete components is inspired {{by the success of}} electrical circuit theory. Just as electric circuit theory works when elements are discrete and linear, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> theory works best when the elements (passive component such as pipes or transmission lines or active components such as power packs or pumps) are discrete and linear. This usually means that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>circuit</b> analysis works best for long, thin tubes with discrete pumps, as found in chemical process flow systems or microscale devices.|$|R
