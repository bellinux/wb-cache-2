Searching for features efficiently representing natural images and investigating their statistics are the fundamentals {{in the task}} of IQA models design. In this context, we have proposed previously a novel reduced reference (RR) IQA model in which groups of the named <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> are good to represent the local distribution of the zero-crossings both for natural images and their distorted counterpart, and then proposed a RR IQA model. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} issue of the interesting <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> related to natural images, i. e., what are the <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> good at representing ZC distribution of natural images? And how should we do to use them for IQA model design? Along those ideas, we extract 39 groups of <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> from 110 natural pictures by a defined curvature rule. Combined with error tolerance, the 39 groups of <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> can well represent the ZC distribution of both the reference and distortion images.

40|$|Graphs {{depicted}} as node-link diagrams {{are widely used}} to show relationships between entities.

The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high-level <b>edge</b> <b>patterns.</b> Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level <b>edge</b> <b>patterns.</b> Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow.

40|$|A {{method for}} spatial {{resolution}} enhancement, or sharpening of three bands of a Landsat thematic mapper (TM) multispectral image by a higher resolution SPOT panchromatic (pan) image, is described. Visible band TM images having positive correlation with the geometrically coregis-tered pan image are sharpened with a reported multiresolution sharpening technique. Application of neural network estimation technique is described to improve sharpening of near-infrared bands specifically {{when there are}} reverse contrast <b>patterns</b> at respective <b>edge</b> boundaries of the pan and TM images. Unless corrections are made for reverse patterns there will be degraded sharpening. Thus multilayer feedforward neural networks are trained to adaptively estimate, at multiple reso-lutions, pan <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> that have the same contrast as the TM <b>edge</b> <b>patterns.</b> Using this esti-mated data with a reported multiresolution sharpening technique gives spatial resolution enhancement. Image examples illustrate opposite contrast edges of pan and near-infrared TM bands.

40|$|Identifying context-specific entity {{networks}} from {{aggregated data}} {{is an important}} task, arising often in bioinformatics and neuroimaging. Computationally, this task can be formulated as jointly estimating multiple different, but related, sparse Undirected Graphical Models (UGM) from aggregated samples across several contexts. Previous joint-UGM studies have mostly focused on sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (sGGMs) and can't identify context-specific <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> directly. We, therefore, propose a novel approach, SIMULE (detecting Shared and Individual parts of MULtiple graphs Explicitly) to learn multi-UGM via a constrained L 1 minimization. SIMULE automatically infers both specific <b>edge</b> <b>patterns</b> that are unique to each context and shared interactions preserved among all the contexts. Through the L 1 constrained formulation, this problem is cast as multiple independent subtasks of linear programming that can be solved efficiently in parallel. In addition to Gaussian data, SIMULE can also handle multivariate Nonparanormal data that greatly relaxes the normality assumption that many real-world applications do not follow. We provide a novel theoretical proof showing that SIMULE achieves a consistent result at the rate O(log(Kp) /n_{tot}). On multiple synthetic datasets and two biomedical datasets, SIMULE shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art multi-sGGM and single-UGM baselines.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a hierarchical {{neural network system}} for improving the edge measurements obtained by an edge operator. The neural network system is designed to adjust the edge measurements {{based on the information}} provided by neighbouring edges. The adopted strategy is to analyze the local edge patterns to determine and reinforce edge structures while suppressing unwanted noise and false edges. The hierarchical neural network system is made up of four levels of subnets. The subnet in the first level consists of high-order neural nets to determine the potential adjustment on the element of interest by detecting edge contours according to the selected processes in the neural nets and the input local <b>edge</b> <b>pattern.</b> The second level consists of a cooperative-competitive neural net model to determine the orientation of the strongest edge contour in the local <b>edge</b> <b>pattern.</b> The subnet in the third level consists of two types of neural net models. A high-order neural net ascertains the conditions for adjusting the gradient magnitude and determines the amount of adjustment to the gradient magnitude. A semilinear feedforward net is used to compute the new adjusted gradient magnitude and determines if the element of interest is to be an edge element or a non-edge element. The subnet in level four is a semilinear feedforward net which is used to determine the new orientation for the element of interest. A fast learning algorithm is developed to derive suitable weights for the neural nets to perform efficiently and correctly. Using the hierarchical neural network system for each element in the image, highly parallel processing can be achieved. An iterative approach incorporated into the neural network system has also enabled the application of global analysis in the process of adjusting the edge measurements. As a result, the final edge measurements are more accurate...|$|E
