500|$|In [...] "Legends of the Dark Knight", {{an episode}} of The New Batman Adventures, three {{teenagers}} discuss their ideas about what Batman <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>like.</b> They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's Batman and Robin. The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain. In Watchmen, director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from Batman & Robin for the Ozymandias costume. The film is referenced in the [...] episode [...] "Legends of the Dark Mite!", when Bat-Mite briefly uses his powers to transform Batman's costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher Batman films, before declaring it [...] "Too icky". The Batman from Batman & Robin later appeared {{as part of an}} army of Batmen gathered from across the Multiverse in [...] "Night of the Batmen!", complete with the blue rubber Batsuit. Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to Batman & Robin and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film , which was originally planned for release at around the same time as Batman & Robin but was subsequently delayed. However, SubZero received a far stronger positive response from critics than Batman & Robin, with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a Batman villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of [...]|$|E

So I'm like, I don't wanna sit on the songs, and I listened to the playlist and it kinda sounded like Crenshaw, it sounded like the environment, like my upbringing. So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like. And really kinda like, create the question in their mind, 'if this is the mixtape, what is gunna be on the album?'" ...|$|E

Hook asks why keep it a secret, and {{she says that she}} did this because she knew he would want to stop her. She says the dark magic must be put into a vessel, and then Emma will cut her down. Emma says that’s why she needed the baby out. She reminds him that Zelena killed Marian and Neal, but Hook says that it’s still [...] "cold-blooded murder." [...] Hook says Merlin must have a better solution, but she says that he can’t help them anymore. Hook asks what happened to Merlin, and he asks her again why she’s really doing this. Mary asks David and Regina how Emma can use Zelena to end dark magic, but they can't figure it out. Regina says no one hurts her sister except for her and tells them she’s going to show Emma what dark magic <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>like.</b> Mary Margaret and David argue with Regina over going to war with Emma. Regina says Emma gave her the dagger because they knew {{she was the only one}} who could act. Emma comes out and says when she’s done with Zelena, they will all be better off. Regina says that his is not right, but Emma says she knows Regina will be happier when Zelena is gone. Emma uses Excalibur to freeze them, while putting up a magic barrier around the house.|$|E

6000|$|The {{exhibits}} of {{food are}} especially remarkable. We cleaned the glass case with our sleeves and {{peered at the}} most appetising revelations. There are dozens of little bottles hermetically sealed, containing such curios as a sample of [...] "Bacon Common (Gammon) Uncooked," [...] and then the same cooked--it looked no nicer cooked--Irish sausage, pork sausage, black pudding, Welsh mutton, {{and all kinds of}} rare and exquisite feeding. There are ever so many cases of this kind of thing. We saw, for instance, further along, several good specimens of the common oyster shell (Ostrea edulis), cockle shells, and whelks, both [...] "almonds" [...] and [...] "whites," [...] and then came breadstuffs. The breadstuffs are particularly impressive, of a grey, scientific aspect, a hard, hoary antiquity. We always knew that stale bread was good for one, but yet the Parkes Museum startled us with the antique pattern it recommended. There was a muffin, too, identified and labelled, but without any Latin name, a captured crumpet, a collection of buns, a dinner-roll, and a something novel to us, called Pumpernickel, that we had rather be without, or rather--for the expression is ambiguous--that we had rather not be without, but altogether remote from. And all these things have been tested by an analyst, with the most painful results. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and the like nasty chemical things seem indeed to have occurred in everything he touched. Those sturdy mendicants who go about complaining that they cannot get food should visit this Parkes Museum and see what food <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> and learn contentment with their lot.|$|E
6000|$|I think I {{neglected}} to record that I saw Miss Martineau {{a few weeks}} since. She is a large, robust, elderly woman, and plainly dressed; but withal she has so kind, cheerful, and intelligent a face that she is pleasanter to look at than most beauties. Her hair is of a decided gray, and she does not shrink from calling herself old. She is the most continual talker I ever heard; it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> the babbling of a brook, and very lively and sensible too; {{and all the while}} she talks, she moves the bowl of her ear-trumpet from one auditor to another, so that it becomes quite an organ of intelligence and sympathy between her and yourself. The ear-trumpet seems a sensible part of her, like the antennae of some insects. If you have any little remark to make, you drop it in; and she helps you to make remarks by this delicate little appeal of the trumpet, as she slightly directs it towards you; and if you have nothing to say, the appeal is not strong enough to embarrass you. All her talk was about herself and her affairs; but it did not seem like egotism, because it was so cheerful and free from morbidness. And this woman is an Atheist, and thinks that the principle of life will become extinct when her body is laid in the grave! I will not think so; were it only for her sake. What! only a few weeds to spring out of her mortality, instead of her intellect and sympathies flowering and fruiting forever! ...|$|E
