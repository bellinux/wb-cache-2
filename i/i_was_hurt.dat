60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> {{and showed}} it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't yesterday," [...] she reproached him, {{somewhat}} dazed by the swiftness of her submission, {{and feeling}} still {{the traces of}} a lingering resentment. She had not intended to surrender. [...] "You forgot all about me, you didn't know I was here, much less that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b> Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt!</b> And you--I can tell at once when anything's wrong with you--I know without your saying it." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{thinking}} over Ethelbertha's words afterwards, {{have come}} to see their wisdom; but at the time I admit <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> and indignant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Disappointed?' he went on, as {{he walked}} between them under the trees. 'Yes. No doubt <b>I</b> <b>am</b> disappointed. <b>Hurt?</b> Yes. No doubt <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt.</b> That's only natural. But what I mean when I say that people who put {{themselves}} {{in the same position}} are mostly used in the same way--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] she said, [...] "but my face {{probably}} reflects my feelings. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt</b> and grieved {{and disappointed}} in you, Henry." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sass Jordan: [...] "I've {{got to say}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> a bit at the beginning, but you totally {{redeemed}} {{yourself with}} that moment at the end" [...] (2) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, miss, they didn't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> {{quite enough}} to require it," [...] {{answered}} Giles, his drooping moustache curling slightly as he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty {{nearly all}} right again," [...] Furley {{answered}} cheerfully. [...] "Seems to me I was frightened before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b> What about your head?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Mrs. Cartwright agreed. [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> {{because you}} did not. You ought to know all that's mine is yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, he would, if {{he thought}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> the institution. See {{what they did to}} poor little Combes, who mildly claimed to be able to hypnotize people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fight on, my men, says Sir Andrew Barton, [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not slaine; [...] I'll lie me {{down and}} bleed a-while, [...] And then I'll rise and fight againe.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Bathurst said. [...] "I felt a sort {{of shock}} as I {{got out of the}} water, but I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt</b> at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by the {{careless}} tone {{with which}} he conveyed this information, and replied coldly: [...] "I am obliged to you for your intelligence, and will avail myself of it." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{heard me}} to the end, and then she leaned back {{on the sofa and}} laughed,--laughed until I thought the people in the street must hear her. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> but said nothing.|$|E
60|$|Hitherto, I {{had kept}} my arm in his. I drew it out now. If his reply meant anything, {{it meant that}} he had once thought me capable of {{breaking}} faith with him. He saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] {{the knight}} murmured, {{as he opened}} his vizor. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt</b> to death. Leave me here to die quietly, and look to yourselves. All is lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't feel hurt, dear," [...] {{returned}} the old lady, {{with a slight}} dash of her argumentative tone; [...] "and don't you think that if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>I</b> should feel it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did she {{not make}} me one? But that is all, all over. You tell her from me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not the man}} to whimper because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt.</b> What ought a man to do that I can't do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Great God, Prendick!" [...] he said, not {{noticing that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> [...] "that brute's loose! Tore the fetter {{out of the}} wall! Have you seen them?" [...] Then sharply, seeing I gripped my arm, [...] "What's the matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CANDOUR. True, true, Child; but there's no {{stopping}} people's Tongues. I own <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> to hear it--as I indeed {{was to learn}} from the same quarter that your guardian, Sir Peter[,] and Lady Teazle have not agreed lately so well as could be wish'd.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seven, is it? It is a longish seven miles, Mr. Heathcote. How could I {{get that}} distance? I ain't {{so good at}} walking as I was before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b> You should have remembered that, Mr. Heathcote, when you laid hands on me the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt</b> gravely enough, {{though not}} {{so as to}} imperil my life. I have a wound {{on the side of}} my head, and the same blow, as the doctor says, cleft through my shoulder-bone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} mean that?" [...] he asked, {{in a tone}} of deep disappointment. [...] "If you do, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt.</b> It proves that the {{friendship}} which to me is so dear, is to you a very slight thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How could you? Am I {{not what}} your father calls a natural actor? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an actor long before I became Scaramouche. Therefore I have laughed. I often do when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt.</b> When you <b>were</b> pleased to <b>be</b> disdainful, <b>I</b> acted disdain in my turn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to think," [...] Charlie said feebly. [...] "I {{do not know}} where I am, or why I am here. I {{remember}} that there was a fray in the street, and I suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b> But why was I brought here, instead of being taken to my lodgings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{intend to}} mention it--you'll {{keep it to}} yourself. I'd got into {{a bit of a}} mess shortly before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> at the ravine, and Harding paid up the money-lender I'd gone to in Winnipeg. What's more, he beat the fellow down, so that I only had to account for what I {{actually}} got." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I lay still," [...] he said, [...] "scared {{out of my}} wits, {{with the}} fore quarter of a horse atop of me. We'd been wiped out. And the smell--good God! Like burnt meat! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> across the back {{by the fall of}} the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I don't think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt,</b> Sam," [...] she faltered, {{and then}} looked rather tearfully into his face. [...] "But it was an awful experience--awful!" [...] and then as he drew a little closer she {{suddenly}} burst into a fit of weeping and rested {{her head on his}} shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{the officer}} {{that came with}} Hurry?" [...] she asked. [...] "If you are, we ought all to thank you, for, though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt,</b> the rest have saved their lives. Did Harry March tell you, where to find us, and how much need there was for your services?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Catherine, {{after a few}} moments' reflection, [...] "I do not--ought I? To say the truth, though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt</b> and grieved, that I cannot {{still love}} her, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} too much spirit to show <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> though," [...] cries Hetty, {{clenching}} her little fists. [...] "And I would smile, though that horrible old painted woman boxed my ears. She is horrible, mamma. You think so yourself, Theo! Own, now, you think so yourself! You said so last night, and acted her coming in on her crutch, and grinning round to the company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the tower}} of Tillietudlem," [...] {{said one of the}} soldiers. [...] "Old Lady Margaret Bellenden lives there. She's one of the best {{affected}} women in the country, and one that's a soldier's friend. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by one of the d--d whig dogs that shot at me from behind a fauld-dike, I lay a month there, and would stand such another wound to be in as good quarters again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, but {{although}} I have known right I {{have always done}} wrong," [...] returned Gartok moodily. [...] "I am sorry now. If you had not been kind to me, your enemy, Cheenbuk, I {{should never have been}} sorry. Ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by the Fire-spouters you have been kind to me, and now you would save my life if you could. But it is too late. You have known right, and done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|When the {{master-at-arms}} advanced {{with the}} prisoner's shirt, Ushant waved {{him off with}} the dignified air of a Brahim, saying, [...] "Do you think, master-at-arms, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hurt?</b> <b>I</b> will put on my own garment. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> never the worse for it, man; and 'tis no dishonour when he who would dishonour you, only dishonours himself." ...|$|R
60|$|McCOMAS. I {{shall not}} proceed, sir. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too <b>hurt,</b> too shocked, to proceed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't {{tell you}} why," [...] Ralph replied, [...] "only we don't do it. I don't say I shouldn't halloo out if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>hurt</b> very much, though I should try my best not to; but I feel sure I shouldn't cry {{like a great}} baby. Why, {{what would be the}} good of it?" ...|$|R
