40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in wireless communication and electronic manufacture have enabled {{a variety of}} sensors {{to be used for}} Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), which can provide real-time body monitoring and feedback for enabling patient diagnostics procedure, rehabilitation, sports training and interactive performance. However, existing single-hop wireless communication scheme faces several major challenges: rapid growth of channel conflicts as more sensors added, impermeabil-ity of human body to radio waves and highly dynamic network topology due to human movements. In this paper, a prototype of multi-hop WBAN has been built to quantify the channel conflict and to characterise the network connectivity during human motions. A probability based routing protocol fusing inertial sensor data and history link quality is then developed, which aims at capturing the high spatio-temporal change of network topology on the selection of a reliable relay node in WBAN routing. The performance of the protocol is experimentally evaluated on our prototype system. Compared with a number of existing routings, the proposed scheme is more splendid in terms <b>of</b> average <b>delivery</b> ratio, number <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> and end-to-end delay. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract–The use of {{deadline}} based channel scheduling in sup-port <b>of</b> {{real time}} <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> application data units (ADU’s) is in-vestigated. Of interest is priority scheduling where a packet {{with a smaller}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> deadline over number <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> to destina-tion is given a higher priority. It {{has been shown that}} a variant of this scheduling algorithm, based on head-of-the-line priority, is ef-ficient and effective in supporting real time <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> ADU’s. In this variant, packets with a ratio smaller than or equal to a given threshold are sent to the higher priority queue. We first present a technique to select this threshold dynamically. The effectiveness of our technique is evaluated by simulation. We then study the performance of deadline based channel scheduling for large net-works, with multiple autonomous systems. For this case, accurate information on number <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> to destination may not be avail-able. A technique to estimate this distance metric is presented. The effectiveness of our algorithm with this estimated distance metric is evaluated. In addition, we study the performance of a multi-service scenario where {{only a fraction of the}} routers deploy deadline based channel scheduling. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the scaling of the number <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> in a large scale wireless ad-hoc network (WANET), a quantity we call network latency. A large network latency affects all aspects of data communication in a WANET, including an increase in delay, packet loss, required processing power and memory. We consider network management and data routing challenges in WANETs with scalable network latency. On the physical side, reducing network latency imposes a significantly higher power and bandwidth demand on nodes, as is reflected in a set of new bounds. On the protocol front, designing distributed routing protocols that can guarantee the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> data packets within scalable number <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> is a challenging task. To solve this, we introduce multi-resolution randomized hierarchy (MRRH), a novel power and bandwidth efficient WANET protocol with scalable network latency. MRRH uses a randomized algorithm for building and maintaining a random hierarchical network topology, which together with the proposed routing algorithm can guarantee efficient <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> data packets in the wireless network. For a network of size N, MRRH can provide an average latency of only O(^ 3 N). The power and bandwidth consumption of MRRH are shown to be nearly optimal for the latency it provides. Therefore, MRRH, is a provably efficient candidate for truly large scale wireless ad-hoc networking...|$|R

Phosphatase treatment of mouse cell extracts reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> isoforms compared to untreated extracts, providing the first direct evidence that Hop was phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that a cdc 2 kinase phosphorylation mimic <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> had reduced affinity for Hsp 90 binding.

A putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified within the Hsp 90 -binding domain <b>of</b> <b>Hop.</b> Although substitution <b>of</b> residues within the major arm of this proposed NLS abolished Hop–Hsp 90 interaction as determined by SPR, this was not sufficient to prevent the nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> under leptomycin-B treatment and heat shock conditions.
