It also allows the database to avoid the overhead of filling in holes in memory or disk structures but requires (generally) the system to periodically sweep through and delete the old, obsolete data objects. For a document-oriented database it also allows the system to optimize documents by writing entire documents onto contiguous sections of disk—when updated, the entire document can be re-written rather than bits and pieces cut out or maintained in a linked, non-contiguous database structure.|$|E

Since web site structure is always changed, we need not only consider the frequency of click behavior but also web site structure to mine web navigation patterns for navigation prediction. To reduce the overhead of dynamically mining the web navigation patterns from the web data, a dynamic mining approach is needed by using the previous mining results and computing new patterns just from the inserted or <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of the web data. In this paper, we propose a special data structure named Ideal-Tree (Inverted-database Expectable Tree) to avoid the effort of scanning database.

Based on the discovered patterns, we also give a navigation prediction model. The experimental results show that our prediction model outperforms other approaches substantially in terms o...|$|E

To identify possible viral gene products involved in PRV virulence, we investigated the transcriptional and translational pattern of the <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of the Us region. Northern blots demonstrated that one major RNA species (3. 8 kilobases) transcribed from fragment 7 A was missing in the vaccine strains, whereas other transcripts were altered. Radioimmunoprecipitation of in vivo-labeled PRV glycoproteins and of in vitro-translated polypeptides with hyperimmune serum and monoclonal antibodies indicated a lack of glycoprotein gI. Hybrid-selection experiments with subcloned DNA fragments confirmed the absence of gI and of a 40, 000 -molecular-weight polypeptide.

40|$|Palaeosols {{may offer}} {{excellent}} {{evidence for the}} development of sedimentary basins but few studies have used diagenetically altered material: here we show that material of this sort can also reflect the sedimentary environment. The Lower to Middle Triassic red beds of the western Iberian Ranges were deposited in a tectonically active half-graben in which subsidence rates varied along the basin as a response to differential fault movements. During this period the basin was filled by a set of fluvial units with interbedded palaeosols. The palaeosols show typical pedogenic calcrete profiles, although extensive dolomitization has <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of their microstructure; however, macrostructure and morphology are preserved. Differences in the maturity stages of the palaeosols are related to the changes in subsidence and sedimentation rates along the basin. Thus, two different scenarios are recognized at: (i) the hanging wall, Riba de Santiuste area, where palaeosols reach stage III as the episodic tilting of the floodplain inhibited the development of more mature soils and (ii) the footwall, Cercadillo area, where palaeosols attain stage V maturity, favoured by prolonged periods of tectonic stability resulting in lower sedimentation rates over the floodplain areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Discovering web {{traversal}} patterns is {{an important}} issue in web usage mining with various applications like navigation prediction and improvement of website management. Since web data grows so rapidly and some web data may become out of date over time, we need not only consider the new data but also delete the old one to re-mine new web traversal patterns. To reduce the overhead of re-mining the web traversal patterns from the whole web data, an incremental mining approach is needed by using the previous mining results and computing new patterns just from the inserted or <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of the web data. In this paper, we propose an efficient incremental web traversal pattern mining algorithm named IncWTP_PLM (Incremental mining of Web Traversal Patterns by using Projected-database Link Matrix). Meanwhile, a special data structure named Projected-database Link Matrix is proposed to avoid scanning original database. Besides, the website structure is also considered in IncWTP_PLM such that each web traversal pattern discovered is qualified. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms other approaches substantially in terms of efficiency.

We then <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of thyA by gene replacement. The resulting strain, MBP 71 ΔthyA, was devoid of TS activity, and in media without thymidine, such as milk, there was no detectable dTTP pool in the cells. Hence, DNA replication was abolished, and acidification by MBP 71 was completely unaffected {{by the presence of}} nine different phages tested at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0. 1. Nonreplicating MBP 71 must be inoculated at a higher level than CHCC 373 to achieve a certain pH within a specified time. For a pH of 5. 2 to be reached in 6 h, the inoculation level of MBP 71 must be 17 -fold higher than for CHCC 373. However, by adding a limiting amount of thymidine this could be lowered to just 5 -fold the normal amount, while acidification was unaffected with MBP 71 up to an MOI of 0. 01.

In this study, we have identified and characterized a mutant observed in F 1 and backcrossed BC 1 populations from a cross between chm 1 - 3 and ecotype Columbia. This mutant, maternal distorted leaf (MDL), grows very poorly and is distinguished by distorted rough leaves and aborted flowering organs. Electron microscopic observation showed that in MDL plants, {{a significant portion of}} mitochondria are abnormal and appear to be nonfunctional. DNA gel blot and sequence analysis of the MDL mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) revealed rearrangements in two mtDNA fragments associated with rps 3 -rpl 16 genes (encoding ribosomal proteins S 3 and L 16, respectively). One rearrangement resulted in the insertion of the rps 3 -rpl 16 operon downstream of atp 9. An independent deletion in this region had eliminated the majority of rps 3. In contrast, another rearrangement <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of rpl 16, whereas rps 3 remained intact.

The L 45 -disrupted strain also grew well in both media but at a slower rate than the parental culture. A diploid strain was obtained by crossing both transformants, and by tetrad analysis it was shown that the double transformant lacking both genes is not viable. These results indicated that proteins L 44 and L 45 are independently dispensable for cell growth and that the ribosome is functional in the absence of either of them...|$|E

40|$|In {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) -infected cells, the {{disappearance}} of nuclear protein histone H 3 and the simultaneous appearance of a new chromatin-associated protein termed Pi can be observed (P. R. Grigera and S. G. Tisminetzky, Virology 136 : 10 - 19, 1984). We sequenced the amino terminus of protein Pi and showed that Pi derives from histone H 3 by proteolytic cleavage. The 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of histone H 3 are specifically cleaved off early during infection. Truncated histone H 3 remains chromatin associated. In addition, we showed that the histone H 3 -Pi transition is catalyzed by the FMDV 3 C protease. The only known function of the viral 3 C protease was, until now, the processing of the viral polyprotein. The viral 3 C protease is the only FMDV protein required to induce the histone H 3 -Pi transition, {{as well as being}} the only viral protein capable of cleaving histone H 3. No viral precursor fusion protein is needed for this specific cleavage as was reported for the processing of the poliovirus P 1 precursor polyprotein by 3 C/D protease. As the <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of the histone H 3 corresponds to the presumed regulatory domain involved in the regulation of transcriptionally active chromatin in eucaryotes, it seems possible that this specific cleavage of histone H 3 is related to the host cell transcription shutoff reported for several picornaviruses...|$|E

This leads to a deficiency in vesicle transport and storage, which affects neurotransmitter vesicle turnover and release in the central nervous system. Since the genomic sequence of the Ap 3 d 1 gene of mocha mouse is not known, precise mapping of the deletion as well as reliable genotyping protocols are lacking. Findings We sequenced the Ap 3 d 1 gene (HGNC GeneID: 8943) around the deletion site in the mocha mouse and revealed a 10639 bp deletion covering exon 2 to 6. Subsequently, new PCR primers were designed yielding a reliable genotyping protocol of both newborn and adult tissue. To examine the genotypes further, hippocampal neurons were cultured from mocha and control mice. Patch-clamp recordings showed that mocha neurons had a higher input resistance, and that autaptic EPSC in mocha cultures depressed faster and stronger as compared with control cultures. Conclusion Our study reports the sequence of the <b>deleted</b> <b>part</b> of the Ap 3 d 1 gene in mocha mice, {{as well as a}} reliable PCR-based genotyping protocol. We cultured hippocampal neurons from control and mocha mice, and found a difference in input resistance of the neurons, and in the synaptic short-term plasticity of glutamatergic autapses showing a larger synaptic depression than controls. The described procedures may be useful for the future utilization of the mocha mouse as a model of defective vesicle biogenesis. Importantly, as genotyping by eye color is complicated in newborn mice, the designed protocol is so fast and reliable that newborn mice could rapidly be genotyped and hippocampal neurons dissociated and cultured, which is normally best done at P 0 -P 2. </p...|$|E
