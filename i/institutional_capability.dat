40|$|This paper re-examines the {{theoretical}} aid-growth nexus by expounding {{on the issues}} relating to policies designed for aid delivery {{and the lack of}} aid recipient's state <b>institutional</b> <b>capability</b> to enforce policy conditionality. Two propositions have been demonstrated to explain why policy conditionality attached to aid might not always promote sustainable economic growth in Least Developed Countries. First, the model has simulated that a stable aid flow contributes to economic growth even when aid is fungible. Second, the model has also simulated that unstable aid inflow impairs the favourable effect of stable aid inflow. It is suggested that the contribution of aid to economic growth depends not only on the ability of aid to increase investment in the recipient country but also the quality of policy conditionality and the state and <b>institutional</b> <b>capability</b> of the recipient country to implement policy conditionality.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that institutional capabilities {{have a positive effect}} on economic development. Methodologically, we used descriptive and multivariate statistics, spatial analysis and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression to estimate their effect. Spatial correlation was tested between the countries by their respective capabilities indexes. The results show in an aggregated level that institutional capabilities do {{have a positive effect on}} economic development. However, when we disaggregated by geographic region, we realized that this relation is significant only in four of them: (1) East Asia and Pacific, (2) Europe and Central Asia, (3) Latin America and Caribbean and (4) Middle East and North Africa. For OECD countries, the <b>institutional</b> <b>capability</b> effect is larger for members than for non-members. Taking political regime in consideration, our index performs better in democracies. In the end, global spatial autocorrelation indicates a weak, positive and statistically significate association comparing with <b>institutional</b> <b>capability.</b> (I = 0, 192; p-value< 0. 05) ...|$|E

Even though it has been long realized that air pollution constitutes one of the major sources of loss on GNP of many countries in the region weak <b>institutional</b> <b>capabilities</b> for air pollution management and control still exist in the region. Major types of pollution sources in the region such as dust storms and sandstorms, greenhouse gas emissions and other gases from various industries are outlined.

The ‘disconnected capitalism’ thesis constructs an argument that structural tendencies within capital markets disrupt established patterns of relations between employers and labour. This article develops this argument by conceptualizing how the ‘private-equity business model’ (PEBM) further diffuses these connections and trends. This diffusion is so extensive that the interests of owners are now paramount in all types of business system to the relative exclusion of other stakeholders. The article defines and explains the term ‘PEBM’ and identifies the theoretical importance of management in managerial capitalism.
