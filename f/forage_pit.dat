Bandicoots, bilbies, bettongs and potoroos are the primary digging mammals in Australia, {{although the majority of}} these species have declined throughout their range. Our study examined the foraging activity of the southern brown bandicoot, a persisting digging Australian mammal. The amount of soil displaced and physical structure of <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> were examined from moulds of fresh <b>foraging</b> <b>pits.</b> We recorded soil water repellency and soil moisture levels along the <b>foraging</b> <b>pit</b> profile and adjacent undug soil. We also examined seedling germination in artificially dug and undug sites. Results/conclusions: An individual southern brown bandicoot created 45 new <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> per night, and could displace approximately 3. 4 tonnes of soil each year. Soil water repellency was highest on undug earth, and varied throughout the profile of a <b>foraging</b> <b>pit.</b> Soil moisture was greatest along the slope of the <b>foraging</b> <b>pit.</b> Seedling germination of native species was highest in artificially dug sites compared to undug controls. Southern brown bandicoots can displace substantial amounts of soil and their <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> create a microhabitat that facilitates higher germination of native plant species. The digging activities of this species are likely to contribute towards ecosystem processes, and the persistence of bandicoots may {{play an important role in}} maintaining the health and function of our woodlands and forests...|$|R

Bandicoots, bilbies, bettongs and potoroos are the primary digging marsupials in Australia, although most of these species have declined throughout their range. This study used a snapshot approach to estimate the soil turnover capacity of the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus, Shaw 1797), a persisting digging Australian marsupial, at Yalgorup National Park, Western Australia. The number of southern brown bandicoots was estimated using mark-recapture techniques. To provide an index of digging activity per animal, we quantified {{the number of new}} <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> and bandicoot nose pokes across 18 plots within the same area. The amount of soil displaced and physical structure of <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> were examined from moulds of 47 fresh <b>foraging</b> <b>pits.</b> We estimated that an individual southern brown bandicoot could create ∼ 45 <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> per day, displacing ∼ 10. 74 kg of soil, which extrapolates to ∼ 3. 9 tonnes of soil each year. The digging activities of the southern brown bandicoots are likely to be a critical component of soil ecosystem processe...|$|R
40|$|Habitat modifying {{species can}} play crucial roles in {{ecosystem}} function. Invasive engineers may assume these roles where native engineers {{have been lost}} from the system. We compared {{the dynamics of the}} <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> of an invasive engineer, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) with two native mammals, the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) and the burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur). <b>Foraging</b> <b>pits</b> are small surface depressions created by animals when they forage for seeds, bulbs, roots, invertebrates and fungi. We measured <b>foraging</b> <b>pit</b> density and turnover, and density and richness of plant seedlings in pits and adjacent surfaces across three landforms representing a gradient in resource availability inside (bilbies and bettongs), and outside (rabbits only) a reserve in an arid Australian shrubland over 2 years. Pits of the native engineers contained 80 % more seedlings (11. 2 plants m− 2) than rabbit pits (6. 22 plants m− 2). Further, rabbit pits supported 3. 6 -times fewer seedlings than equivalent non-pit surfaces outside the exclosure. Only one plant species was restricted entirely to pits. The reserve had more <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> and greater turnover than outside, but contrary to prediction, pit effects on seedling density were no greater in the more resource-limited dunes. There were some strong temporal and landscape effects on pit density and species composition, but generally trends were similar inside and outside the reserve. Overall, despite their functional similarities, invasive rabbits created fewer pits that were less favourable patches for seedlings than those of native engineers. Our work suggests that a suite of ecosystem processes associated with fertile patch creation has potentially been lost with the extirpation of bilbies and bettongs. Alex I. James, David J.

40|$|One {{of the few}} {{commonly}} occuring {{species of}} digging marsupial in south-western Australia is the subspecies of southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus fusciventor). Unlike {{a large proportion of}} Australian digging marsupials that have suffered attrition, bandicoots have persisted and shown resilience to human-mediated disturbance in peri-urban regions. This thesis evaluates some of the ecological roles of bandicoots in ecosystem processes in degraded Eucalyptus gomphocephala woodland in Yalgorup National Park. Bandicoots forage for the fruiting bodies of mycorrhizal fungi and other subterranean food and in doing so make small pits in the soil surface. Surveys of these <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> over a six month period revealed they are sites of lower soil hydrophobicity and higher soil moisture compared to the surrounding undisturbed soil. Additionally, the <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> and the area immediately surrounding them collect more leaf litter than the surrounding areas. The impact of <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> on ant-seed removal rates was explored by creating artificial diggings. Three local seed species Acacia saligna, Eucalyptus gomphocephala, and Kennedia prostrata were used in a cafeteria style experiment. Results found artificially created diggings had no effect on seed removal rates and that E. gomphocephala had the highest seed removal rate. This study suggests that bandicoots provide an important source of soil surface heterogeneity, contributing to ecosystem processes. Their presence in the landscape has the potential to contribute to the restoration of degraded ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} area {{of interest}} in geomorphology {{over the past two}} decades has been the effects of biota on ecosystemprocesses. We examinedthe roles of a rangeof vertebrates onsoildisturbance in twomarkedlydifferent environments, the semi-arid woodland of eastern Australia and a Chihuahuan Desert grassland–shrubland in the south-westernUnited States. <b>Foraging</b> <b>pits</b> of soil-disturbingvertebrates variedmarkedly fromsmall scratchings of heteromyid (mainly Dipodomys spp.) rodents (1. 8 × 10 − 4 m 3) to deep (1. 0 × 10 − 2 m 3) excavations of the burrowing bettong (Bettongia leuseur) and greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis). Vertebratesmoved substantial volumes of soil in both environments, and activity was highly temporally and spatially variable. At large spatial scales, soil disturbance by echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and Gould 2 ̆ 7 s sand goannas (Varanus gouldii) was substantially greater in communities dominated by shrubs, and where domestic livestock had been excluded. Heteromyid rodents tended to excavate more <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> in coarse-textured vegetation communities (both grasslands and shrublands). In both environments, foragingwas concentrated close to perennial plants such as grass tussocks and tree canopies rather than in the interspaces. <b>Foraging</b> <b>pits</b> of Chihuahuan desert animals tended to be higher in labile carbon and support greater levels of infiltration, though this was plant community-dependent. Overall our results indicate that animal foraging is an important geomorphic mechanism capable of mobilizing substantial volumes of soil in arid and semi-arid environments and with potential effects on soil function...|$|R
40|$|Animals that forage {{for food}} or dig burrows by biopedturbation {{can alter the}} biotic and abiotic {{characteristics}} of their habitat. The digging activities of such ecosystem engineers, although small at a local scale, may be important for broader scale landscape processes by influencing soil and litter properties, trapping organic matter and seeds, and subsequently altering seedling recruitment. We examined environmental characteristics (soil moisture content, hydrophobicity and litter composition) of <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> created by the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus; Peramelidae), a digging Australian marsupial, over a 6 -month period. Fresh diggings typically contained a higher moisture content and lower hydrophobicity than undisturbed soil. A month later, <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> contained greater amounts of fine litter and lower amounts of coarse litter than adjacent undug surfaces, indicating that <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> may provide a conducive microhabitat for litter decomposition, potentially reducing litter loads and enhancing nutrient decomposition. We tested whether diggings might affect seedling recruitment (seed removal by seed harvesters and seed germination rates) by artificially mimicking diggings. Although {{there were no differences}} in the removal of seeds, seedling recruitment for three native plant species (Acacia saligna, Kennedia prostrata and Eucalyptus gomphocephala) was higher in plots containing artificial diggings compared with undug sites. The digging actions of bandicoots influenced soil moisture and hydrophobicity, the size distribution of litter and seedling recruitment at a local scale. The majority of Australian digging mammals are threatened, with many suffering substantial population and range contraction. However, their persistence in landscapes {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the health and function of ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Leaf litter is an {{important}} resource and a fundamental component of all terrestrial ecosystems. The senescence and decay of leaves, bark and other organic material provides a mechanism for carbon, nitrogen and other critical elements to be transported and incorporated into the soil. This process is particularly important in arid and semi-arid ecosystems where resources are limited and unevenly distributed spatially and temporally. There are many drivers that modulate surface litter accumulation, litter fall rates and litter decay rates. This thesis examines how these aspects of litter dynamics are moderated by abiotic (e. g. soil, landform, fire, rainfall) and biotic (e. g. vegetation communities, individual species) factors in semi-arid woodlands and shrublands in eastern Australia. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the importance of litter in semi-arid woodlands, describing previous research on leaf litter dynamics in arid and semi&# 150;arid ecosystems. Chapter 2 examines litter fall rates in response to abiotic conditions, with a focus on the fall rates of reproductive structures (seeds, flowers and fruits) from three species that differ in their life histories. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the accumulation and spatial arrangement of surface litter. Chapter 3 describes the shift in litter bed size and composition under two Eucalypt Mallee species (Eucalyptus socialis, E. dumosa) along a 42 year chronosequence of fire histories. Chapter 4 examines properties of spatial self-organisation exhibited by litter patches, assessing litter patch cover, size and degree of spatial association between surface litter and perennial vegetation across four different landscapes. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on aspects and implications of litter decomposition in the <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> of mammals. Chapter 5 examines the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors during the decomposition process of substrates in the <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> of short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) and burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur). Chapter 6 examines the conditions under which litter decomposition in echidna <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> facilitates seedling growth by assessing water stress and the proximity of <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> to large trees. Chapter 7 is a summation of the previous chapters, highlighting the implications and limitations of these novel studies, and providing direction for future work in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{protracted}} {{recovery of}} some bird and mammal populations in western Prince William Sound (WPWS), Alaska, and {{the persistence of}} spilled ‘Exxon Valdez’ oil in intertidal sediments, suggests a pathway of exposure to consumers that occupy nearshore habitats. To evaluate the hypothesis that sea otter (Enhydra lutris) foraging allows access to lingering oil, we contrast spatial relations between foraging behavior and documented oil distribution. We recovered archival time-depth recorders implanted in 19 sea otters in WPWS, where lingering oil and de - layed ecosystem recovery are well documented. Sea otter foraging dives ranged from + 2. 7 to − 92 m below sea level (MLLW), with intertidal accounting for 5 to 38 % of all foraging. On average, female sea otters made 16 050 intertidal dives per year and 18 % of these dives were at depths above the + 0. 80 m tidal elevation. Males made 4100 intertidal dives per year and 26 % of intertidal foraging took place at depths above the + 0. 80 m tidal elevation. Estimated annual oil encounter rates ranged from 2 to 24 times yr− 1 for females, and 2 to 4 times yr− 1 for males. Exposure rates increased in spring when intertidal foraging doubled and females were with small pups. In summer 2008, we found sea otter <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> on 13. 5 of 24. 8 km of intertidal shoreline surveyed. Most pits (82 %) were within 0. 5 m of the zero tidal elevation and 15 % were above 0. 5 m, the level above which most (65 %) lingering oil remains. In August 2008, we detected oil above background concentrations in 18 of 41 (44 %) pits excavated by sea otters on beaches with prior evidence of oiling, with total PAH concentrations up to 56 000 ng g− 1 dry weight. Our estimates of intertidal foraging, the widespread presence of <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> in the intertidal, {{and the presence of}} oil in and near sea otter <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> documents a pathway of exposure from lingering intertidal oil to sea otters foraging in WPWS...|$|R
40|$|Mammals {{that move}} or {{manipulate}} soil for food or to create shelter can completely change the biotic and abiotic characteristics of their habitat, potentially creating multiple {{benefits to the}} overall health of the ecosystem. The main digging mammals within Australia, bandicoots and bettongs, create small, conical-shaped holes while foraging for underground fungi, earthworms and tubers. The majority of Australian digging mammals have undergone drastic range and populati on contractions within the last 100 years. Where ecosystems have lost digging mammals, key processes may be reduced and this may contribute to declines in ecosystem health.

40|$|In arid landscapes limited {{resources}} are concentrated into fertile patches that allow greater productivity than {{would otherwise be}} expected. Fertile patches are created and maintained by processes that modify soil topography and interrupt the flow of resources across the landscape. These processes may be abiotic or biotic in origin. Species that modify, maintain or create habitat have been termed ecosystem engineers. One group of soil disturbing ecosystem engineers creates fertile patches by modifying soil microtopography through foraging for food and creating habitat. This thesis examines the effects of soil foraging animals on resource concentration in arid environments and how effects are moderated by species and landscape. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the importance of fertile patches in arid systems and describes previous research on the effects of ecosystem engineers in arid environments. Chapter 2 examines how fertile patch creation by a well-studied arid zone engineer, the ant, varies between ant species and landforms, demonstrating that while we can generalise about the effects of ant nests on water flow and nutrient levels, differences in soil type, nest density and ant species across sites are likely to moderate these effects. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 compare the engineering effects of reintroduced native species, the Greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) and Burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur) with the Sand goanna (Varanus gouldii) and the invasive European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) across three Australian landforms, revealing differences between reintroduced and invasive engineers at the both patch and landscape scales. At the landscape scale, differences in pit densities and resource concentration in <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> between landforms suggest that fertile patch development is not uniform. Chapter 6 examines whether the structure of the pit or the presence of litter per se explains observed increases in plant germination in <b>foraging</b> <b>pits,</b> and compares temperature and soil moisture conditions in bilby and bettong pits to the soil surface. Chapter 7 is a review that builds upon previous chapters, published and unpublished literature of the potential for reintroductions of ecosystem engineers to restore ecosystem function in degraded environments. Chapter 8 summarises the research presented in this thesis and its implications, and suggests directions for future work...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{impact of}} {{flamingo}} predation on the benthic {{community has been}} well researched {{through the use of}} caging and exclusion experiments. However, there is still very little known about flamingo spatial foraging preferences and the environmental cues that determine them. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the foraging distributions of non-breeding Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) within one of their southern African overwintering grounds, the Heuningnes Estuary. This was achieved by comparing spatial level differences in the abundance and size of flamingo <b>foraging</b> <b>pits</b> across sites and shore positions, and by examining the effects of soil moisture content and sediment profile as environmental cues driving flamingo <b>foraging</b> behaviour. <b>Pit</b> abundance was obtained as a total count per quadrat, and pit size was measured from photographs taken in the field. Sediment cores provided soil moisture content measurements, while sediment profile was measured as the angle of elevation from each shore position to the high water mark. It was found that flamingos fed homogeneously across all four sites, but restricted their foraging to the high shore and upper mid shore regions of the intertidal. Soil moisture content was not a significant driver of flamingo foraging behaviour, but sediment profile was significant. It was proposed that flamingo foraging preference for the high shore and upper mid shore regions was because: (1) the sediment profiles were flatter, (2) the macrofaunal prey densities were greater and (3) these shore positions coincided with the required depth for stamp-feeding, which was linked to the high tide and the time of day at which foraging occurred. This study provides novel information regarding the environmental drivers of Greater Flamingo foraging behaviour and the spatial use of the intertidal sandflats of the Heuningnes Estuary. Furthermore, this knowledge could be useful for the management of flamingo foraging grounds of the De Mond Nature Reserve...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Biological {{disturbances}} on marine {{soft sediment}} ecosystems {{have been well}} researched. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the potential ecological role that iconic shore bird predators may have on marine ecosystems. This paper tests the effects of spatial gradients on Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) predation impacts on the benthic macrofaunal community structure in an intertidal sandflat ecosystem in South Africa. P. ruber is a benthic filter-feeder known to feed on benthic dwelling invertebrates through pit formation, where deep sediments are stirred up by trampling their feet. Macrofaunal community structure between flamingo <b>pit</b> <b>foraging</b> structures and adjacent non-foraged sediments (controls) yielded insignificant spatial differences. However, subtle positive and negative effects of flamingo predation on macrofaunal abundance were noted at specific sites. Flamingos in this study were not targeting a specific prey group. Thus of the 19 macrofaunal prey items identified, none were significantly impacted across treatments, except for an unidentified polychaete. However, this was once again site specific. The results suggested this polychaete is generally abundant within the area sampled. Furthermore, its distribution is perhaps affected by the level of intensity employed in pit-foraging, rather than being preyed upon. Greater polychaete abundance in pits relative to controls may be attributed to vigorous flamingo feeding efforts. <b>Pit</b> <b>foraging</b> appears to be an expensive strategy to employ, but the energy investment may be reduced through the use of sophisticated sensory organs to detect accessible prey deep within the sediment. Overall, the study has shown that the impact of flamingo predation on a spatial gradient is small and site specific. However, the study highlights the need for further research on quantifying the ecological role flamingos play as predators on marine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of predation {{have become a}} central focus of marine ecological research. Numerous studies have {{emphasized the importance of}} apex predators in structuring assemblages at various organisational levels and in determining how ecosystems function. However, less appreciated currently is the fact that predators display multiple foraging behaviours, thereby allowing them to overcome problems associated with unpredictability of food resources in space and time. The primary goal of this dissertation is to contribute to growing understanding of the ecological causes and {{consequences of}} foraging plasticity displayed by Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber roseus in intertidal sandflat ecosystems in Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa. P. roseus feeds by either (1) creating pits, which involves flamingos stirring up deep sediments with their feet or (2) creating channels, in which their inverted bills are swept from side-to-side on the sediment surface. The first objective {{of the study was to}} quantify the ecological drivers of decisions made by flamingos to feed, and to implement either pit- or channel-foraging strategies. The latter was achieved through RandomForest modelling techniques that identified the prominent ecological drivers from a suite of biotic and abiotic variables. Results indicate that biotic variables, i. e. those associated with flamingo prey assemblages, were key in driving choices made by flamingos to forage and to implement either pit- or channel-foraging strategies. The second aim of this dissertation was to quantify the repercussions of the two different foraging behaviours on benthic assemblages. Comparisons of benthic assemblages in flamingo <b>foraging</b> structures (<b>pits</b> and channels) with adjacent non-foraged sediments (controls) indicated differential effects of both flamingo foraging methods on benthic communities, with channel-foraging eliciting a greater negative impact compared to pit-foraging, for which impacts were negligible. Abundance of macrofauna and surface-dwelling taxa such as micro-algae and the amphipod Urothoe grimaldii were all negatively impacted by channel-foraging. Sizes of channels constructed by flamingos were inversely related to their impacts, with impacts on macrofaunal abundance being greater in smaller channels. Overall, this study has shed light on the differential effects of foraging plasticity on prey assemblages and its importance in enhancing spatio-temporal heterogeneity in intertidal sandflats. The study also emphasizes the need to incorporate foraging plasticity into current thinking and conceptual models of predation in marine soft sediments, in order to appreciate the full spectrum of predation effects on assemblages...|$|R
