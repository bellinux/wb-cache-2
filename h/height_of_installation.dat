40|$|Background The {{mismatch}} between equipments and anthropometric dimensions of users {{is one of}} the issues that can be effective on development of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Objectives This study was conducted to determine the proper layout of whiteboard in classrooms of schools of health, and nutrition and food sciences at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS). Patients and Methods In this cross-sectional study, 140 students in schools of health, and nutrition and food sciences at SUMS were investigated. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisted of demographic and anthropometric characteristics, the numerical rating scale and body map. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software version 16 using descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U test. Results Mean severity of discomfort in neck (2. 38 ± 0. 6) was higher than the other regions of body among the students. The results of this study revealed that the mean severity of discomfort in neck in female students (2. 43 ± 1. 01) was higher than in male ones (1. 27 ± 1. 04). Also, the results showed that the mean severity of discomfort in neck among students who were in the classrooms with window opposite of whiteboard was higher than the students in classrooms with beside window. Proper lower and upper heights of installation of whiteboard from the floor were calculated 105 and 195. 2 cm, respectively. Conclusions The layout of whiteboard in classrooms can be effective in causing student’s neck pain. In this study, the suitable <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> of whiteboard was determined and it is recommended to be used in classrooms...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : The {{effects of}} {{aircraft}} engine emissions within the {{planetary boundary layer}} under the landing/ take-off operations contribute sufficiently to deterioration of air pollution {{in the vicinity of}} the airports and nearby residential areas. Currently the primary object of airport air quality are the nitrogen oxides and particle matter (PM 10, PM 2. 5 and ultrafine PM) emissions from aircraft engine exhausts as initiators of photochemical smog and regional haze, which may further impact on human health. Analysis of PM emission inventory results at major European airports highlighted on sufficiently high contribution of aircraft engines and APU. The paper aims to summarize the knowledge on particle size distributions, particle effective density, morphology and internal structure of aircraft PM, these properties are critical for understanding of the fate and potential health impact of PM. It also aims to describe the basic methods for calculation of emission and dispersion of PM, produced by aircrafts under the LTO operations. Methods : analytical solution of the atmospheric diffusion equation is used to calculate the maximum PM concentration from point emission source. The PM concentration varies inversely proportional to the wind velocity u 1 and directly proportional to the vertical component of the turbulent exchange coefficient k 1 /u 1. The evaluation of non-volatile PM concentration includes the size and shape of PM. PolEmiCa calculates the distributions of PM fractions for aircraft and APU exhausts (<b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> was given H= 4, 5 m like for Tupolev- 154). Results: The maximum concentration of PM in exhaust from APU is higher and appropriate distance is less than in case for gas. PM polydispersity leads to the separation of maximums concentration in space for individual fractions on the wind direction and therefore it contributes to the reduction of maximum total concentration. Discussion : But although the APU has contributed significantly to the emission of aircraft at airports, APU emissions are not certificated by ICAO or any other responsible for that authority. It is quite actual task for local air quality to development model and find measurement techniques to identify aircraft engine and APU contribution to total airport PM pollution. </p...|$|E

Thus, the objective of this work was to develop a low-cost trap for collecting C. hominivorax in the field. Three experiments were conducted, with six replications, in the experimental field of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa - Agropecuária Oeste), in Ponta Porã, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Traps were developed using two-liter polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles cut in half, with 30 grams of bovine liver and water covering 90 % of the liver mass placed in the bottom half, using the upper half as a cover funnel to keep the captured flies in the bottom half. The experiments consisted of evaluations of different opening diameter of the trap entrance (3, 4, 6 and 7 mm) with traps installed at 1. 16 m from the ground (Experiment 1), <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> the traps (0. 00, 0. 40, 0. 80, 1. 20, 1. 60 and 2. 00 m from the ground) (Experiment 2) and bottle colors (yellow, blue, white, green, red and transparent) (Experiment 3).

50|$|In 1943, Lorenz was {{instructed}} to adapt Hohentwiel for naval use, and soon the Hohentwiel appeared on U-boats, small surface ships, and coastal installations.There are two U-boat versions of the FuG 200 Hohentwiel used during World War II; FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U and the FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1. The U-boat versions were easier to maintain and more reliable compared with the other versions. However, the U-boat versions had several disadvantages, the smaller dimension of the antenna and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the antenna <b>installation.</b> The antenna was restricted to a smaller dimension as it had to fit within a small area {{on the port side}} of the conning tower. In addition, the reduced <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the antenna <b>installation</b> impaired the range. Both U-boat versions had ranges of between 8 and 10 km for naval targets and between 15 and 25 km at an altitude of 200 m. Resolution was about 3 degrees, and at short range its range accuracy was 100 m. Both U-boat versions worked at a frequency 556 MHz and had four rows of six dipoles. Before the U-boat could dive, the antenna needed to be retracted into a well on the conning tower. Both U-boat antenna versions were 1400 mm wide by 1000 mm in height, and total overall dimensions of the antenna frame was 1540 by 1022 mm.|$|R

To replace chemical control methods, as well as the timing of the peak population of Mediterranean fruit fly, the yellow sticky vertical traps were used in this study. The research was carried out in some citrus orchards of various cities of Mazandaran province of Iran, during the four months from August to November 2016. To determine the best type of yellow color to trap this fly, four types of yellow colors with measured wavelength of reflection, including the fluorescent yellow (538 nm), lemon yellow (574 nm), yellow (602 nm) and amber yellow (641 nm), were used. Also, to determine the best geographical direction and appropriate <b>height</b> for <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> yellow cards, four cardinal directions and five different <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 m above ground level were determined and the cards were installed.

40|$|Indian house sparrow, Passer domesticus indicus is a {{symbiotic}} bird species with human habitation. Its vanishing population created awareness among peoples. Our changing life style {{and loss of}} nesting site proved {{a major cause of}} disappearance of sparrow. Many people try to provide non scientific artificial nest box for these bird in India. So, we experimented with the various design of Standard European sparrow nest box and presented ideal nest box designed which improves the nesting and breeding potential in urban area. Improved dimensions are 15. 24 cm length and 12. 7 cm width. Depth was reduced to 7. 62 cm. We also able to improve the aesthetic look of these boxes which lead to increased acceptance by common people for their fixing around their houses.

However, Taft's wider vision of a Chicago school of sculpture, analogous to other philosophical Chicago schools such as the contemporaneous Chicago school of architecture style, had lost momentum after the 1913 dedication of his Fountain of the Great Lakes. The Beaux Arts style had become dated; instead of funding Taft's large-scale Midway Plaisance beautification plan, and providing the originally planned granite, bronze or Georgia marble materials, the trust only allocated sufficient funds and support for a concrete sculpture.|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{interest}} {{has been shown}} during recent years in ground-effect vehicles. Of the various types proposed, the simple-plenum-chamber vehicle has indicated promise because, although the lift augmentation obtainable appears {{to be less than}} that of an annular jet, it may be somewhat less complicated structurally. The present investigation was undertaken to study the effects of some geometric variations upon lift augmentation of a simple plenum chamber within ground proximity. The variables included the ratio inlet area to exit area, plenum-chamber depth, and entrance configuration. An optimum plenum-chamber depth appeared to be between 3 and 10 percent of the plenum-chamber diameter with a ratio of inlet diameter to plenum-chamber diameter of 0. 15 for the range of plenum-chamber depths investigated. The most important effect of multiple inlets was the elimination of negative lift augmentation, which was experienced with single sharp-edged inlets, at intermediate <b>heights.</b> <b>Installation</b> <b>of</b> a flared inlet and a turning-vane assembly improved lift augmentation of a single-inlet configuration at intermediate heights...|$|R

40|$|Air-based, {{open loop}} Building Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (BIPV/T) systems {{have proven to}} be an {{efficient}} means for generating renewable energy. They produce electrical energy, converting part of the incident solar radiation, and recover part of that radiation that turns to heat, while acting as the outer shell of the building. However, for the typical BIPV/T design with air entering at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>installation,</b> flowing within a continuous air channel and exiting at the outlet of the system high PV temperatures may still occur. This {{is due to the fact}} that as air moves inside the air channel it accumulates heat and the heat exchange efficiency between the PV panels and the flowing air drops along the flow path of the air channel. In large building integrated PV installations, high PV temperatures may lead to quicker PV panel degradation, as well as lower electrical efficiency. A multiple-inlet BIPV/T system aims to increased heat extraction from the PV panels, with the introduction of several intakes of fresh air along the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>installation.</b> This may lead to lower and more uniform PV temperatures, enhanced PV panel durability and higher electrical and thermal performance. This study presents the development of a methodology for the modelling and design of multiple-inlet systems, as well as a numerical study of such a system. The modelling component consists of two aspects, namely, the fluid mechanics and the energy balance of the system. A flow model was developed, based on flow networking techniques, in order to assess the inlet flow distributions. The flow model incorporates wind effects in the form of exterior pressures, acquired through wind tunnel testing. The inlet flow distributions were used in a modified energy balance model that accounts for the flow conditions of the inlets and the air channels of the system. This was an improvement on the assumption of uniform flow from all the openings of the system, which has been common in the limited number of studies of multiple-inlet systems so far. The developed models were applied for the numerical investigation of variations of multiple-inlet BIPV/T systems for a potential retrofit project on an office building in Montreal. The investigation was carried out assuming summer and winter conditions, as well as several cases of wind direction and velocity. A multiple-inlet system with optimized geometric features of the inlets was found have up to 1...|$|R
