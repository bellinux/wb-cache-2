25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll <b>and</b> <b>office</b> <b>expenses,</b> <b>and</b> also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|R
25|$|Due to the region's {{relatively}} sparse population, {{federal and}} provincial electoral {{districts in the}} region are almost all extremely large geographically. The federal electoral district of Sudbury and the provincial electoral districts of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie are the only ones that are comparable in size to an electoral district in Southern Ontario, while at the other extreme the districts of Kenora and Timmins—James Bay are both geographically larger than the entire United Kingdom. One consequence of this, for example, is that a politician who represents a Northern Ontario riding in the Canadian House of Commons or the Legislative Assembly of Ontario must typically maintain a much higher budget for travel <b>and</b> <b>office</b> <b>expenses</b> than one who represents a small urban district does.|$|R

The grant in aid can be used for meeting operating cost of local governments such as rent on building, electricity, vehicle running charges, telephone charges etc. of the transferred sectoral institutions. The amount earmarked for this purpose in 2004-05 in the budget was Rs.205.32 crores.This grant in aid would subsume basic tax grant, surcharge on stamp duty, VTC, rural pool grant, the specific purpose and general-purpose grant and all non-plan grant in aids.

50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} for two officers {{to preside over}} the Senate. Article One, Section 3, Clause 4 designates the Vice President of the United States as the President of the Senate. In this capacity, {{the vice president was}} expected to preside at regular sessions of the Senate, casting votes only to break ties. From John Adams in 1789 to Richard Nixon in the 1950s, presiding over the Senate was the chief function of vice presidents, who had an office in the Capitol, received their staff support <b>and</b> <b>office</b> <b>expenses</b> through the legislative appropriations, and rarely were invited to participate in cabinet meetings or other executive activities. In 1961, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson changed the vice presidency by moving his chief office from the Capitol to the White House, by directing his attention to executive functions, and by attending Senate sessions only at critical times when his vote, or ruling from the chair, might be necessary. Vice presidents since Johnson's time have followed his example.|$|R

40|$|MBA Professional ReportThis study {{analyzes}} the current Navy Food Management Team (NFMT) alignment {{under the leadership}} of COMFISCS and the inability for NAVSUP Food Service (SUP 05) to directly coordinate with teams in the seven different assigned regions. This separation has raised difficulties for SUP 05 to gauge the effectiveness of training, budgeting, team make-up, fleet trends, policy implementation and instruction reviews and re-writes. The lack of continuity and consistency across Navy food service operations is driving the research behind this project, with the ultimate goal being recommendations that lead to the organizational structure that improves customer service fleet wide. The data set contains current Navy Food Management Team manning levels, annual budgets, Supply Management Certification scores for the last three years, training assist visit percentages and ship visit periodicities in each geographical area of responsibility.

5000|$|Like other elected officials, {{supervisors}} enjoy built-in {{advantages of}} incumbency. Supervisors routinely waive parking and rental fees for various organizations, provide bus trips and give free tickets to county facilities to constituents, and build {{projects for the}} community with the supervisor's name clearly marked. Each supervisor has a budget of $3,400,000 for staff <b>and</b> <b>office</b> <b>expenses,</b> with the remainder going into a [...] "discretionary fund" [...] {{that can be used}} for grants to non-profit agencies, without a vote by the other supervisors. [...] "Good-government" [...] advocates have long supported the idea of expanding Board membership to reduce the size of each district, and establishing an elected County Executive as a check and balance on the Board's power, but voters have rejected such proposals every time they have appeared on the ballot. However, former supervisor Gloria Molina supported expansion of the Board (to potentially increase Hispanic representation), and former supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky supported both Board expansion and the creation of an elected County Executive, much like in King County, Washington, where that officeholder directly supervises county departments.|$|R

Donor countries, prioritizing their national reputation over helping Afghanistan overcome its development and growth challenges, have built ‘quick impact projects’ like cheap roads and buildings in the recipient country.
