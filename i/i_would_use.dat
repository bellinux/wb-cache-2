Nibbelink said his daughter's voice-over was completely unscripted. [...] "I would [...] take these silly improvs that my little daughter would do. I mean, lines like, she would say, ‘Babies – p-ew!

500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here. As this is {{absolute}} oppression, if I were a bookseller in this town, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> all the safe means to reprint London books, and run them to any town in England, that I could, because whoever offends not the laws of God, or the country he lives in, commits no sin.... But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

2500|$|Hawke {{declared}} {{publicly that}} [...] "socialist {{is not a}} word <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> to describe myself", and his approach to government was pragmatic. He concerned himself with making improvements to workers' lives from within the traditional institutions of government, rather than by using any ideological theory. He opposed the Vietnam War, but was {{a strong supporter of}} the US-Australian alliance, and also an emotional supporter of Israel. It was his commitment to the cause of Jewish Refuseniks which purportedly led to a planned assassination attempt on Hawke by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and its Australian operative Munif Mohammed Abou Rish.|$|E

Political views were divided: the leftists supporting him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists), opposing him. At this time Mattei is alleged to have widely used unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. He used to say of political parties: [...] "I use them like <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> a taxi: I sit in, I pay for the trip, I get out". Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.|$|E
2500|$|On August 14, United States Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) {{stated that}} [...] "militarization {{of the police}} {{escalated}} the protesters' response." [...] St. Louis Chief of Police Sam Dotson stated {{he would not have}} employed military-style policing such as that which transpired. According to Chief Dotson, [...] "My gut told me what I was seeing were not tactics that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> in the city and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself." [...] Another reason Dotson did not want the city and county police to collaborate was because of the history of racial profiling by police in that county. In an email to a St. Louis Alderman who brought up concerns of racial profiling, he wrote: [...] "I agree and removed our tactical assistance. We did not send tactical resources to Ferguson on Tuesday or Wednesday. Our only assistance was that of four traffic officers to help divert traffic and keep both pedestrians and motorists safe. On Thursday we will have no officers assisting Ferguson." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{most famous}} Crow leaders to {{encounter}} the Little People was the legendary Crow chief Plenty Coups (Aleek-chea-ahoosh). When he {{was nine years}} old, Plenty Coup's older brother (who was a great warrior and quite handsome, and whom Plenty Coups loved deeply) was killed by raiding Lakotas. Although the tribe was preparing to move out, Plenty Coups fasted for four days, used the sweat lodge, rubbed his body with sage and cedar to remove any smell, and then went into the nearby hills where he had a vision. In his vision, {{the chief of the}} Little People took him into a spirit-world lodge, where Plenty Coups saw representations of nature (the wind, the stars, thunder, the Moon, bad storms, etc.). The dwarf chief demanded that Plenty Coups count coup, but since Plenty Coups was just nine years of age he knew that he had no great deeds to count. Nonetheless, the chief of the Little People recounted two great deeds to the spirits gathered in the lodge, and said that Plenty Coups would not only accomplish these deeds but many others as well. He also prophesied that Plenty Coups would become chief of his people, if he used his wits, and then advised Plenty Coups to develop his willpower so that he could lead his people. [...] "I had a will and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>use</b> it, make it work for me, as the Dwarf-chief had advised. I became very happy, lying there looking up into the sky. My heart began to sing like a bird, and I went back to the village, needing no man to tell me the meaning of my dream. I took a sweat-bath and rested in my father's lodge. I knew myself now." ...|$|E
