5|$|The nesting Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} {{was placed}} on top of what was probably a ring of eggs, with its arms <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> them. None of the eggs are complete, but they are estimated to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The specimen {{was found in a}} stratigraphic area that indicates Nemegtomaia preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft, sandy substrate and food. Nemegtomaia may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers. The skeleton of the nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was scavenged by skin beetles. The diet of oviraptorids is uncertain, but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been herbivorous. Nemegtomaia is known from the Nemegt and Baruungoyot Formations, which are thought to represent humid and arid environments that coexisted in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Geake {{noted that}} the bodies are {{generally}} supine, being either extended or slightly flexed, while the arms are typically {{at the sides of}} the body or <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> it. There is nevertheless variation in the use of structures within and around the graves, which include beds or chambers inside the grave, as well as mounds, postholes or boat parts outside of it.|$|E

500|$|The {{standing}} {{image is}} the focus of much discussion among historians and archaeologists, since there is a general belief {{that it is not a}} statue of the Buddha. The image is [...] tall, and stands on a low pedestal shaped like a lotus. It leans back in a relaxed manner, its arms <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> its chest. [...] The statue's face carries a sorrowful expression and the reclining image—which depicts the Buddha's parinirvana—lies next to it, which has led some to believe that it is the monk Ānanda, who is lamenting the Buddha's demise at his deathbed. [...] The remains of the walls, however, indicate that the two images were once in separate chambers, rather than next to each other. Paranavithana believes that the statue is of the Buddha, which depicts the para dukkha dukkhitha mudra or [...] "sorrow for the sorrow of others". However, this is a rarely used gesture in Sinhalese sculpture, and is seen at only a few locations in the country. Another possibility is that the image shows the Buddha during his second week after enlightenment, which he spent gazing at the Bodhi Tree in gratitude for providing him shelter. The image is not mentioned in the Chulavamsa, which only mentions the other three. While this may be an indication that it is not an image of the Buddha, it is also possible that it may have been made at an earlier period than the others.|$|E
500|$|The Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{was found}} {{associated with a}} nest with eggs; its feet {{were placed in the}} centre of what was probably a ring of eggs, with the arms <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> the tops of the eggs {{on each side of the}} body, a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids. The collected part of the nest is about 90cm (35in) wide and 100cm (30in) long; the skeleton occupies the upper 25cm (10in) of the block, whereas the remaining 20cm (8in) is occupied by broken eggs and shells. There is no evidence of plant material in the nest, but there are fragments of undetermined bones. The nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos, which prevents determination of the size, shape, number, and arrangement of the eggs in the nest. It is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below the body, and there do not appear to have been eggs in the centre of the nest. Most eggs (seven distinct eggs have been identified) and egg fragments were recovered either in the lower layer of the nest or under the skull, neck, and limbs of the specimen, and the bones either rested directly on the eggs or were within 5mm (0.2in) of their surfaces. That the skeleton was directly positioned on top of it shows that the nest was not completely covered by sand. Though the placement of the eggs does not suggest a specific arrangement in the nest, most other oviraptorid nests show that the eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles. The eggs of MPC-D107/15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial, or by external factors, such as strong winds, sandstorms, or predators. This also supports the idea that the upper layer of eggs was not buried, as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors.|$|E

[...] These figures embody souls riding a boat for the dead while seafaring towards their sanctuary in the afterlife. [...] These containers have been dated from 710 BC to 890 BC.

40|$|The pH low-{{insertion}} peptide (pHLIP) {{serves as}} a model system for peptide insertion and <b>folding</b> <b>across</b> a lipid bilayer. It has three general states: (I) soluble in water or (II) bound {{to the surface of}} a lipid bilayer as an unstructured monomer, and (III) inserted across the bilayer as a monomeric α-helix. We used fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to study the interactions of pHLIP with a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid bilayer and to calculate the transition energies between states. We found that the Gibbs free energy of binding to a POPC surface at low pHLIP concentration (state I–state II transition) at 37 °C is approximately − 7 kcal/mol near neutral pH and that the free energy of insertion and <b>folding</b> <b>across</b> a lipid bilayer at low pH (state II–state III transition) is nearly − 2 kcal/mol. We discuss a number of related thermodynamic parameters from our measurements. Besides its fundamental interest as a model system for the study of membrane protein folding, pHLIP has utility as an agent to target diseased tissues and translocate molecules through the membrane into the cytoplasm of cells in environments with elevated levels of extracellular acidity, as in cancer and inflammation. The results give the amount of energy that might be used to move cargo molecules across a membrane...|$|R
