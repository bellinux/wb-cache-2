40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test {{juvenile}} <b>grey</b> <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> (Chiloscyllium griseum) for their ability to perceive and discriminate simple and complex motion patterns. Experiments were carried out as two-alternative forced choice experiments; choosing the designated positive stimulus was rewarded with food. Individuals were first trained to differentiate between two videos of circles moving at different velocities surrounded by squared reference frames. All tasks were successfully mastered within 3 – 30 training sessions. Transfer tests revealed whether the training stimulus was still successfully detected if velocity or direction of movement were changed. In a second task, individuals were presented with more complex motion patterns in form of videos of different organisms such as eel vs. trout, eagle vs. bat and dolphin vs. shark. A series of transfer tests elucidated whether sharks could still recognize these stimuli when shown (a) without a reference frame, (b) from a different perspective (front or sideways), (c) enlarged or downsized or (d) as point displays (PDs). Results were rather surprising, as sharks discriminated easily between circles moving in different directions as well as between differently moving organisms but failed in two out of three experiments to apply the acquired information to new situations as provided by transfer tests. Nonetheless, PD videos of ‘eel’ and ‘trout’ were recognized by all sharks (N = 7), suggesting that the ability to spontaneously recognize an organism based on its biological motion alone is present in elasmobranchs...|$|R

The mitogenome encoded 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs and a noncoding control region, a gene arrangement identical to the most common type found in vertebrates. All tRNA sequences were folded into typical cloverleaf secondary structure with the exception of tRNA-Ser 2, in which the DHU arm stem was replaced with 12 unpaired nucleotides and formed a simple loop. In the control region, the putative termination-associated sequences (TAS) with hairpin-loop structure and the conserved sequence blocks (CSB) I-III were identified and considered {{to be associated with the}} replication and transcription of mtDNA. No repeat motifs were found in the mitogenome of C. griseum. On the basis of the mitogenomic data available in the Class Chondrichthyes from both Genbank and this study, and the phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods, the results strongly support the basal division between batoids and sharks and the monophyly of the Superorder Galeomorphii, and confirm the phylogenetic position of C. griseum in the Subclass Elasmobranchii. This study suggests that the mitogenomic data are more robust for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships than individual genes in the Elasmobranchii...|$|E
40|$|Although {{fish fauna}} in the Arabian/Persian Gulf {{have been studied}} for decades, shark {{diversity}} has only been recently investigated in the region. Here, we present a first comprehensive account of shark diversity from the United Arab Emirates based on fishery-dependent data collected at market and landing sites {{over a two-year period}} of field sampling. Landings across the country were dominated by carcharhinids, and six species were found to be most abundant, including the spot-tail shark, Carcharhinus sorrah, and the milk shark, Rhizoprionodon acutus, contributing 31. 8 % and 29. 9 %, respectively, {{of the total number of}} sharks. While observed landings varied among regions and across seasons, results showed that shark landings were dominated by small-sized species, which may be a reflection of overexploitation. We are now expanding the existing checklist of shark species in the Persian Gulf from 27 to 31, having utilized both morphological identification and genetic barcoding in validating the existence of the <b>grey</b> <b>bamboo</b> <b>shark,</b> Chiloscyllium griseum; the tawny nurse shark,Nebrius ferrugineus; the silky shark, Carcharhinus falciformis; and the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, in these waters. This inventory provides an urgently needed assessment of current regional diversity patterns that can now be used as a baseline for future investigations evaluating the effect of fisheries on shark populations. Results emphasize the need for research on life history traits of the various species in order to determine their regional conservation status, but also reveal that a precautionary approach to conservation will be necessary to mitigate anthropogenic impacts...|$|E

40|$|Dorsal fins have diverse morphologies across shark species. However, {{little is}} known about the ability of sharks to control fin {{movements}} and the nature of the balance of forces during swimming. White-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks,</b> Chiloscyllium plagiosum, and spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, are two unrelated species that inhabit different habitats and have strikingly different dorsal fin morphologies. Previous studies that have used a shark model in a wind tunnel have hypothesized that median fins function in stabilization during steady swimming. ^ The dorsal fin anatomy of benthic white-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> and benthopelagic spiny dogfish reflects their different swimming habits. White-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> live in complex reef habitats and thus have requirements for high maneuverability. Spiny dogfish occupy a variety of coastal and continental shelf habitats and are known to form schools, spending more time in open water environments. Principal component analysis separates these two species in morphospace. <b>Bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> are characterized by a second dorsal with larger area and proportionally more muscle inserting onto first and second dorsal fins in comparison to spiny dogfish. The two species also differ in the morphology of the skeletal support of the dorsal fin. Basals and radials in spiny dogfish are almost indistinguishable, while radials in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> are more numerous and are arranged in two rows of elongate, plate-like elements that articulate with one another. The muscle of the dorsal fin in spiny dogfish is composed of one large muscle mass that extends to all of the proximal radials in spiny dogfish, while in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> distinct individual muscle bundles insert onto the ceratotrichia overlying the distal and proximal skeletal elements. ^ During steady swimming, the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish move independently of the body with larger amplitudes at lower speeds, indicating a stabilizing function. The dorsal fins in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> move in synchrony with the trunk, with a larger range of motion than dogfish at both speeds. The first and second dorsal fins of <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> move laterally in phase with the axial portion of the body, although with larger lateral displacement. ^ Electromyography data shows simultaneous muscle activity on both sides of the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish which is independent of speed, indicating active stiffening of this fin. The second dorsal fin in spiny dogfish and both dorsal fins in bamboos show alternating muscle activity on each side of the fin, indicating active flapping. Flow acceleration and vortex shedding were identified at the wake of the second dorsal fin in spiny dogfish and both dorsal fins in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> using particle image velocimetry. Flow in the wake of the second dorsal was considerably decelerated. These data demonstrate that contrary to the traditional hypothesis, not all dorsal fins function as stabilizers; the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish contributes to stability while the second dorsal fin, as well as both dorsal fins in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks,</b> contribute to thrust production. ^ During maneuvers, the dorsal fin muscles are active on both sides in spiny dogfish and white-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks.</b> Spiny dogfish have longer burst duration on the contralateral side, consistent with opposing resistance to the medium. In <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks,</b> activation might be insufficient to counteract water resistance. The function of the dorsal fins is more flexible and diverse than first thought and might explain the morphological diversity in dorsal fins found among sharks. ...|$|R

The births baffled experts as the mother shared an {{aquarium}} with only one other shark, which was female. The female <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> had laid eggs in the past. This is not unexpected, as many animals will lay eggs {{even if there is}} not a male to fertilize them. Normally, the eggs are assumed to be inviable and are discarded. This batch of eggs was left undisturbed by the curator as he had heard about the previous birth in 2001 in Nebraska and wanted to observe whether they would hatch. Other possibilities had been considered for the birth of the Detroit <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> including thoughts that the sharks had been fertilized by a male and stored the sperm for a period of time, as well as the possibility that the Belle Isle <b>bamboo</b> <b>shark</b> is a hermaphrodite, harboring both male and female sex organs, and capable of fertilizing its own eggs, but that is not confirmed.|$|R
