60|$|When he beheld {{those of}} his fellows who were defined as buffers and fogeys--imperturbable, matter-of-fact, {{slightly}} ridiculous beings, past masters {{in the art of}} populating homes, schools, and colleges, and present adepts in the science of giving away brides--how he envied them, assuming them to feel as they appeared to feel, with their commerce and their politics, their glasses and their pipes. They had got past the distracting currents of passionateness, and were in the calm waters of middle-aged philosophy. But he, their contemporary, was tossed like a cork hither and thither upon the crest of every fancy, precisely as he had been tossed when he was <b>half</b> <b>his</b> present <b>age,</b> with the burden now of double pain to himself in his growing vision of all as vanity.|$|R

Under constant attack, he and his comrades assembled a radio station to transmit information about the enemy's movements which helped the Allies determine where to deploy troops. Wilson was injured twice in the war and still had shrapnel in his arm after the war.|$|E

60|$|In 1643 Milton, then {{thirty-five years}} old, married Mary Powell, {{a girl of}} just <b>half</b> <b>his</b> own <b>age,</b> {{daughter}} of a royalist residing near Oxford. We must imagine this young wife as coming to preside, somewhat in the capacity of matron, over a family of boys held severely to their tasks of study by a master in whom the sense of humor was almost entirely lacking, and whose discipline was of the sternest. That she could not endure the situation was but natural. Very soon after the wedding she went home {{with the understanding that}} she was to make a short visit to her parents and sisters; but she did not return for two years. Her husband summoned her, but she would not come back. In 1645 she at last repented of her waywardness, sought reconciliation, and was forgiven. These two years had wrought a change in Mary Powell Milton. She was now ready to live with her husband, and did so till her death in 1652. She left him three daughters, the youngest of whom, Deborah, lived till 1723, and was known to Addison and his contemporaries, from whom she received distinguished honors.|$|R

60|$|Whatever Pierston's years {{might have}} made him look by day, in the dusk of evening he was fairly presentable as a {{pleasing}} man of no marked antiquity, his outline differing but little from {{what it had been}} when he was <b>half</b> <b>his</b> years. He was well preserved, still upright, trimly shaven, agile in movement; wore a tightly buttoned suit which set of a naturally slight figure; in brief, he might have been of any age as he appeared to her at this moment. She talked to him with the co-equality of one who assumed him to be not far ahead of her own generation; and, as the growing darkness obscured him more and more, he adopted her assumption of <b>his</b> <b>age</b> with increasing boldness of tone.|$|R
2500|$|Post-retirement, Weekes {{would make}} {{occasional}} appearances in charity and exhibition matches, including for the International Cavaliers.

He also had some success in stroke play tournaments, including a runner-up finish in the Martini International in 1973 when aged 60.

However, Poirot and Hastings reunite during the novels The Big Four, Peril at End House, The ABC Murders, Lord Edgware Dies and Dumb Witness when Hastings arrives in England for business, with Poirot noting in ABC Murders that he enjoys having Hastings over because {{he feels that}} he always has his most interesting cases with Hastings. The two collaborate for the final time in Curtain: Poirot's Last Case, when the seemingly-crippled Poirot asks Hastings to assist him in his final case. When the killer they are tracking nearly manipulates Hastings into committing murder, Poirot describes this in his final farewell letter to Hastings as the catalyst that prompted him to eliminate the man himself, as Poirot knew that his friend was not a murderer and refused to let a man capable of manipulating Hastings {{in such a manner}} go on.|$|E

2500|$|But {{films with}} Dev Anand {{as the lead}} hero in Hum Naujawan (1985) and Lashkar (1989) {{continued}} to be box office successes and were appreciated by critics.

Aamir quoted “Dev saab was an icon for many generations and entertained us throughout his life. [...] He was already 60 years old in 1983 when he acted with Padmini Kolhapure in Swami Dada but looked <b>half</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> and shared a good on-screen chemistry.

His performance as Professor Anand in the 1989 film Lashkar (film) at the age of 66 was widely appreciated and was a major success at the box office. He managed to look 35 in the film directed by Jagdish Kadar, [...] acting opposite young actors like Sumeet Saigal, Hemant Birje, Javed Jaffery, Sonam and Madhavi.
