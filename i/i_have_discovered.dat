25|$|Be {{it known}} unto you that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that you and}} the other Sir W. H. are {{reciprocal}} polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} on The Big Show's premiere that Allen {{delivered}} perhaps his best-remembered crack about television: [...] "You know, television is called a new medium, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> why {{they call it a}} Medium– because nothing is Well Done." [...] That did not stop the Museum of Broadcast Communications from considering Allen [...] "the intellectual conscience of television." [...] Aside from his famous crack about not liking furniture that talked, Allen observed that television allowed [...] "people who haven't anything to do to watch people who can't do anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fred Allen, who {{frequently}} joked {{about his own}} radio demise, joined Bankhead in recreating one of the best-remembered routines from Allen's old show: the [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Breakfast Show" [...] routine that ruthlessly satirized the often saccharine husband-and-wife morning shows that became something of a radio staple a decade earlier. And it was on The Big Show's premiere that Allen delivered his famous wisecrack about TV: [...] "Television is a new medium, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> why it's called a new medium --- because nothing is well done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> it for myself," [...] she said, [...] "and, {{sooner or}} later, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> it, and <b>had</b> learned that you too {{had been in}} the conspiracy, <b>I</b> should never <b>have</b> spoken to you again as long as I lived." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> {{the fact}} of their mutual liking before either of them, I was not surprised.|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to think}} over what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered,</b> <b>I</b> was sorely perplexed {{what to do}} next.|$|R
2500|$|Pärt {{has said}} of [...] "tintinnabulation": [...] "The complex and many-faceted only confuses me, and I must search for unity. What is it, this one thing, {{and how do}} I find my way to it? Traces of this perfect thing appear in many guises – and {{everything}} that is unimportant falls away. Tintinnabulation is like this. Here I am alone with silence. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence, comforts me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 2016, it was {{announced}} that Ray Ivany would be leaving his post as President of Acadia University {{at the end of the}} 2017 academic year. In a statement provided to The Chronicle Herald, Ivany wrote [...] "I came to Acadia in 2009 because I respected the institution’s history, the faculty and staff who had established its reputation, its alumni who care deeply about the university, and its students who, year after year, earn awards and recognition for their work. In my time here, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> the same Acadia magic that attracts students from around the world".|$|E
2500|$|Hume was {{extremely}} {{pleased with his}} argument against miracles in his Enquiry. He states [...] "I flatter myself, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check {{to all kinds of}} superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures." [...] Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.|$|E
60|$|And smooth! Polished glass {{could not}} be more so. Finally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to admit that at last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a Barsoomian {{fortification}} which I could not negotiate.|$|R
60|$|After <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> this island, <b>I</b> {{considered}} no further; but resolved {{it should}} if possible, {{be the first}} place of my banishment, leaving the consequence to fortune.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> this unknown sea {{all this}} insubstantial pageant had faded like the {{baseless}} {{fabric of the}} vision that it was and left not a rack behind.|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that the}} public in the Holy Land does not fully believe the terrible horror that has befallen our nation in exile. Sadly, the bitter truth is many, many times worse than {{anything}} you have heard. All that is known in the free world is but a drop in the ocean of massacres battering European Jewry. To all those doubters, I can bear witness from my own personal experience that all current descriptions are as nothing compared with the awful truth. On leaving Hungary, I saw with my own eyes wagonloads of Italian Jews being transported to their death in Poland. Elderly, women, young children, pushing their shrunken hands through the bars, begging for [...] "Water! Water!" [...] But the Gestapo troops did not allow anyone to approach the death train and assist the captives. I saw prisoners crazed from thirst attacking each other and biting their flesh.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> that jealousy varies. Let me {{tell you}} what I mean.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, O Orme, a worse thing; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that the}} Prince Joshua has laid {{a plot to}} steal away 'Her-whose-name-is-high.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|By the by, {{what is the}} law of England {{respecting}} this? Suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered,</b> or been wrecked on an uninhabited island, {{would it}} be mine or the king's? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By that aged lady, Madame Walravens?" [...] I inquired, fancying that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> in the incurable grief of bereavement, {{a key to}} {{that same}} aged lady's desperate ill-humour.|$|R
60|$|It {{was seven}} o'clock when I reached Washington, but, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> arrived at my destination, I could give no {{thought to the}} object of my journey until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> the truth about Walkirk. That was all-important.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> what {{girls are}} made for," [...] said Rose, {{the day after}} the {{reconciliation}} of Archie and the Prince.|$|E
60|$|Gerv. Make haste, {{and save}} yourself, sir; the enemy's at hand: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{him from the}} corner, where you set me sentry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Majesty, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{something}} very funny {{at the bottom}} of the hole near the peanut trees. Come and see what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|Something arrested my attention. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> {{among these}} needles {{a number of}} little round objects. And {{it seemed to me}} that one of these had moved. [...] "Cavor," [...] I whispered.|$|R
6000|$|My heart gave a {{great leap}} {{as if it}} would bound out of my body. There was no mistaking that face among the commonplace faces near it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> Mrs. Van Brandt! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{instantly}} summoned help. The women-servants {{carried her}} to my bed. While they were restoring her to herself, I wrote {{a few lines}} telling the miserable woman how <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> her secret.|$|R
6000|$|Three {{days later}} the Commissary called at our hotel. [...] "Well, gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I am glad to say <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> everything!" ...|$|E
6000|$|CUSINS. Oh, mad as a hatter. You {{are welcome}} to my secret since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> yours. But I am astonished. Can a madman make cannons? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's about Montague and Littleham. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> the {{fly in the}} ointment. I thought {{those two}} would never be content with a {{reasonable}} land speculation." ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned upon me with {{a fierce}} look in her big black eyes. Her {{instinct}} showed her at once <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> her secret. [...] "Tell them, and hang me," [...] she cried fiercely.|$|R
6000|$|The old man's {{appearance}} recalled me, {{the moment}} I perceived it, to {{my sense of}} present things, and reminded me that the inquiry which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> pursued thus far still remained incomplete. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> the smear on the nightgown. To whom did the nightgown belong? ...|$|R
5000|$|Miss Wright {{was seated}} at her {{dressing}} table, {{and looked for}} all the world like a little girl experimenting with her mother's cosmetics. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> in her from the first sight, you might say, an unaffected genuineness and appeal.|$|R
6000|$|... "What an {{impatient}} creature you are!" [...] said Lizette. [...] "Only think! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> that my maid, whom we hired {{only two days}} ago, has--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So this {{is where}} the money is coined, eh?" [...] he remarked. [...] "It is {{fortunate}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> the place, for I need some." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This will be {{the twelfth}} day, Lord. As for the Nest, it is secret; that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered.</b> It is to your wisdom that I look to find it." ...|$|E
60|$|With bowed {{head and}} broken hopes I {{came out of}} the cave and told the Sagoth {{chieftain}} what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered.</b> It didn't mean much to the fellow, who doubt-less had but little better idea of the contents of the document <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been sent to fetch to his masters than would the cave man who in all probability <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came near}} {{discovering}} a great deal," [...] Spencer answered. [...] "Perhaps {{it would have}} been better for my system if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a little less. As it is <b>I</b> <b>have</b> finished with l'affaire Poynton for the present. You see how very nearly l'affaire Poynton finished me." ...|$|R
60|$|After a walk {{of perhaps}} {{a quarter of}} an hour I stopped suddenly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> something. <b>I</b> looked about me, utterly amazed. I was on the little beach which the Sand Lady had {{assigned}} to Walkirk and me as a camping ground.|$|R
