40|$|Abstract Advanced-cycle {{pedigree}} breeding has caused maize (Zea mays L.) <b>inbreds</b> to become more-elite but more-narrow genetically. Our objectives were to evalu-ate the genetic distance among current and historical maize <b>inbreds,</b> and {{to estimate how}} much genetic diver-sity has been lost among current <b>inbreds.</b> We selected eight maize <b>inbreds</b> (B 14, B 37, B 73, B 84, Mo 17, C 103, Oh 43 and H 99) that largely represented the genetic back-ground of current elite <b>inbreds</b> in the U. S. seed industry. A total of 32 other <b>inbreds</b> represented historical <b>inbreds</b> that were once important in maize breeding. Cluster analysis of the <b>inbreds,</b> using data for 83 SSR marker lo-ci, agreed well with pedigree information. <b>Inbreds</b> from Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS), Reid Yellow Dent, and Lancaster clustered into separate groups with only few exceptions. The average number of alleles per locus was 4. 9 among all 40 <b>inbreds</b> and 3. 2 among the eight current <b>inbreds.</b> The {{reduction in the number}} of alleles per locus was not solely due to sample size. The average genetic distance (Dij) was 0. 65 among the eight current <b>inbreds,</b> 0. 67 among the 32 historical <b>inbreds,</b> and 0. 67 among all 40 <b>inbreds.</b> These differences were statisti-cally insignificant. We conclude that genetic diversity among current <b>inbreds</b> has been reduced at the gene level but not at the population level. Hybrid breeding in maize maintained, rather than decreased, genetic diversity, at least during the initial subdivision of <b>inbreds</b> into BSSS and non-BSSS heterotic groups. We speculate, however, that exploiting other germplasm sources is necessary for sustaining long-term breeding progress in maize...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of heterotic {{patterns}} {{is essential}} in hybrid maize (Zea mays L.) breeding programs. Second cycle <b>inbreds</b> of maize were developed from crosses between three historical European <b>inbreds</b> (EP 1, F 2, and F 7) and American or European germplasm. The objective {{of this study was}} to find out if the second cycle <b>inbreds</b> derived from EP 1, F 2, and F 7 preserved the European flint heterotic group. Crosses of first and second cycle <b>inbreds</b> with four testers (W 64 A, A 619, A 632, and W 117) were evaluated in northwestern Spain. Second cycle <b>inbreds</b> from EP 1 or F 2 × European germplasm had the highest yield and early vigor in crosses to the testers, probably because flint × dent heterosis was preserved. The U. S. germplasm used to develop second cycle <b>inbreds</b> from EP 1 and F 2 included germplasm from the open-pollinated variety Minnesota No. 13. The use of Minnesota No. 13 germplasm to develop second cycle <b>inbreds</b> from crosses to European flint should be avoided because almost all the early U. S. Corn Belt dent <b>inbreds</b> introduced into Europe are related to Minnesota No. 13. ‘Lancaster’ germplasm was suitable to improve the yield of F 7, but this material lacked early vigor. Lancaster-related second cycle <b>inbreds</b> performed better for yield than the ‘Reid Yellow Dent’ because two testers were of Reid origin. The highest early vigor was obtained for second cycle <b>inbreds</b> from F 7 × European <b>inbreds.</b> European flint germplasm is appropriate for improving European <b>inbreds</b> in crosses to U. S. germplasm, whereas the U. S. germplasm may be used to improve a specific cross. The authors acknowledge to A. Panouille and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (I. N. R.

40|$|AbstractFood {{insecurity}} and malnutrition {{are two major}} challenges facing rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Hybrids of quality protein maize (QPM) have a crucial role here to play because QPM contains increased lysine and tryptophan concentrations and has a higher biological value than the normal maize. Information on the combining ability and heterotic patterns of QPM <b>inbreds</b> is crucial {{for the success of}} hybrid programs in the sub-region. Ninety-one diallel crosses derived from 14 early maturing yellow-endosperm QPM <b>inbreds</b> were evaluated from 2010 to 2012 under Striga infested, drought, low-N and optimal environments in Nigeria. The objectives were to (i) examine the combining ability of the set of early yellow QPM <b>inbreds,</b> (ii) classify the <b>inbreds</b> into heterotic groups and identify the best testers (iii) compare the efficiencies of the heterotic grouping methods in classifying the <b>inbreds</b> and (iv) determine the grain yield and stability of the <b>inbreds</b> in hybrid combinations under the research environments. General (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability effects were important in the inheritance of grain yield and other traits of the <b>inbreds.</b> However, GCA was more important than SCA under each contrasting environment and across environments suggesting that the additive gene action was more important than the non-additive in the set of <b>inbreds.</b> The SCA effects of grain yield and the heterotic group's SCA and GCA of grain yield (HSGCA) methods classified the <b>inbreds</b> into three groups each, while the heterotic grouping based on GCA of multiple traits (HGCAMT) and the SNP-based genetic distance (GD) methods had two groups each across research environments. There was close correspondence among the classifications of all the grouping methods in terms of placement of <b>inbreds</b> into the same heterotic groups. The SNP-based method was the most efficient and was used to identify TZEQI 87 and TZEQI 91 as the best testers for the SNP-based heterotic groups 1 and 2.

5|$|The modern Norman Cob is {{slightly}} heavier {{than it was}} in the early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being absorbed into the Selle Francais breed.

The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, and to bring attention to the risk of extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France.

5|$|From the 14th to the 16thcentury, Finnish {{horses were}} {{exported}} to Russian and Germany in such quantities that eventually {{restrictions on the}} number of exports were set. The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19thcentury influenced the development of the Vyatka horse. In the 19thcentury and early 20thcentury, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural draught breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian Draught. In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian work horse breeds, in the mid-20thcentury, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its war indemnity.

40|$|The most {{important}} insect pest of maize (Zea mays L.) in southern Europe is the pink stem borer (Sesamia nonagrioides Lef.). The {{objective of this}} work was to identify sources of resistance to stem and ear damage by the pink stem borer. One hundred twenty-one <b>inbreds</b> from seven germplasm groups (American, Argentine, European, Lancaster, Northern Flint, Reid, and Other), divided according to their maturity grouping (very early, early, midscason, and late), were evaluated for several years under artificial infestation at Pontevedra (northwestern Spain). Twelve traits were recorded to measure stem and ear damage. Stem and ear damage resistance traits were not correlated, therefore simultaneous selection for {{the two types of}} resistance within the same population should be carried out. Eight very early, two early, seven midseason, and four late <b>inbreds</b> were resistant to stem-damage. The Reid germplasm group was more resistant to stem attack than the other groups. Therefore, the best Reid <b>inbreds</b> could be used to form a stem-damage resistant Reid synthetic, which could be a source of new stem-damage resistant varieties. Simultaneously, the best non-Reid <b>inbreds</b> could be used for making a non-Reid stem-damage resistant synthetic. Thirteen very early, 10 early, two midseason, and three late <b>inbreds</b> performed better than the others against ear attack.
