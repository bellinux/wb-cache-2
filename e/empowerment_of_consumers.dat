50|$|Although offline {{customer}} engagement predates online, {{the latter is}} a qualitatively different social phenomenon unlike any offline {{customer engagement}} that social theorists or marketers recognize. In the past, customer engagement has been generated irresolutely through television, radio, media, outdoor advertising, and various other touchpoints ideally during peak and/or high trafficked allocations. However, the only conclusive results of campaigns were sales and/or return on investment figures. The widespread adoption of the internet during the late 1990s has enhanced the processes of customer engagement, in particular, {{the way in which it}} can now be measured in different ways on different levels of engagement. It is a recent social phenomenon where people engage online in communities that do not necessarily revolve around a particular product, but serve as meeting or networking places. This online engagement has brought about both the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> and the opportunity for businesses to engage with their target customers online. A 2011 market analysis revealed that 80% of online customers, after reading negative online reviews, report making alternate purchasing decisions, while 87% of consumers said a favorable review has confirmed their decision to go through with a purchase.|$|E

40|$|How {{marketing}} {{knowledge is}} applied to the healthcare sector is examined to identify where this knowledge is being used and can be used better. Social marketing, market segmentation, new technologies and consumer empowerment are discussed. Relevance is first established before considering how social marketing is being applied. Limitations and problems are discussed, of which one is the failure to target effectively. Healthcare sector segmentation is considered in terms of ethnicity, given the need to often distinguish and target minority groups. The continuing growth in availability and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) opens the sector to an array of marketing applications with significant strategic considerations for competing businesses. While the use of ICT has implications for consumer empowerment, understanding of the links and interactions between the marketing activities of business using ICT and the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> of healthcare, is another area in need of further research...|$|E

There are many unethical marketing techniques which could be found in deceptive product recipes, packaging, promotion, prices and in other areas. Most consumers have no appropriate powers and tools to counteract the manipulation techniques and feel they have fewer rights than the marketers.

In particular, the idea that it benefits consumers to have more choice is questioned. Design/methodology/approach - The key constructs of Michel Foucault - disciplinary power, governmentality and technologies of self - are used to argue that people can never escape from the operation of power. Rather it is shown how power operates to produce consumers. Findings - The liberal view of the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> through choice is questioned. Rather we suggest the opposite; that choice is a disciplinary power and that more and more choice can lead to choice paralysis. The contemporary phenomenon known as blogging is described as a Foucauldian technology of self. Managerial implications are discussed.

40|$|Recovery {{from severe}} and {{persistent}} mental illness represents {{a new paradigm}} in the understanding and treatment of serious psychopathology {{in the mental health}} field. In contrast to the traditional medical model, the recovery vision presumes a holistic, non-linear, unique nature of the process that individuals with severe mental illness experience in their journey towards wholeness. It focuses more on the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> of mental health services to accept and overcome the challenge of their illness and less on symptom elimination.

40|$|Abstract: Information, it is said, is power, and the {{proliferation}} of web-based information systems (IS) has made the potential for empowerment by information available to an increasingly large user population. The <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> through quality of service information is a key component of modern UK economic and competition policy in order to both resolve certain information asymmetries between traders and consumers and facilitate switching, i. e. the ability of consumers to switch suppliers of goods and services. Using a case study approach, this paper concentrates not on the intricacies, physical design or specific information content of the IS itself but on the regulatory approach taken by the UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, to provide it. It considers how the mechanisms set up to provide and audit appropriate, comparable and reliable information actually favour the interests of the traders rather than the consumers. The result is that those people at whom such information is undoubtedly aimed (consumers) and who need it to make rational choices in the market are actually disempowered, particularly those vulnerable groups who may have special information requirements. It concludes that if consumers are to be properly empowered by information in such systems, the regulator must do more to better protect the consumer interest and provide them with information they actually need and not the information that the traders are willing to provide...|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} <b>of</b> the <b>consumer’s</b> role {{in society}} has been a focus of discussion since {{the first quarter of}} the twentieth century. The improved communications and technology that appeared in the second half of the twentieth century, and coincided with the emergence of new supranational structures of European government, have influenced a transformation of the state and the market. Where the <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> political science was readily transformed into the notional consumer citizen, the once distinct legal doctrines of private and public law conspired to complicate attempts to accommodate the conflated entity. The transformation taking place in the state and the market has brought with it multiple identities for the consumer that have been acknowledged in law, and an opening up of the distinct national citizenship spaces in EU Member States. This thesis argues that a limited and theoretical notion <b>of</b> the <b>consumer</b> citizen can now be accommodated, particularly as a consequence of the economic and technological forces of globalisation that have resulted in an acceleration of the commodification of public services. In reality, numerous barriers can be identified that turn the concept <b>of</b> the <b>consumer</b> citizen into a more relevant, if aspirational, notion <b>of</b> a <b>consumer</b> citizenship practice defined by consumer behaviours. This thesis discusses the normative influences that shape these behaviours and argues that the platforms and channels necessary for an effective consumer citizenship practice, capable of policy and market shaping, is developing with the encouragement of the EU institutions. These normative influences are located in the enforcement and <b>empowerment</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> protection; state, civil society and market sources <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> information; individual and structural aspects of capability; and the individualistic and solidaristic aspects of motivation. They are presented as a hierarchy of normative influences and applied in an illustrative case study of the energy sector. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Disability services offices on college campuses {{can be an important}} resource to these students. This article reports the results of a survey of disability services offices at colleges and universities in 10 states. Data were collected from 275 disability services offices regarding the number of students with psychiatric disabilities seeking assistance, characteristics of the disability services office, and the services provided. We tested a multivariate model examining the relationship between a set of predictor variables (characteristics of the school and disability services office) and the number of students with psychiatric disabilities enrolled with the disability services office. Significant predictors included size of school, school type, and having an outreach/recruitment policy regarding students with psychiatric dis-abilities. Also significant were several characteristics of the disability service office. Although the rights of students with psychi-atric disabilities to higher education have been established for several years, barriers in the col-lege environment can prevent students from taking full advantage of their rights. Disability services offices have a pronounced role in providing the needed supports for students with psychiatric dis-abilities, as well as for students with other types of disabilities. In earlier work we examined state policy regarding supporting students with psy-chiatric disability in higher education (Collins & Mowbray, 2005 a).

40|$|Purpose. This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to develop a conceptual framework that emphasize the proactive role of territorial stakeholder in place communication management, especially thanks to crowdsourcing initiatives. Methodology. The study draws from the taxonomy of Parsons’ decisions (policy decisions, allocative decisions, and coordination decisions) and from the construct of place reputation in order to outline the architecture of strategic and operational decisions of place communication. The pervasiveness of social media, the progressive <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> and growing crowdsourcing activities, enable to define a participatory and interactive approach {{in the management of}} communication. Findings. The proposed framework highlights the strategic role of stakeholder in contributing to the management of place communication. Ideas, comments, suggestions and experiences of different stakeholders can contribute to the re-definition of the resources of place identity and enable a “shared”, collaborative creation of thematic paths and “mapping” of the territory for the promotion of local goods and services. Limitations. The conceptual paper presents the typical limitations of the deductive approach based on literature review. Practical implications. The adoption of the framework can help the responsible of place communication to give sense to the various inputs generated from various stakeholders, to guide the vision and modify the place identity, and to define marketing strategies and place communication in line with the expectations of publics.

40|$|The rise of {{transparency}} {{on the public}} and political agendas is not an accident or fad, soon {{to be replaced by}} another timely topic in sustainability politics and governance. Transparency will remain a key topic in global value chains and will further develop as it piggy-backs on wider social developments such as globalization, the information age, and the shifting role of states in environmental governance. Transparency in value chains is bound up with positive connotations: the more transparency the better it is for the sustainability of chains and for the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> and civil society. But an overall positive past assessment of value chain transparency does not automatically extend into the future as new challenges lie ahead. This paper investigates the new challenges for value chain transparency and their consequences. Due to the growing importance attached to transparency in value chains it becomes a central object of power struggles, with uncertain outcomes. Markets and states seek to capture transparency arrangements for their own goals, which may not be in line with the assumed normative linkages between value chain transparency and increased power for consumers and civil society. In that sense, transparency is losing its innocence: more transparency is no longer always the best for citizen-consumer empowerment and for the sustainability of value chains. But value chain secrecy is not an attractive alternative. This opens a new research agenda on how transparency should be organized and arranged in value chains {{to live up to the}} promises of democracy and sustainability...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{systemic}} “castification” 1 processes and the rapidly changing world of work, assisting people with disabilities with obtaining and maintaining high-quality employment is an increasingly difficult task. Vocational rehabilitation (VR) counseling thus can be instrumental for enhancing the career success and qual-ity of life of consumers with disabilities. In this article, a framework that describes how effective VR counsel-ing promotes the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> with disabilities is presented. Following {{a description of the}} primary model constructs of working alliance, informed choice, self-determination, and empowerment, the implications of the framework for VR counselor training and practice are discussed. The world of work is changing at a rapid pace, and the changes are likely to accelerate during the 21 st century. Employment arrangements such as tempo-rary employment, short-term hires, contractual positions, leased workers, and on-call and part-time workers have and will continue to influence the career development of all workers (Institute on Rehabilitation Issues, 1999). These changes are having a substantial impact on the life roles of individuals with disabilities, the settings in which they live and work and the events that occur in their lives. At the same time, current disability policy in the United States fo-cuses on the inclusion, independence and empowerment of people with dis-abilities (Kosciulek, 2000). Thus, vocational rehabilitation (VR) counseling with people with disabilities must be a dynamic, creative and highly individualized process. Effective VR counseling can be instrumental for empowering the life choices, inclusion and independence of people with disabilities. In turn, empowerment, inclusion and independence will lead to high-quality em-ployment and fulfilling careers for individuals with disabilities (O’Day, 1999).

40|$|With {{the rapid}} emerge of social {{media and the}} {{subsequent}} <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>consumer,</b> marketers are more challenged than ever before. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact of exposure to social media, motivation to use social media, opinions shared and content viewed via social media on the purchase intention. Additionally it aims to identify the impact of social media on creating awareness and information search relative to traditional media channels. Lastly, after suggestion within the literature that there is a change of purchase funnel touch points due to the emergence of social media, this issue is explored as well. A deductive research process allowed establishing a number of hypotheses, which were then statistically analysed via a quantitative research method. In total 193 Austrians between the ages of 19 to 29 years were surveyed with an online survey. In order to test the proposed hypotheses descriptive analyses, Pearson r, stepwise and a multiple regression were undertaken. To gain further inside a descriptive analyses and Pearson r was conducted. The findings illustrate that motivations to use social media, opinions shared and content viewed on social media sites are significantly correlated to purchase intention and also are moderate predictors for purchase intention. Hence the study delivers evidence that e-WOM created and viewed on social media as well as firm-generated content {{have a significant impact on}} consumers purchase intention. In contrast exposure to social media has no significant relationship to purchase intention. The additional findings present a shift from offline towards online media for awareness generation and information search. Also the results underline the change in consumer touch points and suggest adding a touch point. Besides the fact that this research adds to the under-researched area of social media literature it also provides significant findings for marketing in practise.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was twofold: Firstly, to find out whether organic meat {{consumers}} are perceived pro-social as defined by Griskevicius et al (2010) with attributes: Caring, Altruistic and Nice. The second theme was to find out what values of the perceiver influence that judgement; a glimpse to who finds the organic bacon consumer as pro-social. Quantitative methods were used in this study and an internet survey was conducted within students of University of Helsinki and Aalto University as well as a pre-requited Food West panellists. As anticipated, the results show that the organic bacon consumer is indeed perceived significantly more pro-social than the user of conventional bacon. The results indicate that conservational values: conformity, security and tradition best explain the pro-social perception on the organic bacon consumer although also hedonism was found influential in forming the perception. Further the analysis reveals that the conservational values importance to the person influence the perception on organic bacon consumer especially within women. Thus, based on the results it could be hypothesised that the person who perceives organic bacon consumer as pro-social is a woman who cherishes conservational values and that the strength of the values determines her perception. This study contributes new insight to the theory about the influence of values in forming a perception on organic food (meat) consumers. The implications drawn from the study {{can also be used to}} benefit organisations and producers in the organic food sector. <b>Empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> could be one way to guide consumers for more pro-environmental consumption behaviour as it could trigger both, the conservational values as well as hedonism from the selfenhancement value domain.

40|$|Purpose: Arguing that {{increasing}} use of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) is shifting market power from suppliers to consumers, the ensuing consumer empowerment is presented as an unintended consequence of marketing. Marketing implications arising from this consumer empowerment are examined in terms of a process where control and management by suppliers over consumer access and enablement are increasingly difficult. Design/methodology/approach: Consumer empowerment is examined historically, using quality gap analysis to capture an ongoing power struggle between consumers and suppliers. This draws out the limitations of current marketing and management strategies. The different forms of marketing challenges in this new environment are discussed. Findings: The role of marketing strategies in fostering controlled consumer empowerment is reflected in the development of information-based consumer-centric marketing strategies that seek to enable and control delegation. In designing such strategies, consumers' familiarity with and use of ICT are both strengthened and widened, emphasising the uncontrolled nature of the consumer empowerment process. Research limitations/implications: The approach is literature-based, focussing on the ICT enabled process. It does not address the psychology of empowerment. Since, consumer empowerment may imply switching suppliers in search of better value propositions, business cannot afford to ignore it, justifying the need for further research of both elements. Practical implications: Marketing strategy rests on a control premise and the analysis of the consumer empowerment process implies that current customer-centric strategies are operating under a false premise. There is a need to regain control over the marketing process, that is, to either manage the technological <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers,</b> or to devise new strategies cognisant of the possibility that such technological empowerment cannot be managed. The valuation of consumer loyalty in this environment rises significantly. Originality/value: An historical perspective to consumer empowerment exposes the tensions between suppliers and consumers arising from ICT usage. A separation of consumer access and enablement from control and management by suppliers is shown to have important marketing strategy design implications...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{technologies}} {{have become a}} ubiquitous element in contemporary consumption practices. Consumers shop online, take online classes, play fantasy sports, date online, have virtual personal trainers in their phones and even live virtual lives. How do such digital experiences integrate into and reflect upon consumption experiences in the material world? In this dissertation, I propose a theory of sociotechnical consumption that explores this relationship through the digital empowerment (technical) and social interaction (social) elements embedded in consumer products and services in digital spaces. Accordingly, I extend the concept of sociotechnical {{to the study of}} consumer behavior, advocating the perspective that studying the technological aspects of entities is incomplete without considering their relationships with the associated social aspects. I develop and investigate this theory through a multi-method approach, which is elaborated via three essays. Essay one applies the grounded theory methodology to explore consuming experiences in digital spaces in the context of online fantasy football. Essay two provides a conceptual inquiry of consumer empowerment from a sociotechnical perspective illustrating an integrative framework that bridges consumer empowerment literature with the social impact theory (Latané 1981) to discuss research gaps and theory development opportunities. In doing so, it also addresses the disarray surrounding the concept with a broader definition and an exhaustive typology.
