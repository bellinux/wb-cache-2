2500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} types of holes are formed by low head dams (weirs), and similar types of obstruction.

On the other hand, we show that two exponential maps are generally not conjugate on their sets of <b>escaping</b> <b>points.</b> Using the correspondence with our model, we also answer several questions about escaping endpoints of external rays.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a class of}} transcendental meromorphic functions f: C ↦ → C with infinitely many poles.
