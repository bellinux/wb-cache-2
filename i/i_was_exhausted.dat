5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
2500|$|She {{wrote it}} with American {{songwriter}} and producer Dan Wilson. It {{was one of}} the last written for 21. The track, which epitomizes the lyrical content of 21, summarizes the now defunct relationship that the record is all about. Adele has openly discussed the genesis of it saying, [...] "Well, I wrote that song because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> from being such a bitch, with 'Rolling in the Deep' or 'Rumour Has It' ... I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him. And when I did it, I felt so freed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2001, EastEnders began airing a 4th weekly episode. The storyline to {{mark the}} {{occasion}} centred around Mel, her husband Steve, and her former lovers Phil and Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). After Phil and Steve wrongfully framed Dan for Phil's shooting, Dan sought revenge by kidnapping Mel and demanding a ransom. An EastEnders insider reportedly told The Mirror, [...] "This has be [...] {{one of the most}} dramatic storylines we have ever filmed. Dan has vowed to get even with Phil and Steve for framing him over the shooting. Kidnapping Mel kills two birds with one stone. Although Mel and Phil have had their differences, he still harbours feelings for her." [...] As part of the storyline, Outhwaite, as Mel, was tied up to a radiator in a council flat. Outhwaite commented, [...] "They offered to untie my wrists between scenes, but I said no so I could feel what it was really like. My wrists were raw by the end of it and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted,</b> but that was the challenge I wanted." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost <b>exhausted,</b> and by {{the time}} we reached camp, just at dark, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wholly <b>exhausted.</b> My voice had sunk to a whisper, a fact that occasioned R.C. some concern until I could explain.

60|$|At last I {{could go}} no further; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> with the {{violence}} of my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and lay still.|$|E

6000|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> with my struggles, {{and in an}} {{agony of}} {{suffocation}} with the gag, which hindered me from getting my breath.

So the handkerchief was removed, and while I was panting, a voice said: ...|$|E

60|$|Now, you {{see before}} you the wreck and ruin {{of what was}} once a young person like yourselves. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>exhausted</b> by the heat of the day. I must take what is left of this wreck and run out of your {{presence}} and carry it away to my home and spread it out there and sleep the sleep of the righteous. There is nothing much left of me but my age and my righteousness, but I leave with you my love and my blessing, and may you always keep your youth.|$|R
60|$|I slept the {{afternoon}} away under the trees, {{and when my}} father roused me at sundown {{it was a very}} sick little boy that got up and dragged wearily homeward. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted,</b> oppressed by the weight of my limbs, and in my stomach was a harp-like vibrating that extended to my throat and brain. My condition was like that of one who had gone through a battle with poison. In truth, I had been poisoned.|$|E
6000|$|And we fled eastward {{through the}} quiet streets, {{prepared}} at every cross street for anything to happen. To the south a monster conflagration was filling the sky, {{and we knew}} that the great ghetto was burning. At last I sank down on the sidewalk. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> and could go no farther. I was bruised and sore and aching in every limb; yet I could not escape smiling at Garthwaite, who was rolling a cigarette and saying: ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{and again}} as we tramped over the barren ground, and when we climbed the ridge, I was {{compelled}} to stand still to recover breath, explaining to Piake that I had been travelling day and night, with no meat {{during the last three}} days, so that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted.</b> This was an exaggeration, but it was necessary to account in some way for the faintness I experienced during our walk, caused less by fatigue and want of food than by anguish of mind.|$|E
60|$|It was a rainy, misty {{morning when}} I left my kind retreat {{and friends in}} Edinburgh. Considerate as every body had been about {{imposing}} on my time or strength, still you may well believe that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>exhausted.</b>|$|R
60|$|He spoke so earnestly, and {{his face}} looked so deadly pale, that I felt it {{impossible}} to refuse him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>exhausted</b> by the prolonged labours of the day, but knew that I had reserve strength for an emergency.|$|R
5000|$|The film's director, Scud, {{explained}} that {{the idea for the}} film [...] "originated from my own thoughts about suicide. One time, I had thought about walking into the central Australian desert until <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>exhausted</b> and die in a miserable way. These thoughts caused me to think about similar people in this situation." [...] He continued that [...] "All of the episodes are independent of each other and the stories are based on real experiences which some of the actors appearing in the film have gone through. Having an international cast and locations around the world is appropriate because depression and suicide are universal themes".|$|R
60|$|Ignosi bound the diadem {{upon his}} brows. Then advancing, {{he placed his}} foot upon the broad chest of his {{headless}} foe and broke out into a chant, or rather a pæan of triumph, so beautiful, and yet so utterly savage, that I despair {{of being able to}} give an adequate version of his words. Once I heard a scholar with a fine voice read aloud from the Greek poet Homer, and I remember that the sound of the rolling lines seemed to make my blood stand still. Ignosi's chant, uttered as it was in a language as beautiful and sonorous as the old Greek, produced exactly the same effect on me, although <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> with toil and many emotions.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{wound up}} all his affairs from the Receiving Station at Honolulu, {{and went down}} to Molokai. He didn't get on well there. The {{resident}} physician wrote us that he was a shadow of his old self. You see he was grieving about his wife and the kids. He knew we were taking care of them, but it hurt him just the same. After six months or so I went down to Molokai. I sat on one side a plate-glass window, and he on the other. We looked at each other through the glass and talked through what might be called a speaking tube. But it was hopeless. He had made up his mind to remain. Four mortal hours I argued. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> at the end. My steamer was whistling for me, too.|$|E
60|$|Throughout the day, and {{as slowly}} and {{steadily}} as ever, the wind increased. It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow, and blow harder, {{and keep on}} blowing. And still the Ghost foamed along, racing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven knots. It {{was too good to}} lose, but by nightfall <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted.</b> Though in splendid physical trim, a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel was the limit of my endurance. Besides, Maud begged me to heave to, and I knew, if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night, that it would soon be impossible to heave to. So, as twilight deepened, gladly {{and at the same time}} reluctantly, I brought the Ghost up on the wind.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> too <b>exhausted</b> to argue. I {{laid down}} the knife and fork with dignity and took a side seat and Joe went for the wretched creature. He worked away in silence for awhile, and then he muttered [...] "Damn the duck" [...] and took his coat off.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} I {{got to my}} third {{appointment}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> entirely <b>exhausted.</b> <b>I</b> met here some, however, whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> exceedingly interested to see; among them Samuel Gurney, brother of Elizabeth Fry, {{with his wife and}} family. Lady Edward Buxton is one of his daughters. All had that air of benevolent friendliness which is characteristic of the sect.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I {{received}} {{your letter}} with delight; {{it was the}} first word that reached me from the old country. I am in good health now; I have been pretty seedy, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> by the journey and anxiety below even my point of keeping up; I am still a little weak, but that is all; I begin to ingrease,[23] it seems, already. My book is about half drafted: the Amateur Emigrant, that is. Can you find a better name? I believe it will be more popular than any of my others; the canvas is so much more popular and larger too. Fancy, it is my fourth. That voluminous writer. I was vexed to hear about the last chapter of The Lie, and pleased to hear about the rest; it would have been odd if it had no birthmark, born where and how it was. It should by rights have been called the Devonia, for that is the habit with all children born in a steerage.|$|E
60|$|Then, a Hussar once more, I hurried onward to {{the grove}} which was our rendezvous. My brain was {{still reeling from}} the {{concussion}} of the powder, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> by the many emotions which had shaken me during that terrible night. It is like a dream, all that walk in the first dim grey light of dawn, with the smouldering camp-fires around me and the buzz of the waking army. Bugles and drums in every direction were mustering the infantry, for the explosion and the shouting had told their own tale. I strode onward until, as I entered the little clump of cork oaks behind the horse lines, I saw my twelve comrades waiting in a group, their sabres at their sides. They looked at me curiously as I approached. Perhaps with my powder-blackened face and my blood-stained hands I seemed a different Gerard to the young captain whom they had made game of the night before.|$|E
60|$|Through it all I battled my way, hatless, soaked to the skin, yet {{finding a}} certain wild {{pleasure}} in the storm. By the time I had reached my little dwelling <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted.</b> My hair and clothes were in wild disorder, my boots were like pulp upon my feet. My remaining strength was expended in closing the door. The fire was out, the place struck cold. I staggered towards the easy chair, but the floor seemed suddenly to heave beneath my feet. I was conscious {{of the fact that}} for two days I had had little to eat, and that my larder was empty. My limbs were giving way, a mist was before my eyes, and the roar of the sea seemed to be in my ears, even in my brain. My hands went out like a blind man's, and I suppose broke my fall. There was rest at least in the unconsciousness which came down like a black pall upon my senses.|$|E
60|$|Being a good swimmer, I {{struck out}} {{at once and}} made for {{the side of the}} pirate vessel, where I caught the end of a rope, and soon clambered on board. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>exhausted,</b> {{and sat down on the}} breech of a carronade to rest and recover my stunned and {{scattered}} faculties.|$|R
50|$|Its {{water balance}} {{was and is}} {{affected}} by the brown coal open-cast pits south of Mönchengladbach. After the Garzweiler <b>I</b> pit had <b>been</b> <b>exhausted,</b> work began on Garzweiler II. This is slowly approaching Mönchengladbach and also the NMSN.|$|R
60|$|Already I heard shouts {{above me}} which told that my pursuers were {{descending}} the hill. I dashed into the {{thickest part of}} the underwood, and I ran and ran until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> utterly <b>exhausted.</b> Then <b>I</b> lay panting and listened with all my ears, but no sound came to them. I had shaken off my enemies.|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - I {{received}} {{your letter}} with delight; {{it was the}} first word that reached me from the old country.

60|$|Oh, {{that last}} five miles! The skin was rubbed {{from the inside}} of my legs, and every {{movement}} of my horse gave me anguish. Nor was that all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> with toil, want of food and sleep, and also suffering very much from the blow I had received on my left side; it seemed as though a piece of bone or something was slowly piercing into my lung. Poor Daylight, too, was pretty nearly finished, and no wonder. But there was a smell of dawn in the air, and we might not stay; better that all three of us should die upon the road than that we should linger while there was life in us. The air was thick and heavy, as it sometimes is before the dawn breaks, and -- another infallible sign in certain parts of Zu-Vendis that sunrise is at hand -- hundreds of little spiders pendant on the end of long tough webs were floating about in it. These early-rising creatures, or rather their webs, caught upon the horse's and our own forms by scores, and, as we had neither the time nor the energy to brush them off, we rushed along covered with hundreds of long grey threads that streamed out a yard or more behind us -- and a very strange appearance they must have given us.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had been}} {{suffering}} in my health {{a good deal}} all the way; and at last, whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> by my complaint or poisoned in some wayside eating-house, the evening we left Laramie, I fell sick outright. That was a night which I shall not readily forget. The lamps did not go out; each made a faint shining in its own neighbourhood, and the shadows were confounded together in the long, hollow box of the car. The sleepers lay in uneasy attitudes; here two chums alongside, flat upon their backs like dead folk; there a man sprawling on the floor, with his face upon his arm; there another half seated with his head and shoulders on the bench. [...] The most passive were continually and roughly shaken by {{the movement of the}} train; others stirred, turned, or stretched out their arms like children; it was surprising how many groaned and murmured in their sleep; and as I passed to and fro, stepping across the prostrate, and caught now a snore, now a gasp, now a half-formed word, it gave me a measure of the worthlessness of rest in that unresting vehicle. Although it was chill, I was obliged to open my window, for the degradation of the air soon became intolerable to one who was awake and using the full supply of life. [...] Outside, in a glimmering night, I saw the black, amorphous hills shoot by unweariedly into our wake. They that long for morning have never longed for it more earnestly than I.|$|E
60|$|It came {{none too}} soon for me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>exhausted</b> that <b>I</b> had to <b>be</b> helped off my mustang. Stockton {{arranged}} my blankets, fed me, and bathed the bruise on my head, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too weary and sick to be grateful or to care about anything except sleep. Even {{the fact that my}} hands were uncomfortably bound did not keep me awake.|$|R
6000|$|BLOOM: (Cowed) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>exhausted,</b> abandoned, no more young.

The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second {{according to the law}} of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle as you probably...

50|$|It’s crazy. He name {{brings a}} {{different}} perspective on the world. Having a kid {{is a lot of}} work, though. Holy shit! I’d be filming all day and get home sometimes at 12 or 1 in the morning, and he’d just get up—boom!—and wouldn’t go to bed until 6 in the morning.
