5|$|Symes {{was injured}} during {{pre-season}} but made his second Bournemouth debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2010–11 season against Charlton Athletic as a half-time substitute. Bournemouth lost the game 1–0 but played against ten-men for the last half-hour after defender José Semedo was sent off <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> tackle on Symes. He was again a substitute for his side's League Cup match before he made his first start the following weekend as Bournemouth defeated Peterborough United 5–1 and a week later he grabbed his first Bournemouth goal with a penalty in a 3–0 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, Symes soon suffered a shoulder injury, which required specialist treatment and kept him out for nearly a month. With Bournemouth's form pushing them towards the top of the league, Symes admitted he would have to prove himself again to manager Eddie Howe. Bournemouth, however, suffered a number of injuries to strikers, and they risked bringing Symes back early. He was brought on as a half-time substitute against Carlisle United and helped lead his side to a 2–0 victory by scoring the second goal. He instantly won a place in Bournemouth's starting team and followed up his goal-scoring performance by netting twice against Exeter City to put Bournemouth second in the table. He soon spent another six weeks on the sidelines because of a shoulder injury before returning in November. His injury problems continued during the winter and he struggled to gain a run of games in the team meaning he did not score again until February at which point he scored in three successive matches.|$|E

500|$|Though {{it reached}} No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major {{commercial}} nor critical success {{when it was}} first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following.

Jeff Berkwits of Sci Fi Weekly wrote that [...] "… the Battlefield Earth Special Edition DVD is packed with information, offering an enlightening glimpse into the creative process behind this imperfect but entertaining picture". Randy Salas of the Star Tribune described it as the [...] "Best DVD <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> movie."

The {{recording of the}} song featured in the video is the version recorded during the Smart Studios sessions. The Sub Pop video features the band walking around various parts of lower Manhattan including the South Street Seaport, the Lower East Side, and Wall Street. While filming the video, Novoselic shaved his head as penance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> performance the band gave in New York City. This caused discontinuity in the final cut; shots of the band feature the bassist with and without hair throughout the video. This video was later compiled on the Nirvana box set With the Lights Out (2004).

500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Badler had joined the cast of Neighbours as [...] "super-bitch" [...] Diana Marshall. Badler said that when she met with the writers, they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together. Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours executive producer, Susan Bower and when she tried to get her music featured on the show, she was asked to play Diana instead. Badler said that she still had to audition for the role, which she said was [...] "depressing" [...] as she hates auditioning. However, she said it was fun as the part was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> girl, which is the kind of role she enjoys playing. She added [...] "Now I'm happy that I had to earn the role; I feel as though it was made for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mercedes storyline was {{met with}} widely {{divergent}} reactions, though her musical numbers were generally given high marks.

Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first [...] "booty camp" [...] scene, including Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger, BuddyTV John Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting [...] "wildly out of character" [...] in the episode. Michael Slezak of TVLine was also puzzled at her change, and asked, [...] "When has Mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's going to cut her slack <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> week?" [...] Canning agreed, and wrote: [...] "Schue's tough love with Mercedes came out of left field", and felt it added to the [...] "inconsistency of these characters", even though [...] "it ultimately made sense" [...] in the context of setup for [...] "It's All Over". Time James Poniewozik wrote that having the story [...] "turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it [...] "the best part of the episode": it was [...] "all about how she now feels appreciated—because she has a boyfriend, sigh—and so she's willing to take on Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions." ...|$|E

Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush Administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq.
