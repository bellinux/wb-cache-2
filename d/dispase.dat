50|$|During rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, fluid {{from the}} {{vitreous}} humor enters a retinal hole. The {{mechanisms by which}} retinal holes or tears form are not fully understood yet. The accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space and the tractional force of the vitreous on the retina result in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. During this process the retinal cell layers {{come in contact with}} vitreous cytokines. These cytokines trigger the ability of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to proliferate and migrate. The process involved resembles fibrotic wound healing by the RPE cells. The RPE cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and develop the ability to migrate out into the vitreous. During this process the RPE cell layer-neural retinal adhesion and RPE-ECM (extracellular matrix) adhesions are lost. The RPE cells lay down fibrotic membranes while they migrate and these membranes contract and pull at the retina. All these finally lead to secondary retinal detachment after primary retinal detachment surgery.A number of studies have also shown that arachidonic acid metabolic cascade (one of the major inflammatory cascades) is important in the development of PVR. COX-2 expression was found in human idiopathic epiretinal membranes. Phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase blocking reduced structural abnormalities of the rat retina in concanavalin model of PVR and reduced the frequency of membrane formation by 43% in the <b>dispase</b> model of PVR and by 31% in the concanavalin one.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the cellular components, biochemical composition, and membrane surface characteristics of denuded human amniotic membrane (DHAM) treated with <b>Dispase</b> II. Methods: DHAM was incubated with <b>Dispase</b> II (1. 2 U/ml) for 30 min, 60 min, or 120 min. This {{was followed by}} gentle scraping to remove any remaining epithelial cells using a cell scraper. Histology, immunohistochemistry for extracellular matrix molecules and growth factors, and transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to assess the effects of increasing durations of incubation on DHAM structure. Results: <b>Dispase</b> II treatment {{was associated with the}} digestion of several ECM molecules, particularly those in the basement membrane including collagen VI, fibronectin, and laminin. FGF- 2 and PDGF-B expression were unaffected by <b>Dispase</b> II, but TGF-α, TGF-β 1, TGF-β 2 R, PDGF-A, VEGF, and EGFR expression were all reduced by <b>Dispase</b> II incubation. TEM confirmed the disruption of DHAM ultrastructure with increasing duration of <b>Dispase</b> II incubation, beginning with disruption of the basal lamina and progressing to loosening of the stromal collagen network as well. Conclusions: The use of <b>Dispase</b> II in the preparation of DHAM causes significant changes to the ultrastructure of the membrane, particularly the BM.

40|$|<b>Dispase,</b> {{a neutral}} {{protease}} isolated from culture filtrates of Bacillus polymyxa, {{has proven to}} be a rapid, effective, but gentle agent for separating intact epidermis from the dermis and intact epithelial sheets in culture from the substratum. In both cases it effects separation by cleaving the basement membrane zone region while preserving the viability of the epithelial cells. Because it is not known what or where in the basement membrane zone <b>Dispase</b> cleaves, we set up studies to define its substrate specificity. Using purified basement membrane components and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we show that <b>Dispase</b> cleaves fibronectin and type IV collagen, but not laminin, type V collagen, serum albumin, or transferrin. The action of <b>Dispase</b> on collagen appears to be selective for type IV collagen in that several stable degradation products are formed, whereas the enzyme degrades type I collagen only minimally. In newborn human skin, as seen by electron microscopy, <b>Dispase</b> removes the lamina densa, rich in type IV collagen, but preserves the anchoring fibrils (structures known to contain type VII collagen) and the epidermal cells. Because its action is so selective, it suggests that <b>Dispase</b> can serve as a powerful tool for dissecting epithelial-mesenchymal interactions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} using flow cytometry cultured human primary keratinocytes isolated from the epidermis and hair follicles by different methods. Methods: Human keratinocytes derived from discarded fragments of total skin and scalp hair follicles from patients who underwent plastic surgery in the Plastic Surgery Division at UNIFESP were used. The epidermal keratinocytes were isolated by using 3 different methods: the standard method, upon exposure to trypsin for 30 minutes; the second, by treatment with <b>dispase</b> for 18 hours and with trypsin for 10 minutes; and the third, by treatment with <b>dispase</b> for 18 hours and with trypsin for 30 minutes.

The real-time 3 D HD-OCT assessment of (i) the impact on morphological and cellular characteristics of the processing of human acellular dermal matrices (HADMs) and (ii) repopulation of HADMs in vitro by human fibroblasts and remodelling of the extracellular matrix by these cells. Four different skin decellularization methods, <b>Dispase</b> II/Triton X- 100, <b>Dispase</b> II/SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate), NaCl/Triton X- 100 and NaCl/SDS, were analysed by HD-OCT. HD-OCT features of epidermal removal, dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) integrity, cellularity and dermal architecture were correlated with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Human adult dermal fibroblasts were in vitro seeded on the NaCl/Triton X- 100 processed HADMs, cultured up to 19 days and evaluated by HD-OCT in comparison with MTT proliferation test and histology. Epidermis was effectively removed by all treatments. DEJ was best preserved after NaCl/Triton X- 100 treatment. <b>Dispase</b> II/SDS treatment seemed to remove all cellular debris in comparison with NaCl/Triton X- 100 but disturbed the DEJ severely. The dermal micro-architectural structure and vascular spaces of (sub) papillary dermis were best preserved with the NaCl/Triton X- 100. The impact on the 3 D structure and vascular holes was detrimental with <b>Dispase</b> II/SDS. Elastic fibre fragmentation was only observed after <b>Dispase</b> II incubation. HD-OCT showed that NaCl/Triton X- 100 processed matrices permitted in vitro repopulation by human dermal fibroblasts (confirmed by MTT test and histology) and underwent remodelling upon increasing incubation time. Care must be taken in choosing the appropriate processing steps to maintain selected properties of the extracellular matrix in HADMs. Processing HADMs with NaCl/Triton X- 100 permits in vitro the proliferation and remodelling activity of human dermal fibroblasts.

MÉTODOS: A membrana amniótica humana foi coletada no momento do parto, fixada em concentrações crescentes de glicerol (0 - 50 % em DMEM) e preservada a 80 °C até a hora de ser usada. O estudo consistiu de 4 grupos: epitélio intacto (controle) e membranas desepitelizadas pela tripsina (2 mg/mL a 1 : 250), <b>dispase</b> (1, 2 U/mL em solução salina balanceada de Hank livre de Mg 2 + e Ca 2 +) e ácido etilenodiaminotetra-acético (EDTA), 0, 02 %). As amostras foram submetidas à análise por microscopia eletrônica (de varredura e de transmissão). RESULTADOS: A microscopia eletrônica de varredura mostrou epitélio intacto no grupo controle e sua ausência nas membranas amnióticas desepitelizadas pela tripsina e pela <b>dispase.</b> Naquelas tratadas com o ácido etilenodiaminotetra-acético, havia áreas com e sem epitélio. Quando avaliadas pela microscopia eletrônica de transmissão, o epitélio estava intacto e firmemente aderido à membrana basal através de hemidesmossomos nos grupos controle e em parte do ácido etilenodiaminotetra-acético. Havia apenas fibras colágenas nas membranas tratadas com <b>dispase</b> e tripsina. CONCLUSÕES: O tratamento da membrana amniótica com tripsina e <b>dispase</b> pode causar completa retirada do epitélio e da membrana basal, ao passo que o ácido etileno- diaminotetra-acético pode preservar áreas com epitélio intacto e parcialmente destruir a membrana basal em outras. PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the morphological {{features of the}} amniotic membrane denuded by different techniques. METHODS: Human amniotic membrane was collected {{at the time of}} delivery, fixed in increasing concentrations of glycerol (0 - 50 % in DMEM) and preserved at - 80 ºC until the time of use. The study consisted of 4 groups: intact epithelium (control) and denuded by trypsin (2 mg/mL at 1 : 250), <b>dispase</b> (1. 2 U/mL in Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + free Hank's balanced salt solution) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0. 02 %. Specimens were submitted to electron (scanning and transmission) microscopy analysis. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy disclosed intact epithelium in the control group and its absence in the amniotic membranes denuded by trypsin and <b>dispase.</b> In those denuded by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid there were areas with and without epithelium. When assessed by transmission electron microscopy, the epithelium was intact and firmly adhered to the basement membrane by hemidesmossomes in controls and in parts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid group. There were only collagen fibers in the dispase- and trypsin-treated groups.

40|$|Invertebrate {{photoreceptor}} electrophysiology has mainly {{been studied}} with intracellular microelectrodes. Single-channel recording {{has proved to}} be difficult, possibly because of unusual plasma membrane configurations; in Limulus poly-phemus successful gigaohm seals were obtained only after pronase treatment and brief sonication (Bacigalupo and Lisman, 1983). Here we describe an isolated Hermissenda eye preparation that permits single-channel recording (Hamill et al. 1981) from identified type B photoreceptors; this photoreceptor sub-type has been assiduously studied with intracellular microelectrodes, under both current-clamp and voltage-clamp conditions. Associative conditioning of Hermissenda crassicor-nis (in the paired light and rotation paradigm) is attributable in part to the reduction of potassium conductances in the type B photoreceptors (Alkon, 1984, 1987; Alkon et al. 1985). We have used the isolated eye preparation to characterize two types of potassium channels in photoreceptor plasma membranes. When microelectrodes are employed on Hermissenda photoreceptors, the preparations are treated with protease (Sigma type XXIV) to soften the connective tissue capsule that covers the photoreceptors, thus easing the insertion of microelectrodes (Alkon et al. 1984).

Antifibrotic effect of OM- 101 was investigated in vivo. As control, eight weeks old c 57 black mice underwent intravitreal injection with Hepes (group A) or <b>dispase</b> (0. 3 [*]units), to induce retinal detachment (RD) and PVR. The dispase-injected mice were randomly {{divided into two groups}} B and C (N= 25 mice); in group C, the eyes were treated with intravitreal injection of OM- 101 (3 [*]μl), and group B with PBS, as a control.

40|$|While {{real-time}} 3 -D {{evaluation of}} human skin constructs is needed, only 2 -D non-invasive imaging techniques are available. The {{aim of this}} paper is to evaluate the potential of high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) for real-time 3 -D assessment of the epidermal splitting and decellularization. Human skin samples were incubated with four different agents: <b>Dispase</b> II, NaCl 1  M, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and Triton X- 100. Epidermal splitting, dermo-epidermal junction, acellularity and 3 -D architecture of dermal matrices were evaluated by High-definition optical coherence tomography before and after incubation. Real-time 3 -D HD-OCT assessment was compared with 2 -D en face assessment by reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM). (Immuno) histopathology was used as control. HD-OCT imaging allowed real-time 3 -D visualization of the impact of selected agents on epidermal splitting, dermo-epidermal junction, dermal architecture, vascular spaces and cellularity. RCM has a better resolution (1  μm) than HD-OCT (3  μm), permitting differentiation of different collagen fibres, but HD-OCT imaging has deeper penetration (570  μm) than RCM imaging (200  μm). <b>Dispase</b> II and NaCl treatments were found to be equally efficient in the removal of the epidermis from human split-thickness skin allografts. However, a different epidermal splitting level at the dermo-epidermal junction could be observed and confirmed by immunolabelling of collagen type IV and type VII. Epidermal splitting occurred at the level of the lamina densa with <b>dispase</b> II and above the lamina densa (in the lamina lucida) with NaCl. The 3 -D architecture of dermal papillae and dermis was more affected by <b>Dispase</b> II on HD-OCT which corresponded with histopathologic (orcein staining) fragmentation of elastic fibres. With SDS treatment, the epidermal removal was incomplete as remnants of the epidermal basal cell layer remained attached to the basement membrane on the dermis. With Triton X- 100 treatment, the epidermis was not removed. In conclusion, HD-OCT imaging permits real-time 3 -D visualization of the impact of selected agents on human skin allografts.

40|$|Lymphocytes {{isolated}} from Graves' and Hashimoto thyroid tissue by enzymatic (<b>dispase)</b> digestion or mechanical disaggregation were markedly different {{in terms of}} their ability to synthesize thyroid autoantibodies in culture. <b>Dispase</b> digestion, followed by removal of thyroid follicular cells, gave a lymphocyte population with a high T:B cell ratio (6 : 1). However, the ability of these cell suspensions to synthesize microsomal (Mic) and thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies spontaneously was significantly increased compared with lymphoid suspensions isolated by mechanical means. Spontaneous synthesis of thyroid autoantibodies was not markedly enhanced in cell suspensions prepared from patients' lymph node tissue by digestion compared with mechanical disaggregation. Further, Mic and Tg antibody production by thyroid lymphocytes prepared using <b>dispase</b> was inhibited by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) whereas in most cases suspensions prepared from the same tissues by mechanical dispersion synthesized low or undetectable levels of autoantibodies whether PWM was present or absent. Digestion of tissue debris remaining after mechanical removal of lymphocytes gave suspensions which had an increased proportion of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells compared with suspensions produced mechanically or by digestion alone; however, in terms of spontaneous autoantibody synthesis and PWM induced inhibition, these suspensions were similar to these obtained by digestion alone. It would therefore seem that enzymatic digestion of thyroid tissue resulted in the isolation of a lymphoid population which was different from that extracted by mechanical disaggregation. The digestion process appears to permit the recovery of lymphocytes closely associated with thyroid follicular cells and our studies suggest that it is this population which makes the major contribution to autoantibody synthesis...|$|E
40|$|During the {{entrance}} of adenovirus type 2 into cells, {{it has been suggested}} that the virion undergoes a conformational change. In this investigation, we have further characterized the hypothetical conformational change, which the structural protein hexon undergoes in response to low pH. From pH 5. 0 to pH 6. 0, the proteolytic enzyme <b>dispase</b> cleaved the hexon into a few distinct fragments with a dominating low-molecular-weight fragment with a molecular weight of 15, 000 (15 K peptide), whereas between pH 6. 5 and pH 8. 0, the cleavage of the hexon was negligible. The degradation of the hexon with <b>dispase</b> at low pH was not due to an increased activity or alteration of the active site of <b>dispase</b> at low pH. The 15 K fragment was identified as a segment of the N-terminal part of the hexon polypeptide beginning at amino acid residue 5. An immune serum produced in response to acid-treated and glutaraldehyde-fixed hexons contained a small amount of antibodies directed towards the 15 K fragment, as judged by Western immunoblotting. An anti- 15 K antibody fraction was isolated by affinity chromatography by removing antibodies recognizing the hexon in the alkaline configuration. Such antibodies displayed a higher relative titer at pH 5. 0 than at pH 7. 5 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The isolated antibodies showed a specific neutralizing capacity five times higher than that of the corresponding unfractionated polyclonal anti-hexon serum; however, the neutralizing ability was independent of pH.

The best results were achieved by culturing for 30 - 50 h at 42 o C, which yielded high SPI concentrations and negligibly smal...|$|E
30|$|Methods of decellularisation {{in heart}} valves report {{the use of}} trypsin (Bader et al. 2000) or a {{non-ionic}} detergent like triton X- 100 followed by ribonuclease digestion (Bader et al. 1998) which leads to incomplete removal of cells. Bader et al. (2000) described that a longer incubation with trypsin might {{be more effective in}} cell removal but causes a disruption of the matrix bundle of HAM. Reported methods on human amniotic membrane decellularisation include the use of hypotonic tris buffer, protease inhibitors and nuclease treatment along with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Wilshaw et al. 2008) and in some cases, treatment with <b>Dispase</b> II has also been reported (Lim et al. 2009). Though SDS treatment, commonly used for decellularisation was found to have destabilizing effect on collagen triple helix domain it was also responsible to swell the elastin network of the HAM (Samouillan et al. 1999). In the same way, treating HAM with <b>Dispase</b> II leads to the major changes in the basement membrane of HAM in terms of its constituents and ultrastructure which makes the membrane unsuitable for the growth of explant culture (Lim et al. 2009). Treatment of HAM with EDTA and/or proteolytic enzymes; in many cases require additional mechanical and can result in membrane damage (Saghizadeh et al. 2013). To overcome these limitations and to utilise the benefits of this membrane in diverse applications, the appropriate processing and preservation of the membrane is essential.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that cell suspensions prepared by mechanical dispersion of thymic tissue from myasthenia gravis (MG) patients spontaneously synthesise anti-acetyl-choline receptor autoantibodies (anti-AChR) in culture in many cases. We now find a 2 - 200 -fold greater anti-AChR production if the cell suspensions are prepared with the proteolytic enzymes collagenase and <b>dispase</b> (THYC + D). This difference {{has been seen}} in seven of the first 10 cases tested. Using these enzymes, we now also find comparable anti-AChR synthesis by MG lymph node cells, confirming the presumed extra-thymic production of much of this autoantibody. The increased anti-AChR synthesis by THYC + D {{is not simply a}} mitogenic effect of the enzymes, but apparently depends on several distinct factors: (1) plasma cells are often isolated much more efficiently [...] particularly by <b>dispase</b> [...] than by mechanical dispersion of these tissues (or of 'normal' tonsil), and the same may also be true of specific B cells. (2) The greatly increased numbers of fibroblasts, macrophages and other adherent cell types exert 'feeder' effects which enhance anti-AChR and total IgG production non-specifically. (3) Specific antigen presenting cells (APC) may also be recovered more efficiently and selectively stimulate anti-AChR production by B memory cells. These results imply that APC, plasma cells, and perhaps also B memory cells are recovered from germinal centres much more efficiently by enzymic than by conventional dispersion, a conclusion that may be relevant to workers studying antibody forming and memory B cells in other systems or species...|$|E
30|$|The hESC cell colonies were {{detached}} from the MEF feeder layer with <b>dispase</b> (1 U/ml) and transferred to ultra-low contact wells. The suspended hESCs aggregated as an embryoid body [EB] and was allowed to grow for 4 to 6 days before plating on substrates. With respect {{to the influence of}} cell density on differentiations, seven to ten EB cell aggregations were seeded onto each PLO, silk, and silk/CNT substrates, with a neuron induction medium consisting of F 12 /DMEM, N 2 supplement, and FGF 2 (20 ng/ml). The medium was changed once daily for the first 2 days and then once every other day.|$|E
30|$|The mice {{received}} {{an overdose of}} inhaled isoflurane and their pulmonary vasculature was perfused with PBS via the right ventricle. The PBS-perfused lungs were isolated, <b>dispase</b> II solution was infused into the lungs via the trachea and the trachea was then ligated with silk suture. After incubation for 45  min at 37  °C, the lungs were separated from the other mediastinal organs. Each lung was minced and digested in PBS with 0.1  % collagenase, 0.01  % deoxiribonuclease I and 5  mM CaCl 2 for 10  min (37  °C). Cells were suspended in red blood cell lysing buffer to remove red blood cells, washed once with PBS, centrifuged and suspended in PBS.|$|E
