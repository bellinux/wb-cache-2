40|$|Academic {{research}} on service failure is continuously evolving. This includes literature on service failure categories, core service failure, failure types, causes of failure, responses to failure and consequences following having service failures. Although {{much has been}} said regarding service failure, there is neither a clear, concise definition nor concrete empirical evidence found on what actually constitutes service failure. Service failure is generally accepted as a socially constructed concept, due to the variability and inseparability nature of services, service failure might mean <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>different</b> people. Based on previous literature, among the most cited theme for service failure is “delivery which does not meet or falls below customers’ expectations” (Bell and Zemke, 1987; Andreassen, 2001; Sparks, 2001; Lovelock and Wright, 2002; Holloway and Beatty, 2003). This implies that customers have a predetermined expectation before consuming a service. However, this general definition {{does not take into}} account or express in more detail on the “how”, “when” and “at what stage” the service delivery falls below the expectation and failure actually starts. This paper also forwards the acceptability theory whereby it is depicted that the acceptability of service failure is solely depending on the individuals’ tolerance. One failure can be a severe failure to one individual while it might just be insignificant to another. This conceptual paper attempts to understand the nature of service failure and how it is currently perceived based on varying perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to generate some propositions to help to understand better how individuals’ perceive service failure based on individuals’ acceptability, which will then hope to lead to a novel definition of service failure...|$|R

The TCC engages in a variety of activities that take place at all levels, including community, urban, national, and global politics, and involve many different groups of actors. Two sets of questions are ad-dressed: (1) What forms do these activities take? and (2) Do they en-hance or undermine democracy?

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} October, 1984 It {{is widely}} acknowledged that self-help procedures produce housing (Harms, 1982), {{but there are}} differing perspectives on the contexts and motives leading {{to the emergence of}} the self-help housing phenomenon; and the significance of self-help housing action {{in the lives of the}} actors themselves (Martin, 1984). The first issue has been the focus of sustained debate elsewhere (Burgess, 1978; 1982; Harms, 1976; 1982; Lea, 1979; Turner, 1978; 1982), but the second has remained largely the domain of the supporters of self-help housing strategies. This discussion is a first attempt at focusing critical scrutiny on the impact of self-help housing among those who are most intimately involved in it, the self-help homebuilders. This is not a clear-cut task, because the existing self-help literature provides few leads. The bulk of critical work focusing on self-help is a response to the glowing descriptions of self-help enterprise that emerged from the pens of fieldworkers in the squatter settlements of Latin America (Burgess, 1978). Most of this criticism places the self-help squatter phenomenon within a class-based framework of domination and subjection. Here, the group is the unit of analysis, and self-help action is seen to be the collective response to structural poverty. We find this analysis useful, but somewhat unsatisfactory in the context of our own research. Firstly, having worked among self-help homebuilders, it is apparent, to us that self help means <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>different</b> people. Whatever the overarching principle behind the emergence of self help, it is clear that every self-help scheme incorporates winners and losers, opportunists and unwilling co-optees, developers and survivors (Martin, 1984). Secondly, self-help housing and squatting are by no means synonymous in South Africa. Around South African cities, controlled, state-sanctioned self-help has emerged in the wake of ailing mass housing schemes. Self-helpers in this situation are not squatters, but may be relocatees, refugees from chronic overcrowding elsewhere, or even speculators keen to grab new residential possibilities. All enter the self-help arena with different chances of making out, some determined by entry, and others by contextual and personal factors beyond this...|$|R

But Eugenics itself does exist for those who have sense enough to see that ideas exist; and Eugenics itself, in large quantities or small, coming quickly or coming slowly, urged from good motives or bad, applied to a thousand people or applied to three, Eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning.|$|E
