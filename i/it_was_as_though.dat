5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

Large crowds {{gathered on}} the banks of the river and on the bridges, to witness the event. Marr wrote in his diary that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> [...] "all London had conspired together to bid us a heartening farewell".|$|E
500|$|The game's repetitiveness was criticised by many reviewers. Sam Zucchi of Kill Screen {{said that}} the game got tedious and that the repetitiveness of {{clicking}} on objects was sometimes trivial. He said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the game was saying: [...] "No, you really don't understand. Let me show you". Alessandro Baravalle of Eurogamer said that although parts of the game were poorly managed or redundant, it did have some exciting moments. Eric Swain {{said that the}} story is great but the game {{as a whole is}} let down by the repetitiveness of some parts and, as a result, becomes exhausting to play.|$|E

500|$|Aaron Rutkoff of Wall Street Journal touted the installment; [...] "The writers' oratorical impulses {{were mostly}} kept in check, giving us instead an action-filled A plot {{in the field}} and a suspenseful B plot on the farm, and both have serious stakes. The motif {{connecting}} the two plots: knives. This episode was all about knives." [...] Gary Roszko of The Huffington Post stated that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was a nice transition from what he thought was the typical development of the show. Sepinwall asserted that the episode was the strongest telecast since the second-season premiere, [...] "What Lies Ahead". While CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell felt {{that it was a good}} telecast, he declared that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor. New York Starlee Kine was critical of the flashbacks in the episode, who described the process as baffling. She wrote, [...] "It was done in the oddest way, though, where the flashbacks didn’t add any additional information than that which we already knew. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the writers thought a flashback could be used in place of their characters having backstories, instead of as a vehicle to convey them." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult {{to tell the difference between}} the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." [...] The Observers Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Haninah {{read the}} words [...] "the {{judgment}} is God's" [...] in [...] to teach that God views the action of wicked judges unjustly taking money away from one and giving it to another as an imposition upon God, putting God {{to the trouble of}} returning the value to the rightful owner.

I was still there in the trenches with a few men; we knew the armistice had been signed, but we had been forgotten; so had a section of the Germans opposite. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we were both doomed to fight on till extinction.

2500|$|Rivette's {{early years}} in Paris were impoverished and {{he was known to}} live ascetically on minimal resources; Chabrol said that he was very thin and hardly ate, {{comparing}} his smile to that of the Cheshire Cat. Gruault described Rivette as [...] "slight, dark-haired and had very lively dark eyes in an emaciated visage of a waxy pallor…add to that a forced, nervous smile of someone who has to make constant efforts to win acceptance by a society that he seemed to regard as irremediably hostile." [...] His opinions were highly regarded among his peers and according to Douchet, [...] " [...] was the great talker. He was the group's secret soul, the occult thinker, a bit of a censor." [...] Godard said, [...] "I might like a film very much, but if Rivette said 'It's no good' then I would agree with him ... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he had a privileged access to cinematographic truth." [...] Truffaut considered Rivette his best friend, and they were frequently seen at screenings. Truffaut said that in the 1950s, Rivette was {{the only member of the}} group already capable of directing a feature film.|$|E
2500|$|... `Abdu'l-Bahá {{taught that}} Christ's resurrection was a spiritual resurrection {{and that the}} {{accounts}} in the Gospels are parables. [...] `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote: [...] "We explain, therefore, the meaning of Christ's resurrection in the following way: After the martyrdom of Christ the Apostles were perplexed and dismayed. The reality of Christ, which consists in His teachings, His bounties, His perfections and His spiritual power, was hidden and concealed {{for two or three}} days after His martyrdom, and had no outward appearance or manifestation — indeed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were entirely lost. For those who truly believed were few in number and even those few were perplexed and dismayed. The Cause of Christ was thus as a lifeless body. After three days the Apostles became firm and steadfast, arose to aid the Cause of Christ, resolved to promote the divine teachings and practice their Lord's admonitions, and endeavoured to serve Him. Then did the reality of Christ become resplendent, His grace shine forth, His religion find new life, and His teachings and admonitions become manifest and visible. In other words the Cause of Christ, which was like unto a lifeless body, was quickened to life and surrounded by the grace of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vliet {{was forced}} to quickly form a new Magic Band to {{complete}} support-tour dates, with musicians who had no experience with his music and in fact had never heard it. Having {{no knowledge of the}} previous Magic Band style, they simply improvised what they thought would go with each song, playing much slicker versions that have been described as [...] "bar band" [...] versions of Beefheart songs. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the [...] "Tragic Band", a term that has stuck over the years. Mike Barnes said that the description of the new band [...] "grooving along pleasantly", was [...] "...an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who {{only a few years ago}} composed with the expressed intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor". The one album they recorded, Bluejeans & Moonbeams (1974) has, like its predecessor, a completely different, almost soft rock sound from any other Beefheart record. Neither was well received; drummer Art Tripp recalled that when he and the original Magic Band listened to Unconditionally Guaranteed, they [...] "...were horrified. As we listened, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> each song was worse than the one which preceded it". Beefheart later disowned both albums, calling them [...] "horrible and vulgar", asking that they not be considered part of his musical output and urging fans who bought them to [...] "take copies back for a refund".|$|E

2500|$|Science-fiction {{writer and}} critic James Blish, writing in 1957, shortly after publication, criticized {{the lack of}} {{characterization}} of its hero Dan Davis, saying, [...] "It is surely an odd novel that is at its best when the author is openly editorializing...." [...] — in this case about the [...] "parity system of farm price supports, which in 2000 is applied to automobiles. ... Every other important subject of science fiction which Heinlein has examined at length has come out remade, vitalized and made the author's own property. [...] It didn't happen here, {{for the first time}} in Heinlein's long and distinguished career — and not because Heinlein didn't have something to say, but because he failed to embody it in a real protagonist. [...] Evidently, Heinlein as his own hero is about played out." [...] Floyd C. Gale was more positive in his 1957 review, comparing the book to The Sleeper Awakes and writing that [...] "Heinlein paints a detailed picture of both civilizations, so evocative that 1970 emerges clearly in the reader's mind as the old days, and pretty primitive at that ... Of course you'll like Heinlein's latest". The critic Alexei Panshin, writing in 1968, said that [...] "as a whole, the story is thoroughly melodramatic but very good fun. ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Heinlein the engineer said, 'If I had the parts available, what little gadgets would I most enjoy building?' and then went ahead and built them fictionally. [...] A good story." ...|$|E
