40|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{apparent}} losses of rain ascribable to seeding at the Whitetop trial, particularly large and highly significant in the stratum E (but not in the opposite stratum W) of experimental days, it has been hypothesized that seeding causes widespread cloudiness and subsequent lowering of ground temperatures. This hypothesis is flatly contradicted by the observations: the seeded <b>E-days</b> (but not W-days) were uniformly less cloudy and hotter than those without seeding. Curiously, these differences prevailed {{not only from the}} scheduled time of seeding but also for several hours beforehand. The average rainfall for the 10 hr that preceded the time of seeding was investigated in eight “cells”, defined by the day's wind direction to be downwind, upwind, and to the sides and “far” and “near” the center of seeding. Highly significant decreases were found in the far-upwind and far-left cells, indicating an earlymorning disparity between those <b>E-days</b> that later were declared as experimental to be seeded and those <b>E-days</b> that were declared as experimental not to be seeded. This disparity, difficult to explain by chance variation, suggests that particular caution be used in treating differences in the rainfall between seeded and not-seeded days in the Whitetop trial as having been caused by seeding...|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} novels {{based on the}} fictional {{universe}} has been created, all written by Karen Traviss. The books expand on the games and detail events which occur in between installments. Gears of War: Aspho Fields {{was the first in}} an expected trilogy, although the total numbers of books has since grown to five. It focused {{on the history of the}} characters and the battle at Aspho Fields, but also took place during the events between Gears of War and Gears of War 2. The second novel, Gears of War: Jacinto's Remnant, continued where Gears of War 2 left off, with Jacinto's survivors fleeing the ruins of the city and searching for a new safe haven. Later they enter into a new conflict against the Stranded who have begun a guerilla war against the remnants of the COG. The book also detailed events 1 year after <b>E-Day,</b> when the new COG Chairman authorized the Hammer of Dawn counterattack. Gears of War: Anvil Gate is the third novel, released on August 31, 2010. The novel details the COG attempting to establish themselves on the island of Vectes, while trying to contain a Stranded insurgency and the resurgent Lambent. A flashback story details a young Hoffman during the Siege of Anvil Gate. Gears of War: Coalition's End, released in August 2011, is the fourth novel in the series, taking place immediately after the events of Anvil Gate; 18 months after the end of the second game. The novel details the COG's struggle with the Lambent attacks on the island of Vectes, and leads directly into Gears of War 3. Gears of War: The Slab is the fifth and final book in the series released in May 2012. The novel focuses on Marcus Fenix's time in Jacinto Maximum Security Prison prior to Gears of War, and reveals more backstory on him, Victor Hoffman, and Adam Fenix.|$|E

40|$|The {{triennial}} {{general elections}} are arguably the largest logistics {{exercise in the}} country. The Chief Electoral Office staff expands from 15 to over 16, 000 on Election Day (<b>E-day).</b> A complex schedule for finance, supplies, personnel, processes and training is mapped out. In this paper we identify processes that may be improved, and how the transition to electronic voting may enable this. With tight deadlines and untrained staff clerical errors occur. An analysis of these can indicate where additional resources should be allocated and processes improved.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} our knowledge of relevant exposure parameters when discussing possible health implication from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF), especially effects that might occur at non-thermal levels. In this thesis an effort is made to broaden the exposure assessment and to take the exposure time into account and combine it with the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and the field parameters (electric and magnetic field strength) to approach a dose concept. In {{the first part of}} the thesis self-reported subjective symptoms among mobile phone users were studied. As a basis for this an epidemiological study among mobile phone users was completed with the main hypothesis that users of the digital transmission system GSM experience more symptoms than users of the older analogue NMT transmission system. The hypothesis was falsified, but an interesting side finding was that people with longer calling time per day experienced more symptoms than people with shorter calling time per day. The time-aspect (long duration phone call etc.) was also found to be relevant for the occurrence of symptoms in association with mobile phone use as well as duration of symptoms. The new suggested dosimetric quantity Specific Absorption per Day (SAD), in which both calling time per day as well as the measured SAR 1 g are included showed a stronger association to the prevalence of some of the symptoms, such as dizziness, discomfort and warmth behind the ear compared to both CT and SAR 1 g alone. In the second part whole body exposure conditions were considered. Methods to measure the induced current were examined in an experimental study, where different techniques were compared in different grounding conditions. The results were used in a study of operators of RF plastic sealers (RF operators) where the health status as well as the exposure were studied. The results showed that RF operators are a highly exposed group, which was confirmed by the fact that 16 out of 46 measured work places exceeded the ICNIRP guidelines. Headaches were found to be associated with the mean value of the time integrated E-field during a weld (E-weld) and the warmth sensations in the hands (warm hands) with the time integrated E-field exposure during one day (<b>E-day).</b> The general findings in this thesis indicated that time should be included in the exposure assessment when studying non-thermal effects such as subjective symptoms in connection with RF exposure. The thesis proposes two different methods for doing this, namely timeintegrated exposure [V/m x t and A/m x t] and dose [J/kg]...|$|E
40|$|Robots {{have begun}} to deeply enter our lives and homes in various ways and with growing autonomy. Youths {{interact}} with and benefit from various robotic technologies, but have no understanding of how these robots are actually built. The main objective of the proposal is to introduce robot development processes to secondary students in Boise. For this, we are researching {{the development of a}} Lego-based robotic curriculum, which is easy and inspiring. The short-term and long term benefits from the successful curriculum development will be the revitalization of interest in science, technology, engineering and math among secondary students in Boise. For the robotic curriculum development, we have designed and implemented several Lego Mindstorm NXT robots. These robots are (1) fun to build, (2) easy to program to operate autonomously, and (3) rewarding to compete as group activities. In particular, to highlight the programming aspect of the robot development, we replaced the original firmware on an NXT brick with the LeJOS firmware. This will enable the secondary students to program robots in JAVA, which is a dominant modern high-level programming language used in academia and industry. To partially demonstrate our past efforts to develop an easy and inspiring robot curriculum for the secondary students in Boise, we will present the following intelligent robots during the undergraduate research conference: Line-following robot: The robot is programmed to follow a black line on a light surface. A light sensor on the robot determines if the robot is still on the line. If not, it performs a sequence of pivots and movements to search for a line until it finds it and continues. Modifications were made to LeJOS sample code {{in order to make the}} robot more responsive to corners and other anomalies in its path. We will demonstrate our improved algorithm by using robots programmed with the old and new code. Rover: This robot has sensors that allow it to collect environmental data, not unlike the Mars rover. It is able to detect obstacles in its path and respond to them by maneuvering out of the way. The above robot design and implementation experience will enable us to develop an easy and inspiring robot curriculum for secondary students in Boise. We are planning to use our robot design and implementation for the <b>e-DAY</b> and e-CAMP in the summer of 2010 to measure the effectiveness of Lego-based robot activities. To this end, this project will establish an inspiring robot curriculum to stimulate youths to major in STEM as they enter post-secondary education...|$|E
