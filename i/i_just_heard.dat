5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> {{the track and}} loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012, Aguilera {{confirmed}} {{that she and}} Green had worked on a new track entitled [...] "Make the World Move" [...] and described it as [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "full of life." [...] Regarding the collaboration, she said: [...] "I'm just excited to share the stage with Cee Lo because we both get off on production and dancers and having all of those fun elements about being on stage and being a performer... So {{the two of us}} together joining forces is going to be huge!" [...] When asked if [...] "Make the World Move" [...] would be released as a single, Aguilera replied saying that she was not sure about what would be done with the song. In an interview with MTV News in November, Aguilera explained how she felt the song would be suited to Green as she felt a male vocal contribution was needed, saying: [...] "I got to collaborate with my good buddy Cee Lo... There was a part for a potential male vocal on the chorus, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> immediately Cee Lo's voice on it, his signature Cee Lo, and it was fun collaborating with him and having him on my record and us joining forces together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just {{under two}} months later on July 30, Bibby no-hit the {{defending}} and eventual repeat World Champion Oakland Athletics 6-0 at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, the first no-hitter in the franchise's history. Despite issuing six walks and relying almost exclusively on his fastball, he still registered thirteen strikeouts and outdueled Vida Blue—himself a no-hit pitcher in 1970. After he fanned in the ninth inning, Oakland's Reggie Jackson commented on the strike three pitch, [...] "That's the fastest ball I ever saw. Actually I didn't see it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> it." [...] Bibby, whose salary was $15,000 that year, earned a $5,000 raise from team owner Bob Short {{as a result of}} the achievement.|$|E

She {{looked at her}} nails. [...] "But----I suspect you do like Valborg. Oh, I don't mean in any wrong way. But you're young; you don't know what an innocent liking might drift into. You always pretend to be so sophisticated and all, but you're a baby. Just because you are so innocent, you don't know what evil thoughts may lurk in that fellow's brain." ...|$|E

At {{the last three or four}} stairs, he tripped, caught at the bannisters, dropped the letter over them in doing so, tumbled into the passage in such a fury and fright that he looked like a madman, tore his hat off a peg, and rushed out. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> him say his {{daughter}} should come back, if he put a straight waistcoat on her, as he passed the door.

Read it yourself; Basil; you have every moral and legal claim on the precious document--and here it is." ...|$|E
60|$|I put my last {{this evening}} in the post-office. I dined with Dr. Cockburn. This being Queen Elizabeth's birthday, we have the D---- and all to do among us. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> of the stir as my letter was sealed this morning, and was so cross I would not open it to tell you. I have been visiting Lady Oglethorpe(1) and Lady Worsley;(2) the latter is lately come to town for the winter, and with child, and what care you? This is Queen Elizabeth's birthday, usually kept in this town by apprentices, etc.; but the Whigs {{designed}} a mighty procession by midnight, and had laid out a thousand pounds to dress up the Pope, Devil, cardinals, Sacheverell, etc., and carry them with torches about, and burn them. They did it by contribution. Garth gave five guineas; Dr. Garth I mean, if ever you heard of him. But they were seized last night, by order from the Secretary: you will have an account of it, for they bawl it about the streets already.(3) They had some very foolish and mischievous designs; and it was thought they would have put the rabble upon assaulting my Lord Treasurer's house and the Secretary's, and other violences. The militia was raised to prevent it, and now, I suppose, all will be quiet. The figures are now at the Secretary's office at Whitehall. I design to see them if I can.|$|E
