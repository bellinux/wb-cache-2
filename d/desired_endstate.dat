Contractors established demonstration farms, facilitating this training and providing hands on experience to local farmers. Nearly 300 farmers received greenhouses with drip irrigation systems, seed and fertilizers {{providing them with}} the tools {{they needed to be}} successful.

This thesis submits {{that there is}} strategic utility to high-value individual targeting (HVI or HVT) operations and offers a guide for national policy makers regarding when and how such operations should be conducted. Covert and clandestine actions must be conducted {{as part of a}} strategy and in support of clearly defined national goals. Foremost among the strategic considerations of covert action is the need to establish a <b>desired</b> <b>endstate</b> characterized by specific goals upon which a strategy can be built. Second, the strategy and subsequent methods must be consistent with the nations values. Last, any strategy must be continually evaluated for its effectiveness and revised when needed. This thesis analyzes several operations conducted by Israel between 1960 and 1973. Israel provides United States policy makers with relevant examples due to similar democratic structures and security issues. The selected operations, particularly those directed against Palestinian terrorists, have parallels to the United States efforts against al Qaeda. The analysis of Israeli operations provides insight for the considerations and intellectual framework policy makers should understand before committing national resources to high-risk lethal operations.

This paper examines how planners determine effects necessary to yield <b>desired</b> <b>endstate</b> during the EBO mission analysis process. The paper questions the suitability of applying the traditional task-focused mission analysis process to EBO planning. EBO’s conceptualization of the adversary as a Complex Adaptive System, the increased requirements for unified action between various actors (military, government, non-government, and coalition), and the amorphous 4 th Generation Warfare environment each pose new mission analysis challenges. EBO mission analysis is shown to be more problem structuring than problem solving. A new mission analysis process is proposed using a modified version of Soft Systems Methodology to meet these challenges. The discussion includes a general overview of how the new mission analysis would work based on a simple scenario. The paper is relevant to EBO planners and practitioners, especially those dissatisfied with trying to force EBO to fit within the current mission analysis process...|$|E
