2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009. However, when Mel Kiper revised his 2009 draft choices in February 2009, Ringer was not listed among Kiper's top five running backs. It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it that way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E
