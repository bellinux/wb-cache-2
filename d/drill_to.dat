5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the <b>drill</b> <b>to</b> receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the site, {{a former}} farmer's field on a slight slope, {{with a heavy}} clay soil that is subject to {{seasonal}} movements when wet, meant that substantial foundations and drainage had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 concrete piles extending vertically downwards into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These pilings were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, Wig-Palen, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow <b>drill</b> <b>to</b> fill the void as the drill was extracted, and steel reinforcement cages were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing {{the stability of the}} pilings and the structures they support.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. economy {{continued}} to grow, but {{the effects of}} the Cold War were imminent. Many families built bomb shelters in their yards, and children had learned to “duck and cover” under their desks as an emergency <b>drill</b> <b>to</b> a nuclear blast (U-S-History.com). This state of cold war was fought through Vietnam with America supporting the anti-communist South Vietnam and the Soviet Union supporting the pro-communist North Vietnam (What was the Cold War, 2000). The U.S.’s economy showed a short prosperous growth, which faltered when Lyndon Johnson failed to raise taxes to cover war expenses (Carr and Conte). The war dragged on until 1975 and the economy stagnated. During this time period though, the U.S. had established the Department of Transportation in 1966 and the Federal Highway Administration in 1967 (About Inc.). These agencies were responsible for building our nation’s transportations systems of roads and bridges and provided the funding for engineers like Figg.|$|E
