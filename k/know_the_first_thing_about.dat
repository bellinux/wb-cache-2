2500|$|Dolphy and John Coltrane {{knew each}} other long before they {{formally}} played together, having met when Coltrane was in Los Angeles with Miles Davis. They would often exchange ideas and learn from each other, and eventually, after many nights sitting in with Coltrane's band, Dolphy was asked to become a full member. Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis's quintet, but alienated some jazz critics {{when he began to}} move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane's quintets with Dolphy (including the Village Vanguard and Africa/Brass sessions) are now well regarded, they originally provoked Down Beat magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy's music as 'anti-jazz'. Coltrane later said of this criticism: [...] "they made it appear that we didn't even <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> music (...) it hurt me to see [...] get hurt in this thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't {{know what}} soup is," [...] said Jimmy, despairingly. [...] "My good man, I'm afraid you have missed your vocation. You have no {{business}} {{to be trying to}} burgle. You don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But still, I may be peculiarly {{qualified}} {{to live and}} succeed in the country. As you say yourself, you've spent your life in the city. You don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the country. It might even break your heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Consider!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "I <b>know.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> {{is to eat}} breakfast. Then we'll {{lie down}} again until it's time for supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|The little model gritted her teeth, and, {{twisting}} at her dirty gloves, said: [...] "Mr. Dallison, d'you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I'd buy if I was rich?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{we must be}} prepared," [...] Morris rejoined; [...] "you especially, {{because for}} you it must come hardest. Do you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> your father will say to you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Striped Chipmunk, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, and Danny Meadow Mouse {{looked as}} though they felt very foolish, as indeed they did. You see, all their lives Miner the Mole {{had been one of}} their nearest neighbors, and yet they didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Work! I, who {{had worked}} with men, found that I didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> real work. A ten-hour day! I had to pass coal for the day and night shifts, and, despite working through the noon-hour, I never {{finished}} my task before eight at night. I was working a twelve-to thirteen-hour day, and I wasn't being paid overtime as in the cannery.|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt boomed, [...] "Fine! Sure! Just let me know. And {{the wife}} and I want to have you at the house." [...] He forgot it, but {{unfortunately}} Ed Overbrook did not. Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner. [...] "Might as well go and get it over," [...] Babbitt groaned to his wife. [...] "But don't it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it. That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, there's not. Courbertin doesn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing.</b> St. Vincent evidently cannot {{cross the}} slough. Mr. Welse's arm puts {{him out of}} it. So it's only you and I, Tommy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Now let's {{be clear}} {{before we go}} any further that neither Tom Kilburn nor I <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> about {{computers}} {{when we arrived at}} Manchester University...

50|$|So far it was {{successful}} to grasp only {{a shadow of}} the real nature of friendship. We tend to the good to escape the evil, to the health to escape the illness, to the certain friend (doctor) to escape the enemy. We do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> that is loved.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might make}} the jacket a little tighter," [...] I whispered. [...] "It's too loose for comfort. I get lost in it. Hutchins is stupid. He is also a fool. He doesn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> lacing the jacket. Warden, you ought {{to put him in}} charge of the loom-room. He is a more {{profound}} master of inefficiency than the present incumbent, who is merely stupid without being a fool as well. Now get out, all of you, unless you can think of worse to do to me. In which case, by all means remain. I invite you heartily to remain, if you think in your feeble imaginings that you have devised fresh torture for me." ...|$|E
60|$|I sought odd jobs. I worked days, and half-days, at {{anything}} I could get. I mowed lawns, trimmed hedges, took up carpets, beat them, and laid them again. Further, I took {{the civil service}} examinations for mail carrier and passed first. But alas! there was no vacancy, and I must wait. And while I waited, and in between the odd jobs I managed to procure, I started to earn ten dollars by writing a newspaper account of a voyage I had made, in an open boat down the Yukon, of nineteen hundred miles in nineteen days. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the newspaper game, but I was confident I'd get ten dollars for my article.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just the same, you're {{wrong on}} general principle," [...] Grimshaw would oar in. [...] "I {{said at the}} time that the only reason we took Captain Doane in with us on the deal was because we needed a {{navigator}} and because you and me didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it. You said, 'Yes, sure'; and right away knew more about it than him when you wouldn't stand for buying three chronometers. What was the matter with you was that the expense hurt you. That's about as big an idea as your mind ever had room for. You go around looking for to dig out ten million dollars with a second- hand spade you call buy for sixty-eight cents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's funny, ain't it?" [...] Billy answered. [...] "I like {{horses that}} way. The boss says I'm a wooz at horses. An' I know he's a dub. He don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing.</b> An' yet he owns two hundred big heavy {{draughts}} besides this light drivin' pair, an' I don't own one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] said Maggie, simply; [...] "but then, you <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I ever {{remember}} {{in my life}} is standing with Tom {{by the side of}} the Floss, while he held my hand; everything before that is dark to me. But I shall never forget you, though we must keep apart." ...|$|R

"This {{investigation}} only {{assist the}} multibillion-dollar companies to swindle you, the avid consumer, {{as well as}} the vulnerable people that deem information should be free, sure we would like people to buy the games they test play, but it doesn't happen because people have to pay #$ a gallon for gas and shit.

6000|$|Mark Warren came up {{and asked}} her to dance. Rilla went, knowing Kenneth didn't care whether she went or stayed. An hour ago on the sand-shore he had been looking at {{her as if she were}} the only being of any {{importance}} in the world. And now she was nobody. His thoughts were full of this Great Game which was to be played out on bloodstained fields with empires for stakes--a Game in which womenkind could have no part. Women, thought Rilla miserably, just had to sit and cry at home. But all this was foolishness. Kenneth couldn't go--he admitted that himself--and Walter couldn't--thank goodness for that--and Jem and Jerry would have more sense. She wouldn't worry--she would enjoy herself. But how awkward Mark Warren was! How he bungled his steps! Why, for mercy's sake, did boys try to dance who didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> dancing; and who had feet as big as boats? There, he had bumped her into somebody! She would never dance with him again! ...|$|E
60|$|And it so happened. And in stolen half-hours {{of meeting}} I {{came to know}} all the sweet madness of boy's love and girl's love. So {{far as it goes}} it is not the biggest love in the world, but I do dare to assert that it is the sweetest. Oh, as I look back on it! Never did girl have more {{innocent}} boy-lover than I who had been so wicked-wise and violent beyond my years. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> girls. I, who had been hailed Prince of the Oyster Pirates, who could go anywhere in the world as a man amongst men; who could sail boats, lay aloft in black and storm, or go into the toughest hang-outs in sailor town and play my part in any rough-house that started or call all hands to the bar--I didn't know the first thing I might say or do with this slender little chit of a girl-woman whose scant skirt just reached her shoe-tops and who was as abysmally ignorant of life as I was, or thought I was, profoundly wise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Willard {{is a nice}} boy," [...] said Miss Sally suddenly. [...] "I don't think I {{ever did}} him justice before. The finer qualities of his {{character}} come out in these simple, homely little doings and tasks. He is certainly very thoughtful and kind. Oh, I suppose he'll make a good husband, as husbands go. But he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> managing. If his wife isn't a good manager, I don't know what they'll do. And perhaps she won't like the way we've done up Eden. Willard says she will, of course, because he thinks her perfection. But she may have dreadful taste and want the lace curtains and that nightmare of a pink rug Willard admired, and I dare say she'd rather have a new flaunting set of china with rosebuds on it than that dear old dull blue I picked up for a mere song down at the Aldenbury auction. I stood in the rain for two mortal hours to make sure of it, {{and it was really}} worth all that Willard has spent on the dining room put together. It will break my heart if she sets to work altering Eden. It's simply perfect as it is--though I suppose I shouldn't say it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Gag Pune Comes Out - (series finale) Bob Wire {{releases}} Gag Pune from Mount Stoney Lonesome, he {{was imprisoned}} in when Cliff was King. Gag was imprisoned {{in the mountain}} after going on a rampage after being laughed at by Cliff, Bob and the inhabitants of Under during a festival. Bob freed Gag because he <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he'll do is head to Under to destroy the place and Russel will {{have no choice but}} to get Cliff's help, and the price will be the Crown of Under. Meanwhile, Loopy needs to get his nose bell fixed and we learn that he's more than just the court jester.|$|R
5000|$|Modjeska {{intended}} to abandon her career and envisioned herself living [...] "a life of toil under the blue skies of California, among the hills, riding on horseback {{with a gun}} over my shoulder." [...] The reality proved less cinematic. None of <b>the</b> colonists <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> about ranching or farming, and they could barely speak English. The utopian experiment failed, the colonists went their separate ways, and Modjeska returned to the stage, reprising the Shakespearean roles that she had performed in Poland. Perhaps the best account of daily life on the ranch is Theodore Payne's memoir, Life on the Modjeska Ranch in the Gay Nineties.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good shooting, Mr. Mark," [...] the constable said. [...] "If every {{passenger}} {{could use}} {{his arms as}} you do there would soon be an end to stopping coaches.

50|$|The 1996-97 {{season was}} a big {{struggle}} for Southend as they suffered relegation after finishing bottom of Division One.

5000|$|In 1976, Kubrick {{sought out}} a film idea that {{concerned}} the Holocaust {{and tried to}} persuade Isaac Bashevis Singer to contribute an original screenplay. Kubrick requested a [...] "dramatic structure that compressed the complex and vast information into {{the story of an}} individual who represented the essence of this man-made hell." [...] However, Singer declined, explaining to Kubrick, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the Holocaust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh! That's easy. The old geezer's {{like his}} orchard--covered with moss. It's plain as the nose on your face, after San Leandro, that he don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing.</b> An' them horses. It'd be a charity to him, an' a savin' {{of money for}} him, to take 'em out an' shoot 'em both. You bet you don't see the Porchugeeze with horses like them. An' it ain't a case of bein' proud, or puttin' on side, to have good horses. It's brass tacks an' business. It pays. That's the game. Old horses eat more in young ones to keep in {{condition}} an' they can't do {{the same amount of}} work. But you bet it costs just as much to shoe them. An' his is scrub on top of it. Every minute he has them horses he's losin' money. You oughta see the way they work an' figure horses in the city." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{death of}} Kurdi and reports {{that his family}} {{had been trying to}} {{ultimately}} reach Canada had an immediate impact on domestic Canadian politics. Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party Stephen Harper cancelled a photo opportunity and addressed the issue in a campaign event. [...] "Yesterday, Laureen and I saw on the Internet, the picture of this young boy, Alan, dead on the beach. Look, I think, our reaction to that, you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that crossed our mind was remembering our son Ben at that age, running around like that" [...] Harper said. Minister of National Defence and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney cancelled an important announcement on Conservative efforts to protect the integrity of Canada’s immigration system and the security of Canada. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander announced he would be temporarily suspending his campaigning in the 2015 Canadian federal election to return to Ottawa to resume his ministerial duties and investigate the case of Alan Kurdi, whose uncle's application for refugee status had been rejected by his ministry.|$|R
50|$|Comedian & Get This co-host Tony Martin {{paid tribute}} to Richard Marsland by saying Richard Marsland was the nicest person I <b>knew.</b> Usually <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he'd say to you was 'sorry', but there's nobody I can think of who had less to be sorry about. In December 2008, Martin and former co-host Ed Kavalee {{released}} a special tribute podcast on Triple M which featured selected clips of Marsland's contributions to Get This. Martin also dedicated his 2009 book A Nest of Occasionals to Richard.|$|R
50|$|Scenario 2: Suppose Gina wasn't as agile {{with the}} hammer and could only make 1 birdhouse an hour, {{but she took}} a sewing class and could print 10 T-shirts an hour.

While Gina would have the absolute advantage in printing shirts, Mike would have an absolute advantage in building birdhouses.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, the March 7 {{issue of}} The Hollywood Reporter {{magazine}} published the ballots of eight different Oscar {{voters in the}} Academy. Of those eight, four voters abstained in the Best Animated Feature category due to inadequate knowledge of the subject. They admitted to not having seen all of the nominations, one person stating “that ended when I was 6.” Such disregard for animated films is often criticized by American animators, who claim that “Hollywood doesn’t care or <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> animated films.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Tom Brokaw {{devoted a}} chapter to Margaret Ringenberg {{in his book}} The Greatest Generation.

I don’t <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> airplanes’ and that’s where I found my challenge. I never intended to solo or be a pilot.

50|$|<b>Know</b> that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that corrects you {{and helps}} you correct others is renouncing this world. For {{renunciation}} is attained by realisation, and consideration is attained by reflection. For {{if you think}} of this world, you will not find it worth sacrificing your soul and faith for it. But you will find your soul worthier of honour by ridiculing this world. This world is abhorred of God almighty and the messengers. It is an abode of afflication and a station of foolishness. Be on your guard from it.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1985 {{article in}} Sea Technology, Massa shared {{that in the}} {{beginning}} of his career, he was assigned, against his wishes, as a production manager. “I didn’t <b>know</b> then <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> about production and there I was in charge of it,” he said. But his feelings toward the role quickly changed. “Those were the best years I ever spent, because I got to work with a dozen highly skilled production engineers who taught me the importance of being able to produce transducers as well as invent them.” ...|$|R
