5|$|The film began full {{production}} in 2002. While most projects of its type took 18–24 months to complete, the development team completed {{the film in}} 13months. The project's budget was later estimated as being between $3.5 to $5million. In addition to Creative Capers, Taiwanese studio CGCG created most of the animation: at the time, overseas outsourcing was a rarity for CGI movies. By the end of production, the film ran to 77minutes of raw footage. At this stage, 310 Studios {{was brought in to}} handle post production, which mostly entailed cutting the film's length down by 7minutes. According to 310 Studios president Billy Jones, the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this was deciding which pieces needed to be cut, as they were impressed with everything that had been produced. 310 Studios also created the opening title and ending credit sequences. Lego also partnered with Miramax to distribute the film, along with developing a future full feature-length theatrical film.|$|E
25|$|On 21 June 2007, the European Council {{of heads}} of states or governments met in Brussels to agree upon the {{foundation}} of a new treaty to replace the rejected Constitution. The meeting took place under the German Presidency of the EU, with Chancellor Angela Merkel leading the negotiations as President-in-Office of the European Council. After dealing with other issues, such as deciding on the accession of Cyprus and Malta to the Eurozone, negotiations on the Treaty took over and lasted until the morning of 23 June 2007. The <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the negotiations was reported to be Poland's insistence on square root voting in the Council of Ministers.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} cloning a {{particular}} farm animal using SCNT is relatively {{the same for}} all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.|$|E

25|$|The {{onset of}} the {{southwest}} monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May, but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular. The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46°C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51°C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993, when the mercury {{was reported to have}} risen to 54°C. In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season, referred to as barsat, which brings relief in its wake. The <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October.|$|E
25|$|After another league title, {{this time}} with Beitar Jerusalem in 1996-97, Zohar was sold to English club Crystal Palace for £1,200,000 but quickly {{returned}} to Israel after failing to make an impression at the club. In a league match against Southampton, Zohar stepped up to take a penalty kick in place of regular penalty kick taker, Bruce Dyer. His weakly hit shot cost Palace the win and so his reputation with the supporters was forever tainted. His dismal performances for Palace caused him to be voted by the fans {{as one of the}} top ten worst signings. In April 2012 Talk Sport magazine rated Zohar as Crystal Palace's Worst Foreign player. After returning from England, he was signed by Maccabi Haifa, as a replacement for Ukrainian midfielder Serhiy Kandaurov, who was sold to Portugal's Benfica. Haifa manager, Daniel Brailovsky was disappointed with Zohar's performances during practices and decided to let him languish on the bench during the season. After a falling out with Brailovsky, Zohar joined Maccabi Tel Aviv for his third stint but suffered an injury that saw him off the pitch for about 10 months. In retrospect, he later credited this injury to be the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his footballing career.|$|E
500|$|... "Fearful Symmetry" [...] {{takes its}} title from {{a line in}} the William Blake poem [...] "The Tyger". Filming for the episode faced several hurdles. Live {{elephants}} and tigers were used. Co-Producer J.P. Finn claimed that the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> filming the episode was getting an elephant. The biggest hurdle when filming scenes with the tiger were keeping it [...] "calm and warm", due to the cool nature of Vancouver. Due to anti-exploitation laws, several scenes had to be filmed in the country.|$|E

500|$|FLCLs {{localization}} {{director and}} script writer Marc Handler stated that localization {{of the script}} was the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the show. The in-jokes in the show included obscure pop culture references {{that had to be}} decoded and transferred to English audiences. One example was a reference to Cheerio, a discontinued soft drink in Japan, for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink at the time, Crystal Pepsi. Director Kazuya Tsuramaki responded to criticism of FLCL, stating [...] "comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fearful Symmetry" [...] {{was written}} by Steve De Jarnatt and {{directed}} by James Whitmore, Jr. Co-Producer J.P. Finn claimed that the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> filming the episode was getting an elephant; this action required a permit for the animal to pass the border into Vancouver. Finn later revealed that the elephant used for the episode, named [...] "Bubbles", was fantastic to work with. There was initially concern from the producers that the elephant would not run towards the truck for the episode's teaser. Instead, however, the elephant thoroughly enjoyed the truck and the producers had difficulty getting the creature away from it.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the original cartoon series, the developers gathered ideas from several sources for inspiration, including The Legend of Zelda action-adventure game series, and books such as T. H. White's The Book of Merlyn and fables from Medieval poet Marie de France. They noted that the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> development was coming up with puzzles {{for each of the}} regions, as they had to be [...] "fun and challenging, but not repetitive". While they tried to maintain a balance between action and puzzles, they noted that they focused more on the puzzle aspect of the game. Favorite parts of the game for the developers include the dragon battles, the boss Blackwing and Morgana's Warlords.|$|E
500|$|Carter later {{noted that}} the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> [...] "First Person Shooter" [...] was casting a {{suitable}} actress for the part of Maitreya. Casting director Rick Millikan looked into every possible avenue—including strippers, porn stars, and erotic thriller/direct-to-video actresses—before settling upon Krista Allen for the role. Initially, there was a [...] "wholesome quality" [...] that bothered Carter, but as the episode was being filmed, both Carter and Millikan recognized that Allen was right for the part. In addition to the part of Maitreya, several stuntmen were needed for the episode, including doubles for Mulder and Maitreya for their martial art fight scene. Experienced gymnast Dana Heath was hired for several scenes that required Maitreya to execute a series of handstands. Fourteen stuntmen were needed to ride Kawasaki 600s and fire gas-powered machine-guns.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the book was {{finished}} in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy [...] "chewing [...] way through the editing, {{which has been a}} surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around." [...] The <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. [...] "However, as most any writer will tell you, just because you spent ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to keep it in the final manuscript. The only question that matters is whether the scene contributes to the book as a whole," [...] he said. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Alfred A.

500|$|The {{music for}} Sonic the Hedgehog was {{composed}} by Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura {{stated that he}} was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack for Sonic the Hedgehog, as he had just started with Dreams Come True. He {{wanted to do it}} because Sega said the game was going to be better than Mario, and was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. He adapted the Genesis' sound chip, and believed the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it [...] "impossible". Nakamura wrote the soundtrack concurrently with [...] "Million Kisses", a studio album for Dreams Come True.|$|E

He considers himself to be a [...] "very intuitive composer", in that he has [...] "something in my mind’s ear that I want to achieve" [...] and improvises until the music he is creating matches up with it. He finds that the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> composing for a project is finding the basic concept for the music that he wants to use, rather than composing any of the individual pieces. Although he has written a concerto, Schyman does not regularly compose [...] "art music" [...] pieces, as he finds his commercial work to be [...] "satisfying music from a creative standpoint".|$|E
500|$|The Cambridge studio {{decided it}} would not be {{difficult}} to make a sequel to the first MediEvil, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period.

Shepherd considered the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the development was deciding how to make the game better than its predecessor through making certain aspects of the game humorous. To achieve this end, the Cambridge studio recoded a lot of core technology, which Shepherd considered was arguably similar to [...] "starting from scratch". Various features cut from the previous game were added into MediEvil 2, such as playable characters and levels that featured puzzles. By the time the game reached beta status the game offered larger levels, improved NPC logic, and more moves for the protagonist.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{after the}} success of the first MediEvil, Sony {{requested}} that SCE Cambridge develop a sequel that would be released {{before the end of the}} PlayStation's lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was not involved in development thus the project was handed over to James Shepherd. SCE Cambridge decided it would not be difficult to make a sequel to the first MediEvil, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period. Shepherd settled on MediEvil 2 being set in the Victorian era, the centrepiece of the Neo-Gothic revival.

500|$|The {{event was}} contested in Hyde Park in Central London, a park opened in 1637. The [...] swim {{started on the}} north side of The Serpentine and the course was just one lap. One of the female competitors, Laura Bennett, said that the swim was the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the course after {{competing}} in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course: “The swim was the most difficult, it was hard to get away from everyone.” After the swim there was then a [...] transition zone in front of the main grandstand. The competitors then started a [...] bike leg consisting of seven [...] laps. The cyclists first rode down Serpentine Road towards West Carriage Drive before changing direction and cycling to Hyde Park Corner. The course then quickly turned left towards Hyde Park to go past Buckingham Palace on Constitution Hill. Once passing Buckingham Palace, the cyclist turned and went back towards Hyde Park and eventually crossing through the transition area before starting the next lap. The final discipline was the run. It was four-laps of a [...] loop around The Serpentine on flat ground.|$|E
500|$|Lindblom {{found his}} task of {{translating}} an [...] "outsider's {{view of the}} U.S." [...] for an American audience the <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the localization. Nintendo did not want a direct translation, but a more American version of the script. He recalled that he was given latitude to make the script [...] "as weird as [...] wanted" [...] but also sought to stay true to the original text's translation, though he never communicated with Shigesato Itoi (the game's creator) directly. Lindblom's own humor and office in-jokes worked {{their way into the}} script alongside cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and This Is Spinal Tap. Outside the game's script, Lindblom's in-game text includes the item and weapon names as well as the combat prompts. His writing contains multiple Easter eggs, such as in some of the character's names. One character is named for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. After taking the day off for her birthday, Lindblom recalled working for the next 30 days straight, without weekends off. He remembered the workload as large, and recalled [...] "grinding-out" [...] for about 14 hours a day. The localization process took four months.|$|E
