6000|$|... 'What do you mean? What <b>has</b> <b>happened?</b> Something <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to you. What <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> at home? What are {{you going}} to do?' she said sharply. She palpitated with terror. For the first time she felt powerless. Siegmund was beyond her grasp. She was afraid of him. He had shaken away her hold over him.|$|R

5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the attack on}} Seward, Booth had mortally wounded Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. Atzerodt, however, {{decided not to go}} through with the attack on Johnson. When Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and Navy Secretary Gideon Welles hurried to Seward's home to find out what <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> they found blood everywhere.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and heard what <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the crowd, {{as he did}} {{not explain}} what <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> and the people feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo. The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened {{to say that the}} claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.|$|E
5|$|Burnham's {{youngest}} son, Bruce B. Burnham (1897 – October 3, 1905), {{was staying}} with his parents in London when he accidentally drowned in the River Thames. His brother, Roderick, was in California the night Bruce died, yet claimed to know from a dream exactly what <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Roderick awoke screaming and rushed to tell his grandmother about his nightmare.

6000|$|Morley trembled; {{and then}} in a hurried and {{agitated}} voice, said, [...] "No, no, no; nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened.</b> Much may <b>happen,</b> but nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened.</b> And we may prevent it." ...|$|R

6000|$|What {{might not}} <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>had</b> men but tried to copy their Father in heaven? What <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> is but too well known, since, in July 1498, Columbus, coming hither, fancied (and not so wrongly) {{that he had}} come to the 'base of the Earthly Paradise.' ...|$|R
5|$|During the pre-dawn {{coup and}} {{throughout}} the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life as though nothing <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Many appeared unaware that a coup had occurred {{while they were still}} sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} months, {{he sold his}} home in Poway, California, moving to Pasadena. Though he often stayed with friends, some of his {{longtime}} friends felt that he died in seclusion, embarrassed by what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> with his life. In November 1990, Wiggins was hospitalized with pneumonia and tuberculosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. After lapsing {{in and out of}} consciousness for a month, he died at the hospital on January 6, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in Hook Court?" [...] Miss Demolines {{threw herself}} back into an arm-chair, closed her eyes, and clasped both her hands upon her forehead. [...] "What <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in Hook Court?" [...] said Johnny, {{walking up to}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{longing for}} you so," [...] she said. [...] "As you say, {{something}} <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> {{and there is}} no one to whom I can tell my troubles. What I feared <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> for this morning Geoffrey Ormond asked me to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it be {{anything}} that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> at Mowbray, {{especially in this}} quarter, I should think I had. Times must be very bad indeed that some one does not drop in to tell me anything that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> and to ask my advice." ...|$|R
5|$|Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, {{was able}} to {{negotiate}} a buy-out of the band from Reprise. The band would keep {{the rights to the}} album if they paid Reprise $50,000. Before Wilco could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free. Despite Reprise's efforts to accommodate Wilco's departure, the process marred public relations after an article in the Chicago Tribune described what <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
5|$|Margaret recovers {{and returns}} home, telling nobody about what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> at the Mill, mainly {{to protect the}} health of her mother. When Thornton proposes to her the next day, she scorns him, {{thinking}} he believes himself superior because {{of the difference in}} their financial circumstances. He denies this and tells her that he is in love with her, but she insists that her actions were not personal.|$|E
5|$|One of the accused, Demdike, {{had been}} {{regarded}} {{in the area}} as a witch for fifty years, {{and some of the}} deaths the witches were accused of <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> many years before Roger Nowell started to take an interest in 1612. The event that seems to have triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{interesting}} to know what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to the world. [...] . This green vapor--queer stuff. But I know what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to me. It's Conversion. I've always known. [...] . But this is being a fool. Talk! I'm going to stop it." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{disgusted by}} his behavior, Elinor agrees {{to pretend that}} nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> {{to the rest of}} the family.

5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Rookwood, Tresham and Digby {{coincided with a}} series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out. Fawkes would light the fuse, and escape by boat across the Thames. An uprising would start in the Midlands, during which Princess Elizabeth was to be captured. Fawkes would escape to the continent and explain to the Catholic powers what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> in England.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself). While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
