40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICT) are driving the modern innovation process. To better understand these dynamics, the current dissertation analyses {{the interactions between}} innovation and competition. The scope of this work {{can be divided into}} two areas: The first one deals with a question of how markets could be organized to produce the most optimal outcome. The second one analyses the feedback effects of innovative activity on competition and the organisation of economic activity. Regarding the impact of competition on innovation, an empirical analysis reveals that ICT- driven innovations dominate in concentrated industries, whereas innovations based on other technologies flourish in moderately competitive markets. This suggests that there are some features that make ICT-enabled innovations exceptional, compared to innovations based on other technologies. Concerning the impact of innovation, two findings <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>emphasising.</b> First, as shown in a theoretical analysis, although profitable from an individual producer¿s perspective, the adoption of a technology increasing product variety across the entire industry erodes firms¿ payoffs. In addition, firms'' decisions with respect to the technology adoption are not always efficient from the social welfare point of view. Second, another empirical analysis included in this work reveals that ICT leads to more competition and facilitates the emergence of hybrid organization forms, subject to firm''s and industry''s characteristics. Although this dissertation reveals only a small piece of the complexity of the ICT-driven innovation process, it casts some new light on the importance of market structure for ICT- enabled innovation and the feedback effect of the technology on firms¿ environment. Interestingly, the outcomes of this thesis show that these interactions are often far from straightforward and in many cases counterintuitive. JRC. DDG. J. 4 -Information Societ...|$|R

40|$|In many {{scientific}} applications, it {{is important}} to investigate how certain properties scale with the parameters of the systems. The experimental studies of scalings have traditionally been addressed with log regression, which limits the results to power laws and to theoretical and not data-driven dimensionless quantities. This has also been the case in nuclear fusion, in which the scaling of the energy confinement time is a crucial aspect in understanding the physics of transport and in the design of future devices. Traditionally two main assumptions are at the basis of the most widely accepted empirical scaling laws for the confinement time: (a) the dimensionless variables used are the ones derived from the symmetries of the Vlasov equation; (b) the final scalings have the mathematical form of power laws. In this paper, it is shown how symbolic regression (SR), implemented with genetic programming (GP) techniques, can be used to test these hypotheses. Neither assumption is confirmed by the available data of the multi-machine International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) of validated tokamak discharges. The statistically soundest expressions are not power laws and cannot be formulated in terms of the traditional dimensionless quantities. The consequences of the data-driven scaling laws obtained are both practical and theoretical: the confinement time for the ITER can be significantly shorter than foreseen by power laws and different dimensionless variables should be considered for theoretical investigations. On the other hand, higher quality databases should be built to reduce the uncertainties in the extrapolations. It <b>is</b> also <b>worth</b> <b>emphasising</b> that the proposed methodology is fully general and therefore can be applied to any field of science...|$|R
40|$|For some nurses {{caring for}} {{patients}} {{at the end of}} life, euthanasia is a difficult topic to consider objectively. It is also characterised by moral debates and strong emotional responses. The study by Eliott et al suggests that, whatever our views, patients are acutely aware of the extent of their own (and others’) suffering and can locate euthanasia within a larger moral view of what is best for them and society more generally. The importance of choice is emphasised and seems to be a central consideration when people are faced with suffering and impending death. However, ‘‘choice’’ is not as simple as it might first appear—it is subject to the moral judgements of others, and in this context, the choice to die has significant moral connotations that are sidelined by the emphasis on autonomy. It <b>is</b> also <b>worth</b> <b>emphasising</b> that those who are very ill possess, or may seek, the power to make choices about their daily routine or how they want to spend their remaining time.

Those who feel abandoned within their suffering may view euthanasia as a more attractive option than those who enjoy ‘‘a good death. ’’ 2 Nurses caring for dying patients—whether from cancer or other conditions—may witness a patient’s attempt to retain their fighting spirit and sense of self despite the limitations of illness.

40|$|Purpose – In {{the present}} paper the {{influence}} of magnetization patterns of the rotor magnets on the performance characteristics for surface permanent magnet (SPM) motor is investigated. The objective is {{to show how the}} electromagnetic and electromechanical characteristics of this type of motor can be significantly changed by applying various magnetization patterns of permanent magnets placed on the rotor surface. Design/methodology/approach – At the beginning a survey of possible and most frequently used magnetization patterns for permanent magnet motors is presented. The research is focussed on the comparison of performance characteristics and is developed into three levels. It is started with a conventional SPM motor having segmented permanent magnets, and two magnetization patterns are considered: parallel and radial. Showing no significant difference of the motor performance at parallel and radial magnetization, for further investigation only radial magnetization, being more conventional, is considered. In the second step, the counterparts of SPM with two Halbach array configurations, under the constraint of fixed magnet volume, are studied. Finally, detailed comparative analyses of SPM at radial, Halbach 1 and Halbach 2 magnet patterns are presented. Advantages and drawbacks for suggested magnet configurations are discussed. Findings – It is presented how the magnetization pattern of the rotor permanent magnets can have a substantial impact on the SPM motor performance characteristics. From the analysis of magnetic field properties at various types of magnetization, it is observed that both shape and rates of the characteristics, for radial magnetization and Halbach 2 configuration, exhibit similar features. It {{is due to the fact}} that Halbach 2 array cancels magnetic flux above the permanent magnets, i. e. strengthens the magnetic field in the rotor, and enhances the coupling between the rotor and stator magnetic field. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> to <b>emphasise,</b> that due to less saturation of the magnetic core and lower iron loss at Halbach 1 and Halbach 2 magnetization, it is possible to increase armature current and consequently to increase the electromagnetic torque. This fact could be interesting for further research. Originality/value – The paper presents an original comparative analysis for performance characteristics of a surface permanent motor at various magnetization patterns. The novelty of the paper is seen in the introduction of two Halbach magnetization array for permanent magnets and improvement of the performance characteristics for the analysed motor.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the growth of {{population}} and the inevitable push towards better living conditions which must involve a growing demand for industrial materials, there seems little justification for fears of scarcities of materials, apart of course from the temporary scarcities and temporary high prices which are due to fluctuations in supply and demand. These temporary scarcities are particularly likely in primary producing industries such as the copper industry, where a miscalculation of demand leads to a temporary shortage because of the long gestation period of investment. But this is a very different situation from the long-run scarcities which are sometimes portrayed. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>emphasising</b> this since mistaken ideas about the future scarcity of natural materials can damage the developing countries which are heavily dependent on natural materials. They are made to believe that the long-term supply prospects for natural materials are poor, and that therefore there must be an overhasty development of synthetic materials.

These effects are geometrical in origin being a consequence of refraction by large-scale random variations in refractive index. Fluctuations of this kind may be caused by density variations within a propagation medium, such as the atmosphere, or by roughness of the interface between media having differing dielectric constants. Although significant dispersion may also be observed (as for example {{in the case of the}} colourful twinkling of a star low down in the sky) for the most part they are white light optical effects that are independent of wavelength within the visible spectrum. With the advent of the laser a new range of coherent light scattering phenomena became visible to the naked eye. In particular, the random interference effect that has come to be known as laser speckle commonly occurs in laboratory laser light scattering experiments [2].

The identification of structural shocks is based on sign restrictions. We identify four structural shocks: a labour supply, an aggregate supply, an aggregate demand and a monetary policy shock. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>emphasising</b> that a negative labour supply shock cannot be distinguished from minimum wage hikes in this model. Impulse response analysis shows that after an aggregate supply shock, real wages react more persistently and {{to a greater extent than}} prices.

Unlike in estimated DSGE models for Hungary, we found a positive response of employment with respect to monetary policy shock. All impulse responses are estimated to be less persistent than in the SVAR model estimated using eurozone data pointing to a more flexible Hungarian economy. Our impulse responses are closer to the DSGE model of Jakab and Vil 1 gi (2008) and Baksa, Benk and Jakab (2009) than to the model of Jakab and K 3 nya (2009) which describes a relatively rigid labour market.

Over the 7 -year period, 205, 466 women were started on bisphosphonates, with 716 women sustaining a subtrochanteric/femoral shaft fracture (411 and 305 women, respectively). They suggested that long-term bisphosphonate treatment (> 5  years) was associated with higher risk of subtrochanteric/femoral shaft fracture compared with transient use (< 100  days) of bisphosphonates (adjusted OR 2.74; 95  % CI 1.25 – 6.02). Interestingly, shorter durations (> 100  days– 5  years) were not shown to be associated with an increased risk. The authors were also able to assess the validity of their study design by investigating the effect of long-term bisphosphonate use on femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures. Indeed, the study confirmed the well-documented effect of bisphosphonates on these types of fractures, as it demonstrated their protective effect (adjusted OR 0.76; 95  %CI 0.63 – 0.93). Despite the statistical significance achieved in the study, it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>emphasising</b> the small absolute risk of subtrochanteric/femoral shaft fractures detected, as among 52, 595 women on a minimum of 5  years on bisphosphonates, a fracture was seen in only 188 women.

The study outcome was reached by confirming the absence of trauma and radiological identification of the fracture site.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the many}} things we like about this paper is that it forces us to change our {{perspective}} on Metropolis-Hastings. We may {{not the only ones}} with the toy example of a bivariate, strongly correlated, Gaussian distribution imprinted in our brain. This example explains well why taking correlations into account is important. However, one often forgets that, contrary to the Gaussian example, the curvature of the log target density may be far from constant, which justifies a local calibration of HM strategies. The authors give compelling evidence that local calibration may lead to strong improvements in large-dimensional problems. There are two ways to understand these results. One of them, put forward in this paper, stems from the information geometry perspective: the parameter space is endowed with a metric defined by G(θ), which turns the posterior dis-tribution into a density over a manifold. The general MMALA algorithm based on a diffusion over that manifold is a beautiful mathematical device, but it is not immediately apparent how this leads to improved (relative) MCMC perfor-mance. A different viewpoint proceeds from optimisation: MMALA performs better because it uses a better local model of the posterior density. As often pointed out, the Langevin proposal is a noisy version of a gradi-ent ascent step. Similarly, the simplified MMALA step is a noisy version of a (quasi-) Newton step, in which the Hessian is replaced with the Fisher infor-mation matrix, an idea known as Iteratively Reweighted Least-Squares in the literature on Generalised Linear Models.

The last trick <b>is</b> always <b>worth</b> an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 11, tens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 10, kings <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four, queens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> three, jacks <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> two, and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero.|$|R
