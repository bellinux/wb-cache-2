Conventional single <b>flame</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis and, for the first time, double <b>flame</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis are compared for the synthesis of alumina supported cobalt catalysts. In the latter process the metal oxide precursors are combusted individually in two opposing nozzles. The key parameter for defining the final material composition is the intersection distance of the flames, which was systematically varied. The Fischer-Tropsch performance of the Co-based catalysts was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 230 C and 20 bar. The catalytic results are discussed o n the basis of structural characterization of the different catalysts by XRD, BET, TPR, UV-vis and TEM/EF-TEM.
