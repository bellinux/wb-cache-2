5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> achievement.|$|E

5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Stoke sub Hamdon Priory is {{a complex}} of {{buildings}} and ruins which initially formed a 14th-century college for the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, and later {{was the site of}} a farm in Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, England.

5|$|The Kuiper belt <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ring {{of debris}} {{similar to the}} {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice.

There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
