The water has been bottled on an industrial scale under the Schweppes brand from 1850 until 2010, and is still bottled by a family-owned company since 2009 as Holywell Malvern Spring Water. In 2012 the Holywell Water Co Ltd was granted permission to use the world-famous [...] "Malvern" [...] name in its branding, thus becoming Holywell Malvern Spring Water. It has been drunk by several British monarchs. Elizabeth I drank it in public in the 16th century; Queen Victoria refused to travel without it.|$|R
5000|$|Bottling and {{shipping}} of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95 hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800 houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.Queen Adelaide visited St. Ann's Well in September 1842. [...] "Throughout the 1840s and 1850s Malvern attracted a stream of celebrated visitors, including royalty." [...] Patients included Charles Darwin, Catherine, wife of Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Lord Lytton, who was an outspoken protagonist, Lord Tennyson and Samuel Wilberforce. The <b>hydrotherapists</b> came under heavy criticism from Sir Charles Hastings (a founder of the British Medical Association) and other physicians.|$|R

5000|$|Darwin kept {{records of}} the effects of the {{continuing}} water treatment at home, and in 1852 stopped the regime, having found that it was of some help with relaxation but overall had no significant effect, indicating that it served only to decrease his psychosomatic symptomatology. In 1855 Darwin wrote to a friend that [...] "Dr. Gully did me much good", but he did not want to return to Malvern. When his illness returned much as when he had first seen Gully he found a new <b>hydrotherapist,</b> Dr. Lane, whose more relaxed regime did not include clairvoyance, mesmerism or homeopathy. After a similarly speedy recovery Darwin became a complete convert. In 1863 his illness worsened seriously at a time when Lane was not available, and Emma Darwin persuaded her husband to return to Gully. His cousin Fox had told him that Gully had suffered a mental breakdown and was unavailable. In his reply Darwin had mentioned having had eczema, and wrote [...] "Gully will be a great loss & I hardly know whom to consult there. I must be under some experienced man, for I could not stand much hard treatment." [...] They arrived at Malvern on 2 September, but Darwin felt that he was being fobbed off with the supervising physician, Dr. Ayerst. Emma arranged for Dr. Gully to attend and endorse Ayerst's treatment, but by then the eczema was too raw to bear any water. Darwin had a complete breakdown, and on 13 October left the spa worse than when he'd arrived. His serious illness continued until the spring of 1866.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{memories}} of Annie's death, Darwin {{did not want to}} return to Malvern. In 1856, he began writing for publication of his theory, and he pressed on, overworking, until by March 1857 illness was cutting his working day [...] "ridiculously short". He found a new <b>hydrotherapist,</b> Dr. Edward Wickstead Lane, whose Moor Park hydropathic establishment near Farnham in Surrey was only 40 miles from Darwin's home. His condition was much as when Darwin had first seen Gully, and Dr. Lane later wrote, [...] "I cannot recall any case where the pain was as poignant as his. When the worst attacks were on, he seemed crushed with agony." [...] Darwin arrived on 22 April and wrote to Fox that [...] "it is really quite astonishing & utterly unaccountable the good this one week has done me", deciding to stay on to 5 May. He enjoyed the more relaxed regime, which did not include clairvoyance, mesmerism or homeopathy, as Lane did [...] "not believe in all the rubbish which Dr G. does." [...] Darwin became a complete convert, [...] "well convinced that the only thing for Chronic cases is the water-cure", and wrote, [...] "I really think I shall make a point of coming here for a fortnight occasionally, as the country is very pleasant for walking." [...] He told Hooker he had [...] "already received an amount of good, which is quite incredible to myself & quite unaccountable.—I can walk & eat like a hearty Christian; & even my nights are good.—I cannot in the least understand how hydropathy can act as it certainly does on me. It dulls one's brain splendidly, I have not thought about a single species of any kind, since leaving home." [...] He then contradicted himself by asking about alpine species.|$|E
40|$|Objective Aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} changes of quality of life (QoL) and complaints of patients with post-polio-syndrome (PPS) under a self-administered cold water hydrotherapy over a period of 8 weeks. Method This is a randomised, controlled, clinical pilot-study in a waiting group design over 4 weeks with a follow-up of 8 weeks. Complaints and QoL were examined at the time of inclusion into the study, at the end of the waiting period and after 4 and 8 weeks of hydrotherapy. After completion of the individual study period patients evaluated tolerability and practicability of the different types of cold water administrations. After inclusion into the study, patients were randomised either to an immediate treatment group (SBG) or a waiting group (WG). The waiting group began with hydrotherapy after a waiting period of 4 weeks. Immediately before starting the individual study period all patients were trained by a qualified <b>hydrotherapist</b> in performing the hydrotherapeutical measures, enabling them to treat themselves independently at home. Primary outcome parameters were the changes of the psychic and physical sum-scores of SF- 36 after a 4 -week hydrotherapy treatment compared to the waiting group. Secondary outcome parameters were the subscales of SF- 36, MFI- 20 and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. Statistical evaluation was done after 4 and 8 weeks in both groups. Changes of temperature sensitivity was descriptively documented along the results of the rating scale, the physical examination at the end of study and the free notes. Among the secondary outcome parameters the VAS-pain score for back pain and tender joints in the SBG showed a tendency of improvement, in the WG pain became worse (back pain SBG: from 55 ± 23 to 46 ± 23 mm (p= 0, 063), WG: from 41 ± 28 to 48 ± 29 mm; tender joints of originally affected extremities SBG: from 40 ± 28 to 32 ± 26 mm (p= 0, 064), WG: from 34 ± 30 to 39 ± 29 mm). The subscales of MFI- 20 did not show any difference over time in both groups. After 8 weeks of hydrotherapy changes were more accentuated in both groups (SBG: n= 17, WG: n= 10). The SBG showed a still non-significant improvement of the physical sum score of the SF- 36 (from 25, 1 ± 9, 3 to 27, 7 ± 8, 9; p= 0, 069), the waiting group a significant improvement of the psychic sum score of SF- 36 (from 52, 4 ± 7, 9 to 58, 7 ± 6, 5; p= 0, 038). The subscale of SF- 36 „physical pain“ improved significantly in the SBG from 37, 4 ± 11, 4 to 45, 1 ± 14, 8 (p= 0, 016). The VAS-scores for back pain improved significantly in both groups (WG: p= 0, 02, SBG: p= 0, 03). The results concerning blood circulation of the extremities and sensitivity to cold temperature were not conclusive. The temperature rating scale showed no improvement of intolerance to cold temperature or for the presence of cold extremities. The patients rated the tolerability and practicability of the hydrotherapy treatment mostly as good or very good. Results: Out of 42 patients, who were enrolled into the study (male n= 12, female n= 30, average age 59, 8 +/- 7, 2), 39 fulfilled either four weeks of hydrotherapy or waiting period. 27 patients finished the whole study as per protocol. An ambulant self-administration of at least two cold hydrotherapeutic treatments per day over 4 weeks in 21 patients with post-polio-syndrome did not improve the primary outcome parameters, the physical and psychic QoL in comparison to a waiting group (n= 21). (Physical sum-score before and after 4 weeks of hydrotherapy or waiting period: SBG before: 26, 5 +/- 10, 6, after: 26, 4 +/- 11, 2, WG before: 26, 6 +/- 9, 6, after: 25, 8 +/- 10, 3, psycic sum-score: SBG before: 56, 1 +/- 8, 3, after: 57, 4 +/- 8, 2, WG before: 51, 5 +/- 10, 5, after: 51, 7 +/- 10, 3). Out of the secondary outcome parameters the VAS-score for backpain and tender joints showed a tendency of improvement in the therapy group, in der Wartegruppe nahmen die Schmerzen zu (Rückenschmerzen SBG von 55 +/- 23 auf 46 +/- 23 mm (p= 0, 063), WG von 41 +/- 28 auf 48 +/- 29 mm; Gelenkschmerzen in den ursprünglich betroffenen Extremitäten SBG von 40 +/- 28 auf 32 +/- 26 mm (p= 0, 064), WG von 34 +/- 30 auf 39 +/- 29 mm). Conclusion This pilot study did not show a significant improvement of post-polio patients QoL by Kneipp hydrotherapy over 4 weeks, measured with the sum scores of the SF- 36. After 8 weeks of treatment there might be an improvement of pain. A self-administered ambulant treatment after qualified training showed to be practicable and tolerable. Further studies should examine whether hydrotherapy with cold water can improve post-polio patient`s back pain and tender joints to a clinical relevant degree...|$|E
