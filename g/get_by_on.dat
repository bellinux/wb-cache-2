They could {{not rely on}} any form of foreign support and had to <b>get</b> <b>by</b> <b>on</b> the funds that Mohammad Amin al-Husayni could raise.

To make things even worse, {{they had to be}} content with arms bought on the black market or pillaged from British warehouses, and, as a result, did not really have enough arms to wage war.|$|E

Lanford was nominally located in Fulton County, but other on-air references over the years suggest the town is {{in the vicinity of}} Aurora, Elgin, and DeKalb, which are much closer to Chicago. The family consisted of outspoken Roseanne, married to husband Dan, and their three children: Becky, Darlene, and DJ. Later in the series, Roseanne becomes pregnant again and gives birth to a boy named Jerry Garcia Conner.|$|E

500|$|Derek Elley of Variety found The Hurt Locker to be [...] "gripping" [...] as {{a thriller}} but {{felt that the}} film was {{weakened}} by, [...] "its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology." [...] Elley wrote that it was unclear {{to know where the}} drama lay: [...] "These guys <b>get</b> <b>by</b> <b>on</b> old-fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware—but it's not a pure men-under-stress drama either." [...] The critic also felt that the script showed [...] "signs of artificially straining for character depth." [...] Anne Thompson, also writing for Variety, believed The Hurt Locker to be a contender for Best Picture, particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War, which had performed poorly.|$|E
500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for [...] "Start Over" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] saying that they [...] "just don't seem to be listening to themselves, and will <b>get</b> <b>by</b> <b>on</b> listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity {{to try something new}} in some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hush" [...] {{was highly}} praised when it aired, {{not only for}} its riskiness in {{presenting}} viewers with extended silence, but for the frightening qualities of The Gentlemen. Robert Bianco from USA Today comments, [...] "(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues {{to find new ways to}} make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he's a TV treasure." [...] In the Ottawa Citizen, Chuck Barney writes, [...] "I wondered if this enormously entertaining cult favourite would lose some starch once our favourite little slayer moved on to college. But happily, it continues to win us over with the way it deftly bounces between the genres of comedy, horror and romance. The recent silent episode (Hush) was brilliant." [...] Alan Sepinwall in The Star-Ledger calls it a [...] "magnificently daring episode", explaining [...] "(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when Buffy has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to <b>get</b> <b>by</b> <b>on</b> the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to get around that, with several cast members—particularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow—proving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians." ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can <b>get</b> <b>by</b> <b>on</b> a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|In 1847-48, {{his family}} {{spent some time}} in London with relatives, while his father stayed in Russia. Whistler's {{brother-in-law}} Francis Haden, a physician who was also an artist, spurred his interest in art and photography. Haden took Whistler to visit collectors and to lectures, and gave him a watercolor set with instruction. Whistler already was imagining an art career. He began to collect books on art and he studied other artists' techniques. When his portrait was painted by Sir William Boxall in 1848, the young Whistler exclaimed that the portrait was [...] "very much like me and a very fine picture. [...] Mr. Boxall is a beautiful colourist…It is a beautiful creamy surface, and looks so rich." [...] In his blossoming enthusiasm for art, at fifteen, he informed his father by letter of his future direction, [...] "I hope, dear father, you will not object to my choice." [...] His father, however, died from cholera at the age of forty-nine, and the Whistler family moved back to his mother's hometown of Pomfret, Connecticut.
