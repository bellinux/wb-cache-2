However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers make a statewide election campaign impractical for me at this time.|$|E

He was appointed as Director of Naval Intelligence in November 1902, an apt posting for a man whom First Lord of the Admiralty the Earl of Selborne described as [...] "the cleverest sailor <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> yet".|$|E

500|$|In August 1942, Mahatma Gandhi's Quit India Movement {{resulted}} in civil disobedience spreading across Bihar, Orissa and Bengal. The division was deployed throughout these areas, suppressing the disturbances {{and protecting the}} railways of Bihar. After civil power was restored in the affected areas, the 70th Division was concentrated again at Ranchi and resumed training as part of XV Indian Corps. The corps commander, Lieutenant-General William Slim, wrote in his memoirs that the 70th Division [...] "was {{one of the best}} British formations <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met,</b> with a magnificent battle hardened spirit gained in the Middle East".|$|E
500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book [...] "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and [...] "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy." [...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!" [...] Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, [...] "I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written {{from the point of view}} of my mind, not the mind of a child." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone {{were the}} first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson {{did not appear to be}} in pain, and instead lay {{watching}} the leg shake. Huskisson shouted [...] "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied [...] "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his coat over William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from its hinges, to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, shaking his head and saying [...] "Where is Mrs Huskisson? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> my death, God forgive me." [...] (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as [...] "This is my death, God forgive me".) ...|$|E

500|$|After Gilbert's retirement, {{and even}} {{following}} his death, controversy remained {{attached to his}} name; {{there seemed to be}} a conspiracy of silence surrounding his fate. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400pages; in his Cricketers <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Met,</b> Grace described 121cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came in the pages of Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have [...] "Mr." [...] before his name in the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] section, he was referred to until his death as [...] "Gilbert, W. R.", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title [...] "Mr. W. R. Gilbert", even though the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] still listed him as a professional, and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in [...] "Births and Deaths", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: [...] "At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada." [...] Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: [...] "Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion to me that if this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now." [...] It is not clear who made this suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: [...] "No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ford's poem Antwerp (1915) {{was praised}} by T.S. Eliot as [...] "the only good poem <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> {{with on the}} subject of the war".|$|E
2500|$|British {{journalist}} Malcolm Muggeridge (who went hopefully {{to live in}} the New Civilization in 1932, {{but soon}} became disillusioned) said of Duranty that he [...] "always enjoyed his company; there was something vigorous, vivacious, preposterous, about his unscrupulousness which made his persistent lying somehow absorbing." [...] Muggeridge characterised Duranty as [...] "the greatest liar of any journalist <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> in 50 years of journalism." [...] Others have characterized Duranty as [...] "the number one Useful Idiot for Lenin first, and later for Stalin." ...|$|E

Everyone counter-rucks {{nowadays}} and, if anything, I was in the wrong place. He just hit me and I was unlucky. So I was surprised to see he got banned. I know we didn't cite him so I don't know why the independent commissioner did. It was just a fair ruck from a hard player. When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> him before he seems like a tidy enough bloke so I'm not seeing it as anything malicious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reid took an {{aggressive}} approach to defending his government's international policy. Speaking {{ahead of a}} conference on NATO modernisation in Germany on 4 February 2006, Reid asserted in a press interview that [...] "no institution has the divine right to exist". Similarly on 19 March 2006, in response to former interim Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi's claim that Iraq is {{in the grip of}} civil war, Reid defended the British Government's contrary view. He stated: [...] "Every single politician <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> here [...] from the prime minister to the president, the defence minister and indeed Iyad Allawi himself said to me there's an increase in the sectarian killing, but there's not a civil war and we will not allow a civil war to develop".|$|E
2500|$|Quinn {{played in}} one Test {{of the series}} at home against England in 1930–31, the drawn [...] at Durban which was {{dominated}} by the English bowlers, and then toured to Australia and New Zealand in 1931–32, also finishing second in the tourists' bowling averages, this time behind Sandy Bell. He dismissed Donald Bradman for only 2 in the [...] in Melbourne, [...] that Bradman was out for less than 100 in that series. Bradman wrote later: [...] "In the First Test, Neville Quinn ... had me sorely puzzled, and I was missed off him twice in my innings, {{then went on to}} make 226 ... Quinn worried me more than any of their bowlers, and appeared to come off the pitch faster than any medium fast bowler <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> in this country {{with the possible exception of}} Maurice Tate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Armenian {{national}} movement, {{also known}} as the [...] "Armenian revolutionary movement", was the Armenian national effort to re-establish an Armenian state in the historic Armenian homelands of eastern Asia Minor and the Transcaucasus. The decline of the Ottoman Empire in part was the result and in part the cause of rise of nationalism among various groups that made up the multi-ethnic and multi-religion Empire. The Russo-Turkish War, which resulted in the independence of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, provided a model for other aspiring nationalists and revolutionaries. The Hinchak and Dashnak, Armenian revolutionary committees, were formed in Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire following the Berlin Treaty, which were very much under direct Russian threat. Yet, this is contrasted by Fâ'iz el-Ghusein, who stated, [...] "I have enquired of many Armenians whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met,</b> but I have not found one who said that he desired political independence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{families}} of prisoners, {{the staff of}} closed and censored publications, the victims of eviction and confiscation — none were ever turned away. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> influential [...] "civil society" [...] Palestinians alive today who were protected as students when Israel was a professor of chemistry at the Hebrew University; from him they learned never to generalize about Jews. And they respected him, not just for his consistent stand against discrimination, but also because — he never condescended to them. He detested nationalism and religion, and {{made no secret of}} his contempt for the grasping Arafat entourage. But, as he once put it to me, [...] "I will now only meet with Palestinian spokesmen when we are out of the country. I have some severe criticisms to present to them. But I cannot do this while they are living under occupation, and I can 'visit' them as a privileged citizen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In one {{edition of}} The Mark Thomas Comedy Product, Mark Thomas {{investigated}} {{the practice of}} avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Soames was claiming tax relief on a [...] "three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports" [...] on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a 'National Soames Day' on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law. In 2015, Thomas told The Independents Adam Jacques: [...] "I {{try to find the}} good in my enemies. It's not unusual {{to be able to get}} on with people despite what they are doing being awful. The only person <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> who I considered to be without any redeeming features was [...] Nicholas Soames. [...] He was such a pantomime baddie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told you, didn't <b>I,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> Mr. Courage in town?" [...] she remarked, looking up. [...] "After all, {{it is such}} a small world, isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he asked}} me if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen its Chief, a certain Umslopogaas or Bulalio. I answered, Yes, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> him there {{for the first time and}} thought him a very {{remarkable}} man.|$|R

2500|$|We cannot {{precisely}} {{ascertain the}} time when tithes were first introduced into this country. [...] Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, {{about the end of}} the fifth century. [...] But the first mention of them, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{describing}} himself, he said, [...] "I am {{not sure}} that I exist, actually. I am all the writers that I have read, all the people that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met,</b> all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors." [...] As a young man, he visited the frontier pampas which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him [...] "to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan," [...] in the way of Henry and William James. Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and Death and the Compass. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes to be [...] "the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bennett {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{academics}} who have attended conferences sponsored by the Unification movement and worked for its US based seminary, which has employed and continues to employ non-Unification faculty. Attendance at Unification sponsored meetings has taken Bennett as far a field as San Francisco for the Second Assembly of the World's Religions ( [...] 15 to 21 August 1990), Istanbul for a Christian-Muslim colloquium (September 1991), Berlin for a conference on religious freedom ( [...] 29–31 May 1998 [...] ), Israel (December 2003) and South Korea on several occasions. At times he has been accompanied by his wife or son. [...] He has consistently expressed the view that religious freedom is indivisible and that unless proven guilty of breaches in law, Unificationists and their founder have an absolute right to practice their religion. He has argued that working with the movement no more implies agreement with their beliefs than his work with Roman Catholics implies that he agrees with theirs. Bennett writes that '‘as a life long participant in Christian-Muslim dialogue, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>met</b> through Rev. Moon's movement some of the most influential Muslim thinkers in the world. [...] This is because Rev. Moon has funded inter-religious dialogue when most church bodies concerned with inter-religious relations remain strapped for cash." ...|$|E
