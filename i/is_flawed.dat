5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations <b>is</b> <b>flawed.</b> HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E
5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind <b>is</b> <b>flawed.</b> The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E

50|$|Chilling Effects {{estimates}} that OSPs remove allegedly offending content even though approximately 60% of all takedown notices <b>are</b> <b>flawed.</b> Notices can <b>be</b> <b>flawed</b> in several ways. Many fail {{to follow the}} requirements of the statute. Others ask for material to be taken down for reasons such as trademark infringement and defamation that are unrelated to copyright infringement.|$|R
25|$|Post-Enlightenment {{ideologies}} such as fascism, nazism, and neo-fundamentalism oppose democracy {{on different}} grounds, generally citing {{that the concept}} of democracy as a constant process <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> and detrimental to a preferable course of development.|$|E
25|$|Still others {{assert that}} the {{conflation}} of promoting civil society and promoting democracy in development rhetoric <b>is</b> <b>flawed.</b> Whereas civil society is a tool for developing democracy, it is not democracy itself and indeed does not always result in democratic behavior or values.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Nolte {{hinted at}} the {{possibility}} that the Holocaust had never happened at all. Nolte claimed that the Wannsee Conference never took place, and argued that most Holocaust scholarship <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> because most Holocaust historians are Jewish, and thus “biased” against Germany and in favour of the idea that there was a Holocaust.|$|E

25|$|The BBC {{was criticized}} for irresponsible journalism, but the {{producers}} of the segment defended the BBC, stating that the report was a light-hearted look at a mathematical problem aimed at a mainstream, regional audience for BBC South Today rather than at a global audience of mathematicians. The BBC later posted a follow-up giving Anderson's response to many claims that the theory <b>is</b> <b>flawed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Joseph Levine's paper Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap {{takes up}} where the criticisms of conceivability arguments, such as the {{inverted}} spectrum argument and the zombie argument, leave off. Levine agrees that conceivability <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> {{as a means of}} establishing metaphysical realities, but points out that even if we come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical, there is still an explanatory problem.|$|E
25|$|You {{have also}} broken your word to your {{followers}} {{who signed the}} petitions that got you {{on the ballot in}} many states. You pledged you would not campaign as a spoiler and would avoid the swing states. Your recent campaign rhetoric and campaign schedule make it clear that you have broken this pledge... Please accept that I, and {{the overwhelming majority of the}} environmental movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy <b>is</b> <b>flawed,</b> dangerous and reckless.|$|E

25|$|Jonathon Porritt's {{call for}} the Green Party to select a single leader <b>is</b> <b>flawed.</b> Rather than {{suggesting}} the Green Party becomes a little more like the conventional top down political parties, Jonathon could show a little more personal leadership. Last year he took 42 flight clocking up air miles to go to meetings to tell people to cut CO2. I am calling on Jonathon to use video conferencing a little more and to fly a little less.|$|E
25|$|Other saga {{material}} {{provides an}} alternative description. In the Eyrbyggja saga {{the same story}} of a great expedition to punish unruly Vikings who were raiding Norway is undertaken, but here it is Ketil flatnefr (Ketil Flatnose) who leads it. Although this is apparently done at Harald's behest, Ketil then claims the islands as his own. Once again, the chronology <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> by Harald's inclusion in the tale as other information provided about Ketil gives him a floruit of the mid, rather than late, 9th century.|$|E
25|$|The breaststroke, backstroke, {{and front}} crawl {{can all be}} swum easily even if the swimmer's {{technique}} <b>is</b> <b>flawed.</b> The butterfly, however, is unforgiving of mistakes in style; {{it is very difficult}} to overcome a poor butterfly technique with brute strength. Many swimmers and coaches consider it the most difficult swimming style. The main difficulty for beginners is the synchronous over-water recovery, especially when combined with breathing, since both arms, the head, shoulders and part of the chest have to be lifted out of the water for these tasks. Once efficient technique has been developed, it becomes a smooth, fast stroke.|$|E
50|$|Humanities scholar Camille Paglia {{also criticized}} the book, arguing that Wolf's {{historical}} research and analysis <b>was</b> <b>flawed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hyman {{wrote the}} autoganzfeld {{experiments}} <b>were</b> <b>flawed</b> {{because they did}} not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.|$|R

25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E
25|$|Although Arrow's theorem is a {{mathematical}} result, {{it is often}} expressed in a non-mathematical way with a statement such as no voting method is fair, every ranked voting method <b>is</b> <b>flawed,</b> or the only voting method that isn't flawed is a dictatorship. These statements are simplifications of Arrow's result which are not universally considered to be true. What Arrow's theorem does state is that a deterministic preferential voting mechanism—that is, one where a preference order is the only information in a vote, and any possible set of votes gives a unique result—cannot comply {{with all of the}} conditions given above simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Freegans' {{rejection}} of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste, estimated as up to 40% {{of the food}} supply in the United States and other Western countries. For many, statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12% of global cropland and 23% of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed—serve as justification for a complete {{rejection of}} the capitalist food system. Moreover, the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows, according to some freegans, that the vegan theory of social change <b>is</b> <b>flawed,</b> because markets do not efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production.|$|E

25|$|According to the Russian {{demographic}} publication Demoscope, {{the rising}} male death rate was a long-term trend from 1960 to 2005. The only significant reversion {{of the trend}} was caused by Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, but its effect was only temporary. According to the publication, the sharp rise of death rates in the early 1990s {{was caused by the}} exhaustion of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign, while the market reforms were only of secondary importance. The authors also claimed the Lancet's study <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> because it used the 1985 death rate as the base, while that was in fact the very maximum of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with general}} {{information}} on life for young men, Leykis's 101 advice mostly consists of his principles of {{looking out for}} oneself. He argues that {{the institution of marriage}} <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> and that family court systems are often corrupt because DNA testing after childbirth is not mandatory to prevent paternity fraud, and because courts have forced men to pay child support even after DNA testing has established that a man was not actually a child's father. Other examples of Leykis 101 guidelines include never dating single mothers or co-workers; never cohabiting with a woman; using birth control during each sexual encounter; and immediately ending a relationship if a woman issues an ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|With their rollercoaster finally finished, Phineas and Ferb unveil it {{to their}} entire {{neighborhood}} in a glamor-filled light show with notable guests being Isabella, Ginger, and Katie. They all rocket off on the rollercoaster, which spirals around buildings and swoops through parking lots. Doofenshmirtz, meanwhile, reveals that he is using the tin foil to cover the eastern seaboard, then using a magnet to pull it, thereby reversing the Earth's rotation. Perry fights him, but Doofenshmirtz manages to get the magnet activating. However, Doofenshmirtz soon learns that his plan <b>is</b> <b>flawed</b> because the magnet has only taken the tin foil off the eastern seaboard, forming it into a 2-ton giant ball. Seeing that it's heading forward, Doofenshmirtz decides to separate the magnet from his machine to stop it, and Perry is forced to help him out.|$|E

50|$|Shimizu professes {{that the}} DNA testing methods {{used in the}} Ashikaga case <b>were</b> <b>flawed,</b> and that arresting the {{perpetrator}} would require the prosecutor's office to acknowledge this. However, the same testing methods were also used in the Iizuka case, in which the alleged culprit was executed in 2008 despite requests for new DNA tests and a retrial, and acknowledging that the testing methods <b>were</b> <b>flawed</b> {{would lead to a}} massive scandal around that case.|$|R
