40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{alternative}} fabrication method based on polymeric materials and technologies for three-axis thermal accelerometers. The device is composed by four microinjected parts forming an external structure {{responsible for the}} coupling and sealing of a polymeric membrane. The membrane contains and protects the heater and thermoresistors and is fabricated by microtechnologies. The fabrication process was successful although some issues were noticed in the mould during the microinjection process. Regarding the ejection side, a redesign was done to first assure the locking of the micro-parts on the movable side of the mould and second to improve the extraction of the parts avoiding its deformation. Overheating of the mould and polymer freezing on the <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle</b> were the main issues found on the injection side of the mould.

50|$|The OM 138 has one {{cylinder}} head {{for all four}} cylinders. The main part are the precombustion chambers. They are located in a 45° angle above the combustion chamber {{and placed in a}} bulge in the {{cylinder head}}. Like other early OM diesel engines, the OM 138 has a sieve for fuel spraying purposes between the main combustion chamber and precombustion chamber. The <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles</b> inject fuel into the precombustion chambers, they are mounted on the cylinder head and can be maintained with ease.

The speed controllers are driven by the camshaft of the injection pump. The idle speed controller does affect the idle and redline speed only, while the all-speed controller affects every rotation speed. For fuel filtering a paper filter is used.|$|E

50|$|Preconcentrated {{waste acid}} from the preconcentrator (III / IV) is {{injected}} into the reactor (I) by means {{of one or more}} spray booms (VIII) bearing one or more <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles</b> each. Injection takes place at reactor top at a pressure between 4 and 10 bar. The reactor is directly fired by tangentially mounted burners that create a hot swirl. Temperatures inside the reactor vary between 700 °C (burner level) and 370 °C (roast gas exit duct).In the reactor the conversion of droplets of preconcentrated waste acid into iron oxide powder and hydrogen chloride gas takes place. Hydrogen Chloride leaves the reactor through the top, while iron oxide powder is removed from the reactor bottom by means of mechanical extraction devices.

50|$|On 18 November 2015, Autoblog {{reported}} that a VW fix for the affected 1.6 diesel engine is under review by the KBA. On 25 November 2015, VW said the fix involves a minor hardware modification to the car's air intake system, alongside a software update. This low-cost solution contradicted earlier speculation regarding the possible fitting of new <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles</b> and catalytic converters. VW also said that its affected 1.2 liter and 2.0 liter diesel engines only need a software update. The fixes have {{been approved by the}} KBA, with the first recalls likely to begin in January 2016. According to VW, the measures aim to achieve legal EU emissions compliance without impairing engine output, fuel consumption, or performance. The simple fixes with inexpensive parts and software are now possible but were not available when the engines were developed, because engine technology understanding and intake flow simulation capabilities have matured in the interim time, allowing for a better understanding and options for addressing the burning of Diesel and air mixtures via intake flow shaping.|$|E
