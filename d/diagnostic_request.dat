40|$|Novel {{respiratory}} viruses {{have been}} identified as possible agents of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Multiplex real-time PCRs have been developed to identify clinically relevant respiratory pathogens. In this study, 178 respiratory samples already screened for influenza virus types A and B by Flu A/B ASR real-time PCR kit were retrospectively analyzed with the Respiratory Multi Well System (MWS) r-gene™ real-time PCR kit which detects a wide spectrum of respiratory pathogens. The goal was to demonstrate the importance of a wide spectrum screening compared to a single <b>diagnostic</b> <b>request.</b> The Flu A/B ASR kit detected influenza B virus in 1. 7 % of the samples (3 / 178) and no influenza A virus. The MWS r-gene™ kit detected influenza virus in 6. 7 % (12 / 178) of samples (0. 6 % influenza A, and 6. 2 % influenza B), while the overall detection rate for respiratory pathogens was 54 % (96 / 178). Co-infections were detected in 8 / 178 (4. 5 %) samples. Adenovirus was the infectious agent detected most frequently, followed by respiratory syncytial virus. The risk of being infected by respiratory syncytial virus is almost threefold higher in patients older than 65 years compared to the younger age group (OR: 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 6. 2). Wide spectrum screening of respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR is an effective means of detecting clinically relevant viral pathogens...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{may cause}} prolonged hospital admissions with high treatment costs. The burden of ADRs in children {{has never been}} evaluated in Nigeria. The incidence of pediatric ADRs and the estimated cost of treatment over an 18 -month period were determined in this study. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study on children admitted to the pediatric wards of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in Nigeria, between July 2006 and December 2007. METHODS: Each patient was assessed for ADRs throughout admission. Medical and non-medical costs {{to the hospital and}} patient were estimated for each ADR by reviewing the medical and pharmacy bills, medical charts and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>request</b> forms and by interviewing the parents. Cost estimates were performed in 2007 naira (Nigeria currency) from the perspectives of the hospital (government), service users (patients) and society (bearers of the total costs attributable to treating ADRs). The total estimated cost was expressed in 2007 United States dollars (USD). RESULTS: Two thousand and four children were admitted during the study; 12 (0. 6 %) were admitted because of ADRs and 23 (1. 2 %) developed ADR(s) during admission. Forty ADRs were suspected in these 35 patients and involved 53 medicines. Antibiotics (50 %) were the most suspected medicines. Approximately 1. 83 million naira (USD 15, 466. 60) was expended to manage all the patients admitted due to ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: Treating pediatric ADRs was very expensive. Pediatric drug use policies in Nigeria need to be reviewed so as to discourage self-medication, polypharmacy prescription and sales of prescription medicines without prescription...|$|E
40|$|Toscana virus (Phlebovirus genus, Bunyaviridae family) is a {{neurotropic}} virus which circulates in the Mediterranean Basin.

Thus, the objective of this study was to analyse the prevalence of antibodies anti-Toscana virus in the human population in our country. Sero-epidemiological investigations were performed with indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. The study population consisted of a control population (blood donors, n= 150), a population considered at risk (n= 236) and a population of individuals with symptoms and laboratory <b>diagnostic</b> <b>request</b> for vector-borne viruses. The latter population was divided into two groups: those individuals with neurological symptoms (n= 165) and those without neurological symptoms (n= 373). We tested sera from a total of 924 individuals. The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies in the control population was 2 %. In the population considered at risk, the prevalence was 3. 4 %. In the population with central nervous system disease, we detected a seroprevalence of 4. 2 %. For the same type of antibodies and in subjects without central nervous system disease, the prevalence was 1. 3 %. Five cases of recent infection (3 %) were detected in the population with neurological signs. Those infections have been acquired in the districts of Faro, Coimbra, Aveiro and Lisbon. The associated clinical diagnoses were meningitis, meningoencephalitis and rash. The observed seroprevalences were, in general, lower than reported in other endemic countries. Only 5 of the 29 sera which gave positive results by IFA and ELISA were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization tests with the Italian strain ISS. Phl. 3.

40|$|Background: In a {{large part}} of the {{developing}} world, limited infectious disease surveillance is performed. In laboratory information management systems data on <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests</b> is available and may be amenable to trend analyses. We explored this potential, using DENV <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests</b> as a model. Method: Test results and anonymised information provided by clinicians were received for 8942 patients from diagnostic centres in the Netherlands from January 2000 to May 2011. The data were evaluated for completeness of a predefined minimal dataset and trends in DENV positive results by travel destination. Population travel data were obtained from a commercial registry, and dengue case notification data by country from WHO DengueNet. Results: Vaccination history was rarely reported (0. 4 %); travel destination was completed for 42 % of requests; trends in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests</b> and IgM positive tests for this subset correlated to the WHO DENV notifications for the three main travel destinations, with some discrepancies. Additionally, this approach may provide information on disease outbreaks with other pathogens causing diseases clinically similar to DENV. PCR data proved to be insufficient for trend monitoring by country. Conclusion: This approach is not straightforward, but shows potential for use as a source of additional information for surveillance of disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|Background: Arboviruses have {{overlapping}} geographical distributions and {{can cause}} symptoms that coincide with more common infections. Therefore, arbovirus infections are often neglected by travel diagnostics. Here, we assessed the potential of syndrome-based approaches for diagnosis and surveillance of neglected arboviral diseases in returning travelers. Method: To map the patients high at risk of missed clinical arboviral infections we compared the quantity of all arboviral <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests</b> by physicians in the Netherlands, from 2009 through 2013, with a literature-based assessment of the travelers’ likely exposure to an arbovirus. Results: 2153 patients, with travel and clinical history were evaluated. The diagnostic assay for dengue virus (DENV) was the most commonly requested (86 %). Of travelers returning from Southeast Asia with symptoms compatible with chikungunya virus (CHIKV), only 55 % were tested. For travelers in Europe, arbovirus <b>diagnostics</b> were rarely <b>requested.</b> Over all, <b>diagnostics</b> for most arboviruses were requested only on severe clinical presentation. Conclusion: Travel destination and syndrome were used inconsistently for triage of diagnostics, likely resulting in vast under-diagnosis of arboviral infections of public health significance.

40|$|Wireless vehicle {{diagnostics}} {{is expected}} to provide great improvements {{to the maintenance of}} future cars. By using certificates, vehicles can identify diagnostics equipment for a diagnostics session, even over long distances. However, since the diagnostics equipment contains authentication keys used to authenticate such sessions, it is critical that neither the keys nor the equipment is lost. Such a loss can give unauthorised access to any vehicle accepting these keys until the theft is detected and the certificates are revoked. In this paper, we propose a method to protect vehicles against unauthorised diagnostics sessions. A trusted third party is introduced to authorise sessions, thus we do not rely solely on proper identification and authentication of diagnostics equipment. Our approach enables vehicles to verify the validity of <b>diagnostics</b> <b>requests.</b> It is transparent to the diagnostics protocol being used, supports different levels of trust, and can control what commands are permitted during diagnostics sessions...|$|R

40|$|Coordinated {{experimental}} {{design and implementation}} has become a cornerstone of global climate modelling. So-called Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) enable systematic and robust analysis of results across many models to identify common signals and understand model similarities and differences without being hindered by ad-hoc differences in model set-up or experimental boundary conditions. The activity known as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has thus grown significantly in scope and as it enters its 6 th phase, CMIP 6, the design and documentation of individual simulations has been devolved to individual climate science communities. The Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C 4 MIP) takes responsibility for design, documentation and analysis of carbon cycle feedbacks and interactions in climate simulations. These feedbacks are potentially large and play a leading order contribution in determining the atmospheric composition in response to human emissions of CO 2 and {{in the setting of}} emissions targets to stabilise climate or avoid dangerous climate change. For over a decade C 4 MIP has coordinated coupled climate-carbon cycle simulations and in this paper we describe the C 4 MIP simulations that will be formally part of CMIP 6. While the climate-carbon cycle community has formed this {{experimental design}} the simulations also fit into the wider CMIP activity and conform to some common standards such as documentation and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests</b> and are designed to complement the CMIP core experiments known as the DECK. C 4 MIP has 3 key strands of scientific motivation and the requested simulations are designed to satisfy their needs: (1) pre-industrial and historical simulations (formally part of the common set of CMIP 6 experiments) to enable model evaluation; (2) idealised coupled and partially-coupled simulations with 1 % per year increases in CO 2 to enable diagnosis of feedback strength and its components; (3) future scenario simulations to project how the Earth System will respond over the 21 st century and beyond to anthropogenic activity. This paper documents in detail these simulations, explains their rationale and planned analysis, and describes how to set-up and run the simulations. Particular attention is paid to boundary conditions and input data required, and also the output <b>diagnostics</b> <b>requested.</b> It is important that modelling groups participating in C 4 MIP adhere as closely as possible to this experimental design...|$|R

40|$|Leptospirosis and {{haemorrhagic}} fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) {{are hard to}} distinguish clinically since these two important rodent-borne zoonoses share hallmark symptoms such as renal failure and haemorrhage. Leptospirosis is caused by infection with a spirochete while HFRS {{is the result of}} an infection with certain hantaviruses. Both diseases are relatively rare in the Netherlands. Increased incidence of HFRS has been observed since 2007 in countries that border the Netherlands. Since a similar rise in incidence has not been registered in the Netherlands, we hypothesise that due to overlapping clinical manifestations, hantavirus infections may be confused with leptospirosis, leading to underdiagnosis. Therefore, we tested a cohort of non-travelling Dutch patients with symptoms compatible with leptospirosis, but with a negative diagnosis, during 2010 and from April to November 2011. Sera were screened with pan-hantavirus IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Sera with IgM reactivity were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). ELISA (IgM positive) and IFA results were confirmed using focus reduction neutralisation tests (FRNTs). We found hantavirus-specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies in 4. 3 % (11 / 255) of samples taken in 2010 and in 4. 1 % (6 / 146) of the samples during the 2011 period.

Results: In total 1028 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median LOS at the ED was 243 minutes (range: 21 - 728). Patients admitted to the neurology department had a significant shorter LOS at the ED. Factors significantly associated with a longer LOS at the ED were daytime arrival at the ED, a low triage urgency, more specialists involved, more <b>diagnostics</b> <b>requested</b> and a long time between request and execution of admission. Patients had a shorter LOS when arriving at the ED in the evening or night, high urgency at triage, less specialists involved and less diagnostic tests were performed.

To ensure secure communications {{with each other and}} to prevent mistakes due to communication error, protocol tests are performed at the physical and data link layer level.

Modern control units have this diagnostic capabilities to detect this communication error among others. This data is provided for a guided troubleshooting the vehicle via a defined interface. In this communication test detection mechanisms are specifically stimulated and read afterwards.

40|$|Purpose: Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) is an ‘on-line’ evidencebased {{decision}} support tool ([URL] {{that was developed}} at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) to facilitate appropriate <b>diagnostic</b> imaging <b>requesting</b> behaviour amongst clinicians. This study aims to evaluate compliance of <b>diagnostic</b> imaging <b>requests</b> to recommendations outlined in DIP and reasons for non-compliance. Methods and materials: Retrospective audits, followed by intervention and re-audits were {{carried out in the}} Emergency Department (ED). Pathways targeted were: ‘Suspected Pulmonary Embolism’, ‘Ankle Injury’ ‘Suspected Renal Colic’ and ‘Non Traumatic Acute Abdominal Pain’. Interventions included: regular reminders to staff to refer to DIP, education on DIP recommendations, introduction of request forms detailing “proof” of adherence to pathways, and refusal of inappropriate examinations. Results: In the initial audits (N  658), 285 (43 %) received imaging of doubtful appropriateness whilst 158 (24 %) received examinations without indications. Follow-up audits demonstrate only partial improvements in compliance. Requesters failed to follow recommendations for many reasons including: insufficient time to learn about recommendations; disbelief in their validity; failure to understand the importance of adhering to recommendations. Requesters may provide inaccurate pre-requisite information or ‘pressurise’ providers to accept a request without pre-requisites. Providers fail in their ‘gatekeeper’ function because of insufficient time to deliver education, difficulty obtaining pre-requisite information, and reluctance to resist a demand. Conclusion: Targeted interventions were only partially successful in eliminating non-compliance with evidence-based pathways (DIP) amongst clinicians in this study. Future investigations should examine the extent to which information-communication technology linked to electronic ordering of imaging can suppress inappropriate practice...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{training}} programme {{has been proposed}} for general practitioners (GPs) to perform ultrasound in primary care. This has generated considerable concern among radiologists as to the adequacy and appropriateness of such training. AIM: To assess the current provision of ultrasound services to primary care in the former Northern health region of England, the level of interest among GPs in undertaking recommended training, and the willingness or ability of radiology departments to provide it. METHOD: Postal questionnaires were sent to GPs (n = 334), their practice managers (n = 281) and all clinical directors/heads of radiology departments (n = 19) in the region. RESULTS: Altogether, 67 % of GPs, 59 % of practice managers, and 68 % of radiologists returned questionnaires. Overall, 48 % of GPs have open access to obstetric/gynaecological ultrasound compared with 77 % for general <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests.</b> A total of 73 % of GPs would prefer an open access service and 15 % a practice-based service. Some 48 % of GPs were not interested, 36 % moderately interested, and 16 % very interested in participating in the {{training programme}}. Only two out of 13 radiology, departments were willing to provide such training. CONCLUSION: Despite recommendations from the Royal College of General Practitioners, around half the respondents in this survey do not have direct access to ultrasound for obstetric referrals, and a quarter for non-obstetric referrals. Interest shown by GPs in a primary care-led service is not mirrored by their radiology colleagues.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} impact of {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) on the cost of the tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Study Design: Prevalence based cohort Place and Duration of Study: Penang General Hospital, Hospital USM, and– Univesiti Malaya Medical Center; 2005 – 2008. Methods: Study patients were placed in the TB only, DM only, or DM-TB groups,with each group including 200 patients. Information related to demographics, chronic disease comorbidity, duration of hypertension (HTN) and DM, and economic variables were obtained from the patients’ medical files both {{at the beginning and end}} of the study period. The economic burden of DM-TB patients was assessed from hospitalization periods, frequency of clinic visits, and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>requests.</b> Results: Durations of DM and HTN were 9. 2 and 5. 6 years, respectively, for the DMonly group compared to 5. 3 and 1. 1 years, respectively, for DM-TB subjects. For both diabetic groups, diabetes preceded HTN, with onset of HTN occurring approximately 4 years after patients were diagnosed diabetic. Approximately 86 % of DM only subjects suffered additional comorbidity, and 44. 5 % had three or more coexisting chronic diseases compared to 56 % and 11. 4 %, respectively, in the DM-TB group. The hospitalization period was 10. 2 days for the DM-TB group compared to 7 and 4 days for the TB only and DM only groups, respectively; however, 43 % of TB only subjects needed surgical intervention compared to 17 % in the DM-TB group. The total cost wasRM 4530 (US$ 1234. 3) for the DM-TB group compared to RM 3082. 8 (US$ 840) and RM 6945. 26 (US$ 1892. 40) for theTB only and DM only groups, respectively. Conclusions: DM antedated HTN in our patients. Durations of both DM and HTNwere longer for the DM only group. The number of diagnosed chronic diseases and overall treatment cost was higher in the DM-TB group compared to TB only group, but lower compared to the DM only group. The TB only group required the most surgical intervention...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} system that generates {{explanations}} and tutorial problems from the probabilistic information contained in Bayesian belief networks. BANTER is a tool for high-level interaction with any Bayesian network whose nodes can be classified as hypotheses, observations, and diagnostic procedures. Users need no knowledge of Bayesian networks, only familiarity with the particular domain and an elementary understanding of probability. Users can query the knowledge base, identify optimal <b>diagnostic</b> procedures, and <b>request</b> explanations. We describe BANTER's algorithms and illustrate its application to an existing medical model...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: When {{managing}} a new neurologic deficit after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), the surgeon is often preoccupied with determining {{the cause of}} the problem, <b>requesting</b> <b>diagnostics</b> tests, and deciding whether the patient should be surgically reexplored. The goal {{of this study was to}} analyze a series of perioperative neurologic events and to determine if careful analysis of their timing and mechanisms can predict which cases are likely to improve with reoperation. METHODS: A review of 2024 CEAs performed from 1985 to 1997 revealed 38 patients who manifested a neurologic deficit in the perioperative period (1. 9...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Standardization is {{very much}} the trend in the {{development}} of automotive electronics. The use of open architectures and configurable components are intended to let developers focus more on the innovative and differentiating aspects of the development process. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) has the stated goal of standardizing a common open automotive software architecture. It is a standard platform for vehicle software. The components in AUTOSAR are hardware independent. The diagnostic stack in AUTOSAR consists of three modules: DCM, DEM and FIM. The DCM (Diagnostic Communication Manager) implements the diagnostic communication per ISO 14229 - 1. This paper focuses on the design and development of the DCM module for AUTOSAR 4. 0. The Diagnostic Communication Manager (DCM) provides a common API for diagnostic services in the AUTOSAR-Basic Software. DCM checks if the <b>diagnostic</b> services <b>request</b> is supported and if the service may be executed in the current session according to the diagnostic states...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} goal {{of our work}} described in this paper {{is the development of}} a biologically-inspired cellular fault-tolerant hardware system. The basic structure of the system is a multi-cellular embryonic array that is capable of achieving self-diagnostics, self-repair and fault recovery. The `nucleolus' of the cell is a general purpose function unit comprised of a 2 -to- 1 multiplexer and a Dtype flip-flop. Input and configuration data to the function unit are provided by the DNA segment memory and I/O router. A diagnostic logic monitors the error free operation of the cell. When an error is detected the <b>diagnostic</b> logic <b>requests</b> the reconfiguration unit to kill the cell, transferring its function to a fault-free neighbouring cell. Once permission is granted, the faulty cell is eliminated and becomes transparent. The functionality of each cell will shift in the array until a spare cell is found. Finally the whole embryonic array recovers. Fault-free operation is then continued...|$|R
