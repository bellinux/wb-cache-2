60|$|At {{this part}} of the lake there occurs a deep bay or inlet, to save {{rounding}} which travellers usually strike straight across from point to point, making what is called in voyageur parlance a traverse. These traverses are subjects of considerable anxiety and frequently of delay to travellers, being sometimes of considerable extent, varying from four to five, and in such immense seas as Lake Superior to fourteen miles. With boats, indeed, there is little to fear, as the <b>inland</b> <b>craft</b> of the fur-traders can stand a heavy sea, and often ride out a pretty severe storm; but it is far otherwise with the bark canoes that are often used in travelling. These frail craft can stand very little sea--their frames being made of thin, flat slips of wood and sheets of bark, not {{more than a quarter of}} an inch thick, which are sewed together with the fibrous roots of the pine (called by the natives wattape), and rendered water-tight by means of melted gum. Although light and buoyant, therefore, and extremely useful in a country where portages are numerous, they require very tender usage; and when a traverse has to be made, the guides have always a grave consultation, with some of the most sagacious among the men, as to the probability of the wind rising or falling--consultations which are more or less marked by anxiety and tediousness in proportion to the length of the traverse, the state of the weather, and the courage or timidity of the guides.|$|E

Lecturers of languages for specific purposes, mostly experts in linguistics or literature of a foreign language, are usually faced with professions different from theirs when they start their LSP adventure and are forced to master to a certain extent the profession whose language they intend to teach. Still, keeping abreast with the latest in a profession different from the LSP lecturers 2 ̆ 7 own is a demanding and often hardly feasible task. Maritime English (ME) is used in an environment to which ME lecturers hardly have access, i. e. on board ocean-going and <b>inland</b> <b>craft</b> worldwide. The lecturer has to take a detour, insist on eliciting information from the professionals in the field and keep pace with the actual language requirements to meet. It still remains difficult to find adequate content for LSP purposes as the lecturer feels like a hurdles runner in a different profession field. Students interested in their future profession can often do better in this sense and should be engaged in the creation of course materials and their presentation in class. LSP lecturers should remain in their own field of the (language) coach, while students should actually run their race through the LSP course. Some ideas based in Maritime English are presented as an example of why and how student-created / centred content {{has become one of the}} principal approaches in the teaching / learning of Maritime English at the Faculty of Maritime Studies (FMS) in Split, Croatia and Gdynia Maritime University (GMU) in Gdynia, Poland...|$|E

40|$|Ship {{classification}} {{based on}} construction has traditionally divided boats into two major families: shell-built, {{in which the}} exterior skin of planking or other material is the primary component, and skeleton-built, in which internal framing is dominant. A large number of vessels, largely flat-bottomed and confined to inland and coastal waters, do not fit neatly into either category. They appear to mix both shell and skeleton concepts, or employ methods that {{do not seem to}} be either. These vessels belong in a distinct, third family: bottom-built construction, in which the bottom of the vessel is the primary component. Most of the excavated, northwestern European vessels of the Roman period, which have been previously identified as members of a native "Celtic" tradition, are bottom-built craft. The distinguishing feature of this tradition is a heavy, flat bottom of straight planks, temporarily fastened together as the first stage of construction. After the bottom has been shaped, the temporary fastenings are replaced by heavy floor timbers and the sides completed. In the Middle Ages, this tradition produced cogs, the dominant seagoing ships of the twelfth to through fourteenth centuries, as well as a variety of related <b>inland</b> <b>craft.</b> Careful examination of an early fifteenth-century cog from the reclaimed land of the Zuiderzee, Almere Wijk 13, reveals details of the construction process and structural thought involved in cog construction. Despite the abandonment of lapstrake planking in favor of carvel in the fifteenth century, Dutch shipwrights continued to build even large seagoing ships in a bottom-based manner and were thus able to take quick advantage of the economic benefits of the new technology. A late sixteenth-century ferry from the Zuiderzee, Oost Flevoland B 71, demonstrates the manner in which bottom-based construction was adapted to carvel construction, as well as the limitations it imposed. A brief look at shipbuilding traditions in the New World shows that bottom-based concepts were transported to the English colonies, and that native bottom-based methods may have been merged with European skeleton methods to produce hybrid vessels...|$|E

50|$|A {{waterway}} is any navigable body of water. Broad distinctions {{are useful}} to avoid ambiguity, and disambiguation {{will be of}} varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other languages. A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by <b>inland</b> water <b>craft.</b> Maritime shipping routes cross oceans and seas, and some lakes, where navigability is assumed, and no engineering is required, except to provide the draft for deep-sea shipping to approach seaports (channels), or to provide a short cut across an isthmus; this is the function of ship canals. Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways. There is an exception to this initial distinction, essentially for legal purposes, see under international waters.|$|R
25|$|In 1700 {{the port}} of Nantes {{numbered}} more <b>inland</b> waterway <b>craft</b> than any other port in France, testifying to the historic importance of navigation on France’s longest river. Shallow-draught gabares and other river craft continued to transport goods into the industrial era, including coal from Saint-Étienne loaded on to barges in Orléans. However, the hazardous free-flow navigation and limited tonnages meant that railways rapidly killed off the surviving traffic from the 1850s. In 1894 a company {{was set up to}} promote improvements to the navigation from Nantes to Briare. The works were authorised in 1904 and carried out in two phases from Angers to the limit of tides at Oudon. These works, with groynes and submersible embankments, survive and contribute to the limited navigability under present-day conditions. A dam across the Loire at Saint-Léger-des-Vignes provides navigable conditions to cross from the Canal du Nivernais to the Canal latéral à la Loire.|$|R
50|$|This {{diverse and}} {{scattered}} category is {{highly dependent on}} private individuals. Only canal and <b>inland</b> waterways <b>craft</b> have a degree of structure, largely because of their links with the waterways. Others such as fishing boats, lifeboats and traditional river craft are found all round the UK. In museums smaller vessels are typically overshadowed by larger ones. Steam has a strong following. Most boats are privately owned and the majority are sailable. There are probably about 500 small boats of major historical importance which should be preserved - their interests are managed by a plethora of ‘umbrella’ organisations, to which the National Maritime Museum is attempting to bring a degree of co-ordination. The National Small Boat Register, managed by the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, maintains listings of over 1,200 small craft (under 12m/40 ft) that embrace rarity, historic and cultural value. The Advisory Committee for National Historic Ships maintains a register of larger historic vessels 10.1m/33 ft that have demonstrably strong UK associations.|$|R
40|$|The {{off-highway}} {{sector is}} under increasing pressure to reduce operating costs (including fuel costs) {{and to reduce}} emissions. Recognizing this, the Society of Automotive Engineers and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) convened a workshop in April 2001 (ANL 2001) to (1) determine {{the interest of the}} off-highway sector (consisting of agriculture, construction, surface mining, <b>inland</b> marine) in <b>crafting</b> a shared vision of off-highway, heavy machines of the future and (2) identify critical research and development (R&D) needs for minimizing off-highway vehicle emissions while cost-effectively maintaining or enhancing system performance. The workshop also enabled government and industry participants to exchange information. During the workshop, {{it became clear that the}} challenges facing the heavy, surface-based off-highway sector can be addressed in three major machine categories: (1) engine/aftertreatment and fuels/lubes, (2) machine systems, and (3) thermal management. Working groups convened to address these topical areas. The status of off-highway technologies was determined, critical technical barriers to achieving future emission standards were identified, and strategies and technologies for reducing fuel consumption were discussed. Priority areas for R&D were identified. Given the apparent success of the discussions at the workshop, several participants from industry agreed to help in the formation of a joint industry/government ''roadmap'' team. The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies has an extensive role in researching ways to make heavy-duty trucks and trains more efficient, with respect to both fuel usage and air emissions. The workshop participants felt that a joint industry/government research program that addresses the unique needs of the off-highway sector would complement the current research program for highway vehicles. With industry expertise, in-kind contributions, and federal government funding (coupled with the resources at the DOE's national laboratories), an effective program can be planned and executed. This document outlines potential technology R&D pathways to greatly reduce emissions from the off-highway sector and yet greatly reduce fuel costs cost-effectively and safely. The status of technology, technical targets, barriers, and technical approaches toward R&D are presented. Program schedule and milestones are included...|$|R
