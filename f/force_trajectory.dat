40|$|Continuous {{force output}} {{containing}} numerous intermittent force pulses {{is not completely}} smooth. By characterizing force fluctuation properties and force pulse metrics, this study investigated adaptive changes in trajectory control, both force-generating capacity and force fluctuations, as fatigue progresses. Sixteen healthy subjects (20 - 24 years old) completed rhythmic isometric gripping with the non-dominant hand to volitional failure. Before and immediately following the fatigue intervention, we measured the gripping force to couple a 0. 5 Hz sinusoidal target {{in the range of}} 50 - 100 % maximal voluntary contraction. Dynamic force output was off-line decomposed into 1) an ideal <b>force</b> <b>trajectory</b> spectrally identical to the target rate; and 2) a force pulse trace pertaining to force fluctuations and error-correction attempts. The amplitude of ideal <b>force</b> <b>trajectory</b> regarding to force-generating capacity was more suppressed than that of the force pulse trace with increasing fatigue, which also shifted the force pulse trace to lower frequency bands. Multi-scale entropy analysis revealed that the complexity of the force pulse trace at high time scales increased with fatigue, contrary to the decrease in complexity of the force pulse trace at low time scales. Statistical properties of individual force pulses in the spatial and temporal domains varied with muscular fatigue, concurrent with marked suppression of gamma muscular oscillations (40 - 60 Hz) in the post-fatigue test. In conclusion, this study first reveals that muscular fatigue impairs the amplitude modulation of force pattern generation more than it affects the amplitude responsiveness of fine-tuning a <b>force</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Besides, motor fatigue results disadvantageously in enhancement of motor noises, simplification of short-term force-tuning strategy, and slow responsiveness to force errors, pertaining to dimensional changes in force fluctuations, scaling properties of force pulse, and muscular oscillation...|$|E

40|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about {{the response of the}} climate system to future <b>trajectories</b> of radiative <b>forcing.</b> To quantify this uncertainty we conducted face-to-face interviews with 14 leading climate scientists, using formal methods of expert elicitation.

All experts ranked “cloud radiative feedbacks” as contributing most to their {{uncertainty about}} future global mean temperature change, irrespective of the specified level of radiative forcing. The experts disagreed about the relative contribution of other physical processes to their uncertainty about future temperature change. For a <b>forcing</b> <b>trajectory</b> that stabilized at 7  Wm- 2 in 2200, 13 of the 14 experts judged the probability that the climate system would undergo, or be irrevocably committed to, a “basic state change” as ≥ 0. 5.

Springback, the elastic material recovery when the tooling is removed, is the major cause of variations and inconsistencies in the final part geometry.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the contact}} force {{control of a}} {{constrained}} one-link flexible arm is fully investigated using a linear distributed parameter model including the internal damping of Kelvin-Voight type. To overcome the inherent limitations caused by the non-minimum phase nature of the noncollocation of the joint torque input and the contact force output, a minimum phase transfer function is deduced by using the feedback and the output redefinition. A PD controller is then designed to accomplish the regulation of the contact force. Therefore, asymptotic tracking of a desired contact <b>force</b> <b>trajectory</b> with internal stability can be achieved. With the infinite product of transcendental functions, exact solutions of the noncollocated infinite-dimensional closed-loop force control system can be obtained {{so that it is}} free from spillover problems with stability robustness to parameter uncertainties.

At present, there are many intelligent algorithms for global optimization, such as the genetic algorithm [24], particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony algorithm.

It has been widely used in wavelet network optimization [25], impeller parameter optimization, stretch <b>force</b> <b>trajectory</b> optimization, and in other practical engineering problems. Therefore, this paper also selects it as the solver. However, when an optimization problem {{needs to be resolved}} rapidly and accurately, such as parameter estimation of the fault-related components, PSO becomes powerless. Therefore, a joint optimization algorithm, combining a modified bare-bones particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and trust region (TR), is proposed subsequently to improve the solution precision and convergence speed. The distinctive advantage of this detection method is that more accurate parameters of the fault-related components are estimated, even using a short-time data window.|$|E
