5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given {{in his testimony}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, and consequently {{increase the risk of}} a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised {{to build up the}} church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E

5|$|In {{the ninth}} century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of non{{metabolic}} real presence. During {{the high and}} late Middle Ages, the metabolic view became increasingly dominant {{to the exclusion of}} the nonmetabolic view, {{to the point that it}} was considered the only orthodox option. The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the audience {{does not need to}} see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

50|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure on companies {{to respond to}} environmental pressure from stakeholders, therefore increasing the use of voluntary environmental regulations such as certification to achieve sufficient social legitimacy and to protect their profits. This is a relational motivation as the company feels that environmentally conscious management will help to prevent stakeholder pressures and to form {{a good relationship with}} the socio-economic environment. There are also operational motivations which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> environmental certification can help to reduce costs and increase productivity and commercial motivations which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it can help to increase sales and improve the market position.|$|R

5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E

25|$|Islamic creationism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the {{universe}} (including humanity) was directly created by God as {{explained in the}} Qur'an.

25|$|Certain {{principles}} of relativity {{have been widely}} assumed in most scientific disciplines. One of the most widespread <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> any law of nature {{should be the same}} at all times; and scientific investigations generally assume that laws of nature are the same regardless of the person measuring them.

25|$|In Jainism, the reincarnation doctrine, {{along with}} its {{theories}} of Saṃsāra and Karma, are central to its theological foundations, {{as evidenced by the}} extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on these topics from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.

50|$|Napoleon III also {{acted to}} {{increase}} the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia.

50|$|Coupled {{with this}} pragmatic need <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clarity and {{simplicity}} of mathematical expression avoided systematic errors of holistic thinking and logic rooted in traditional argument.

25|$|Amyraldism (or {{sometimes}} Amyraldianism, {{also known}} as the School of Saumur, hypothetical universalism, post redemptionism, moderate Calvinism, or four-point Calvinism) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> God, prior to his decree of election, decreed Christ's atonement for all alike if they believe, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election.

25|$|Housing First is an {{initiative}} to help homeless people reintegrate into society, {{and out of}} homeless shelters. It was initiated by the federal government's Interagency Council on Homelessness. It asks cities {{to come up with}} a plan to end chronic homelessness. In this direction, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> if homeless people are given independent housing to start, with some proper social supports, then there would be no need for emergency homeless shelters, which it considers a good outcome. However this is a controversial position.|$|E
25|$|Apostolic {{succession}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> {{the pope}} and Catholic bishops are the spiritual successors of the original twelve apostles, through the historically unbroken chain of consecration (see: Holy orders).

He is elected by the College of Cardinals who may choose from any male member of the church but who must be ordained a bishop before taking office. Since the 15th century, a current cardinal has always been elected.|$|E
