40|$|The GFR α 2 {{receptor}} is the cognate co-receptor for the {{neurotrophic factor}} neurturin and GFR α 2 is selectively expressed by isolectin B 4 (IB 4) -binding nociceptive sensory neurons. Here, we used two physiological approaches {{in combination with}} mice that have a targeted deletion of the GFR α 2 gene (GFR α 2 −/− mice) {{in order to determine}} whether GFR α 2 /neurturin signalling regulates the functional properties or the survival of IB 4 -binding nociceptors. Because 50 % of IB 4 -binding neurons respond to noxious heat and because patch clamp recordings of isolated dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons allow one to neurochemically identify subpopulations of neurons, we analysed the noxious heat responsiveness of IB 4 -positive and -negative small-diameter neurons isolated from adult GFR α 2 −/− and littermate control mice. The percentage of IB 4 -positive neurons that had large (> 100 pA) heat-evoked inward currents was severely reduced in GFR α 2 −/− mice (12 %) compared to wild-type littermates (47 %), and this loss in large-magnitude heat currents was accounted for by an increase in neurons with very small (< 100 pA) heat-evoked currents as well as an increase in neurons with no detectable heat current. Counts of IB 4 -positive and -negative neurons, as well as counts of unmyelinated axons in the saphenous nerve, confirmed that the loss in neurons with large-amplitude heat currents was due to a deficit in heat transduction and not a decrease in cell survival. The effect was modality specific for heat because mechanical transduction of all <b>fibre</b> <b>types,</b> <b>including</b> IB 4 -positive C fibres, was normal.

It was hypothesized, first, that due to the transition between suckling and chewing, during early postnatal development {{the increase in the}} proportion of slow <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> and in <b>fibre</b> cross-sectional areas would be larger in the masseter than in the digastric; and second, that due to the supposed influence of testosterone during late postnatal development, the proportion of slow <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> in both muscles would decrease. <b>Fibre</b> <b>types</b> were classified by immunostaining according to their myosin heavy chain (MyHC) content. The proportion of slow <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> significantly increased in the masseter, from 7 % at week 1 to 47 % at week 8, and then decreased to 21 % at week 20, while in the digastric it increased from 5 % in week 1 to 19 % at week 8 and remained the same thereafter. The changes in the proportion of fast <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> were the opposite. The remarkable increase and decrease in the proportion of slow <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> in the masseter was attributed predominantly to MyHC-cardiac α fibres. During early development, the cross-sectional area of all fibres in both muscles increased. However, only the fast <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> in the masseter continued to grow further after week 8. Before weaning, the fast <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> in the digastric were larger than those in the masseter, but after week 8, they became larger in the masseter than in the digastric.
