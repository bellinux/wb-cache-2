25|$|Tinamous prefer thick {{branches}} {{on which}} to roost as they do not clutch the branch with their toes, but rest on it with <b>folded</b> <b>legs.</b> They will reuse the same locations and avoid defecating nearby to avoid advertising the roost site to predators. The smaller forest species, along with the steppe tinamous, will roost on the ground, sometimes in the shelter of a bush. They will also use the same location repeatedly; known examples are the elegant crested and ornate tinamous.|$|E
500|$|A giraffe rests by lying {{with its}} body {{on top of}} its <b>folded</b> <b>legs.</b> To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers {{the rest of its}} body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then {{straightens}} its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head. In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short [...] "deep sleep" [...] phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep. If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the surface.|$|E

2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but I never saw a servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he sat back on his <b>folded</b> <b>legs,</b> with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E

60|$|About me was {{the great}} plain rolling away to the Sierras in the background. The {{railroad}} track traversed it in a thin line. There were no trees--only {{here and there a}} clump of cactus or chaparral, a tuft of dog-grass or a few patches of dogwood. At intervals in the distance one could see a hacienda standing in majestic solitude in a cup of the hills. In the blue sky floated little banderillos of white cloud, while a graceful hidalgo appeared poised on a crag on one leg with folded wings, or floated lazily in the sky on one wing with <b>folded</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E

60|$|My {{method of}} {{mechanical}} hypnosis was {{the soul of}} simplicity. Sitting with <b>folded</b> <b>legs</b> on my straw-mattress, I gazed fixedly at a fragment of bright straw which I had attached {{to the wall of}} my cell near the door where the most light was. I gazed at the bright point, with my eyes close to it, and tilted upward till they strained to see. At the same time I relaxed all the will of me and gave myself to the swaying dizziness that always eventually came to me. And when I felt myself sway out of balance backward, I closed my eyes and permitted myself to fall supine and unconscious on the mattress.|$|E
60|$|One of Ricardo's hands, reposing palm upwards on his <b>folded</b> <b>legs,</b> made a swift {{thrusting}} gesture, repeated by {{the enormous}} darting shadow of an arm very {{low on the}} wall. It broke the spell of perfect stillness in the room. The secretary eyed moodily the wall from which the shadow had gone. Anybody could be made quiet, he pointed out. It was not anything that the Chink could do; no, it was the effect that his company must have produced on {{the conduct of the}} doomed man. A man! What was a man? A Swedish baron could be ripped up, or else holed by a shot, as easily as any other creature; but that was exactly what was to be avoided, till one knew where he had hidden his plunder.|$|E
60|$|It hadn't; {{but it did}} {{not yield}} a strong gush. The sound of a thin stream, partly {{breaking}} on the gunwale of the boat and partly splashing alongside, became at once audible. It was greeted by a cry of inarticulate and savage joy. Heyst knelt on the string-piece and peered down. The man who had spoken was already holding his open mouth under the bright trickle. Water ran over his eyelids and over his nose, gurgled down his throat, flowed over his chin. Then some obstruction in the pipe gave way, and a sudden thick jet broke on his face. In a moment his shoulders were soaked, the front of his coat inundated; he streamed and dripped; water ran into his pockets, down his legs, into his shoes; but he had clutched the end of the pipe, and, hanging on with both hands, swallowed, spluttered, choked, snorted with the noises of a swimmer. Suddenly a curious dull roar reached Heyst's ears. Something hairy and black flew from under the jetty. A dishevelled head, coming on like a cannonball, took the man at the pipe in flank, with enough force to tear his grip loose and fling him headlong into the stern-sheets. He fell upon the <b>folded</b> <b>legs</b> of the man at the tiller, who, roused by the commotion in the boat, was sitting up, silent, rigid, and very much like a corpse. His eyes were but two black patches, and his teeth glistened with a death's head grin between his retracted lips, no thicker than blackish parchment glued over the gums.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the recent}} years when {{accomplishing}} anthropological investigations, some complementary anthropological test are included {{for a better}} characterization of a population. For {{the aims of the}} present investigation there have been used the following: Hand clasping, Arm <b>folding,</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>folding,</b> leading hand. The purpose of the study is to be discovered anthropological differences concerning age or sex in the examined population, and to be detected possible changes occurring in dependence of age. In respect of the hand clasping the right hand type predominates over the left, the opposite is noted about arm folding. As a whole right leading hand type dominates over left in the examined population. Total domination of the left or right hand type occurs rarely, in comparison with the mixed type...|$|R
