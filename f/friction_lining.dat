50|$|Synchronizing {{rings are}} made of metal and can be {{provided}} with anti-wear coatings called a friction lining.Common metals for synchronizer rings are brass and steel. The linings typically consist of molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon.The synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming (common forging) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the stamping of the blank out of a sheet metal strip and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A <b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, iron or bronze sinter friction layers can be used. Carbon-coated synchronizer rings are particularly wear resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.|$|E

There are the {{analysis}} and estimation of disc brake friction linings deformation value and impact on the friction body (<b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> on steel base) loading given in this article. It allows to modulate the wear of <b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> in the future research. Such friction body construction was analyzed in this research – the friction body and brake lever are linked with a pin, the direction of this pin is perpendicular regarding the vector of the slipping velocity. The research is significant to the joint-stock company “Jelgava engineering plant ” (A/S “Jelgavas masinbuves rupnica”) – they produce brakes with such construction. The theoretical research was done using two methods – solving differential equation for balk with finite length on elastic base (Winkler’s method) and the method of finite elements (FEM). After solving the differential equation for balk with finite length on elastic base the author found equations for vertical displacement y, turning angleθ, specific surface pressure p, bending moment M and transversal force Qy of balk in any cross section.

Two friction tests were conducted at a low sliding rate (1 mm/s) using a wire rope (designed for mining use) and a commercial <b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> material. One involved dry-{{friction and}} the other greased conditions. The corresponding coefficient of friction (COF) in each case was determined and {{used to evaluate the}} effect of application of the FPG on the lifting performance of a hoist under normal conditions. In addition, experiments involving high-speed sliding friction between the wire rope and the friction material were also performed (with and without the FPG). Different sliding speeds and applied loads were used. The aim was to obtain the tribological behavior of the friction material in conditions that simulate a severe working environment for the hoist. The experimental results were analyzed and combined with the rheological properties of the FPG. The FPG can substantially protect the <b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> from wear and simultaneously provide an adequate COF (about 0. 356) between the friction pair under normal working conditions. When the working conditions are severe, an increase in sliding speed causes a decrease in the COF. However, a larger load does not necessarily result in a smaller COF. Increasing the sliding speed or the load both aggravate the wear of the <b>friction</b> <b>lining...</b>|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this paper we report the effects of surface roughness on contact <b>line</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients of water droplets on micro- and nano-patterned surfaces. Both advancing and receding contact <b>line</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients have been measured, analyzed and compared on smooth, one-tier (with micropillars), and two-tier (with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on micropillars) surfaces {{over a wide range}} of contact line velocities and droplet volumes. Our results indicate that superhydrophobic surfaces with CNTs on top of micropillars can significantly decrease both the advancing and receding contact <b>line</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients. In comparison, both the advancing and receding contact <b>line</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients on smooth surfaces were more than ten times larger than those on superhydrophobic surfaces. However, droplets on one-tier surfaces with only micropillars exhibit different dynamic behaviors on advancing and receding movements. We experimentally investigated the Wenzel-Cassie transition on micropillar structures and found that the receding motion on micropillars is dominated by the Wenzel behavior, which leads to higher receding contact <b>line</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients on one-tier surfaces. However, there is a high tendency for an advancing droplet to exhibit Cassie-type behaviors on one-tier surfaces. As a result, advancing contact <b>line</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient is considerably mitigated on micropillars. On two-tier superhydrophobic surfaces, it was the Cassie–Baxter behavior that dominates both the advancing and receding contact line motions giving rise to less friction coefficients. Furthermore, the effects of surface roughness on contact line hysteresis are discussed in this paper. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the friction performance characteristics of a Copper, Antimony, and sulfide free environmentally automotive friction material using different allotropes of graphite as a replacement. Model brake friction materials were created and tested on a full scale brake dynamometer using the Society of Automotive Engineers J 2430 test and Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure. The dynamometer testing revealed the graphite replacement to have higher average effectiveness values when compared to the baseline friction material currently in production. The model samples generally had higher wear rates but some were comparable to the baseline and would be acceptable in real world applications. Some of the model samples displayed stable characteristics under varying load and linear braking velocity conditions, ultimately passing the criteria required. The model samples (RD 18670 A/B/C/D/E/F/G) displayed average effectiveness values of 0. 425, 0. 435, 0. 4125, 0. 425, 0. 475, failed test, and 0. 35 respectively, which is on average a substantial gain over the baseline effectiveness value average of 0. 3125.

Mixture is filled into a hollow cylindrical mold, being compressed cold to a blank. Pressure reached = 10 - 1000 bar. Cold compression takes place at room temperature. The compressive strength of the blank = 0. 5 - 3 N/mm 2. The blank is made into a disc shaped friction layers or slices with a thickness = 0. 5 - 2 mm. Hardening follows in an oven at 140 - 240 deg.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to address the relationship between formulation of <b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> materials and their propensity to friction induced noise generation. The basic idea was formulated earlier by Dr. Filip, who showed that the friction layer plays the relevant role when noise is observed during braking. It was shown that when newly formed patches (parts of the friction layer) exhibit a large difference in the coefficient of friction, brake lining is stretched and released repeatedly, which leads to significant vibrations and corresponding noise when coupled with the vibration mode of the system. Farhang,on the other hand, demonstrated that noise can be related to specific surface roughness parameters and when properties of <b>friction</b> <b>lining</b> and friction layer (such as compressibility, stiffness and modulus of elasticity) fit into certain specific value ranges, noisy behavior occurs. This research will address the braking related to friction induced noise in relation to the properties of the bulk lining material and the character and properties of the friction layer. The friction tests will be performed using the CAFS-developed (Szary and Lee) real time noise measurement system compatible with the major part of SAEJ 2521 standard (note that the system does not allow for reliable measurement of frequencies lower than 900 Hz). The mechanical properties of fourteen samples will be investigated. Of the fourteen samples, friction layer of three of the samples will be investigated by several analytical techniques developed by Dr. Filip [1]. They include polarized light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction. This research summarizes data from the J 2521 dynamometer test of the Dodge Caravan samples exhibiting specific compressibility, porosity and hardness. Also, this research provides the results of friction surface analysis by SEM with energy dispersive microanalysis, light microscopy, surface roughness, and X ray diffraction.
