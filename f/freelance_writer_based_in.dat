40|$|The genesis for Dialogues with Tomorrow (at Downstage Theatre, Wellington, April–June 2010) was {{the desire}} to bring a {{cultural}} perspective to the looming climate crisis. We began {{with the aim of}} bringing artists into the discussion around climate change, to add some complexity to what had become a simplistic understanding: a) humans are responsible for the warming of the planet, b) the warming of the planet leads to disaster, c) now PANIC and feel guilty and/or too overwhelmed to think or act. In an attempt to unpick panic, to examine our sense of agency and control (or apocalypse), and the potential for arts-led pathways out of a clouding atmosphere, we sought six artists and a cultural historian whose work strongly engaged with climate-related matters. To help link the artists’ work to the empirical understandings of climate and economics, we sought five interlocutors who could respond to the artists’ explorations and might find their science or business enriched by artistic reflections. It is a bold attempt to mix disciplines, to ask people from very different worlds to meet on stage and either find some common ground or talk across a gulf. It is precisely such conversations though, that are needed in facing up to the complex challenges of climate change. This volume documents the original texts and images of the 2010 Dialogues contributors, without introduction or the discussion that ensued between them. The texts give a clear sense of the thinking of these presenters, {{the ways in which they}} understand their work, as well as the work of their conversational partners, to be engaging with the multifaceted—perhaps even Hydra-headed—issue which they are determined to wrestle with.
