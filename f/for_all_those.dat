The townsfolk demand the Doctor turn Jex over, but he reminds them that Isaac's death will be for naught if they do so, and {{has come up with}} a plan from {{learning}} about Jex' society. When the Gunslinger arrives the next day, residents wearing facial markings similar to Jex race through town, confusing the cyborg and allowing Jex to flee to his ship. However, instead of taking off, Jex tells the Doctor he is ready to face justice in the afterlife, and causes the ship to self-destruct.|$|E

While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E

Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps.

25|$|In early 1941, the Nazi German {{government}} arranged another resettlement <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> who {{had refused}} to leave in 1939 or 1940. The action was called the Nachumsiedlung. This time around no compensation was offered for any property or belongings left behind and this group of resettlers were treated with intense suspicion or considered traitors because they had refused Hitler's first call to leave the Baltics in 1939. Most of these arrivals were first settled in filtration camps. Unknown to the general public, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was only 2 to 4 months away, and this was Hitler's last chance to transfer these people in peacetime conditions.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky differentiates competence, {{which is}} an {{idealized}} capacity, from performance being the production of actual utterances. According to him, competence is the ideal speaker-hearer's knowledge {{of his or her}} language and it is the 'mental reality' which is responsible <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> aspects of language use which can be characterized as 'linguistic'. Chomsky argues that only under an idealized situation whereby the speaker-hearer is unaffected by grammatically irrelevant conditions such as memory limitations and distractions will performance be a direct reflection of competence. A sample of natural speech consisting of numerous false starts and other deviations will not provide such data. Therefore, he claims that a fundamental distinction has to be made between the competence and performance.|$|E

25|$|In June 1917, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Espionage Act of 1917 which was later {{extended}} by the Sedition Act of 1918, enacted in May 1918. In February 1918, the Montana legislature {{had passed the}} Montana Sedition Act, which was {{a model for the}} federal version. In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, military, or symbols through speech or other means. The Montana Act led to the arrest of over 200 individuals and the conviction of 78, mostly of German or Austrian descent. Over 40 spent time in prison. In May 2006, then-Governor Brian Schweitzer posthumously issued full pardons <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act.|$|E
