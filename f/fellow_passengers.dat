5|$|Not all {{passengers}} were {{happy with the}} new train. In 2005, a delegation of commuters between Helsinki and Tampere collected criticism from <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> on the Internet and delivered it to VR's head of passenger transport Antti Jaatinen. The delegation's leader, Kaj-Erik Fohlin, had made 30 trips between the two cities in January 2005 using the Pendolino, 12 {{of which had been}} on schedule.|$|E
5|$|The sixth film, The Signalman, is an {{adaptation}} of a story by Charles Dickens published in his magazine All the Year Round in 1866. In its original context {{it was one of}} eight stories set around the fictional Mugby Junction and its branch lines. It was inspired by the Staplehurst rail crash of June 1865, which Dickens himself survived, having attended to dying <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers.</b> He subsequently suffered panic disorders and flashbacks as a result.|$|E

However, he hides the incident from Nandini, indicating that he has successfully blended his personalities into one instead of eradicating them.|$|E

40|$|We studied how a <b>fellow</b> <b>passenger</b> robot {{influences}} drivers. The <b>fellow</b> <b>passenger</b> robot {{was designed}} to move and speak as if it knows the surroundings of the car. We conducted experiments with a driving simulator and evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} robot with various methods. We used questionnaires to ask for impressions of the driving experience for the participants after the driving experiments with the <b>fellow</b> <b>passenger</b> robot. In addition, the car speed, acceleration and steering angle were measured during the driving experiments. Some significant differences between experiences with and without robot were found in the results with regard to impression evaluation and average speed. Therefore, we found that the robot makes driving more enjoyable and that drivers drive slower than without the robot...|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker {{visited the}} continent, touring through France, Germany and Italy. While in Vienna in 1787, news reached him of {{political}} troubles with the Dutch, and he began to journey back to England in hope of a commission. While travelling through the forest near Aschaffenburg, the diligence he was in was attacked by ten armed men, who fired into the coach and demanded the passengers' money. Walker attempted to resist them, but was left unsupported by his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers,</b> and was knocked down, robbed, and thrown into a ditch. The robbers took 800l of money and rode off, believing Walker to be dead. He came to, suffering from a sabre cut to the head, and was carried into Aschaffenburg. There his wounds were treated free of charge by the local surgeons and authorities, and on recovering sufficiently he was brought to Frankfurt. There the local lodge of freemasons offered him financial assistance, and on his arrival at Mainz he was presented to the Prince-Bishop, Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal. The Archbishop gave him a letter detailing his adventure in the forest near Aschaffenburg, and commending his bravery. Despite this assistance Walker was unable to reach England until after the Dutch crisis had abated, and so returned to his travels in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E

25|$|On June 2, 1738, a {{boat with}} {{passengers}} {{was on its}} way from Pamplona to Aparri. Near the port, a sudden gale blew and it was swept out to sea. With the strong winds, heavy rains and big waves, rescue seemed impossible. A passenger on a pilgrimage to Piat began to pray the holy rosary and exhorted his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> to join him. They all did; soon afterward, the rain stopped, the winds died down and the boat and its passengers made it safely to port.|$|E

On June 11, 1880, he was a passenger on the SS Stonington when it collided with the SS Narragansett at night in heavy fog. The Stonington was able to return to port, but the Narragansett burned to the waterline and sank, with significant loss of life. Although none of his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> on the Stonington were injured, the incident left Guiteau believing that he had been spared for a higher purpose.|$|E

25|$|Harvey and Bryant's {{father were}} now dead, {{and he became}} {{increasingly}} lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages.

However, he enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who {{had no choice but to}} be polite. Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Saint Awtel {{is celebrated}} by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Jacobites and the Maronites. His {{place and date}} of birth vary {{according}} to the sources. From an unknown place in modern Turkey for the Maronite Sinksar and born in the 3rd century AD, he is from Lycia for the other sources and he lived during the 6th century AD. His feast day varies also according to the different traditions. But most sources have corroborating deeds: he escaped a forced marriage arranged by his family, spent some time in Byzantium, delivered his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> during a severe storm, went back to his place of birth {{after the death of his}} parents and finally became a monk then a hermit.|$|E

25|$|On 28 July 1847, Whyte {{recorded}} {{the neglect of}} his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers,</b> who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or {{so much as a}} drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.|$|E
25|$|Of {{all those}} references, he {{concluded}} that Awtel or Awtilios {{was born in a}} city called Magdal or Magdaloun in the land of Lycia in Asia Minor, in the 6th century A.D. His two parents were pagan but he was converted very young, became Christian and ran away from the paternal home to avoid marriage. He boarded and ran away to the city of Moumista (probably al-Maççîça) delivering his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> from a tempest where they would have perished. He came to Constantinople, led an ascetic life in one of its monasteries, then came back to his fatherland before spending some time in the region of Antioch, then back in Lycia. There, he converted the pagans of this region, christened them and ended his life in the desert in a monastery which he built nearby and where he lived till his death. In the calendar of the antiochian Church of al-Bîrûnî a martyr called Uwaytilyos is mentioned on the date of September 23. But it is not proven whether it is Mar Awtel or another saint.|$|E
25|$|Poirot observes his <b>fellow</b> <b>passengers</b> in the funicular. There is a {{friendly}} American tourist called Mr Schwartz, a beautiful but melancholy woman, a distinguished-looking man {{reading a book}} in German and three criminal types playing cards. Arriving at the hotel, they find it somewhat in chaos as it is only just opening {{at the start of}} the season. To Poirot, the hotel manager seems in too much of a nervous panic; the only efficient person is Gustave, the waiter. Talking to the manager and then to Schwartz again, Poirot learns that the beautiful woman is a Madame Grandier, who comes each year on the anniversary of her husband's death in the area, and that the distinguished-looking man is Dr Lutz, a Jewish refugee from the Nazis in Vienna. Poirot introduces himself to Schwartz as Monsieur Poirier, a silk merchant from Lyon. The next morning, when delivering coffee to his room, Gustave tells Poirot that in fact he is M. Drouet, a police inspector. They are now cut off in the hotel as the funicular has been damaged during the night, probably by sabotage. Poirot and Gustave discuss who Marrascaud could be among the guests and staff, which includes Jacques, the cook's husband. Poirot is intrigued as to why a rendezvous has been arranged in such an isolated place.|$|E
