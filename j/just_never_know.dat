Whether to call us punk or what. All the majors have been out to see us play, Geffen and that. But they think, well, we can only sell a few thousand. It's not worth it for them to sell 15-20 thousand, they're not bothered. But if Rotten sells 15-20 thousand, that's really nice. And the fella from Rotten has been coming to see us for the last 15 years."

The process of negotiation is actualized within what scholar Michel de Certeau has termed ‘grids of control’ and makes use of tactics (as opposed to strategies) that are negotiated through a practiced based on walking, interactive installations, and text that aim to collate, destabilize and amplify everyday repetition and patterns. Within an artistic discourse where the context ―social, political or otherwise― is of primary concern, my practice neighbours that of artists including as Francis Alÿs, Barbara Kruger, Cathy Busby, and Jenny Holzer, who each deploy {{a variety of methods}} and tactics that disrupt social spaces and text- based rhetoric.
