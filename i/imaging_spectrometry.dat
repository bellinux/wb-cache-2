50|$|In non-scanning, {{a single}} 2-D sensor output {{contains}} all spatial (x,y) and spectral (λ) data. HSI devices for non-scanning yield the full datacube at once, without any scanning. Figuratively speaking, a single snapshot represents a perspective {{projection of the}} datacube, from which its three-dimensional structure can be reconstructed. The most prominent benefits of these snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems are the snapshot advantage (higher light throughput) and shorter acquisition time. A number of systems have been designed, including computed tomographic <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (CTIS), fiber-reformatting <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (FRIS), integral field spectroscopy with lenslet arrays (IFS-L), multi-aperture integral field spectrometer (Hyperpixel Array), integral field spectroscopy with image slicing mirrors (IFS-S), image-replicating <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (IRIS), filter stack spectral decomposition (FSSD), coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), image mapping spectrometry (IMS), and multispectral Sagnac interferometry (MSI).

The described parametric geocoding procedure (PARGE) strictly considers the aircraft and terrain geometry parameters and uses a forward transformation algorithm to create orthorectified <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> cubes. The implementation princi- ples, the auxiliary data calibration strategies, and the workflow of the currently applied processor are dis- cussed. The major error sources of the approach are identified, and possibilities are shown how to make the most out of the available auxiliary data (INS/GPS) parameters. Results on HyMap and AVIRIS <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> data show an absolute accuracy in the range of 1 - 3 pixels for this kind of imagery.

40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{progress}} {{in the field of}} <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> is presented based on the 14 articles comprising the special issue of this journal. The results presented were achieved through research done with data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), the first imaging spectrometer to cover the full solar reflected portion of the spectrum. The majority of the early work in <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> prior to AVIRIS focused largely on geological applications and specifically surface mineral identification. In the past 5 years, the range of applications has expanded into the scientific disciplines of ecology, hydrology, oceanography, and atmospheric science. Significant progress has also been made in sensor design and calibration, and information extraction. NASA plans to place high spectral resolution sensors in earth orbit within the next few years; two have been flown already on recent planetary missions and have proven to be of great value to the study of planetary surfaces and atmospheres. The work presented in this issue will lead directly to more effective utilization of <b>imaging</b> <b>spectrometry</b> {{in the study of the}} earth.

40|$|Mass <b>spectrometry</b> <b>imaging</b> {{has emerged}} as a {{powerful}} tool for the direct detection of biomolecules, mainly phospholipids, proteins and peptides, in tissue samples. To date, there is very little information available on the direct analysis of gangliosides in brain tissue. One major hurdle for imaging gangliosides in tissue using mass spectrometry is that sialic acid residues can be dissociated in ionization process. In this report, we investigated an ionic liquid matrix for mass <b>spectrometry</b> <b>imaging</b> of gangliosides. This ionic liquid matrix offered excellent sensitivity for detection gangliosides without significant loss of sialic acid residues. Thus, {{it can be used to}} study the abundance and anatomical localization of gangliosides in mouse brain using mass <b>spectrometry</b> <b>imaging</b> technique. Mass <b>spectrometry</b> image analyses of the mouse brain tissue sections demonstrated that the N-fatty acyl chains of gangliosides were differentially distributed in mouse hippocampal regions, whereby the gangliosides with N-C 2 ̆ 0812 ̆ 088 acyl chainwere enriched in CA 1 region, while gangliosides with N-C 2 ̆ 0822 ̆ 080 acyl chain were enriched in dentate gyrus.
