5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures {{in a process}} in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble.</b> His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E

25|$|The banking {{industry}} proved more enthusiastic about Buenaventura’s appointment as BSP governor than Buenaventura himself expected. It had good reason: Buenaventura was {{taking over the}} position {{at a time when}} the industry was <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble,</b> having accumulated a gargantuan portfolio of bad loans that, in the face of the Asian financial crisis, threatened to collapse the entire financial system. Moreover, the industry was on the threshold of increasing globalization, and required radical shifts in regulatory policies in order to comply with global standards.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble</b> at the time.

For such crimes, trial and execution would have been almost guaranteed. Within the past two months, at least three people, Henry Barrow, John Greenwood and John Penry, {{had gone to the}} scaffold for offences no worse than this.

25|$|Following the {{retirement}} of Damien Martyn during the Ashes in 2006–07 Symonds was again recalled to the team.

25|$|Magdeburg {{had a very}} {{successful}} season in 2000–01. Not only did the club win their league in superior style, scoring more than 120 goals, but they also reached the quarter final of the DFB-Pokal. 1. FC Magdeburg beat Bundesliga side 1. FC Köln, holders FC Bayern Munich and Karlsruher SC, eventually going out against Schalke 04. Additionally the club won their fourth Saxony-Anhalt-Cup. In the promotion play-offs, Magdeburg beat their old rivals BFC Dynamo 5–2 on aggregate, but financially the club was <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble.</b> In order {{to be allowed to}} play, they had to raise 5 million DM in a matter of days. A two-day donation drive initiated by the fans brought 1 million Marks, the remaining sum was loaned to the club by two banks.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s onwards, {{there was}} a {{widespread}} belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble.</b> This eclipse of Darwinism (in Julian Huxley's phrase) {{grew out of the}} weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in blending inheritance, which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin correctly noted in 1868. This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of pangenesis, with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing {{from all parts of the}} body, actually implied Lamarckism.|$|E

25|$|Bu Chan {{inherited}} his father's {{legacy and}} became the new military commander stationed at Xiling (西陵; present-day Xiling District, Yichang, Hubei) to guard the border. He was also appointed as General of Illustrious Martial Might (昭武將軍) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xi Village (西亭侯). In 272, {{during the reign of}} the last Wu emperor Sun Hao, Bu Chan was recalled back to the imperial capital to serve as the Controller of the Imperial Guards (繞帳督). As Bu Chan and his family had been living in Xiling for several years, he thought that he was being recalled because he failed to perform his duty well in Xiling. He also feared that he would become a victim of slander and end up <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble,</b> so he defected to the Jin dynasty and surrendered Xiling to the enemy.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 NRL season saw Mini {{return to}} the field after a re-occurrence of his back injury put him out for the back half of the 2007 season. Unfortunately, during a round 4 clash with the Canterbury Bulldogs, pain in his back returned. This {{severely}} harmed his chances of regaining his Australian fullback jersey and he was overlooked in favour of both Brett Stewart and Melbourne Storm fullback Billy Slater. Stewart and Slater were also the respective fullbacks for NSW and Qld at the time. In 2009, Anthony played 2 games before injuring his ankle against the Canberra Raiders. He was sidelined until Round 20; by then, the Roosters were <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>trouble</b> and staring down of their worst season since failing to win a single game in 1966.
