5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the <b>drive</b> <b>roller</b> to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Deformation {{of round}} {{castings}} due to thermal and/or mechanical strain {{may lead to}} the occurrence of their ovality defects during continuous casting. Presently, ovality defect from thermal deformation have been effectively controlled in actual casting process with the application of more advanced equipments and more sophisticated control strategies. But the control of ovality defect from larger mechanical deformation still cannot satisfy the need of caster design or higher qualified rate of castings. It is shown that excessive hot pressure while strand passes through tension leveler, is the main reason to generate larger mechanical deformation. With consideration of the characteristics of round caster and the requirement of safety production, a theoretical calculated model based on mechanical deformation analysis has been developed in the paper to eliminate ovality defect specially from the over large hot pressure. Calculation analysis suggests that groove design of <b>drive</b> <b>roller</b> and range of round section sizes should be the important consideration for the determination of hot pressure, and there always exists an optimum value for hot pressure when the machine equipments of round caster have been designed and installed. The model can provide a useful guideline for casting engineers to design the groove of <b>drive</b> <b>roller</b> and to determine reasonable safe hot pressure. Reliability of the model analysis has been verified by industrial application on a newly built round caster...|$|E

30|$|Filament winding {{has emerged}} as the main process for carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) fabrication, and tension control {{plays a key role in}} enhancing the quality of the winding products. With the continuous improvement of product quality and efficiency, the precision of the tension control system is constantly improving. In this paper, a novel tension control method is proposed, which can regulate the fiber tension and transport speed of the winding process by governing the outputs of three different <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> (the torque of the unwind roll, the torque of the magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed roller) in three levels. The mechanical structures and dynamic models of the <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> and idle rollers are established by considering the time-varying features of the roller radius and inertia. Moreover, the influence of parameters and speed variation on fiber tension is investigated using the increment model. Subsequently, the control method is proposed by applying fiber tension in three levels according to the features of the three <b>driven</b> <b>rollers.</b> An adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for tuning the PID parameters online to control the speed of the master speed roller. Simulation is conducted for verifying the performance and stability of the proposed tension control method by comparing with those of the conventional PID control method. The result reveals that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed, and the proposed system is applied to a winding machine. The performance and stability of the tension control system are demonstrated via a series of experiments using carbon fiber under different reference speeds and tensions. This paper proposes a novel tension control method to regulate the fiber tension and transport speed.|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the above}} studies {{considered}} the dynamics of <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> in the models but the behavior of idle rollers was ignored. Consequently, the models were under some limited conditions, which ignored detailed complex tension dynamics. On the other hand, most research focused on dynamic modeling and control strategy design, but the mechanical structure {{and the influence of}} parameter variation on fiber tension were ignored. In this paper, a novel tension control method is presented, which can regulate the tension and speed of the filament winding process. The mechanical structure and dynamic model of the system are established, and the influences of the parameter and the speed variation on fiber tension are examined. Subsequently, according to the features of <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> and the influence of variation, the control method is proposed by regulating the outputs of the torque of unwind roll, the torque of magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed roller in three levels. Simulations are conducted for verifying the effect by comparing the results with those of the conventional PID controller. Finally, the performance of the proposed control system is verified through experimental studies using a filament winding machine.|$|R

40|$|Observations {{with radio}} telescopes address key {{problems}} in cosmology, astrobiology, heliophysics, and planetary science {{including the first}} light in the Universe (Cosmic Dawn), magnetic fields of extrasolar planets, particle acceleration mechanisms, and the lunar ionosphere. The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two <b>rollers,</b> one <b>driven</b> and one passive. The antenna film is wrapped around the <b>driven</b> <b>roller.</b> The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially {{with respect to the}} <b>driven</b> <b>roller.</b> Springs preload the passive <b>roller</b> against the <b>driven</b> <b>roller,</b> and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or "bird's nesting" on the driven spool. The antenna deployment mechanism is integrated on the minimally-actuated Axel rover. Axel is a two-wheeled rover platform with a trailing boom that is capable of traversing undulated terrain and overcoming obstacles of a wheel radius in height. It is operated by four motors: one that drives each wheel; a third that controls the rotation of the boom, which orients the body mounted sensors; and a fourth that controls the rover's spool to <b>drive</b> the antenna <b>roller.</b> This low-mass axle-like rover houses its control and communication avionics inside its cylindrical body. The Axel rover teleoperation software has an auto-spooling mode that allows a user to automatically deploy the thin-film antenna at a rate proportional to the wheel speed as it drives the rover along its trajectory. The software allows Axel to deposit the film onto the ground to prevent or minimize relative motion between the film and the terrain to avoid the risk of scraping and antenna with the terrain...|$|R
