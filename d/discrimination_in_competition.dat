In {{this paper}} it is {{necessary}} to analyze the types of competition in the transport market in order to find ways to improve the competitiveness of railway transport and to determine the ensuring equal conditions for all market participants by eliminating <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> <b>competition.</b> Methodology. Analysis of recent research and publications on the subject was held by the authors. The question of the development of competition, increased competitiveness in railway transport was investigated. Attention is drawn to the fact that due to the decline in traffic volumes on all modes of transport competition may significantly change the usual sphere the effective use of different modes of transport. Every mode of transport occupies a particular segment of the transport market, taking into account its technical and economic features, weakly competing, and in some cases do not compete with each other (except the road transport). However, it is entirely possible competition inside these segments. Findings. The problems of management of competitiveness, including the transport market, which required extensive analysis and serious scientific study, were identified. Originality. As a result of this work the features of transport and production of transport in modern conditions were structured. The dependences of passenger turnover and freight turnover by mode of transport over the past decade were shown. The question of additional profits by providing the cargo owners a range of service was examined. The optimal combination of cost and quality of such services at each transportation company promotes increasing its competitive status. Practical value. Competition between enterprises of the industry put the aim of improving the competitiveness of not only railway subsystems directly involved in technology movement of cargoes and the movement of passengers, but also the organization of infrastructure in the first place – subsystems to expand services and improve service for passengers and cargo owners. Ensuring of equal conditions for all market participants is achieved through a ban of three key anti-competitive actions: the adoption of agreements restricting competition; abuse of a dominant (monopolistic) position and mergers, which result in a dominant market position to restrict competition. ...|$|E

We compare differences in minutes played between five ethnic groups: White Europeans, Black Europeans, Africans, White Latin Americans, and Black Latin Americans. We find evidence that White Latin Americans enjoy significantly less game time than White Europeans, while the opposite is true for Black Latin Americans. However, the inclusion of player fixed effects reveals that, after controlling for player ability, {{there is no evidence of}} <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> this <b>competition...</b>|$|R

We show that the leader does not use any price discrimination at all. Rather, the follower does all price discrimination. The leader directs all of its first mover preemptive advantage to attract the highest value consumers who pay a uniformly high price. We observe that profits and total welfare are larger and consumer surplus is smaller than those of the standard Stackelberg competition model. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

40|$|While {{researchers}} have long held that <b>discrimination</b> cannot endure <b>in</b> an increasingly competitive environment, {{there has been}} little work testing this dynamic process. This paper tests the hypothesis (based on Becker 1957) that increased competition resulting from globalization in the 1980 s forced employers to reduce costly discrimination against women. The empirical strategy exploits differences in market structure across industries to identify the impact of trade on the gender wage gap: because concentrated industries face little competitive pressure to reduce <b>discrimination,</b> an increase <b>in</b> <b>competition</b> from increased trade should lead to a reduction in the gender wage gap. We compare the change in the residual gender wage gap between 1976 and 1993 in concentrated versus competitive manufacturing industries, using the latter as a control for changes in the gender wage gap that are unrelated to competitive pressures. We find that increased competition through trade did contribute to the relative improvement in female wages in concentrated relative to competitive industries, suggesting that, at least in this sense, trade may benefit women by reducing firms' ability to discriminate. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{documented}} that the gender wage gap declined substantially in the 1980 s, despite rising overall wage inequality. While Blau and Kahn (JoLE 1997) attribute {{much of this}} improvement to gains in women's relative labor market experience and other observable characteristics, {{a substantial part of}} the decline in the gender wage gap remains unexplained, and may be due to reduced <b>discrimination</b> against women <b>in</b> the labor market. This paper tests the hypothesis (based on Becker 1957) that increased globalization in the 1980 s forced employers to reduce costly discrimination against women and thus accounted for part of the "unexplained" improvement in the gender pay gap.; To test this hypothesis, we calculate the change in the residual gender wage gap across industries (as well as cities) over time using CPS data from 1977 - 1994, and test the correlation between this measure and changes in import shares. The wage data are further broken down by the type of market structure in an industry, i. e. whether the industry is concentrated or competitive. Since concentrated industries face little competitive pressure to reduce <b>discrimination,</b> an increase <b>in</b> <b>competition</b> from increased trade should lead to a reduction in the residual gender wage gap. We use a difference-in-differences approach to compare the change in the residual gender wage gap in concentrated versus unconcentrated sectors, using the latter as a control for changes in the gender wage gap that are unrelated to competitive pressures. The findings indicate that increased competition through trade did contribute to the narrowing of the gender wage gap, suggesting that, at least in this sense, trade may benefit women relative to men.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} foreign trade induced product market competition, upon workplace gender <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> urban Mexico {{as measured by the}} gender earnings differential. More than four decades ago, Becker argued that labour market discrimination was economically inefficient in that discriminating firms must forego a quantity of profit. Thus, firms with more market power, i. e., firms facing less competition, {{may be more likely to}} discriminate. It therefore follows that <b>competition</b> <b>in</b> product markets may reduce <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> labour markets. The spread of foreign trade has traditionally been a major factor in increased product market competition. Hence, Becker 2 ̆ 019 s thesis suggests foreign trade will reduce employment discrimination.

Many of these ideas were advanced by List when he taught at the Finnish School of Finance in 2007 on field experiments in Finance.|$|R
40|$|A key dynamic {{implication}} of the Becker model of discrimination (1957) is that increased product market competition will drive out costly <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> the long run. This paper tests that hypothesis by examining the impact of globalization on gender <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing industries. Because concentrated industries face little competitive pressure, an increase <b>in</b> <b>competition</b> from trade should reduce the residual gender wage gap more in these industries than in competitive industries. The authors compare {{the change in the}} gender wage gap between 1976 and 1993 in concentrated versus competitive manufacturing industries, using the latter as a control for changes in the gender wage gap that are unrelated to competitive pressures. They find that while trade increases wage inequality by modestly reducing the relative wages of less-skilled workers, {{at the same time it}} appears to benefit women by reducing the ability of firms to discriminate...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{possible}} effects of discrimination by sex and race {{on the career}} patterns of doctors up to six years after qualifying. DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaire follow up survey. PARTICIPANTS [...] 1572 Doctors who graduated from five British medical schools in 1981, 1983, and 1985, including 587 women and 131 doctors from ethnic minorities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Reported success rates of applications for training posts. RESULTS [...] Comparison of the career patterns {{of women and men}} yielded no evidence of <b>discrimination</b> against women <b>in</b> <b>competition</b> for posts. <b>In</b> contrast, there were striking differences in career patterns between graduates of native European origin and those of ethnic minority origin. Graduates from ethnic minorities reported lower success rates and more difficulty in obtaining house officer posts, registrar posts, and places in vocational training schemes in general practice. Most of this discrimination seemed to occur at the stage of shortlisting for interview. Graduates from ethnic minorities were more likely than graduates of native European origin to have experienced spells of unemployment while seeking work. They {{were also more likely to}} have changed their original choice of career because of difficulty in obtaining suitable training posts or unfavourable career prospects. CONCLUSIONS [...] Discrimination against ethnic minorities occurs <b>in</b> the <b>competition</b> for training posts among graduates from British medical schools. There was no evidence of discrimination against women graduates. Shortlisting procedures based on objective scoring systems may help to ensure equality of opportunity in future...|$|R

40|$|While the {{economic}} theories {{have come to}} the conclusion that discounts and price discrimination are enhancing welfare, an obligation to offer non-discriminatory prices has been implemented in the sector specific regulation for telecom operators enjoying SMP. Moreover, price discrimination has generally been accepted <b>in</b> <b>competition</b> law cases. This might change in the future as the EU Commission has published the draft recommendation for the regulation of Next Generation Access networks (NGA). In this draft recommendation, the EU proposes to allow for the introduction of discounts (price <b>discrimination)</b> <b>in</b> certain cases related to Next Generation Access (NGA) networks on the wholesale level. This paper looks at the implications of an acceptance of price <b>discrimination</b> <b>in</b> the sector specific regulation of telecommunication markets. We conclude that price discrimination is expected to be effective in creating incentives for investments in NGA networks, but that there is a risk that price discrimination will harm <b>competition</b> which <b>in</b> turn might imply negative welfare effects. Therefore, a case-by-case analysis instead of a general approach is required. [...] ...|$|R
