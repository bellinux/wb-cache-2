40|$|The {{influence}} of drinking conditions on alcohol metabolism and drunkenness {{was investigated in}} healthy men with ALDH 2 * 1 /* 1 genotype aged from 40 to 60 who were occasional or habitual drinkers. The investigation was performed by open intersection competitive drinking tests at an ethanol dose of 0. 32 g/kg under 4 different drinking conditions: beer without a meal [B(–) ], shochu (a distilled spirit) without a meal [S(–) ], beer with a meal [B(+) ] and shochu with a meal [S(+) ]. The blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and BAC-AUC (area under the curve) were lower in the B(–) than in the S(–). The blood acetaldehyde concentration (BAcH) and the serum acetate concentration (SAce) were also lower in the B(–) than in the S(–). The meal markedly decreased BAC, BAC-AUC and BAcH-AUC for both alcoholic beverages. Subjective drunkenness was stronger in order of B(+) + in liver cells, was higher in the S(–) than in the B(–), and was decreased by the meal for both alcoholic beverages. These results suggested that <b>glucide</b> increase the rate of alcohol metabolism by supplying pyruvic acid to decrease the ratio of NADH/NAD+, which lowers BAC and relieves drunkenness.

The polluted solution was expected to include several water-soluble impurities, such as <b>glucide</b> derived from rice starch (approximately 2 wt%) and calcium sulfate (almost saturated at room temperature), as well as insoluble micro particles. The original wastewater sample was milky-white with no macroscopic impurities. In this prototype plant manufactured by Mayekawa MFG.

40|$|The {{protective}} effect exerted by polyamines (Put and Spd) against cadmium (Cd) stress {{was investigated in}} Brassica juncea plants. Treatment with CdCl 2 (75 micro-Mole) resulted in a rise of Cd accumulation, a decrease of fresh and dry weights in every plant organ, an increase of free polyamine content at limb and stem levels {{as well as a}} decrease at root level. On the other hand, the total conjugated polyamine levels in the stem tissues were unaffected by Cd. In the leaf tissues, this metal caused a reduction of chlorophyll a content, a rise of guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble <b>glucide,</b> proline and amino acid contents. Exogenous application, by spraying, of putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) to leaf tissues reduced CdCl 2 -induced stress. These polyamines proved to exert a partial, though significant, protection of the foliar fresh weight and to alleviate the oxidative stress generated by Cd through reductions of MDA amounts and GPOX (E. C. 1. 11. 1. 7) activity. The enhancement of chlorophyll a content in plants by Put and those of Chl a and Chl b by Spd both constitute evidences of their efficacy against the Cd 2 +-induced loss of pigments. Conversely to Put, Spd caused a decrease of Cd content in leave tissues and a rise in the stems and roots; these findings are in favour of a stimulation of Cd uptake by Spd. The proline stimulation observed with Cd was reduced further to the spraying of Put onto tissues, but the decrease induced by Spd was more limited. In the plants treated with Cd, the amino acid contents in the leaves were unaffected by Put and Spd spraying; on the other hand, Cd 2 + disturbed polyamine levels (free and acido-soluble conjugated-forms); we notice the rise of total free PAs and the decrease of their conjugated-ones.

The antioxidants are chemical substances that inhibit, decompose or prevent forming of free radicals or other substances that induce the cancerogenesis. Also, dietary fibers are another group of natural compounds with important role in prevention of the digestive diseases. In the experiments were used biochemical methods for analysis of fruit and processed products (determination of soluble dry substance, <b>glucides,</b> proteins, lipids, mineral elements, total acidity, vitamin C, ?-carotene, cellulose, pectic substances etc.). Also were performed microbiological analysis and sensorial analysis for processed products. In order to obtain the product Apple, Quince and Sea Buckthorn Nectar, four variants of experiments were carried out at the laboratory level. Following the sensorial and biochemical analyses, the optimum variant of the product Apple, Quince and Sea Buckthorn Nectar was selected, namely the variant V 3 in which the ratio apple puree and quince puree was 1 : 1 and the percentage of added sea buckthorn juice was of 3 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} (structuring) of a sensorial (taste) {{assessment program}} {{with all the}} derived implications and recommandations is a decisive step in promoting {{a new kind of}} food. The paper presents the experiments of sensorial evaluation for two panification assortments (graham and whole-meal bread) by using specific wheat obtained from raw material cultivated in the West Planes of Romania, improved with enzymes, <b>glucides</b> and proteins (fermentation bran extract). The special taste and odour of the bread is due to the over 200 flavoured vectors (partially identified). In this paper, by using the three-phase proceeding, we, gradually, modified the main influence factors of taste and flavor in the two major technological phases: the preparation of the leaven and dough (consistency, duration, fermentation temperature) and baking (duration, temperature). We analyzed, by chromatography, the major compounds of taste and flavor (ppm) (hydroxy-methyl-furfural, furfural-acetoine, diacetyl) in the crumb, in the inferior and superior crust, for the mentioned specialties and the flavor index, by knowing, from the literature, the sensitivity threshold for the four flavor “vectors”. Each of them was described and it appreciated by three/four different points of the global sensorial evaluation of the panification product. The PCA (Principal Component Analysis) allowed us to evaluate the experimental data that w...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is the {{evaluation}} of the analytical characteristics of the determinations performed using glucose oxidase and acetylcholinesterase based electrochemical sensors, developed applying original or optimized conventional methods of enzyme immobilization. It was found that the sensitivity of glucose determination, for example, varies from 0. 048 to 3. 36 mA L mol- 1 cm- 2 and the response time of the glucose oxidase based sensors - from 5 to 30 s, according to the method of the bioreceptor immobilization. The sensitivity of the analysis is affected from the activity of the immobilized biocomponent, from the composition of the solution (concentration of the substrate, of the mediator and of the inhibitor), and from the experimental conditions (pH, temperature, agitation), {{as well as from the}} kinetic parameters of the studied process. It was found that the immobilized glucose oxidase conserves its substrate specificity in the presence of a number of <b>glucides</b> (galactose, maltose, fructose, and saccharose) in 100 fold higher concentrations. The selectivity of glucose analysis is ensured applying a suitable potential. Interferences free glucose amperometric determination was performed at 0. 00 V/SCE, in the presence of ascorbates and urates. The electrochemical quantification of enzyme inhibitors allows reaching particularly low limits of detection (10 - 9 - 10 - 14 mol L- 1) ...|$|R
