The main {{shooting}} was switched {{from the usual}} 007 Stage at the Pinewood Studios to France, due to <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E
5|$|The Poles, {{completely}} {{surprised by}} the Swedish invasion, in September attempted a counter-offensive, but were defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Gniew. The forces required serious modernization. The Sejm passed <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> for the defense, but collections lagged behind. The situation was partially saved by the City of Danzig, which hurriedly embarked {{on the construction of}} modern fortifications, and by Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. The accomplished commander of the eastern borderlands fighting quickly learned the maritime affairs and contemporary methods of European warfare. Koniecpolski promoted the necessary enlargement of the naval fleet, modernization of the army, and became a fitting counterbalance for the military abilities of Gustavus Adolphus.|$|E
25|$|However, the <b>high</b> <b>taxation,</b> {{continuing}} {{wars and}} the cold climate (the Little Ice Age) made the Imperial era of Sweden rather gloomy times for Finnish peasants. In 1655–1660, the Northern Wars were fought, taking Finnish soldiers to the battle-fields of Livonia, Poland and Denmark. In 1676, the political system of Sweden was transformed into an absolute monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Red is a far-left party like both of its predecessors, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party. It favours {{the welfare}} state and <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> upon the wealthy {{as a means of}} {{tackling}} inequality. Since its formation, notable groups have merged with the party, the most notable example of this being the Trotskyist International Socialists. The party consists of various internal factions, including the Trotskyists, Marxist-Leninists, and democratic socialists.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{documents}} show records of induced abortion from {{as early as}} the 12th century. It became much more prevalent during the Edo period, especially among the peasant class, who were hit hardest by the recurrent famines and <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> of the age. Statues of the Boddhisattva Jizo, erected in memory of an abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or young childhood death, began appearing at least as early as 1710 at a temple in Yokohama (see religion and abortion).|$|E
25|$|Growing {{opposition}} to French officialdom and <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> {{led to an}} insurrection in 1282 (the Sicilian Vespers), which was successful {{with the support of}} Peter III of Aragón, who was crowned King of Sicily by the island's barons. Peter III had previously married Manfred's daughter, Constance, and it was for this reason that the Sicilian barons effectively invited him. This victory split the Kingdom in two, with Charles continuing to rule the mainland part (still known as the Kingdom of Sicily as well).|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of the 19th century saw a relative period of stability, as Muslim, Druze and Maronite groups focused on economic and cultural development which saw {{the founding of the}} American University of Beirut and a flowering of literary and political activity associated with the attempts to liberalize the Ottoman Empire. Late in the century there was a short Druze uprising over the extremely harsh government and <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> rates, but there was far less of the violence that had scalded the area earlier in the century.|$|E
25|$|Brazil's main {{competitive}} advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria {{out of all}} countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many World Heritage sites. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), {{with the quality of}} roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and <b>high</b> <b>taxation.</b> Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Wu, on {{the other}} hand, sparked debate when he intervened into the economy {{to pay for his}} wars. His {{interventions}} were hotly debated between the Reformists, who were composed mainly of Confucian scholars favoring laissez-faire policies, and the Modernists, a group of government officials who supported the state monopolies on salt and iron and <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> policies that Emperor Wu had pioneered. These debates were recorded in the book Discourses on Salt and Iron, an important document showing ancient Chinese economic thought. Although the Modernist policies were followed through most of the Western Han after Emperor Wu, the Reformists repealed these policies in Eastern Han, save for the government monopoly on minting coins.|$|E
5000|$|The temperance {{movement}} of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in combination with First World War emergency measures, introduced a number of changes, such as <b>higher</b> <b>taxation</b> on beer, lower strengths, a ban on [...] "buying a round" [...] and restricted opening hours. Most were gradually repealed over subsequent decades.|$|R

25|$|Edward III's son, the Black Prince died in 1376, a {{year before}} his father, which meant that the next king was Edward's eleven-year-old {{grandson}} Richard II (1377–1399). England continued to lay claim to France, and remained at war until 1396; <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> {{to pay for the}} war caused several peasant uprisings. During this period large quantities of inferior quality European coins circulated alongside the high-quality English coins, producing a real-life example of Gresham's law as English coins were smuggled to the continent to be melted down, alloyed with other metals and remanufactured as fake pennies and returned to England. Pennies were produced at London, York and Durham, and inscribed RICARDUS REX ANGLIE, RICARDUS REX ANGLE Z FRANC, RICARDUS REX ANGLIE Z, RICARD REX ANGL Z FRANC, RICARD REX ANGLIE or RICARDUS REX ANGL Z F.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Mycenae's wealth {{came from}} the trading they did {{along the coast of}} the Mediterranean. When power passed from the Minoans to the Mycenae, Crete and Rhodes became major trading points. Trading {{eventually}} moved further north, as far as Mount Olympus. With the growing power and influence, trading went as far as Egypt, Sicily, and the coast of Italy. Other sites where pottery was discovered are Baltic, Asia Minor, Spain, and most of the Aegean. Another society that the Mycenae traded with were the Neolithic. Around 1250BC, the Mycenae combined forces to take over Troy due to <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> of ships through the channel among other reasons. With the fall of Troy, the production of pottery declined and many families moved to avoid the fighting. Pottery did not become a lost art form like many others, but it became more rugged.|$|E
25|$|Short and {{frequently}} ended through violence, Phanariote rules were usually marked by political corruption, intrigue, and <b>high</b> <b>taxation,</b> {{as well as}} by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory; nonetheless, they also saw attempts at legislative and administrative modernization inspired by The Enlightenment (such as Constantine Mavrocordatos' decision to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as Scarlat Callimachi's Code), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.|$|E

25|$|Al-Jazzar {{understood}} {{well that}} in order to maintain his political and military dominance in Syria, his rule needed a solid economic foundation. Al-Jazzar acquired his income from a variety of means, namely taxes, commerce, tolls and extortion. As such, he continued and strengthened the lucrative monopolies on cotton and grain that were established by Zahir. In the 1780s, he expelled French cotton traders from Acre and Jaffa. Improvements in agricultural development and increased trade from Palestine bolstered the economic prosperity of certain enclaves of territory in his domain, particularly the coastal cities of Acre, Sidon and Beirut. He successfully suppressed marauding Bedouin tribes and thus increased security and maintained order in his territories. Although he attempted to attract immigrants, including Christians and Jews, to settle in his domains, al-Jazzar's institution and strict enforcement of a stringent and <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> policy heavily burdened the population to the point that many emigrated from the areas he ruled to neighboring regions.|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{indicate}} the Galicia and Lodomeria was poorer than areas west of it. The {{average income per capita}} did not exceed 53 Rhine guilders (RG), {{as compared to}} 91 RG in the Kingdom of Poland, 100 in Hungary and more than 450 RG in England at that time. Also the taxes were relatively high and equalled to 9 Rhine guilders a year (ca. 17% of yearly income), as compared to 5% in Prussia and 10% in England. Also the percentage of people with higher income was much lower than {{in other parts of the}} Monarchy and Europe: the luxury tax, paid by people whose yearly income exceeded 600 RG, was paid by 8 people in every 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to 28 in Bohemia and 99 in Lower Austria. Despite <b>high</b> <b>taxation,</b> the national debt of the Galician government exceeded 300 million RG at all times, that is approximately 60 RG per capita.|$|E
25|$|Having England {{as an ally}} {{meant that}} the {{military}} situation of the Republic was strongly improved, but this very fact induced William to be uncompromising in his position towards France. This policy led to {{a large number of}} very expensive campaigns which were largely paid for with Dutch funds. In 1712 the Republic was financially exhausted; it withdrew from international politics and was forced to let its fleet deteriorate, making what was by then the Kingdom of Great Britain the dominant maritime power of the world. The Dutch economy, already burdened by the high national debt and concomitant <b>high</b> <b>taxation,</b> suffered from the other European states' protectionist policies, which its weakened fleet was no longer able to resist. To make matters worse, the main Dutch trading and banking houses moved much of their activity from Amsterdam to London after 1688. Between 1688 and 1720, world trade dominance shifted from the Republic to Britain.|$|E

In 2006 a litre of 3 Hammers could be bought for £1.19, cheaper by volume than a bottle of Perrier water at 99p for 75. It can be purchased in Salisbury Store for £3.89 a bottle, which is considered a low price considering its high alcohol content.|$|R
25|$|The {{platforms}} for the {{two major}} national parties were similar in many respects. Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada (countries with which the islands had strong cultural and economic links); encouraging and expanding tourism; working to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Federation and to obtain loans, financial aid, and technical assistance. Despite these similarities, there were differences. The WIFLP had advocated the encouragement of agriculture while the DLP had promised a climate favourable to both private industry and labour, development of human and economic resources. The WIFLP promised to encourage the Bahamas (in addition to British Guiana and British Honduras) to join the Federation, whereas the DLP did not. The WIFLP also campaigned to establish a central bank for the extension of credit resources and advocated a democratic socialist society and full internal self-government for all the unit territories, whilst avoiding the issues of freedom of movement and a customs union. The DLP said nothing about full internal self-government, attacked socialism, wished to avoid <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> (via loans and technical aid) and emphasized West Indian unity, freedom of worship and speech, and encouragement of trade unions.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives won {{a convincing}} {{majority}} at the 1959 general election, increasing their lead over their nearest rivals, Labour. The Labour party were further weakened by internal disputes, but the Conservatives' economic policies unveiled in the 1960 Budget proved damaging. The tax cuts of 1959 were reversed, decreasing the government's popularity while the Liberals began a revival. The Conservatives {{were forced into}} third place in several by-elections, culminating {{in the loss of}} the previously safe seat of Orpington (neighbouring Macmillan's Bromley seat) in a March 1962 by-election victory for the Liberal candidate, Eric Lubbock. The by-election result, announced on 14 March, came one day after the Blackpool North by-election, another former Conservative safe seat; though the Conservative candidate Norman Miscampbell succeeded in holding the Blackpool North seat, the previous majority of 15,587 was reduced to just 973 by the Liberal candidate, Harry Hague. The Conservatives were struggling with deep unpopularity over their economic policies. A pay-pause and rising prices, together with discontent at <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> that was demonstrably inequitable, drove voters to protest against government policies by switching their votes to the Liberals, or by abstaining from voting Conservative.|$|E
25|$|After the Ridda Wars, {{a tribal}} chief of north eastern Arabia, Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, raided the Persian towns in Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq). Abu Bakr {{was strong enough}} to attack the Persian Empire in the {{north-east}} and the Byzantine Empire in the north-west. There were three purposes for this conquest: 1. Along the borders between Arabia and these two great empires were numerous Arab tribes leading a nomadic life and forming a buffer-like state between the Persians and Romans. Abu Bakr hoped that these tribes might accept Islam and help their brethren in spreading it. 2. The Persian and Roman populations suffered with very <b>high</b> <b>taxation</b> laws; Abu Bakr believed that they might be persuaded to help the Muslims, who agreed to release them from the excessive tributes. 3. Two gigantic empires surrounded Arabia, and it was unsafe to remain passive with these two powers on its borders. Abu Bakr hoped that by attacking Iraq and Syria he might remove the danger from the borders of the Islamic State. With the success of the raids, a considerable amount of booty was collected. Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha went to Medina to inform Caliph Abu Bakr about his success and was appointed commander of his people, after which he began to raid deeper into Mesopotamia. Using the mobility of his light cavalry he could easily raid any town near the desert and disappear again into the desert, into which the Sassanid army was unable to chase them. Al-Muthanna's acts made Abu Bakr think about the expansion of the Rashidun Empire.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{employment}} protection, stricter EPL is mostly {{associated with lower}} participation rates—except in Western Europe—and higher unemployment rates. Similarly, <b>higher</b> labor <b>taxation</b> is negatively correlated with labor force participation—with {{the exception of the}} new member states—and positively correlated with unemployment rates, though the latter result is less robust. <b>High</b> labor <b>taxation,</b> associated with long-term unemployment, appears to be a major problem in Europe. Overall, the strictness of EPL and high labor taxes lower the employment rate.|$|R

50|$|Supply-side {{economics}} {{holds that}} increased taxation steadily reduces economic trade between economic participants within {{a nation and}} that it discourages investment.

As such, <b>higher</b> <b>taxation</b> leads to lower levels of specialization and lower economic efficiency. The idea is said to be illustrated by the Laffer curve.
