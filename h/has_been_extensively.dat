5|$|Cecil Roland McKenzie {{was a young}} {{electrical}} engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in Auburn on New Years Eve 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, Greenwich Point complete with a wireless room in the attic. The house remains, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> renovated since the McKenzies lived there.|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> embanked, {{and many}} of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is {{vulnerable}} to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks that}} form Snowdon were {{produced}} by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, {{and the mountain}} was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest.|$|E

The centre is constructed using timber-frame walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E

It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> redeveloped {{during the last few}} decades, and its two shopping centres, Town Square and the Spindles, now provide one of the largest covered retail areas in Greater Manchester. The Spindles (named with reference to textile spindles) is a modern shopping centre with over 40 retailers, banks, building societies and catering outlets. It houses one of Europe's largest stained glass roofs, created by local artist Brian Clarke in celebration of the music of one of Oldham's famous sons, composer and conductor Sir William Walton.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} Waterfall Gully <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> logged, and early {{agricultural}} interests saw {{the cultivation of}} a variety of introduced species as crops, along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries. Attempts to mine the area were largely unsuccessful, but the region housed one of the state's earliest water-powered mills, and a weir erected in the early 1880s provided for part of the City of Burnside's water supply. Today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks.|$|E
5|$|Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie {{region have}} been {{observed}} due to increased adult mortality, especially of males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes.

As of 2011 he has raised more than £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects {{to improve the lives of}} children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Temple 22 (Structure 5D-22) is a south-facing {{building}} located centrally on {{the north}} side of the basal platform. Temple 22 underwent three principal phases of construction. The earliest version of this structure was built around AD 250; a second version of the temple was built over it around AD 350; this version was decorated with giant stucco masks. The final version of the temple dates to the 5th century AD. Temple 22 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> investigated by archaeologists with portions of the 5th-century architecture being stripped away to expose the earlier versions. A tomb in the Temple 22 was looted at some point during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Defence {{launched}} Project MoDEL (Ministry of Defence Estates London) in 2006 {{to consolidate}} {{many of its}} London-based operations at RAF Northolt. Under the project, RAF Bentley Priory, RAF Uxbridge, RAF West Ruislip, RAF Eastcote and the Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill were all closed between 2006 and 2010 with any remaining units transferring to Northolt. The Air Historical Branch, originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War, was also relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory in 2008 {{as part of this}} project. As a result, the station <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> redeveloped with new facilities to support these operations.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E
5|$|Vega <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> {{studied by}} astronomers, leading {{it to be}} termed “arguably the next most {{important}} star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded. It {{was one of the first}} stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.|$|E
5|$|Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1927, Dworsky {{lived in}} the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls, South Dakota before {{attending}} the University of Michigan. Dworsky was a four-year starter for Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1945 to 1948. He played linebacker, fullback, and center for the Michigan Wolverines and was a key player on the undefeated 1947 and 1948 Michigan football teams that won consecutive national championships. The 1947 team, anchored by Len Ford, Alvin Wistert, Dworsky and Rick Kempthorn, {{has been described as}} {{the best team in the}} history of Michigan football. Dworsky won a total of six varsity letters at Michigan, four in football and two in wrestling where he competed in the heavyweight division. Dworsky is among the famous Jews in football, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> profiled in encyclopedic Jewish publications. Dworsky married the former Sylvia Ann Taylor on August 10, 1957. The couple has three children: Douglas, Laurie and Nancy. They reside in Los Angeles.|$|E
