Also, the state and the region, the major funders of the project, are seeking new methods of financing, perhaps through the participation of public management (including Seine-Arche and La Défense) or via a public-private partnership. Departments, municipalities, and public institutions of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> (EPCI) may also be sought.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the detainees had no connection with the events in Kuala Lumpur, for example, several Baptist Church members in Petaling Jaya were arrested for allegedly converting seven Malays, and at least nine PAS members were arrested for making claims about Christians converting Malays. Many of those detained were also not involved in creating racial tensions; for example, Chandra Muzzafar, chairman of Aliran whose philosophy involves <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and members of Insan, a social reformist group that campaigned against exploitation of the poor, and Environment Protection Society of Malaysia, were also arrested. [...] A categorisation of the initially named detainees, numbering 97, gives the following breakdown: political parties: 37; social movements: 23; individuals: 37.|$|E
40|$|Concentration and recentralization can be {{described}} as a European trend in the fi eld of local governance, especially in the fi eld of the administration of rural areas. An important tool of the concentration of the local administration is the <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The Hungarian rural areas have fragmented spatial structures. Because of the fragmentation and the small number of the voluntary associations these types of local cooperation were signifi cantly supported by the central budget in the 1990 s and 2000 s. The economic crisis resulted a strong concentration trend in Hungary, as well. The new Hungarian Municipal Code introduced a Janus-faced model. The administration of the rural areas was strongly concentrated by the establishment of the mandatory common municipal offi ces of the small villages (under 2000 inhabitants) while the forms of the intercommunal associations were simplifi ed. This reform reduced the number of local offi ces signifi cantly. This type of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> became the main form of the j oined public service management as well, because the former signifi cant state aid of the voluntary associations have been reduced. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of cities and}} their regions into transnational networks has become a key municipal strategy, {{with the creation of}} a metropolitan governance structure being seen in this context as a fundamental element. The Szczecin Metropolitan Area constitutes an example of meagre results in <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> in post-socialist East-Central Europe. This has its repercussions on the task of creating cross-border metropolitan governance structures including adjacent German counties, a task which, in turn, may help to overcome development barriers. This becomes apparent particularly in the process of defining joint development objectives as well as an image for the cross-border metropolitan regio...|$|E
40|$|German {{municipalities}} {{are expected}} to suffer from intense demographic changes in the upcoming decades, {{not only in the}} form of population losses, but also through a changing demographic structure. We assess local governments' vulnerability to the fiscal consequences of these demographic transformations (using a sample of 1021 German municipalities) by determining the elasticity of local government cost functions to municipalities' demographic characteristics. Our findings indicate that smaller municipalities are especially vulnerable to increasing cost pressures. In the absence of increased higher-level government support, these findings would support a case for boundary reviews or more extensive <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation.</b> demographic change, cost elasticity, economies of scale, rolling regression, German municipalities...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this diploma thesis will be an {{introduction}} of a process of municipalities involvement in international relationships for which a term paradiplomacy has been established. The aim of the thesis is {{to point out the}} origins of formation of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the villages of canton Bern and South Bohemia. A case study of a chosen South Bohemian city Sezimovo Ústí and Swiss village Thierachern will be used. Mapping of the first steps in the nineties of the twentieth century which lead to relationship establishment and its progressive development until now will be necessary. Interviews with representatives of both municipalities using an oral history method will {{become an integral part of}} this thesis. Methods of politology, history and sociology will be used to write this diploma thesis...|$|E
40|$|At the moment, {{the rural}} area of Lorraine which has {{experienced}} a regressive process {{for a long time}} is going through a process of tangible regeneration. On the one hand, this {{is the result of a}} general structural change, in the course of which even the sparsely populated rural areas have gained new functions. There is evidence for this revival in the rural landscape, for example, there is an increased tendency to preserve and renew the village structures which have been degraded. Nonetheless, fundamental development problems remain: despite a general improvement of the demographic development, there are still some areas in which the exodus of the rural population has not yet been halted. The process of concentration in farming, which still continues and which even has accelerated recently, means that the problems linked to this, still remain. The political-geographical dissipation in many small communities and in many particular interests is one of the greatest development impediments in the rural area. It is above all here that promising development perspectives have opened up: the concept of a local development, linked to various forms of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation,</b> provides suitable instruments of development and therefore intervenes sucessfully in the process of regeneration in the rural area. Lacking transparency remains a problem, which results from the manifold various initiatives and cooperation possibilities. Additionally, the concept of local development and <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> has not yet had its effects in all areas. Due to the binding of state subsidies and regional subventions to the existance of a local development planning, there is further danger in these partial areas of being pushed out on to the periphery. The persistance of centralist structures can be seen once again in the microregion's financial limitations and the dependence on the fluctuating state subvention allocations. It will be of major importance for the future development, that the independence and stability of the microregionsare promoted in an appropriate manner by long-term financial and instrumental provision...|$|E
40|$|E-Government doesn’t concern only {{technological}} innovation in Public Administration, {{but most of}} all organizational innovation through the adoption of organizational models enabled by the use of ICTs. One model of this kind, that in countries characterized by a high number of Small Local Government Organizations (SLGOs) can be adopted also to reduce the administrative fragmentation, is inter-organizational cooperation among SLGOs. This is the model the Italian National Center for Information Technology in Public Administration (CNIPA) adopted in the action plan to promote E-Government in Local Public Administration in Italy. However, inter-organizational cooperation requires the partners to interoperate, at least in the areas which are the object of the cooperation. One possibility which guarantees interoperability of different organizations consists in the adoption of a shared cooperative environment. Depending on how binding are the conditions which define it, the cooperative environment can determine different levels of interoperability, up to organizational interoperability (cooperability). In the case of cooperation among organizations which can be heterogeneous, one of the conditions defining the cooperative environment is the sharing of an “enterprise model” for the cooperation. In the paper we describe some of the conditions that define a cooperative environment and introduce a system for the description and the classification of different forms of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> for services provision...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{highlight}} {{the way in which}} the small towns in Bihor County, Romania are trying to find again their place and part in the upsetting territorial construction, through various mutations of their functions, after the fall of the communist regime. The setup of the Territorial Planning Units (TPUs) in the effort to optimize the territorial development through construction of structures of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation,</b> turned some small towns in Bihor County into poles of local development. The question that this study intends to answer is: Are these towns capable to assume this role, considering the relict structures inherited from the communist past? In order to answer it, we considered the development potential of the small towns as a tool of assessment and validation of the viability of the poles imposed by the intercommunal construction. Thus, we carried out the comparison between the real development poles, highlighted by the analysis of potential, and non-viable development poles, imposed by the intercommunal construction, thus resulting in a typology. The suggested typology identifies three types of development poles: viable, vulnerable and non-viable. Applied to other counties as well, this typology can become a tool of assessment of the functionality of the intercommunal construction. </p...|$|E
40|$|The region Walgau {{is located}} in the Austrian Federal State of Vorarlberg. The 21 {{municipalities}} started a three years development programme to develop common goals and to enhance the <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The region is characterized by a dispersed structure of settlement and differences between the more agricultural oriented mountainside and the more industrialized bottom of the valley. For this one of the main goals of process is to establish a regional learning process about different requirements and living conditions. The increasing meaning of the Web 2. 0 (social web) is discussed in different fields of politics and society but less in regional development activities. The Web 2. 0 means the interactive part of the Internet in which users generate their own environments and issues by communicating, sharing, collecting and co-working. User analyses show that users of different social networks have an average age between 25 and 35 years and represent a generation which weekly is represented in local and regional participation processes. At a first glance it seems promising to use such platforms to enhance the group of activists and to promote the issues of a regional development process. But the experiment also can fail if the target group of such kind of web activities strongly differ from the actors interested in such processes. In this case we have to state that the instrument and the issue fall apart. In the regional development process 'Im Walgau' a regional Wiki starts in January 2010 as an important element of a public discourse on regional development issues. At the ERSA Conference the methodological design of the development process and the concept of communication including the web 2. 0 - application will be presented and first empirical results of internet participation can be shown...|$|E
40|$|As {{far as the}} new Laender of the Federal Republic of Germany are concerned, the Halle-Leipzig {{region is}} marked by an {{especially}} great development dynamics {{on the one hand}} but on the other, this old industrialized economic region suffers from serious structural problems. From these general conditions arise high demands on instruments of regional planning and management. When looking for regional political solutions administrative delimitations and beginnings of <b>intercommunal</b> <b>cooperation</b> are important factors of influence. Due to a strong increase in the establishment of shopping centres in particular in the urban regions of the two core cities of Halle and Leipzig there is a great need for action. A large number of failings caused by insufficient coordination amongst private investment activities and public planning are to be noted here. Among others, problems arise from the approval {{of a large number of}} trading estates and large-scale retail projects without considering the actual surface required and the consequences to be expected for hierarchy of urban centres. Already now it is obvious that for a long time both the lack of regional development concepts in the phase of strongest industrial location and the questionable reorganisation of the Laender and districts with its negative effects will have an influence on the development perspectives of the region. Thus, the drawing-up of the new border between Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt right through the agglomeration of Halle-Leipzig created an extremely unfavourable starting point for planning activities. In order not to spoil the region's prospects by further mistakes in regional development it is urgently necessary that the state and regional development plans come into effect as soon as possible and that political and economic decision-makers come together to work out solutions for the whole region. However, the administrative bodies necessary for an understanding of the participants and for the establishment of a regional network have still to be created. In Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt a division of labour between authorities of regional planning and town-hinterland associations to be established still is urgently necessary. As far Karin Wiest The Halle-Leipzig Region - Administrative organisation and beginnings of cooperation Europa Regional, 1 (1993) 2, pp. 1 - 11 as the cooperation of the two Laender is concerned, optimal concepts of action for the agglomeration of Halle-Leipzig are impeded by differing legal bases of planning and formalities. In this context, the possibility of establishing regional districts is being discussed in order to make political structures more efficient and to be closer to the problems. A union of the towns and districts to form a common planning region of Halle-Leipzig in the sense of a regional district, however, would involve another administrative reform which in the medium term is not possible to realise and is, therefore, no realistic alternative for the near future. In order to ensure a positive development of the region in the long run regional functions of cooperation an management bound to solid institutions cannot be renounced with. However, the scope of these institutions should not be limited to discussions and exchange of information but include concepts of action suited to realise all-regional interests...|$|E
