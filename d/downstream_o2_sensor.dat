50|$|The {{titanium}} <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{was used}} throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s on a limited basis. This sensor’s semiconductor construction makes its operation {{different from that of}} the zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b> Instead of generating its own voltage, the titanium <b>O2</b> <b>sensor’s</b> electrical resistance changes according to the exhaust oxygen content. When the air/fuel ratio is rich, the resistance of the sensor is around 950 ohms and more than 21 kilohms when the mixture is lean. As with the zirconia <b>sensor,</b> the titanium <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is also considered a narrow-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|R

For markets which unleaded fuel was {{rare in the}} early 90's, e.g. Eastern Europe ...|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the main}} problem with any narrow-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is that the ECM only detects that the mixture is slightly richer or leaner than the stoichiometric ratio. The ECM does not measure the operating air-fuel ratio outside the stoichiometric range. In effect it only detects that the mixture is richer or leaner than stoichiometry. An <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> voltage that goes lower than 450 mV will cause a widening of injector pulse and vice versa. The resulting changing or cycling fuel control (closed-loop) O2 signal is what the technician sees on the scope when probing at the <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> signal wire.|$|R
50|$|The newer “wide-band” <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{solves the}} narrow sensing {{problem of the}} {{previous}} zirconia sensors. These sensors are often called by different names such as continuous lambda sensors (lambda representing air-fuel ratio), AFR (air-fuel ratio sensors), LAF (lean air-fuel <b>sensor)</b> and wide-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b> Regardless of the name, the principle is the same, which {{is to put the}} ECM {{in a better position to}} control the air/fuel mixture. In effect, the wide-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> can detect the exhaust’s O2 content way below or above the perfect air/fuel ratio. Such control is needed on new lean burning engines with extremely low emission output levels. Tighter emission regulations and demands for better fuel economy are driving this newer fuel control technology.|$|R
25|$|An {{automotive}} oxygen <b>sensor</b> (<b>O2</b> <b>sensor)</b> is {{also known}} as a lambda probe, sensor, sond, or sonde.|$|R
50|$|The early {{introduction}} of the oxygen sensor came about in the late 1970s. Since then zirconia has been the material of choice for its construction. The zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> produces its own voltage, which production makes it a type of generator. The varying voltage will display on a scope as a waveform somewhat resembling a sine wave when in closed loop control. The actual voltage that is generated {{is a measure of}} the oxygen that is needed to complete the combustion of the CO and HC present at the sensor tip. The stoichiometric air-fuel ratio mixture ratio for gasoline engine is the theoretical air-fuel ratio at which all of the fuel will react with all of the available oxygen resulting in complete combustion. At or near this ratio, the combustion process produces the best balance between power and low emissions. At the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, the generated <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> voltage is about 450 mV. The Engine Control Module (ECM) recognizes a rich condition above the 450 mV level, and a lean condition below it, but does not detect the extent of the richness or leanness. It is for this reason that the zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is called a “narrow-band” <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{constantly}} measures {{residual oxygen}} in the exhaust gases and this information is sent to 32-bit powertrain control module (PCM), which continuously optimizes the air/fuel mix ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{difficulties}} adapting the M-block {{to the second}} generation of emissions controls. Unlike previous Ford engines, Thermactor and exhaust gas recirculation features had already been built into the 351M and 400 engine, rendering adaptation to electronic feedback fuel/air systems difficult. One requirement of the second-generation equipment was an oxygen (<b>O2)</b> <b>sensor</b> in the exhaust, {{which had to be}} placed before the Thermactor air was added. Since Thermactor air was injected right into the block's exhaust ports in the M-block, there was nowhere for the <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> to go.|$|R
50|$|The {{wide-band}} <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> looks {{similar in}} appearance {{to the regular}} zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b> Its inner construction and operation are totally different, however. The wide-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is composed of two inner layers called the reference cell and the pump cell. The ECM’s AFR sensor circuitry always tries to keep a perfect air/fuel ratio inside a special monitoring chamber (diffusion chamber or pump-cell circuit) by way of controlling its current. The AFR sensor uses dedicated electronic circuitry to set a pumping current in the sensor’s pump cell. In other words, if the air/fuel mixture is lean, the pump cell circuit voltage momentarily goes low and the ECM immediately regulates the current going through {{it in order to}} maintain a set voltage value or stoichiometric ratio inside the diffusion chamber. The pump cell then discharges the excess oxygen through the diffusion gap by means of the current created in the pump-cell circuit. The ECM senses the current and widens injector pulsation accordingly to add fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{assembled}} controller takes {{input from}} several sensors {{in order to}} manage the fuel injectors, including a throttle position sensor (TPS), exhaust gas oxygen <b>sensor</b> (EGO or <b>O2</b> <b>sensor),</b> MAP sensor, tach signal (or crank position sensor), {{intake air temperature sensor}} (IAT), and a coolant temperature sensor (CLT). The latter two sensors themselves are usually the General Motors type, although the controller can recalibrated to use other sensors including Ford and Bosch.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "cold" [...] engine {{makes the}} {{computer}} change the fuel air ratio so the output voltage of the <b>o2</b> <b>sensor</b> switches between about 100 and 850/900 mV {{and after a}} while the sensor may output a switch voltage between about 200 and 700/750 mV, for turbocharged cars even less.|$|R

50|$|Another major {{difference}} between the wide-band AFR sensor and a zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is that it has}} an operating temperature of about 750 C. On these units the temperature is very critical and for this reason a special pulse-width controlled heater circuit is employed to control the heater temperature precisely. The ECM controls the heater circuit.|$|R
50|$|Molecular oxygen (O2) {{directly}} oxidizes many compounds {{to produce}} useful products in an organism, such as antibiotics, etc., in reactions catalyzed by oxygenases.

40|$|Long-term in-vivo {{electrochemistry}} (LIVE) enables {{real-time monitoring}} and measurement of brain metabolites. In this study we have simultaneously obtained blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and amperometric tissue O(2) data from rat cerebral cortex, during both increases and decreases in inspired O(2) content. BOLD and tissue O(2) measurements demonstrated close correlation (r= 0. 7898) during complete (0 %) O(2) removal, with marked negative responses occurring ca. 30 s after the onset of O(2) removal. Conversely, when the inspired O(2) was increased (50, 70 and 100 % O(2) for 1 min) similar positive rapid changes (ca. 15 s) in both the BOLD and tissue O(2) signals were observed. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the practical feasibility of obtaining real-time metabolite information during fMRI acquisition, and that tissue O(2) concentration monitored using an <b>O(2)</b> <b>sensor</b> can serve as an index {{of changes in the}} magnitude of the BOLD response. As LIVE <b>O(2)</b> <b>sensors</b> can be used in awake animals performing specific behavioural tasks the technique provides a viable animal surrogate of human fMRI experimentation...|$|R
50|$|If on {{the other}} hand the air/fuel mixture goes rich, the pump cell circuit voltage rapidly climbs high and the ECM {{immediately}} reverses the current polarity to readjust the pump cell circuit voltage to its set stable value. The pump cell then pumps oxygen into the monitoring chamber by way of the reversed current in the ECM’s AFR pump cell circuit. The ECM detects the reversed current and an injector pulsation-reduction command is issued bringing the mixture back to lean. Since the current in the pump cell circuit is also proportional to the oxygen concentration or deficiency in the exhaust, it serves as an index of the air/fuel ratio. The ECM is constantly monitoring the pump cell current circuitry, which it always tries to keep at a set voltage. For this reason, the techniques used to test and diagnose the regular zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{can not be used to}} test the wide-band AFR sensor. These sensors are current-driven devices and do not have a cycling voltage waveform. The testing procedures, which will be discussed later, are quite different from the older <b>O2</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|R

40|$|A novel thermal {{analysis}} technique – Dynamic Elemental Thermal Analysis (DETA) – is demonstrated for the characterisation of biomass.

At an illustrative temperature of 500 °C for a Spotted Gum biomass, 17 % of the biomass carbon is retained in the biochar. The results are used to estimate the potential revenue from each product of the heating process. The economic assessment showed that bio-oil (being the largest fraction) would provide the greatest income stream as either renewable electricity or when sold as crude liquid. The sequestration of carbon as biochar would be the smallest income stream for a carbon price of $ 23 /tonne CO₂ (around 4 % total revenue).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Compact and {{automated}} sensors are desired {{for assessing}} the health of cell cultures in biotechnology experiments. While several single-analyte sensors exist to measure culture health, a multi-analyte sensor would simplify the cell culture system. One such multi-analyte sensor, the Paratrend 7 manufactured by Diametrics Medical, consists of three optical fibers for measuring pH, dissolved carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), dissolved oxygen (pO(2)), and a thermocouple to measure temperature. The sensor bundle was designed for intra-vascular measurements in clinical settings, {{and can be used}} in bioreactors operated both on the ground and in NASA's Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) experiments. METHODS: A Paratrend 7 sensor was placed at the outlet of a bioreactor inoculated with BHK- 21 (baby hamster kidney) cells. The pH, pCO(2), pO(2), and temperature data were transferred continuously to an external computer. Cell culture medium, manually extracted from the bioreactor through a sampling port, was also assayed using a bench top blood gas analyzer (BGA). RESULTS: Two Paratrend 7 sensors were used over a single cell culture experiment (64 days). When compared to the manually obtained BGA samples, the sensor had good agreement for pH, pCO(2), and pO(2) with bias (and precision) 0. 005 (0. 024), 8. 0 mmHg (4. 4 mmHg), and 11 mmHg (17 mmHg), respectively for the first two sensors. A third Paratrend sensor (operated for 141 days) had similar agreement (0. 02 +/- 0. 15 for pH, - 4 +/- 8 mm Hg for pCO(2), and 24 +/- 18 mmHg for pO(2)). CONCLUSION: The resulting biases and precisions are com- parable to Paratrend sensor clinical results. Although the pO(2) differences may be acceptable for clinically relevant measurement ranges, the <b>O(2)</b> <b>sensor</b> in this bundle may not be reliable enough for the ranges of pO(2) in these cell culture studies without periodic calibration...|$|R

40|$|Teleost fish {{possess a}} unique, pH-sensitive {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) that, {{in the presence}} of an acidosis, substantially reduces the affinity and carrying capacity for O₂ (Root effect). To date, this efficient O₂ delivery mechanism is only known for filling a swim bladder (SB) against huge pressure gradients (> 50 atm) associated with depth and for oxygenating the metabolically active, yet avascular retinal tissue of the eye. In spite of the clear benefits to O₂ delivery for buoyancy and vision, no study has been conducted to determine whether the Root effect may be important in optimizing O₂ delivery to other tissues such as muscle, which is the focus of this research. During environmental or exercise-induced stress, blood pH may fall; however, some fish regulate red blood cell (RBC) intracellular pH (pHi) by releasing catecholamines that activate the sodium/proton (Na⁺/H⁺) exchanger (βNHE) on the RBC membrane. The βNHE removes H⁺s from the RBC resulting in an intracellular alkalosis, an increase in Hb–O₂ affinity, and O₂ uptake at the respiratory surfaces is safeguarded, which is the ultimate goal of this mechanism. In our proposed model, when adrenergically stimulated blood encounters plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme found in the RBC but also membrane-bound and potentially plasma-accessible in select locations, it will catalyze H⁺s removed from the RBC to form CO₂. This CO₂ will back-diffuse into the RBC creating an intracellular acidosis (extracellular alkalosis), reducing Hb–O₂ affinity, and ultimately elevating PO₂ via the Root effect. We created an in vitro closed system using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) blood where we can (1) simulate an acid-induced Root effect, (2) adrenergically stimulate the RBCs, and finally (3) short-circuit the βNHE via CA (CA-mediated Root effect), all of which can be monitored in real-time (Fig. 1). Data generated currently support our Hypothesis: adrenergic RBC pH regulation can be short-circuited {{in the presence of}} plasma-accessible CA, therefore generating a Root effect increase in PO₂. In fact, if this scenario also occurs in the tissues of O. mykiss, CA-mediated short-circuiting of adrenergic pH regulation can facilitate an increase in PO₂ over 30 times that which would be generated in vertebrates possessing only a Bohr shift! We are ready to test our model in vivo by implanting fiber-optic <b>O₂</b> <b>sensors</b> in O. mykiss muscle while simulating environmental and exercise stress with and without CA blockers. Furthermore, even though CA is not found in general circulation, there are membrane-bound and potentially plasma-accessible isoforms in muscle endothelia, and research is underway to localize this enzyme to understand the relationship between location and function of the short-circuiting. Teleost fish, which are more numerous than all other vertebrates combined (terrestrial and aquatic), have evolved an extraordinary O₂ delivery mechanism, the Root effect, that allows O₂ delivery to the eye and to the SB, thus allowing efficient buoyancy regulation, which {{may be one of the}} most important factors responsible for the extensive adaptive radiation in teleost fishes. Therefore, it is particularly interesting that the Root effect has not yet been investigated for general O₂ delivery. If the Root effect can also facilitate general O₂ delivery in vivo, which our data currently support, this would help shed insight into how the Root effect was selected for prior to the evolution of the βNHE, choroid gland and retia of the eye, and the gas gland and rete mirabile associated with the SB...|$|R
