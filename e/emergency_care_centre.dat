50|$|In 2013, a £110m <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> {{development}} was completed. This {{was the first}} time that the Foresterhill campus had hosted emergency and urgent care facilities in the same building, and 75% of the beds in the centre are single-occupancy.|$|E
50|$|Alberti drove {{controversial}} {{changes to}} <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in the UK, leading to some hospitals losing {{their status as}} <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|R
50|$|In November 2012, {{a public}} {{interest}} writ petition was {{filed in the}} Madras High Court citing {{the lack of a}} full-fledged <b>emergency</b> medical <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> at the terminus. Further to this, the Southern Railway invited expression of interest from several hospitals in the city to establish a medical <b>care</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} was built between 1973-78 and officially opened 15 June 1979. A new <b>Emergency</b> and Urgent <b>Care</b> <b>centre</b> was opened in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Kent Oncology Centre {{is partly}} housed on this site. The {{specialist}} centre provides cancer {{services for the}} whole of Kent and also Hastings and Rother. The hospital also has a £2m <b>Emergency</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centre,</b> {{which was one of the}} first of its kind in the country to offer full A&E services, a GP out-of-hours service and a walk-in centre under one roof.|$|E
50|$|In March 2005 {{planning}} permission was granted for a £1 billion redevelopment {{and expansion of}} the Royal London Hospital. Sited {{on the grounds of}} the existing hospital, the redevelopment will replace the hospital's previously demolished facilities, some of which date back to when the hospital moved to its existing site in 1757. On completion of the project, the hospital will have London’s leading trauma and <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre,</b> one of Europe’s largest renal services and the capital’s second biggest paediatric service. Barts is also undergoing redevelopment and will become a cancer and cardiac centre of excellence.|$|E
50|$|A {{major new}} wing {{to the south}} of the current tower block started in 2007 and was {{completed}} in 2010 as part of plans to centralise acute services by the NHS trust at this hospital. This included an <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre,</b> maternity unit (to replace those in Forth Park), critical care, coronary care, ultrasound department and 11 new operating theatres. A new A & E department will form part of the new development, among other re-located services. The area surrounding the hospital will include signal controlled junctions; a new mini-roundabout and a possible park and ride system to prevent traffic gridlock in the area. New car spaces will also be provided at both the north and south ends of the hospital.|$|E
50|$|Harlow {{is served}} by the NHS Princess Alexandra Hospital, {{situated}} {{on the edge of}} The High, which is the main Town Centre area of Harlow. This hospital has a 24-hour Accident & <b>Emergency</b> and Urgent <b>Care</b> <b>Centre.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 15 April 2013, a new <b>emergency</b> medical <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> was opened. The centre {{has three}} beds, two doctors on duty {{and another on}} standby, four nurses, a {{paramedic}} team, and a round-the-clock ambulance. The centre is equipped with oxygen cylinders, an ECG, a defibrillator and resuscitation equipment. The terminus is the first railway station {{in the country to}} have facilities of an ambulance.|$|R
40|$|The “crisis” in out {{of hours}} primary care 1 2 and {{availability}} of new development funding 3 have prompted new service arrangements, primarily general practice cooperatives and primary <b>care</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>centres.</b> Nurse telephone triage is an adjunct to cooperatives and primary <b>care</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>centres</b> in which trained nurses receive, assess, and manage calls by giving advice or by referral to the general practitioner or ambulance service. 4 These services are established elsewhere but are an innovation in the United Kingdom. This paper reports a pilot study of a United Kingdom based nurse telephone triage service. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Primary Care Services: Daytime only (Monday to Friday from 8AM to 7PM, Saturdays 10AM to 4PM) Primary Care Services by Nurse Practitioner/Physician and/or other {{resident}} and/or visiting professionals, {{are available}} by appointment (306-883-4400) at Spiritwood Health Complex, but {{subject to change}} due to weather or illness. Laboratory collection and X-rays limited to chest and extremities are available from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM (closed from 12 to 12:30 PM).

50|$|St. Bartholomew's Hospital is a {{recognised}} area {{of excellence}} {{in the fields}} of cardiovascular and cancer research, whereas the Royal London Hospital is London's leading trauma and emergency centre. To continue and sustain this standard of care, planning permission was awarded in March 2005 for a £1 billion redevelopment and expansion of the Royal London. Upon its completion in 2011, the Royal London Hospital will consolidate its position as London’s leading trauma and <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre,</b> will have one of Europe’s largest renal services and the capital’s second biggest paediatric service. St. Bartholomew's Hospital is also currently being refurbished and refitted in order to continue its specialised approach to cardiovascular and cancer care. A further £100 million has been invested in creating leading-edge research facilities at both the Whitechapel and West Smithfield/Charterhouse Square campuses.|$|E
50|$|As of 2009, the {{hospital}} comprises over 320 medical and surgical beds, and treats {{more than half}} a million patients from throughout Sydney and New South Wales each year. The Emergency Department was one of the first in NSW to implement a PECC (Psychiatric <b>Emergency</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centre),</b> in response to the high number of people with a mental illness residing in the inner suburbs of Sydney, as well as the increasing incidence of people affected by illegal, psychoactive drugs such as heroin, GHB and crystal meth. In line with the Sister's original mission, {{the hospital}} oversees the largest population of homeless people in Australia (many of whom also have a mental illness), concentrated in the neighbouring suburbs of Kings Cross, Surry Hills, and Woolloomooloo. The hospital's catchment area also includes some of Sydney's most affluent suburbs, including Vaucluse, Paddington, Bellevue Hill, Rose Bay, Point Piper and Darling Point.|$|E
50|$|The £62.5 million Brent <b>Emergency</b> <b>Care</b> and Diagnostic <b>Centre</b> (BECaD) at Central Middlesex Hospital, Park Royal, London, was {{completed}} in March 2007. The scheme was designed by HLM Architects in association with Avanti Architects and constructed by Bouygues (UK) through the PFI form of procurement.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, architects AWW {{worked with}} the {{hospital}} to re-plan five wards and medical facilities whilst maintaining the Emergency Department. The expanded facilities improve efficiency {{with the addition of}} a new Children’s <b>Emergency</b> Department, Urgent <b>Care</b> <b>Centre</b> and new <b>emergency</b> x-ray facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{opened in}} January 1994 and has rapidly expanded {{to cope with}} the expanding population in Melbourne's fast-growing western suburbs. The hospital has a capacity of 189 beds, and in April 2004 commenced a $10 million upgrade to facilities, funded by the Victorian Government, including a new <b>Emergency</b> Department, palliative <b>care</b> <b>centre,</b> increased clinical support areas, an extra theatre and better vehicle access.|$|R
40|$|We study {{whether and}} how {{physicians}} respond to financial incentives, making use of detailed register data on the health-care services provided to patients by general practitioners (GPs) in Norway over a six-year period (2006 - 11). To identify GPs' treatment responses, we exploit that specialisation in general medicine entitles the GPs to a higher consultation fee, implying a change in total and relative fee payments. To control for demand and supply factors related to becoming a specialist, we estimate a GP fixed effect model focusing on a narrow time window around the date of specialist certification. Our results show a sharp response by the GPs immediately after obtaining specialist certification and thus a higher consultation fee: the number of visits increase, while the treatment intensity (prolonged consultations, lab tests, medical procedures) decline. These {{findings are consistent with}} a theory model where (partly) profit-motivated GPs face excess demand and income effects are sufficiently small. Finally, we find no evidence for adverse health effects (measured by <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> visits) on patients due to the change in GPs' treatment behaviour after becoming a specialist...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about smoking, {{unhealthy}} use of alcohol, and risk behaviours for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in immigrants from developed and developing countries. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study of 400 patients who consulted an academic <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> at a Swiss university hospital. The odds ratios for having one or more risk behaviours were adjusted for age, gender, and education level. RESULTS: Immigrants from developing countries {{were less likely to}} use alcohol in an unhealthy manner (OR = 0. 35, 95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 57) or practise risk behaviours for STDs (OR = 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 74). They were also less likely to have any of the three studied risk behaviours (OR = 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 3). DISCUSSION: In addition to the usual determinants, health behaviours are also associated with origin; distinguishing between immigrants from developing and developed countries is useful in clinical settings. Surprisingly, patients from developing countries tend to possess several protective characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A case is {{reported}} where a flap {{cut of the}} radial slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis triggered on the proximal border of the A 2 pulley within a healed intact tendon sheath. Shaving the flap resolved the problem. This illustrates another post-traumatic mechanical cause of triggering after partial division of flexor tendons. Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1989) Triggering is a well-known complication of a partially-cut flexor tendon. Commonly, the cut tendon becomes entrapped and may then trigger on the perforation of the tendon sheath. It may also impinge on {{the entrance to the}} proximal portion of the tendon sheath (Bilos, 1977; Gordon, 1981; Schlenker, 1981). We report an unusual case in which a partial division of the flexor digitorum sublimis of the middle finger was demonstrated at operation to be triggering within an intact tendon sheath at the proximal border of the A 2 pulley. Case report A 21 -year-old right-handed woman sustained an injury to her left middle finger. A glass falling from a rack shattered as she was trying to catch it, leaving her with a handful of glass fragments. The resultant laceration {{at the base of the}} finger was irrigated and sutured at an <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> <b>centre.</b> She subsequently noted intermit-tent catching and triggering which was associated with a dull ache and a sense of loss of reaction time. When she was seen by us seven weeks after the injury, she had a healed wound just distal to the basal flexion crease of the left middle finger (Fig. 1). There was Fig. 1 Pre-operative clinical photograph showing the scar just distal to the basal flexion crease of the finger...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Emergency {{medicine}} {{is a relatively}} new specialty in Africa, with the first emergency medicine training programme only started in South Africa in 2004. Continued emergency centre development and preparedness relies on {{a better understanding of the}} quantity and category of emergency centre encounters within the various African regions. Methods: This study was conducted over four, consecutive months in 2014 using a retrospective chart review, aimed to examine the types of visits made to one emergency centre at the Grande Mbour Hospital in Mbour, Senegal. The New York University Emergency Department Algorithm was used to classify emergency centre encounters. Each diagnosis included in this study was classified per the algorithm as non-emergent; emergent but primary care treatable; emergent with <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> <b>care</b> needed but avoidable/preventable; and emergent with <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> <b>care</b> needed and not avoidable/preventable. The algorithm also categorised diagnoses of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Results: This study included 1268 diagnoses from the emergency centre. The most common presentations in Mbour, Senegal were injuries, with 302 cases (33 %), and from the category: emergent but primary care treatable, with 303 cases (33 %). In total, 174 cases (19 %) were classified as: non-emergent. While only 93 cases (10 %) were considered: <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> needed/preventable or avoidable, a substantial number (n =  218, 24 %) were categorised as: emergent with <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> <b>care</b> needed and not avoidable/preventable. Conclusion: This study provides the first description of patients presenting for <b>care</b> in the <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> of Mbour’s hospital and demonstrates the wide range of illnesses and types of trauma that the emergency centre must accommodate while contending with the limited resources available in the area. Understanding the burden of disease will help prioritise resources appropriately...|$|R
5000|$|The {{organisation}} {{is responsible}} for the provision of health and social care to the population of around 23,000 people that are resident in Shetland. [...] There are 10 GP practices in Shetland with a primary <b>care</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>centre</b> in Lerwick staffed by three salaried GPs.

40|$|Australia, {{like many}} other {{countries}} that adopted deinstitutionalisation is experiencing increased presentation at emergency departments (EDs) by patients with acute mental health and addiction needs. While different models of psychiatric <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> have been utilised within EDs {{little is known about}} the effectiveness of the care provided or how they work on a day-to-day basis. Psychiatric <b>Emergency</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centres</b> (PECCs) is one of these new initiatives. PECCs aim to improve patient flow in urban EDs by providing a rapid pathway to specialist mental health assessment and care. St Vincent hospital in Sydney opened a 6 bed PECC service in 2005. It is co-located with ED and staffed 24 hours a day by registered mental health nurses supported by psychiatric and emergency teams. The service has two components - a short term stay unit and an ED liaison role. The nurses work closely with community mental health teams, inpatient units, general practitioners, non-government agencies and other hospitals. This thesis evaluated the organisational and operational aspects of this PECC service using a processimpact evaluation. Documents, existing clinical records and interviews with nurses in the PECC and ED and with a consumer representative were used as data sources to describe the service and identify what was working well and what could be improved. The research found that the service has provided additional resources and collaboration between ED and mental health services. In addition the research found that PECC is an effective service catering to the needs of consumers and providing access to mental health specialist clinicians. Since PECC was established there has been an increase in assessments conducted within the ED and an increase in the numbers presenting to ED for mental health reasons from 2833 in 2006 to 4987 in 2008, but the number of admissions to PECC have remained relatively stable at 693 and 714. Aspects of the service that worked well included the rapid assessment and management of acutely unwell people by the PECC nurses. Aspects that were problematic concerned the ability of the service to address social issues and the management of people with behavioural, alcohol, substance intoxication or selfharm behaviours. Areas for enhancing the service include being more consumers responsive, increasing the skills and knowledge of staff and undertaking further research regarding the needs of people who use the service...|$|R

5000|$|... 2009 {{marked a}} {{significant}} growth milestone for the General campus, {{when it opened}} a $72 million <b>Emergency</b> and Critical <b>Care</b> <b>Centre</b> in its new West Wing. The project, which more than doubled {{the size of the}} previous Emergency department, features new infection control and isolation protocols as well as five care zones that are designed to provide the appropriate level of care for specific patients’ acuities—Pediatric, Rapid Assessment, Critical Care, Acute Care and Ambulatory Care. The new wing is also home to a 22-bed Critical <b>Care</b> <b>Centre</b> that consolidates patients from the previous Intensive Care Unit, Coronary Care Unit and Acute Medical Unit. A Satellite Diagnostic Imaging department also opened in the West Wing, with the Greater Toronto Area’s first Siemens YSIO DR-X-ray units that result in faster images and a more comfortable experience for both patients and technologists. The hospital is also the first in the world to run two key diagnostic imaging systems (Agfa HealthCare’s IMPAX 6.3.1 and Cardiovascular 7.7,) on an integrated platform—a major benefit for cardiac patients who can now get faster, more accurate diagnoses and treatment.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The {{increasing}} number of patients requiring <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> is a challenge and leads to decreased satisfaction of health professionals at emergency departments (EDs). Thus, a Swiss hospital implemented a hospital-associated primary <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> at the ED. The study aim was to investigate changes in job satisfaction of ED staff {{before and after the}} implementation of this new service model and to measure hospital GPs' (HGPs) satisfaction at the hospital-associated primary <b>care</b> <b>centre.</b> METHOD: This study was embedded in a large prospective before-after study over two years. We examined changes in job satisfaction with a questionnaire followed by selected interviews approaching all of the involved 25 ED staff members and 38 HGPs. RESULTS: The new <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> model increased job satisfaction of ED staff and HGPs in all measured dimensions. The overall job satisfaction of ED employees improved from 76. 5 to 83. 9 points (visual analogue scale 0 - 100; difference 7. 4 points [95...|$|R
50|$|Although {{offered at}} {{ambulance}} service training departments, {{the curriculum and}} certification were initially awarded by the NHS Training Authority, NHSTA, (which became the NHS Training Directorate and then the NHS Training Division, which in turn became the Institute of Health and Care Development. The Institute was acquired by the Edexcel examination board in 1998, and Edexcel was acquired by Pearson in 2004. Pearson continued to operate the IHCD 'brand' until 2016. This 'in-house' paramedic training was a modular programme, usually between 10 to 12 weeks, followed by time spent in a hospital <b>emergency</b> department, coronary <b>care</b> <b>centre</b> and operating theatre, assisting the anaesthetist and performing airway management techniques such as endotracheal intubation. Completion of the course allowed the paramedic to register with the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (CPSM), which was superseded by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), a regulatory body.|$|R

Main outcome measures: Intention to reduce or opt out of on call; plans for changing out of hours arrangements; {{the three most important}} changes needed to out of hours care; willingness to try, and perceived strengths and limitations of, three alternative out of hours care models [...] primary <b>care</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>centres,</b> telephone triage services, and cooperatives. Results: The overall response rate was 74 % (Wessex research network 77 % (89 / 116), northern research network 71 % (59 / 83)). Eighty three per cent of respondents (123 / 148) were willing to try at least one service model, primary <b>care</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>centres</b> being the most popular option. Key considerations were the potential for a model to reduce time on call and workload, to maintain continuity of care, and to fit the practice context. Sixty one per cent (91 / 148) hoped to reduce time on call and 25 % (37 / 148) hoped to opt out completely. Conclusion: General practitioners were keen to try alternative arrangements for out of hours care delivery, despite the lack of formal trials. The increased flexibility in funding brought about by the recent agreement between the General Medical Services Committee and the Department of Health is likely to lead to a proliferation of different schemes. Careful monitoring will be necessary, and formal trials of new service models are needed urgently...|$|R
40|$|Background: GP cooperatives are {{typically}} based in <b>emergency</b> primary <b>care</b> <b>centres,</b> and patients are frequently required {{to travel to}} be seen. Geography is a key determinant of access, but {{little is known about}} the extent of geographical variation in the use of out-ofhours services. Aim: To examine the effects of distance and rurality on rates of out-of-hours service use. Design of study: Geographical analysis based on routinely collected data on telephone calls in June (n = 14 482) and December (n = 19 747), and area-level data. Setting: Out-of-hours provider in Devon, England serving nearly one million patients. Method: Straight-line distance measured patients’ proximity to the primary <b>care</b> <b>centre.</b> At area level, rurality was measured by Office for National Statistics Rural and Urban Classification (2004) for output areas, and deprivation by The Index of Multiple Deprivation (2004). Results: Call rates decreased with increasing distance: 172 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 170 to 175) for the first (nearest) distance quintile, 162 (95 % CI = 159 to 165) for the second, and 159 (95 % CI = 156 to 162) per thousand patients/year for the third quintile. Distance and deprivation predicted call rate. Rates were highest for urban areas and lowest for sparse villages and hamlets. The greatest urban/rural variation was in patients aged 0 – 4 years. Rates were higher in deprived areas, but the effect of deprivation was more evident in urban than rural areas. Conclusion: There is geographical variation in out-of-hours service use. Patients from rural areas have lower call rates, but deprivation appears to be a greater determinant in urban areas. Geographical barriers must be taken into account when planning and delivering services...|$|R

50|$|The 1997 Labour Party {{manifesto}} made {{a specific}} commitment {{to end the}} Conservatives’ internal market in health care, but in government they retained the split between purchasers and providers of healthcare. In 2000 the Labour Government agreed A Concordat with the Private and Voluntary Health Care Provider Sector with the Independent Healthcare Association. The intention was to increase capacity, particularly in elective care, where private provision was used to bring down waiting lists, in critical care, and in intermediate care facilities. This was followed, in April 2002,by the introduction of prospective payment with nationally set prices for acute, elective activity under ‘payment by results’. Under patient choice patients could opt for treatment by a private provider paid by the NHS. The NHS Plan {{led to the development}} of independent sector treatment centres which provide fast, pre-booked surgery and diagnostic tests for NHS funded patients separating scheduled treatment from <b>emergency</b> <b>care.</b> These <b>centres</b> played a role in reducing the price paid for ‘spot purchases’ with private providers. Previously when the NHS had made use of the independent sector on an ad hoc basis, it often paid 40-100% more than the equivalent cost to the NHS. The NHS Improvement Plan: Putting people at the heart of publicservices, published in 2004 there was an expectation that the independent sector would supply up to 15% of NHS services by 2008, but this figure was not reached.|$|R
