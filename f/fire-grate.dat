6000|$|Mr. James Harthouse smiled; {{and rising}} from {{his end of}} the sofa, and {{lounging}} with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty <b>fire-grate</b> as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: ...|$|E
6000|$|If {{people would}} only have their doors opened to you by such {{assistance}} as may come most easily and naturally to the work! I stood lately for some minutes on a Tuesday afternoon at a gallant portal, and as I waxed impatient a pretty maiden came and opened it. She was a pretty maiden, though her hands and face and apron told tales of the <b>fire-grates.</b> [...] "Laws, sir," [...] she said, [...] "the visitors' day is Wednesday; and if you would come then, {{there would be the}} man in livery!" [...] She took my card with the corner of her apron, and did just as well as the man in livery; but what would have happened to her had her little speech been overheard by her mistress? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{door was}} not locked, and he entered. No workmen {{appeared}} to be present, and he walked from sunny window to sunny window of the empty rooms, {{with a sense of}} seclusion which might have been very pleasant but for the antecedent knowledge that his almost paternal care of Lucy Savile was to be thrown away by her wilfulness. Footsteps echoed through an adjoining room; and bending his eyes in that direction, he perceived Mr. Jones, the architect. He had come to look over the building before giving the contractor his final certificate. They walked over the house together. Everything was finished except the papering: there were the latest improvements of the period in bell-hanging, ventilating, smoke- jacks, <b>fire-grates,</b> and French windows. The business was soon ended, and Jones, having directed Barnet's attention to a roll of wall-paper patterns which lay on a bench for his choice, was leaving to keep another engagement, when Barnet said, 'Is the tomb finished yet for Mrs. Downe?' ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{noticing the}} occupations of an {{intervening}} day or two, which, as they {{consisted of the}} ordinary silvan amusements of shooting and coursing, have nothing sufficiently interesting to detain the reader, we pass to one in some degree peculiar to Scotland, which may be called a sort of salmon-hunting. This chase, in which the fish is pursued and struck with barbed spears, or a sort of long-shafted trident, called a waster, is much practised {{at the mouth of}} the Esk and in the other salmon rivers of Scotland. The sport is followed by day and night, but most commonly in the latter, when the fish are discovered by means of torches, or <b>fire-grates,</b> filled with blazing fragments of tar-barrels, which shed a strong though partial light upon the water. On the present occasion the principal party were embarked in a crazy boat upon a part of the river which was enlarged and deepened by the restraint of a mill-wear, while others, like the ancient Bacchanals in their gambols, ran along the banks, brandishing their torches and spears, and pursuing the salmon, some of which endeavoured to escape up the stream, while others, shrouding themselves under roots of trees, fragments of stones, and large rocks, attempted to conceal themselves from the researches of the fishermen. These the party in the boat detected by the slightest indications; the twinkling of a fin, the rising of an airbell, was sufficient to point out to these adroit sportsmen in what direction to use their weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Carton," [...] {{said his}} friend, {{squaring}} himself {{at him with}} a bullying air, as if the <b>fire-grate</b> had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, [...] "your way is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look at me." ...|$|E
60|$|Then up rose Dr. Grantly and, having thus {{collected}} the scattered wisdom of his associates, spoke forth with words of deep authority. When I say up rose the archdeacon, I {{speak of the}} inner man, which then sprang up to more immediate action, for the doctor had bodily been standing all along {{with his back to}} the dean's empty <b>fire-grate,</b> and the tails of his frock coat supported over his two arms. His hands were in his breeches pockets.|$|E
60|$|It was a dingy {{little room}} in which our hero found himself, having an empty and rusty <b>fire-grate</b> {{on one side and}} a window on the other, from which there was visible a {{landscape}} of paved court. The foreground of the landscape was a pump, the middle distance a wash-tub, and the background a brick wall, about ten feet distant and fifteen feet high. There was no sky to the landscape, by reason of the next house. The furniture was in keeping with the view.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Kealy Mines {{commenced}} explorations in the area. The name {{derived from}} the surnames of its two principals, Patrick Keating, a civil engineer originally from Ballylooby in Tipperary and Gilbert Howley, a native of Co. Mayo. As a student, Keating had worked for O'Brien at the Gurteen pit before emigrating {{to work on the}} M1 motorway in England. He returned to Ireland in the early sixties and later became involved with Howley in the latter's civil engineering and excavation business. They reopened workings at Lickfinn, near the village of New Birmingham, which accessed the coal by slope mining. Initially the mines employed 34 miners and the Electricity Supply Board expressed an interest in using Ballingarry coal for the generation of power and so reduce its dependence on imported oil. However, in preliminary testing at a power station designed to burn peat, the high temperatures produced by the anthracite caused its <b>fire-grates</b> to overheat. Coal dust was supplied to the Irish Sugar processing plant at Thurles and they became an important customer. Financing also proved a difficulty for Kealy Mines, and it was acquired by a Canadian consortium in 1982. Flair Resources Ltd., trading as Tipperary Anthracite was headed by John Young, a Tipperary emigrant to Canada. The new company expanded the workforce to 80 and transferred surface processing such as washing, screening and bagging to the old pithead at Gurteen. It also opened a second underground 'cutting' and investigated exploiting the more marginal No. 1 seam. An electrically powered coal-cutter was employed and investment allowed some further modernisation of plant. Extraction concentrated on the No. 2 seam, with its reserves estimated at that time to be 3 million tonnes. By 1985, Tipperary Anthracite was also in receivership. Financial irregularities regarding IDA grants were investigated by the Gardaí and highlighted on RTÉ current affairs programme 'Today Tonight'. In 1989, Emereld Resources was granted a licence to reopen the mines and for a while sporadic work continued at Lickfinn-Earl's Hill.|$|R
60|$|It was no {{time for}} {{following}} up the introduction, and they all stood as still as the rocks around them, obscured behind the pile of brushwood, which had been probably placed there to break the cold wind from the sea, without totally intercepting the supply of air. The branches were laid so loosely above each other that, looking through them towards the light of the <b>fire-grate,</b> they could easily discover what passed in its vicinity, although a much stronger degree of illumination than it afforded would not have enabled the persons placed {{near the bottom of the}} cave to have descried them in the position which they occupied.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} painful feeling to Gertrude through {{the whole of the}} last {{fortnight}} had been the total prostration of her husband's energy, and almost of his intellect; he seemed to have lost the power of judging for himself, and of thinking and deciding what conduct would be best for him in his present condition. He who had been so energetic, so full of life, so ready for all emergencies, so clever at devices, so able to manage not only for himself but for his friends, he was, as it were, paralysed and unmanned. He sat from morning to night looking at the empty <b>fire-grate,</b> and hardly ventured to speak of the ordeal that he had to undergo.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay--so I purpose," [...] {{answered}} Douglas; [...] "the {{night will}} be dark, and suits a muffled man. [Footnote: Generally, a disguised man; originally one who wears the cloak or mantle muffled round {{the lower part}} of the face to conceal his countenance. I have on an ancient, piece of iron the representation of a robber thus accoutred, endeavouring to make his way into a house, and opposed by a mastiff, to whom he in vain offers food. The motto is spernit dona fides. It is part of a <b>fire-grate</b> said to have belonged to Archbishop Sharpe.]--Keltie, I forgot, there should be a stone laid on that man's grave, recording his name, and his only merit, which was being a faithful servant to the Douglas." ...|$|E
6000|$|Glossin paused; {{the sweat}} broke upon his brow with {{the agony of}} his feelings, while the hard-featured miscreant who sat {{opposite}} coolly rolled his tobacco in his cheek and squirted the juice into the <b>fire-grate.</b> 'It would be ruin,' said Glossin to himself, 'absolute ruin, if the heir should reappear; and then {{what might be the}} consequence of conniving with these men? Yet there is so little time to take measures. Hark you, Hatteraick; I can't set you at liberty; but I can put you where you may set yourself at liberty, I always like to assist an old friend. I shall confine you in the old castle for to-night, and give these people double allowance of grog. MacGuffog will fall in the trap in which he caught you. The stancheons on the window of the strong room, as they call it, are wasted to pieces, and it is not above twelve feet from the level of the ground without, and the snow lies thick.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 118. Studies of {{this kind}} are easily made, {{when you are in}} haste, with an F. or HB. pencil: it {{requires}} some hardness of the point to insure your drawing delicately enough when the forms of the shadows are very subtle; they are sure to be so somewhere, and are generally so everywhere. The pencil is indeed a very precious instrument after you are master of the pen and brush, for the pencil, cunningly used, is both, and will draw a line with the precision of the one and the gradation of the other; nevertheless, it is so unsatisfactory to see the sharp touches, on which the best of the detail depends, getting gradually deadened by time, or to find the places where force was wanted look shiny, and like a <b>fire-grate,</b> that I should recommend rather the steady use of the pen, or brush, and color, whenever time admits of it; keeping only a small memorandum-book in the breast-pocket, with its well-cut, sheathed pencil, ready for notes on passing opportunities: but never being without this.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{this time}} {{there had been no}} {{reconciliation}} between the miller and his younger daughter. Carry would ask her father whether she should do this or that, and the miller would answer her as a surly master will answer a servant whom he does not like; but the father, as a father, had never spoken to the child; nor, up to this moment, had he said a word even to his wife of his intended journey to Salisbury. But now he was driven to speak. He had placed himself in the arm chair, and was sitting with his hands on his knees gazing into the empty <b>fire-grate.</b> Carry was standing at the open window, pulling the dead leaves off three or four geraniums which her mother kept there in pots. Fanny was passing in and out from the back kitchen, in which the water for their tea was being boiled, and Mrs. Brattle was in her usual place with her spectacles on, and a darning needle in her hand. A minute was allowed to pass by before the miller answered his eldest daughter.|$|E
60|$|Last night I {{was getting}} into bed just at twelve o'clock, when Dolby came to my door to inform me {{that the house was}} on fire (I had {{previously}} smelt fire for two hours). I got Scott up directly, told him to pack the books and clothes for the readings first, dressed, and pocketed my jewels and papers, while Dolby stuffed himself out with money. Meanwhile the police and firemen were in the house, endeavouring to find where the fire was. For some time it baffled their endeavours, but at last, bursting out through some stairs, they cut the stairs away, and traced it to its source in a certain <b>fire-grate.</b> By this time the hose was laid all through the house from a great tank on the roof, and everybody turned out to help. It was the oddest sight, and people had put the strangest things on! After a little chopping and cutting with axes and handing about of water, the fire was confined to a dining-room in which it had originated, and then everybody talked to everybody else, the ladies being particularly loquacious and cheerful. And so we got to bed again at about two.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} a gentle {{delicacy}} of manner, surprising to Elizabeth, that he showed {{her out of the}} office and through the outer room, where Donald Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection of a beginner in charge. Henchard preceded her through the door in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers, and onward into the house. The dining-room to which he introduced her still exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast laid for Farfrae. It was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany furniture of the deepest red-Spanish hues. Pembroke tables, with leaves hanging so low that they well-nigh touched the floor, stood against the walls on legs and feet shaped like those of an elephant, and on one lay three huge folio volumes--a Family Bible, a [...] "Josephus," [...] and a [...] "Whole Duty of Man." [...] In the chimney corner was a <b>fire-grate</b> with a fluted semicircular back, having urns and festoons cast in relief thereon, and the chairs were of the kind which, since that day, has cast lustre upon the names of Chippendale and Sheraton, though, in point of fact, their patterns may have been such as those illustrious carpenters never saw or heard of.|$|E
60|$|The scene, {{independent}} of the peculiar moral interest and personal danger which attended it, had, from {{the effect of the}} light and shade on the uncommon objects which it exhibited, an appearance emphatically dismal. The light in the <b>fire-grate</b> was the dark-red glare of charcoal in a state of ignition, relieved from time to time by a transient flame of a more vivid or duskier light, as the fuel with which Dirk Hatteraick fed his fire was better or worse fitted for his purpose. Now a dark cloud of stifling smoke rose up to the roof of the cavern, and then lighted into a reluctant and sullen blaze, which flashed wavering up the pillar of smoke, and was suddenly rendered brighter and more lively by some drier fuel, or perhaps some splintered fir-timber, which at once converted the smoke into flame. By such fitful irradiation they could see, more or less distinctly, the form of Hatteraick, whose savage and rugged cast of features, now rendered yet more ferocious by the circumstances of his situation and the deep gloom of his mind, assorted well with the rugged and broken vault, which rose in a rude arch over and around him. The form of Meg Merrilies, which stalked about him, sometimes in the light, sometimes partially obscured in the smoke or darkness, contrasted strongly with the sitting figure of Hatteraick as he bent over the flame, and from his stationary posture was constantly visible to the spectator, while that of the female flitted around, appearing or disappearing like a spectre.|$|E
60|$|From there I went to {{look for}} the players and called for {{information}} on a young priest, who had invited them, and taken upon himself the finding of an audience. He lived in a high house with other priests, and as I went in I noticed with a whimsical pleasure a broken pane of glass in the fan-light over the door, for he had once told me the story of an old woman who a good many years ago quarrelled with the bishop, got drunk, and hurled a stone through the painted glass. He was a clever man, who read Meredith and Ibsen, but some of his books had been packed in the <b>fire-grate</b> by his house-keeper, instead of the customary view of an Italian lake or the coloured tissue-paper. The players, who had been giving a performance in a neighbouring town, had not yet come, or were unpacking their costumes and properties at the hotel he had recommended them. We should have time, he said, to go through the half-ruined town and to visit the convent schools and the cathedral, where, owing to his influence, two of our young Irish sculptors had been set to carve an altar and the heads of pillars. I had only heard of this work, and I found its strangeness and simplicity--one of them had been Rodin's pupil--could not make me forget the meretriciousness of the architecture and the commercial commonplace of the inlaid pavements. The new movement had seized on the cathedral midway in its growth, and the worst of the old & the best of the new were side by side without any sign of transition. The convent school was, as other like places have been to me--a long room in a workhouse hospital at Portumna, in particular--a delight to the imagination and the eyes. A new floor had been put into some ecclesiastical building and the light from a great mullioned window, cut off at the middle, fell aslant upon rows of clean and seemingly happy children. The nuns, who show in their own convents, where they can put what they like, a love of what is mean and pretty, make beautiful rooms where the regulations compel them to do all with a few colours and a few flowers. I think it was that day, but am not sure, that I had lunch at a convent and told fairy stories to a couple of nuns, and I hope it was not mere politeness that made them seem to have a child's interest in such things.|$|E
50|$|The D7 was {{fundamentally}} an anthracite-burning {{version of}} the PRR D6, with a larger <b>fire-grate</b> in order to burn the slower-burning, harder coal.|$|E
50|$|A {{very large}} <b>fire-grate</b> area was provided, {{which gave the}} {{locomotive}} free-steaming qualities; its grate area was in fact larger than many later express passenger locomotives. Only the Baden IV h 4-6-2 and DRG Class 45 2-10-2 locomotives ever had larger fireboxes in Germany; even the record-breaking DRG Class 05 4-6-4s had fireboxes no larger than the S 2/6. This was partly because Bavarian coal was of lower quality than that available in Prussia and elsewhere. Large ashpans extended down {{on both sides of}} the locomotive, between the driving wheels and trailing truck, allowing for long runs before they needed to be emptied.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{few other}} historians harbour doubts about the {{authenticity}} of the work, the majority of other Anglo-Saxon scholars do not find these arguments persuasive. The stiffest opposition to Smyths work has come from former Cambridge Professor Michael Lapidge and Professor Simon Keynes, still an eminent Cambridge Saxonist, who themselves collaborated on a book about Alfred the Great. Both have argued that Smyths analysis of the Latin text, which relied heavily on the opinions of other academics who helped with the book, is fatally flawed. Professor Keynes felt strongly enough about the subject to place a copy of Smyths book in the <b>fire-grate</b> of his chambers in Trinity College, and then photograph it for his personal website. A typed statement from department officials was also placed on the inside cover of a copy of the book kept in the ASNAC (Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic) library at Cambridge, to leave undergraduates in no doubt as to the departments views. The debate caught the imagination of the popular press when Professor Smyths book was published, fuelled by the former University of Kent historians claim that the Cambridge ASNAC department knew Assers life was a fake, but that they were happy to keep the myth going in order to avoid discrediting previous eminent historians from their university such as Frank Stenton and Dorothy Whitelock.|$|E
