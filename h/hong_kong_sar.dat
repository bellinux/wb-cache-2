40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years, {{environmental}} policy in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{has been driven}} by responses to a variety of local problems resulting in an array of environmental ordinances and supporting regulations addressing air, water and noise pollution problems, waste management and the use of EIA in the development planning process. <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong's</b> approach to environmental policy has been based on the conventional 'command and control' model of environmental management. It has, however, become increasingly apparent that many of <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong's</b> environmental problems cannot be effectively addressed solely by local initiatives but must involve broader collaborative efforts with authorities in neighbouring Guangdong Province. Furthermore, the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>SAR's</b> efforts to address sustainability issues, which are still at an early stage, may also be facilitated by a regional rather than purely local perspective as well as by one that explores the utility of the ecological modernization model. This paper discusses the recent evolution of environmental policy in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong,</b> the emergence of a regional environmental management agenda and the potential of ecological modernization as a basis {{for the development of a}} broader strategy to manage the environmental problems of the Pearl River Delta Region.

The judgement {{as to whether or}} not a building is environmentally sustainable goes beyond its site boundary, and what constitutes a green building remains open to debate. Building environmental assessment methods (BEAMs) are tools that can focus attention on actions to improve building environmental performance. However, the framework, development and content of such tools is influenced by many factors, such as the environmental aspects targeted, type of building covered, extent of support from stakeholders, and the level of endorsement by government and end-users, etc. The paper discusses the framework under which voluntary BEAMs are being developed and operated, including the local HK-BEAM scheme. It concludes that the coverage of environmental aspects, the extent to which building environmental performance can be improved, and the lake-up of a BEAM depends on many factors, not least consensus and compromise within the building construction and real estate sectors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{principal}} aims of {{this study}} were to report on the prevalence of oral disease {{and its impact on the}} life quality of older (aged 60 and above) prisoners at <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>SAR's</b> elderly detention centre, China. DESIGN: A cross-sectional epidemiological survey involving clinical oral examinations and face-to-face interviews with 64 older prisoners at the centre. Clinical oral examinations were carried out following WHO criteria. The impact of oral health on life quality was assessed using the 14 -item Oral Health Impact Profile measure, OHIP- 14. RESULTS: The prevalence of oral disease was high, the mean DMFT was 22. 5 (SD 10. 6) and 40 % (18) of the dentate prisoners had shallow or deep periodontal pockets. Most (75 %, 48) were in need of prosthetic treatment. Over half the prisoners experienced one or more oral health impacts on life quality during the previous year. This was associated with socio-demographic factors: employment status prior to incarceration (P < 0. 01), oral health behaviour: smoking habits (P < 0. 01) and clinical oral health status: DMFT (P < 0. 05) and prosthetic need (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Among inmates at <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong's</b> elderly detention centre, the prevalence of oral disease was high and the impact of oral health on their life quality was substantial. The impact of oral health on the life quality of the older prisoners was associated with prisoners socio-demographic background, oral health behaviour and oral health status. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
