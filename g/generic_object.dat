40|$|We generalize {{results of}} Gitik, Dzamonja-Shelah, and Magidor-Sinapova on the {{existence}} of pseudo-Prikry sequences, which are sequences that approximate the behavior of the <b>generic</b> <b>objects</b> introduced by Prikry-type forcings, in outer models of set theory. Such sequences {{play an important role in}} the study of singular cardinal combinatorics by placing restrictions on the type of behavior that can consistently be obtained in outer models. In addition, we provide results about the existence of diagonal pseudo-Prikry sequences, which approximate the behavior of the <b>generic</b> <b>objects</b> introduced by diagonal Prikry-type forcings. Our proof techniques are substantially different from those of previous results and rely on an analysis of PCF-theoretic objects in the outer model. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

This terminology is typically confined to polytopes and polyhedra that are convex. With this terminology, a convex polyhedron is the intersection of {{a finite number of}} halfspaces and is defined by its sides while a convex polytope is the convex hull of a finite number of points and is defined by its vertices.|$|E
