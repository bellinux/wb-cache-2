25|$|During the 1970s, Vanderbilt {{ventured into}} the fashion business, first with Glentex, {{licensing}} her name for a line of scarves. In 1976, Indian designer Mohan Murjani's Murjani Corporation, proposed launching a line of designer jeans carrying Vanderbilt's signature embroidered on the back pocket, {{as well as her}} swan logo. Her jeans were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time. The logo eventually appeared on dresses and perfumes, while Vanderbilt also launched a line of blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories. Vanderbilt {{was one of the first}} designers to make public appearances, which was a <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> for her because of her shyness.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

She and Wright {{approached}} his film [...] "as a <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to tackle" [...] because of their desire to distinguish it from the television adaptation. Due to Wright's dislike of the high waistline, Durran focused on later eighteenth century fashions that often included a corseted, natural waistline rather than an empire silhouette (which became popular after the 1790s). A generational divide was established: the older characters dress in mid-eighteenth century fashions while the young wear [...] "a sort of proto-Regency style of hair and dress". Mrs Bennet was of the older generation, and her dresses {{appeared to have been}} mended.|$|E
500|$|Director Rob Bowman {{was worried}} that the episode's monster would not appear [...] "scary" [...] and that the story would not be [...] "compelling". By {{utilizing}} unique camera angles and quick action Bowman {{was able to make}} the episode feel [...] "a hell of a lot better than [...] was afraid it might". The monster was created by special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich, a task he considered [...] "the single most <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> [...] did all season". The tentacles were created out of a combination of silicone and urethane to make them translucent, but give them a flexible feel. The [...] "octopus bite marks" [...] numbered in the hundreds and required 90 minutes to apply. The episode's title, [...] "Agua Mala", means bad water in Spanish. [...] Aguamala is also the slang name for the Portuguese Man o' War, a venomous jellyfish similar in form to the episode's primary antagonist.|$|E
500|$|Mason {{has said}} he was nervous about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I did {{have to stand up}} in front a group of people and tell them , I was gay.

Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport.

500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|He got {{his first}} job writing for {{television}} on the sitcom Three's Company in 1983. Through his cousin, Mirkin met writer George Tricker who became his mentor. Tricker wrote for the Three's Company spin-off The Ropers so Mirkin wrote a spec script for an episode of The Ropers. Although rejected by the producers of The Ropers, Three's Company creator Bernie West {{was impressed by the}} script and Mirkin began pitching ideas for that series instead. Mirkin pitched to the series' story editors for several years without success because they had very limited script buying power. He was eventually able to pitch to the show's producers, who bought a script from him, and then hired him as a staff writer. Mirkin was apprehensive about the job because he was aiming to work on Cheers, a show more focused on character-driven humor which Mirkin preferred writing, but felt he could not turn the opportunity down. Mirkin considered Three's Company to have [...] "a classic French farce structure", as [...] "the characters were so stupid they could never say anything clever." [...] This meant Mirkin had to adapt his preference for character-driven comedy to fit the show; it [...] "forced you to put all the cleverness into the plot, a much more <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do. The plot had to get all the laughs". Mirkin felt the experience [...] "taught [...] a lot about structure" [...] which greatly aided his later work on character-focused shows.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'Orison' rises above {{its origins in}} the depressing, hackneyed genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone X-Files stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode [...] "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is , and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] " [...] was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It {{was also one of}} the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." [...] Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that [...] "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she did right, but it certainly wasn't a <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to understand." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B" [...] and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a [...] "potentially fascinating figure" [...] who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it [...] "helps transform the episode’s climax into something more than a simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series Millennium.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
