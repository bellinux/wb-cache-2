5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided {{that he could make}} money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
25|$|The {{big winner}} of the {{campaign}} was Dick Spring and the Labour Party. They distanced themselves completely from Fine Gael and fought an independent line. During the campaign Spring made very little comment about what the party would do after the election, however, {{he did say that}} if the Labour Party was part of a coalition <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> granted a turn as Taoiseach.|$|E
25|$|In March 1944 Ladd {{took another}} {{physical}} and was re-classified 1A. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-inducted into the army, but a deferment {{was given to}} enable Ladd to make Two Years Before the Mast (the release of which was postponed two years). He {{was meant to be}} re-inducted on 4 September 1944 but Paramount succeeded in getting this pushed back again to make Salty O'Rourke. He also found time to make a cameo a big screen version of Duffy's Tavern.|$|E
6000|$|... "From my {{blackness}} to yours," [...] said Mr. Britling aloud. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{write it}} in English. But {{even if they}} knew no English some one would be found to translate it <b>to</b> them. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write very plainly.|$|R

It was so {{difficult}} to do in Chitterlow's presence though; in his absence it was easy enough. This half share, and taking a theatre and all of it, was going too far.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{drop out}} the chief {{characters}}; {{the public would}} say such people are impossible. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> drop {{out a number of}} the most picturesque incidents; the public would say such things could never happen. And yet the chief characters did exist, and the incidents did happen.|$|R
25|$|In {{their quest}} to rid the Earth {{of all forms of}} kryptonite, Superman and Batman journey deep below the sea and find a large amount of it. The two of them are met with hostility by Aquaman and King Shark. A brief fight ensues, but eventually, Joseph allows them to take the kryptonite. Before doing so, he points out that not {{everyone}} may want Superman to find all of Earth's kryptonite, and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least part human to know that.|$|E
25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of the water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
500|$|Meredith and Derek's {{marriage}} becomes strained when Derek {{goes against}} his promise and accepts {{an offer from}} the U.S. President {{to participate in the}} Brain Mapping Initiative, which consumes his time and eclipses Meredith, who is feeling increasingly left behind and mommy-tracked. He receives an offer to head the project itself in Washington D.C., meaning that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> based there permanently. Meredith puts her foot down as she does not want to uproot their young family to move across the country for his career at the sacrifice of her own. They begin a series of on-and-off arguments and [...] "cold wars" [...] over their careers. Derek accepts the job {{in the heat of the}} moment and promptly leaves for Washington. During a phone call with Meredith, they agree to work things out after she tells him that she did not want them to become [...] "one of those couples" [...] and he reciprocates, saying that he missed her. She privately admits to Alex that she has realized that she could live independently of Derek, but chooses not to.|$|E

Komal agrees, {{on the condition that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up his playboy lifestyle and become responsible: <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> quit smoking, drinking and women for her to marry him.

When asked about it, Asō stated, [...] "I won't change my style. Luckily I have {{my money and}} can afford it." [...] Asō added that if he went anywhere else, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by security guards which would cause trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Fletcher is {{the first}} Member of Parliament (MP) in Canadian history with a {{permanent}} disability. [...] A running joke during his first campaign was that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a front bench MP, as the backbenches are not wheelchair-accessible. [...] His election created {{the need for a}} [...] "stranger to the House"—a person who is not officially an MP or officer of Parliament—in this case, his aide, to actually be {{on the floor of the}} Commons during sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas II {{was forced}} to abdicate on [...] He did this in favour of his twelve-year-old son Alexei who ascended the throne under a regency. Nicholas later decided to alter his {{original}} abdication. Whether that act had any legal validity is open to speculation. Nicholas consulted with doctors and others present and realised that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated from Alexei. Not wanting Alexei to be parted from the family, Nicholas altered the abdication document in favour of his younger brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia. After receiving advice about whether his personal security could be guaranteed, Michael declined to accept the throne without the people's approval through an election held by the proposed Constituent Assembly; no such referendum was ever held.|$|E

60|$|He resolved, after {{a little}} natural hesitation, to drown the children, and reproached himself bitterly for not having {{disposed}} {{of them at the}} same time as their mother. Now <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through another period of mourning and the consequent delay in pressing his suit. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> allow a decent interval between his conversation with Miss Lindsay and their untimely end.|$|R

If you wish, you can leave the whole matter in my hands and I will have it investigated." ...|$|R
2500|$|Napoleon had {{attempted}} to speedily catch the British and force them to fight. He led the French army [...] over 10 days by forced marches {{and in spite of}} winter blizzard conditions reached Astorga on 1 January with 80,000 men. Napoleon manoeuvred to cut Moore off from a retreat to Portugal. Moore had already planned that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready to make a run for the coast. On 28 November Moore had ordered his Corunna contingent under Baird to embark from Vigo while the main British army was to fall back on Portugal but by 28 December he had decided to embark the whole army at Vigo. Abandoning Astorga on 30 December, he would manage to keep ahead of the pursuing French and avoid a major battle. Moore ordered Crawford and two brigades as well as the troop transport ships to the port of Vigo. Napoleon would write to his brother Joseph on 31 December: [...] When {{it was clear that he}} could not bring Moore to battle, Napoleon left the pursuit of the British to Soult's corps with Marshal Ney in support and took the bulk of the army, some 45,000 men, back to Madrid. Napoleon decided to leave Spain to attend to other pressing matters; the Austrians were about to declare war on France, and would soon invade Italy and Bavaria.|$|E
2500|$|After the First English Civil War, King Charles I was a {{prisoner}} of the Parliamentarians. They tried to negotiate a compromise with him, but he stuck steadfastly to his view that he was King by Divine Right and attempted in secret to raise an army to fight against them. It became obvious to {{the leaders of the}} Parliamentarians that they could not negotiate a settlement with him and they could not trust him to refrain from raising an army against them; they reluctantly {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put to death. On 13 December 1648, the House of Commons broke off negotiations with the King. Two days later, the Council of Officers of the New Model Army voted that the King be moved from the Isle of Wight, where he was prisoner, to Windsor [...] "in order to the bringing of him speedily to justice". In the middle of December, the King was moved from Windsor to London. The House of Commons of the Rump Parliament passed a Bill setting up a High Court of Justice in order to try Charles I for high treason in the name of the people of England. [...] From a Royalist and post-restoration perspective this Bill was not lawful, since the House of Lords refused to pass it and it failed to receive Royal Assent. However, the Parliamentary leaders and the Army pressed on with the trial anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{with this}} {{truncated}} {{version of the}} opera, many compromises and cuts were made, some during rehearsals, and some during the run. The new second act was the Chasse [...] Royale et Orage ("Royal Hunt and Storm") , an elaborate pantomime ballet with nymphs, sylvans, and fauns and a chorus. Since the set change for this scene took nearly an hour, it was cut, despite the fact its staging had been greatly simplified with a painted waterfall, rather than one with real water. Carvalho had originally planned to divert water from the nearby Seine, but during the rehearsals, a faulty switch nearly caused a disaster. The entries of the builders, sailors, and farm-workers , were omitted because Carvalho found them dull; likewise, the scene for Anna and Narbal [...] and the second ballet [...] The sentries duet [...] was omitted, because Carvalho had found its [...] "homely style... {{out of place in}} an epic work". Iopas's stanzas [...] disappeared with Berlioz's approval, the singer De Quercy [...] "charged with the part being incapable of singing them well." [...] The duet between Dido and Aeneas [...] was cut because, as Berlioz himself realized, [...] "Madame Charton's voice was unequal to the vehemence of this scene, which took so much out of her that she would not have had the strength left to deliver the tremendous recitative 'Dieux immortels! il part!' , the final aria , and the scene on the pyre [...]" [...] The [...] "Song of Hylas" [...] , which was [...] "greatly liked at the early performances and was well sung", was cut while Berlioz was at home sick with bronchitis. The singer of the part, Edmond Cabel, was also performing in a revival of Félicien David's La perle du Brésil, and since his contract only required him to sing fifteen times per month, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid an extra two hundred francs for each additional performance. Berlioz lamented: [...] "If I am able to put on an adequate performance of a work of this scale and character I must be in absolute control of the theatre, as I am of the orchestra when I rehearse a symphony." ...|$|E
