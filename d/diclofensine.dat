50|$|The tetrahydroisoquinoline {{skeleton}} is {{encountered in}} a number of drugs, tubocurarine, one of the quaternary ammonium muscle relaxants. Drugs based on 4-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines include nomifensine and <b>diclofensine.</b> They can be prepared by N-alkylation of benzyl amines with haloacetophenones. Naturally occurring tetrahydroisoquinolines includes cherylline. and latifine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diclofensine</b> (Ro 8-4650) was {{developed}} by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s {{in the search for}} a new antidepressant. It was found that the (S)-isomer was responsible for activity. Is a stimulant drug which acts as a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, primarily inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, with affinities (Ki) of 16.8 nM, 15.7 nM, and 51 nM for DAT, NET, and SERT (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin transporters), respectively. It was found to be an effective antidepressant in human trials, with relatively few side effects, but was ultimately dropped from clinical development, possibly due to concerns about its abuse potential.|$|E
40|$|Eight male volunteers {{received}} placebo, <b>diclofensine</b> 25 mg, <b>diclofensine</b> 50 mg and desmethylimipramine (DMI) 50 mg {{at least}} a week apart. Using tyramine pressor tests, no statistically significant differences between the noradrenaline reuptake blocking effects of the three active treatments could be demonstrated. Visual analogue rating scales showed an increase in dryness of the mouth at 3 h after DMI but no similar effect after either dose of <b>diclofensine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>diclofensine,</b> a pure {{dopamine}} (DA) uptake inhibitor on 1) 3 H-DA uptake in rat arcuate-periventricular nucleus-median eminence synaptosomes, 2) basal and K+-evoked endogenous DA release from tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons and 3) in vivo prolactin (PRL) secretion were studied. <b>Diclofensine,</b> in concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 microM caused a marked decrease of 3 H-DA uptake. In addition, it {{was unable to}} stimulate basal endogenous DA release which, on the contrary, was elicited by d-amphetamine in the same concentration (50 microM). On the other hand, <b>diclofensine</b> (50 microM) caused a 3 fold enhancement of K+-evoked DA release. Finally, the compound, when administered in vivo to male rats, significantly reduced basal serum PRL levels. The {{results of the present}} study seem to indicate that the pharmacological blockade of DA uptake in TIDA neurons is a condition sufficient to cause a reduction of PRL release...|$|E
40|$|Evaluated the {{interaction}} of either gaboxadol HCl (THIP) or muscimol, both gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A agonists, with indirect-acting dopamine agonists (DAGs) methylphenidate, (+) -amphetamine, metamphetamine, amfonelic acid, indatraline, nomifensine, <b>diclofensine,</b> mazindol, and GBR 12935 and with direct-acting DAGs WIN 35, 428, bupropion, GBR 12909, and cocaine. 1, 832 male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were given either with saline or 1 of the doses of THIP or muscimol before an injection of a dopamine agonist. Gnawing on corrugated packing paper was measured. Results showed that: (1) indirect- but not direct-acting DAGs induced gnawing, (2) gnawing induced by indirect-acting DAGs GBR 12935, nomifensine and mazindol was potentiated in mice in which GABA type A receptors were stimulated either by THIP or muscimol, and (3) indirect DAGs had a differential sensitivity {{to the effects of}} THIP and muscimol.
