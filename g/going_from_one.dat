5|$|Snowboarding is a {{sport that}} has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while <b>going</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E

Larry Wilcox, of CHiPs, was also a candidate for the role of Crockett, but the producers felt that <b>going</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> police officer role to another would not be a good fit. After dozens of candidates and a twice-delayed pilot shooting, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas were chosen as the vice cops. For Johnson, who was by then 34 years old, NBC had particular doubts about the several earlier unsuccessful pilots in which he had starred. After two seasons, Johnson threatened to walk from the series as part of a highly publicized contract dispute. The network was ready to replace him with Mark Harmon, who had recently departed St. Elsewhere, but the network and Johnson were able to resolve their differences and he continued with the series until its end. Actor Jimmy Smits played Eddie Rivera, Crockett's partner who is killed early in the pilot episode.|$|E

500|$|To {{reflect this}} serious intent to procure a new fighter-bomber, the LWF program was rolled {{into a new}} Air Combat Fighter (ACF) {{competition}} in an announcement by U.S. Secretary of Defense James R.

The ACF {{would not be a}} pure fighter, but multi-role, and Schlesinger made it clear that any ACF order would be in addition to the F-15, which extinguished opposition to the LWF. [...] ACF also raised the stakes for GD and Northrop because it brought in competitors intent on securing what was touted at the time as [...] "the arms deal of the century". These were Dassault-Breguet's proposed Mirage F1M-53, the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar, and the proposed Saab 37E [...] "Eurofighter". Northrop offered the P-530 Cobra, which was similar to the YF-17. The Jaguar and Cobra were dropped by the MFPG early on, leaving two European and the two U.S. candidates. On 11 September 1974, the U.S. Air Force confirmed plans to order the winning ACF design to equip five tactical fighter wings. [...] Though computer modeling predicted a close contest, the YF-16 proved significantly quicker <b>going</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> maneuver to the next, and was the unanimous choice of those pilots that flew both aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of ordered hexagonal arrays of Co nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes (NTs) with diameters of 50 nm and interwire/tube distances of 105 nm were studied using first-order reversal curves (FORCs). We report an advanced analysis of angle dependent first-order reversal curves (AFORCs), measured {{by changing the}} angle of the applied magnetic field from θ = 0 ° (parallel to the wire/tube axis) to 90 ° (perpendicular). This method allowed us to determine the magnetization reversal mode and to retrieve quantitative information on the magnetostatic interactions between NWs and between NTs. In particular, we found a sharp increase in the coercivity distribution of the NT arrays for θ > 70 °, which is attributed to a transition between vortex and transverse reversal modes. Local magnetic interactions are found to prevail in the Co NT arrays, steadily increasing from θ = 0 ° to 90 °. However, in the Co NW arrays the mean magnetic interactions decrease as θ increases, <b>going</b> <b>from</b> <b>ones</b> similar to local interactions to ones smaller than them. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.
