5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the court should not merely rely on international law to determine {{the meaning of the}} liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
25|$|A {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} {{is only as}} valid as its data; therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> data used for {{the completion of a}} life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-cost}} net shape forging for demanding applications that {{are subject to}} {{a high degree of}} scrutiny, i.e. non-destructive testing by way of a dye-penetrant inspection technique, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> basic forging process disciplines be implemented. If the basic disciplines are not met, subsequent material removal operations will likely be necessary to remove material defects found at non-destructive testing inspection. Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E

50|$|Regarding {{fire service}} in Northern Ireland, Ramsey said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> {{problems}} within the Northern Fire and Rescue Service ‘need to be tackled {{as soon as}} possible’ and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ‘worrying that the Fire Service {{has been allowed to}} get into such a poor state of management’.|$|R
25|$|In 1949, {{after the}} Malayan Union had been {{replaced}} by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance. The Malay people thus search for their birth-rights since the government of Malaya did not proclaim it openly, resulting in a confusing situation. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> UMNO's struggle is apparently not racial based. As they also fought for other races once they are {{at the helm of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> {{children}} {{are allowed to}} socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be {{in an environment that}} allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.|$|E
25|$|The Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa {{also offers}} a co-op option for some of their {{programs}} including: accounting, commerce, e-business, finance, management, marketing, and few other interconnected programs. With the exception of accounting which starts during the summer before a student’s fourth year, all programs start the summer before a student’s third year of study. Finally as a last category, several co-op graduate programs are offered as well: computer science, economics, globalization and international development, history, information studies, and public and international affairs. The entry requirements for graduate students are {{a little different from}} those for undergraduate co-operative education programs. In the graduate level, one of the requirements of the co-op program is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> students begin their study in the fall semester because of the co-op program’s placement cycle.|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{supported}} {{the role of}} UNMIH in assisting the Government of Haiti to achieve a secure and stable environment in the country. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> free and fair presidential elections took place. Efforts to establish a police force by UNMIH were praised, while UNMIH's mandate {{as a whole was}} being closely monitored by the Council.|$|R
50|$|On 30 June 2017, Finance Minister Steven Joyce and Transport Minister Simon Bridges signed {{agreements}} with Auckland Mayor Phil Goff that established City Rail Link Limited (CRLL). Effective 1 July 2017, the company assumed responsibility for delivering the City Rail Link. Mr Joyce said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> there <b>be</b> a single joint entity running {{the project and}} that CRLL was owned jointly by central and local government.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1999, at {{a wedding}} anniversary party, Massino gave the {{following}} message to Salvatore Vitale: [...] "George has got to go". The plan was for fellow capo Patrick DeFilippo to invite Sciascia to a meeting to resolve an ongoing disagreement with Graziano over a marijuana racket. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the murder not {{be linked to the}} Bonanno family in any way to avoid a potential conflict with the Rizzuto family in Montreal.|$|R

2500|$|On 18 September, Bishop Jo Seoka of the South African Council of Churches, who was {{mediating}} {{a resolution}} to the conflict, announced that the striking miners had accepted a 22% pay raise, a one-off payment of R2,000, and would return to work 20 September. However, the National Union of Mineworkers, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union and the Solidarity union did not make any statements {{in response to this}} offer. While miners' representative Zolisa Bodlani said of the deal that [...] "it's a huge achievement. No union has achieved a 22% increase before," [...] Lonmin's Sue Vey said it would offer no comment as the agreement had not yet been signed. However, Chris Molebatsi, who {{was a part of the}} organising committee for the strike, said: [...] "The campaign will go on. This campaign is aimed at helping workers. People died here at Marikana. Something needs to be done. This is a campaign to ensure justice for the people of Marikana. We want the culprits to be brought to book, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> justice is seen to be done here. It is our duty and the duty of this country to ensure justice is served, so that we can make sure this country is a democracy and to stop South Africa from going down the drain." [...] He also added that the Marikana Solidarity Campaign has more work to do in terms of supporting victims' families, offering PTSD counselling and to oversight the state-appointed judicial commission that would ensure justice after the violence; he also noted that: ...|$|E

Berwick framed himself as progressive on major issues and said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> Massachusetts {{continue to focus on}} health care reform and the well-being of children, topics he has focused on during his career. Berwick, who holds three degrees from Harvard, repeatedly emphasized his experience in helping health organizations deliver better care to consumers, an asset he said he would bring to being the state’s chief executive.|$|R

40|$|Faced with a {{downsizing}} organization, serious budget {{reductions and}} retirement of key metrology personnel, maintaining capabilities to provide necessary services to our customers was becoming increasingly difficult. It {{appeared that the}} only solution was to automate some of our more personnel-intensive processes; however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the most personnel-intensive candidate process be automated, at the lowest price possible and with the lowest risk of failure.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> Lysias {{established}} that the murder of Eratosthenes was not premeditated. The prosecution case was that Euphiletos had entrapped Eratosthenes, and was therefore guilty of intentional homicide. Lysias has Euphiletos argue that the murder was not premeditated by stressing Euphiletos' lack of preparation: {{he had had a}} friend around for dinner that night but had not kept him around to help, and he repeatedly stresses the difficulty Euphiletos had gathering witnesses after Eratosthenes entered his house because he had not organised them in advance. He does not call on witnesses to corroborate either of these points.|$|R

5000|$|In 1917, Sinn Féin {{won their}} first ever seat in {{parliament}} for the constituency of Roscommon North, centred on Boyle, {{with the election}} of George Noble Plunkett. Plunkett's son, Joseph Mary Plunkett, had been executed by the British in May 1916 for his association with the 1916 Rising. Michael Collins campaigned on the candidate's behalf, as did Michael O'Flanagan, later to become President of Sinn Féin. A plaque on the courthouse, on The Crescent in Boyle, commemorates this. This was the first by-election following the Easter Rising of 1916 and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the democratic mandate be obtained by Sinn Féin.|$|R

40|$|Dr Eirini Artemi’s paper {{explores the}} {{teaching}} of Gregory of Nazianzus (329 – 390 AD) on exactly what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that qualifies someone {{to be called a}} theologian. Focusing particularly on his Twentieth Oration, On Theology, she places his thought on the subject against the background of a period in which many heresies had recently made their appearance, and when many ‘pseudo-theologians’ had come to prominence. Her paper explains why, at a time when orthodoxy was being severely tested, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> Gregory should set out the required conditions if someone was to become a true theologian and to connect closely with the vision of God.

50|$|Because solid lye is hygroscopic, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> {{the solid}} {{granules}} of the cleaner are placed directly in {{proximity to the}} clog. Otherwise, the lye itself will absorb water and actually create a mass itself, exacerbating the clog issue.|$|E
5000|$|Rouass, who had {{no medical}} {{expertise}} prior to her casting, said the role was [...] "a real eye opener." [...] She spent a day at The Heart Hospital in London as preparation, and commented in February 2011 that she also hoped to observe a real operation. Rouass felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> she liked her character and remained passionate about creating her, otherwise she may not have taken the role on. When asked whether she had much input into the character or storylines, Rouass explained {{that she had been}} given a questionnaire to gauge her opinion of Sahira's backstory, and that the creative team were receptive to suggestions.|$|R
5000|$|In the past, {{we would}} go into the studio and write.

You had to take a lot on faith. But once you know a part inside and out, you can move on to worrying about performance. If you’re trying to remember it, then you’re not playing from the heart - you're playing from the brain. That always sounds stale on playback.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} area {{that must be}} considered concerns the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. Because {{the strength of a}} phalanx depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> a phalanx <b>be</b> able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in the front ranks. If a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times, would lead to a quick defeat. This then implies that the hoplites ranks closer to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.|$|R
