50|$|The <b>{{insurance}}</b> <b>certificate</b> {{or cover}} note {{issued by the}} insurance company constitutes the only legal evidence that the policy to which the certificate relates satisfies {{the requirements of the}} relevant law applicable in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Island of Guernsey, the Island of Jersey and the Island of Alderney. The Act states that an authorised person, such as a police officer, may require a driver to produce an <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> for inspection. If the driver cannot show the document immediately on request, and evidence of insurance cannot be found by other means such as the MID, then the Police are empowered to seize the vehicle instantly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{immediate}} impounding of {{an apparently}} uninsured vehicle replaces the former method {{of dealing with}} insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept). This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> was, and still is, an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known - even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public - as a [...] "Producer". As these are seldom issued now and the MID relied upon to indicate the presence of insurance or not, {{it is incumbent upon}} the insurance industry to accurately and swiftly update the MID with current policy details and insurers that fail to do so can be penalised by their regulating body.|$|E

50|$|Shipping experts {{optimize}} {{their service}} and costs by sampling rates from several carriers, brokers and online marketplaces. When obtaining rates from different providers, shippers {{may find a}} wide range in the pricing offered. If a shipper in the United States uses a broker, freight forwarder or other transportation intermediary, {{it is common for}} the shipper to receive a copy of the carrier's Federal Operating Authority. Freight brokers and intermediaries are also required by Federal Law to be licensed by the Federal Highway Administration. Experienced shippers avoid unlicensed brokers and forwarders because if brokers are working outside the law by not having a Federal Operating License, the shipper has no protection {{in the event of a}} problem. Also, shippers normally ask for a copy of the broker's <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> and any specific insurance that applies to the shipment.|$|E
50|$|To {{pass the}} {{inspection}} a driver must {{get to a}} police vehicle registration center or an authorized service station and present a vehicle for inspection.

The lack of the valid <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> or driving with the elapsed one is subject to heavy fines and eventual revocation of the Driver's License. The test periodicity varies with the type of vehicle. Commercial buses (defined as vehicles that carry >8 persons aside from a driver) and oversize/dangerous cargo trucks must be inspected each 6 months, heavy trucks (>3.5 tons loaded weight) are inspected annually, while the new cars, bikes and light trucks (< 3.5 tons) must be first inspected after three years, then bi-annually until they are 7 years old, after which the inspections become annual.|$|E

50|$|As soon as {{a vehicle}} is purchased, the dealer of the vehicle issues a {{temporary}} licence sticker known colloquially as a TR (To Register) number. This is valid for one month, during which the owner must register the vehicle in the controlling RTO of {{the area in which}} the owner is residing to get a standard licence plate. Some states like Tamil Nadu do not allow vehicles with TR numbers on the road, the dealer will hand over the vehicle to the purchaser only after the registration process is done. To register a vehicle, it has to be presented to the RTO's office, where a Motor Vehicle Inspector will verify the applicant's address and other details, confirm that the engine and chassis numbers are identical to what is written in the application and issues a permanent registration certificate which is usually valid for 20 years. The permanent registration certificate is one of the four important documents a vehicle plying on the road should always have; the others being a valid <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate,</b> a pollution under control (PUC) certificate and the driver's licence. For public utility vehicles like buses, trucks, taxis and pick-up vans, {{there are a number of}} additional documents like a road-worthiness certificate and a transportation permit.|$|E
5000|$|During the post-World War II period, Zainichi Koreans faced {{various kinds}} of {{discrimination}} from Japanese society. Due to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japanese government created laws to support Japanese citizens by giving financial support, providing shelters, etc. However, after the treaty was signed, Zainichi Koreans were no longer counted as Japanese citizens, so {{they were unable to}} get any support from the government. They were unable to get an <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> from the government, so it was difficult for them to get any medical care. Without medical insurance, Zainichi Koreans were unable to go to hospital since the cost of medication was too high. Another problem caused by this treaty was that the Japanese government created a law which stated that Korean residents in Japan had to be fingerprinted since Zainichi Koreans had two names (their original name and a name given by the Japanese government). Under this law, Zainichi Koreans had to reveal their identity to the public because when they visited the city hall to provide their fingerprints, their neighbors found out that they were Zainichi Koreans. Therefore, Zainichi Koreans were forced to reveal their identity to Japanese and faced discrimination from them. This made their lives even more difficult. In order to protect themselves, many Zainichi Koreans protested against this law. Mindan and many Zainichi Koreans opposed this law, but the law wasn’t repealed until 1993. Until then, Zainichi Koreans could not escape from the social discrimination which they had faced in Japanese society. Furthermore, it was hard for the Zainichi Koreans to get a job due to discrimination. Especially, it was very hard for Zainichi Koreans to become public employees since Japan only let Japanese nationals become public employees at that time. Since many Zainichi Koreans couldn’t get a proper job, they began to get involved in illegal jobs such as [...] "illegal alcohol production, scrap recycling, and racketeering". (Min). As a result, many Zainichi Koreans ended up living in slums or hamlets since Japanese real estate agents refused to let Zainichi Koreans rent houses.Zainichi today have established a stable presence in Japan after years of activism. Through Mintohren, community support by Zainichi organizations (Mindan, Chongryon, among others), other minority groups (Ainu, Burakumin, Ryūkyūans, Uilta, Nivkhs and others), and sympathetic Japanese, they have improved the social atmosphere for Zainichi in Japan. There are also Koreans living in Japan who try to present themselves as Japanese to avoid discrimination. Most younger Zainichi now speak only Japanese, go to Japanese schools, work for Japanese firms and increasingly now marry Japanese. Most naturalization occurs among the young during the period when they seek formal employment or marriage. Those who have already established their life often choose to retain their South Korean or Joseon nationality as part of their heritage.|$|E
