40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, in several Northern and Western European Union {{countries}} responsibility for general youth policy has been transferred from the central government to the local level of municipalities. In this transformation process the local authorities, guided by central government's advice, have decided to give the participation of {{children and young people}} in policy decision-making an unprecedented policy prominence. In the Netherlands, as in the UK, youth's participation in policy decision-making was linked to the idea of fostering among young people a greater commitment to democracy. Democratic citizenship became the new pedagogical ideal. This evaluation study of youth policy in 25 municipalities shows the discrepancies between democratic ideals and youth's participation in practice.

40|$|While {{young people}} have {{generally}} {{been at the forefront}} of the adoption and use of new communications technologies, little is known of uses by <b>exceptional</b> <b>youth.</b> This study compares cell phone use by a group of adolescents with Asperger Syndrome (n = 35) with that by a group of adolescents with typical development (n = 35). People with Asperger Syndrome tend to have limited ability to take part in reciprocal communication and weaker social motivation. We predicted that this group would be less likely to have access to cell phones and, if they did have them, would be less likely to use them for talking to peers and more likely to use non-communicative features, such as games. These predictions received strong support. The findings have implications for theoretical accounts of new media use by the young, for our knowledge of the lives of individuals with AS, and for caregivers of children with exceptional conditions...|$|E
40|$|The various uses of {{computer-mediated}} communication (CMC) are {{transforming the}} nature of social interactions and human relations among adolescents. Little is known about engagement of <b>exceptional</b> <b>youth</b> with this technology. The present study investigated the implications of language and social factors for frequency of CMC use {{and its relationship to}} adolescent well-being in young people with and without a history of specific language impairment (SLI). Eighty six adolescents with a history of SLI and 90 typically developing 17 year olds participated. Participants completed standardized assessments of psycholinguistic abilities and self-report measures of language motivations and social motivations for CMC use, as well as anxiety and depression. Results indicate that language abilities have a complex relationship with frequency of CMC use; social abilities have a more direct association and are predictive of frequency of CMC use. Both adolescents with SLI and typically developing adolescents were less shy online. No association was obtained between frequency of CMC use and reported emotional symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. It is argued that the characteristics of CMC, in terms of its less stringent language demands and its reduced-cues environment, can provide a medium for positive adaptation of adolescents with communication challenges...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{adolescents}} use e-mail for {{a variety}} of purposes, including peer communication and education. Research into these uses has focused on typically developing individuals; much less is known about the use of e-mail by <b>exceptional</b> <b>youth.</b> The present study examined the structure and form of e-mail messages sent by adolescents with and without a history of specific language impairment (SLI). Thirty-eight adolescents with a history of SLI and 56 typically developing (TD) peers were assessed on measures of nonverbal abilities, core language skills and literacy skills (reading and spelling). The participants were asked to compose an e-mail reply to a standard e-mail sent by an experimenter. These reply e-mails were coded for linguistic structure, readability and spelling errors. Two adult raters, blind to the participants’ language ability, judged how understandable the e-mails were, how grammatically correct the e-mails were, and also the sender's command of the English language. Adolescents with a history of SLI produced e-mails that were similar to those sent by their TD peers in terms of structure and readability. However, they made significantly more spelling errors. Furthermore, the adult raters considered the messages from participants with a history of SLI to be of poorer standard than those sent by their TD peers. Conclusions & Implications: The findings suggest that the e-mail messages of adolescents with a history of SLI provide indicators of the sender's language and literacy skills.

6000|$|The second {{piece of}} {{experience}} which he acquired at Bossey was {{the knowledge of}} injustice and wrongful suffering as things actual and existent. Circumstances brought him under suspicion of having broken the teeth of a comb which {{did not belong to}} him. He was innocent, and not even the most terrible punishment could wring from him an untrue confession of guilt. The root of his constancy was not in an abhorrence of falsehood, which is <b>exceptional</b> in <b>youth,</b> and for which he takes no credit, but in a furious and invincible resentment against the violent pressure that was unjustly put upon him. [...] "Picture a character, timid and docile in ordinary life, but ardent, impetuous, indomitable in its passions; a child always governed by the voice of reason, always treated with equity, gentleness, and consideration, who had not even the idea of injustice, and who for the first time experiences an injustice so terrible, from the very people whom he most cherishes and respects! What a confusion of ideas, what disorder of sentiments, what revolution in heart, in brain, in every part of his moral and intellectual being!" [...] He had not learnt, any more than other children, either to put himself in the place of his elders, or to consider the strength of the apparent case against him. All that he felt was the rigour of a frightful chastisement for an offence of which he was innocent. And the association of ideas was permanent. [...] "This first sentiment of violence and injustice has remained so deeply engraved in my soul, that all the ideas relating to it bring my first emotion back to me; and this sentiment, though only relative to myself in its origin, has taken such consistency, and become so disengaged from all personal interest, that my heart is inflamed at the sight or story of any wrongful action, just as much as if its effect fell on my own person. When I read of the cruelties of some ferocious tyrant, or the subtle atrocities of some villain of a priest, I would fain start on the instant to poniard such wretches, though I were to perish a hundred times for the deed....

40|$|As you can {{see this}} JOURNAL is a work in progress. We hope to have our first edition on-line by the end of March. The {{editorial}} staff is currently reviewing submissions and choosing what is {{to be included in the}} first edition. New editions of the JOURNAL will be published quarterly, with timely articles and new perspectives concerning inclusive initiatives. It is our intent to provide a forum for articles concerning inclusive education and that many voices will be heard and diverse perspectives concerning inclusive education will be understood. The JOURNAL defines inclusive education in the same spirit and with the same understanding as the Council of Exceptional Children (CEC) defines the principles of appropriate ethical behavior. These principles of ethical behavior are based on several assumptions that are stated in the preamble of the CEC Common Core of Knowledge and Skills essential for all beginning special education teachers (1996). One assumption is that special education has within its heritage the perspectives of advocacy for persons with exceptionalities and of embracing individual differences. These differences include the traditional consideration of the nature and effect of exceptionalities. As the community of <b>exceptional</b> children, <b>youth,</b> and adults has become increasingly diverse, these perspectives have been broadened to include other characteristics that significantly influence their quality of life. To maintain their ability to successfully function as advocates for their multicultural clients, special educators must broaden their perspectives to ensure vigilant attention to the issues of diversity...... to design effective interventions, special educators must understand the characteristics of their learners, including factors such as culture, language, gender, religion, and sexuality.... Another assumption is that the sustained involvement of families and the larger community is fundamental to delivering high-quality educational serves to individuals with exceptional learning needs. This journal embraces the above ethical definitions with one caveat [...] the above principles are appropriate for ALL educators, ALL children and ALL educational endeavors. Each child placed in the charge of public education represents a unique combination of learning characteristics and needs and therefore presents an opportunity to foster, celebrate, embrace, affirm and delight in the diversity inherent in this population. In the coming months as this JOURNAL grows and develops its voice we will continue to define and enlarge the above perspective...|$|R
40|$|Special education, {{educational}} {{provisions for}} <b>exceptional</b> children and <b>youth,</b> {{is based on}} the premise that some students have physical, mental, or behavioral characteristics that so separate them from their peers it is necessary to provide special services or to adapt or modify general education programs in order to meet their needs. Most nations have developed policies and practices concerning the education and needs of students who require special education. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those special education issues of most concern to special educators in Victoria, Australia and Nebraska, U. S. A. and to compare those issues to determine if there is a significant difference in the issues as determined by educators in Nebraska and Victoria. ^ A modified Delphi survey was administered to special educators in Victoria and Nebraska to determine the important issues in special education as reported by selected experts. The issues were generated by the respondents themselves in the first round. Respondents were asked to respond to those issues in the second and third rounds of research. An independent-measures t-test was conducted to compare the final results from both states. With 40 degrees of freedom and alpha =. 05 for a two-tailed test, the critical value was 2. 021. The data in this study produced a t statistic of 3. 595. Thus, it can be interpreted that there was a significant difference in the final opinion of Nebraska educators as compared to those of Victorian educators. Although there was a significant difference between the overall opinions of special education experts in both countries, there also were many similarities in the issues common to both states. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} forms part of {{a broader}} review of the Tasmanian Youth Justice Collaborative Case Conference (CCC) process, which is currently being undertaken at a policy level. The Collaborative Case Conference program is currently practiced in the Northern Youth Justice Area only. Over the period since it was adopted by the North, it has evolved considerably, adapting {{to meet the needs of}} complex clients. The contribution of the CCC is recognised in the new Youth Justice Model of Care (MOC, 2012), which intends to evaluate the effectiveness of the CCC, and make recommendations as to its extension to other areas of the State. The purpose of this dissertation is to focus on one part of this overall review; the "Referral Pathway" into the Collaborative Case Conference (CCC) process itself. In doing so, it will raise issues for consideration within the current referral pathway in meeting the requirements of complex and exceptional needs clients entering the Youth Justice System. The aim is to propose a new referral pathway that is linked to a primary assessment that determines an early intervention approach. The dissertation has three specific objectives: The first section outlines the current Collaborative Case Conference (CCC) process, which employs a horizontal and vertical response and both highlights and streamlines the referral pathway. To provide an overview of the CCC process, this dissertation draws information from the Department of Health and Human Service, Children and Youth Service, Collaborative Case Conference Policy and Guidelines (2012). Secondly, through a literature review lens, this dissertation responds to the current CCC referral pathway by arguing that the one pertinent issue to successfully working with this target group is that complex needs require a higher level of collaborative expertise and therefore require an early intervention approach and subsequent pathway into the CCC process. Lastly, this dissertation clearly outlines a new early intervention front-end approach into the CCC process. This new revised approach is put forward as the most effective way to respond to high needs complex clients that enter the Youth Justice System. The methodological insight for this dissertation is based on the assumption that a review on the referral pathway into the Collaborative Case Conference process will advocate as evidence for future policy change. Thus, within a literature review framework, this dissertation highlights that policy administrators need to understand that an early intervention approach into the Collaborative Case Conference process will deliver more effective and timely outcomes when supporting this high needs client group. The main policy implications of these findings are straightforward. To embrace research and develop an early intervention referral pathway into the CCC process. Through implementation of this policy, collaboration will occur as an established early practice, resulting in better outcomes for <b>exceptional</b> needs <b>Youth</b> Justice Clients...|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with the {{childhood}} and <b>exceptional</b> and accomplished <b>youth</b> of Prince Stepan Kasatsky. The young man is destined for great things. He discovers {{on the eve of}} his wedding that his fiancée Countess Mary Korotkova has had an affair with his beloved Tsar Nicholas I. The blow to his pride is massive, and he retreats to the arms of Russian Orthodoxy and becomes a monk. Many years of humility and doubt follow. He is ordered to become a hermit. Despite his being removed from the world, he is still remembered for having so remarkably transformed his life. One winter night, a group of merry-makers decide to visit him, and one of them, a divorced woman named Makovkina, spends the night in his cell, with the intention to seduce him. Father Sergius discovers he is still weak and in order to protect himself, cuts off his own finger. Makovkina is stunned by this act, and leaves the next morning, having vowed to change her life. A year later she has joined a convent. Father Sergius' reputation for holiness grows. He becomes known as a healer, and pilgrims come from far and wide. Yet Father Sergius is profoundly aware of his inability to attain a true faith. He is still tortured by boredom, pride, and lust. He fails a new test, when the young daughter of a merchant successfully beds him. The morning after, he leaves the monastery and seeks out his cousin Pashenka (Praskovya Mikhaylovna), whom he, with a group of other boys, had tormented many years ago. He finds her, now in all the conventional senses a failure in life, yet imbued with a sense of service towards her family. His path is now clearer. He begins to wander, until eight months later he is arrested in the company of a blind beggar who makes him feel closer to God. He is sent to Siberia, where he now works as the hired man of a well-to-do peasant, teaching the gentleman's young children and working in the gardens.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of a democratically elected multi-party government in 1990, the need for advancing a national educational program has been evident if Nepal is to rise above its present poverty status. This dissertation provides a description of the existing status, the needs, and future proposals concerning special education for exceptional students in Nepal. The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct a needs assessment for the delivery of special education services in Nepal. Specifically, this study provides: (a) a national overview of the status of special education services in Nepal; (b) a description of the specific issues with which school administrators are faced in trying to serve <b>exceptional</b> children and <b>youth,</b> and (c) recommendations for the future. The review of the literature addresses the limited Nepalese data and information on: (a) prevalence of exceptional school-age population; (b) the legal status of special education; and (c) exceptional students being served. The major components of comprehensive special education programs were discussed including: (a) the purposes of special education; (b) the alternative kinds of special education services; and (c) the organization of special education services. The methodology for this study included a description of a conceptual model; unit of analysis; subjects selection; instrumentation, data collection methods; and data analysis procedures. The results described the current status and needs of special education services in all seventy five school districts of Nepal. Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect data from district education officers. These data presented the responses of the district education officers regarding the: types and numbers of children with exceptionalities identified, served, and not served; the kinds of personnel and programs provided; operating procedures; barriers; and administrators' suggestions for improving services. The recommendations from this study included: information about strong and weak areas in existing services and needs to improve the special education services; a new model for the delivery of services; and suggestions for effecting further action. This study concluded with comments on the feasibility of implementing a national plan, with particular attention to {{the establishment}} of a nationwide delivery procedure for Nepalese children with special education needs...|$|R
