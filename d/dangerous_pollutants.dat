The last {{is the reason for}} the always increasing interest, demonstrated by the number of publications on this topic in recent years, in air quality/pollution indices: since the concentration of individual pollutants can be confusing, concentration measurements are conveniently transformed in terms of an air quality index. In this way, complex situations are summarized in a single figure, letting comparisons in time and space be possible. In this paper we will give an overview about the Air Quality/Pollution Indices proposed in literature and/or adopted by countries, trying also to categorize them into homogeneous groups. For the classification different approaches can be followed. Since in real life exposure to mixtures of chemicals occurs, with additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects, here we will distinguish between indices that consider the conjoint effect of pollutants and indices only based on the actual most <b>dangerous</b> <b>pollutant.</b> This brief review on air pollution indices shows, on one side, the wide interest in the problem, on the other, the lack of a common strategy which allows to compare the state of the air for cities that follow different directives.

Workers exposed to o-anisidine by inhalation for 6 months developed headaches, vertigo, and effects on the blood. Animal studies have reported effects on the blood from chronic (long-term) dermal exposure to o-anisidine. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of o-anisidine in humans.

The ultimate goal is to ensure that the natural ecosystems of the Guianas continues to play their role to sustain the region’s biological diversity, cultural enrichment and socio-economic development. Goldmining plays a significant economic role in the Guianas, yet the rudimentary nature of small to medium scale gold mining activities often generates a legacy of extensive degradation and deplorable social-conditions, both during and after activities have ceased. This form of mining usually involves the extraction of secondary gold from placer deposits (alluvial, colluvial or elluvial), which can be liberated and treated using gravity methods. In the Guianas, the most popular form of small-scale gold mining is referred to as “land dredging”, a combination of hydraulicking and suction dredging. This method requires application of large volumes of water for both mining and mineral processing; in most cases, there are no containment structures for the waste tailings generated. Mercury, a <b>dangerous</b> <b>pollutant,</b> is the preferred method employed by small-scale miners for gold recovery.

This study was conducted with the aim of investigating truck drivers hearing loss and its effective factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 in Kerman City on 150 professional truck drivers who had a dossier at the center of screening occupational diseases, and were chosen by stratified random sampling. Information was collected by a checklist including age, marital status, military services status, smoking status and audiometry done in the current year and were analyzed by using SPSS 18 using correlation, ANOVA, Paired t-test, McNemar's test and Adjusted Linear Regression. Results: The mean age of participants was 43. 0 ± 10. 56 and in all frequencies a significant difference was found between the hearing threshold of drivers with different work experiences, and hearing loss increased with increase in work experience. Hearing loss increased significantly in all frequencies with age increase as well. Hearing loss in frequencies more than 2000 H was significantly more in the left ear than the right. Conclusion: Although age increase is an important factor in hearing loss, but alone, it does not justify the asymmetric hearing loss at the quantities measured in the drivers in this study. It appears that driving due to constant exposure to noise can lead to hearing loss in drivers. *Corresponding Author: Narges Khanjani, Department of Epidemiology and Statistic, Faculty of Public Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.

After optimum pH determination (pH= 7), this plant was cultivated within 14 days in a contaminated Hoagland nutrient solution which had four different concentrations of Ni (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg/L). By daily measurement of Ni concentration in cultivation solution and also initial and final concentrations of this element in the plants, the Ni-phytoextraction potential was evaluated, and biological effects of Ni on coontail were studied by calculation of biomass production index. Maximum Ni removal efficiency was 50 %, which was observed in the 1 mg/L Ni treatment. Maximum transfer factor and uptake index were 338. 65 and 5. 05 mg, respectively, obtained in 6 mg/L Ni treatment.
