He was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1967. He was invited by the premier, Don Dunstan, {{to become the}} Governor of South Australia, a position he held from 1971 to 1976. During this period, he caused great concern to Dunstan when he strongly supported {{the decision of the}} Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.|$|E
500|$|Once seated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair,</b> {{a canopy}} of golden cloth is held over the monarch's head for the anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was {{performed}} in recent coronations by four Knights of the Garter. This element of the coronation service is considered sacred and is concealed from public gaze; it was not photographed in 1937 or televised in 1953. The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a filigreed spoon with which the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign {{in the form of}} a cross on the hands, head, and heart. The Coronation Spoon is the only part of the mediaeval Crown Jewels which survived the Commonwealth of England. While performing the anointing, the Archbishop recites a consecratory formula recalling the anointing of King Solomon by Nathan the prophet and Zadok the priest.|$|E
500|$|The group {{obtained}} a duplicate nuclear football and Gold Codes card, {{and kept it}} in the situation room. (Reagan's football was still with the officer at the hospital, and Bush also had a card and football.) The participants discussed whether to raise the military's alert status, {{and the importance of}} doing so without changing the DEFCON level, although the number of Soviet submarines proved to be normal. Upon learning that Reagan was in surgery, Haig declared, the [...] "helm is right here. And that means right <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair</b> for now, constitutionally, until the vice president gets here." [...] However, Haig made an inaccurate statement. As the sitting Secretary of State, he was fourth behind Vice President [...] Bush, [...] Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and President pro tempore of the Senate Strom Thurmond in the line of succession and, under , O'Neill and Thurmond would have had to resign their positions to become acting president. Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the March 2006 {{incident}} with the Capitol Police officer, Rep. McKinney was in the news, and her office invited the media to attend one of her monthly [...] "District Days," [...] where she spends one full day meeting with constituents to discuss issues of concern. At her April 23, 2006, [...] "District Days" [...] event, Rep. McKinney was being interviewed by WGCL's Renee Starzyk, who repeatedly questioned her about the March 29 scuffle with a Capitol police officer. Frustrated, McKinney stood up and apparently forgot she was still wearing the microphone. Her offscreen comments were captured on tape. She was heard saying, [...] "Oh, crap, now you know what ... they lied to , and Coz is a fool." [...] McKinney returned on screen with the microphone, this time with instructions on what parts of the interview the station was allowed to use: [...] "anything that is captured by your audio ... that is captured while I'm not seated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair</b> is off the record and is not permissible [...] to be used ... is that understood?" [...] The comments from the interview were subsequently aired on CBS and eventually across the nation.|$|E
2500|$|It took 15 {{minutes for}} Don Canham {{to be sold}} on Bo Schembechler, {{resulting}} in Schembechler becoming the 15th coach in Michigan football history. At the time, Schembechler's current employer, the Miami RedHawks, could have thrown more money at Schembechler, but Canham managed to sell Schembechler on Michigan's tradition and prestige. Schembechler's respect for Michigan was evident early on when assistants complained about how the equipment they had was worse than {{what they had to}} work with at Miami. Schembechler gestured to a rusty chair and said, [...] "See this chair? Fielding Yost sat <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair.</b> See this nail? Fielding Yost hung his hat on that nail. And you're telling me we had better stuff at Miami? No men, we didn't. We have tradition here, Michigan tradition, and that's something no one else has!" [...] Schembechler immediately got to work in turning around his team. He had a reputation for being hard on his players, causing 65 of his 140 players to quit the team before the season even started. In response, Schembechler promised his team [...] "Those Who Stay Will be Champions," [...] assuring the players that remained that their efforts would be rewarded.|$|E

[...] "Let us {{consider}} it settled, therefore, that Winthrop, Bellingham, Dudley, and Endicott, each of them, when chosen governor, took {{his seat in}} our great chair on election day. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair,</b> likewise, did those excellent governors preside, while holding consultations with the chief counsellors of the province, who were styled Assistants. The governor sat <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair,</b> too, whenever messages were brought {{to him from the}} chamber of Representatives." ...|$|E

60|$|Seating the {{stranger}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair,</b> Bertie {{rolled up the}} trouser, and passed his fingers round the knee. There was a sort, of loving-kindness in that movement, as of a hand which had in its time felt the joints and sinews of innumerable horses.|$|E

Eighty-two, a great age, yet it seems but the other day that I used to sit <b>in</b> <b>this</b> very <b>chair</b> and dandle you upon my knee, and make this {{repeater}} strike for you. And yet that is twenty years since, and I have lived through four twenties and two years. A great age, a cold world!" ...|$|R

"Now I have {{performed}} {{the part of}} a good host," [...] pursued Mr. Rochester, [...] "put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.

6000|$|... "You {{mean that}} the man sent you to try and work on me {{because he knew that}} I used to be {{intimate}} with your family. Well, it is a poor errand and will have a poor end.

60|$|He was {{brooding}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair,</b> {{with his}} eyes cast down upon the ground, when Mrs Gamp came in {{to tell him that}} the little room was ready.

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>chair,</b> {{from one}} year's end to another, sat that prodigious bookworm, Cotton Mather, {{sometimes}} devouring a great book, and sometimes scribbling one as big.

5000|$|While in Paris, Niemeyer began {{designing}} {{furniture that}} {{was produced by}} Mobilier International. He created an easy chair and ottoman composed of bent steel and leather in limited numbers for private clients. Later, <b>in</b> 1978, <b>this</b> <b>chair</b> and other designs, including the [...] "Rio" [...] chaise-longue were produced in Brazil by Tendo company, then Tendo Brasileira. The easy chairs and ottomans were made of bent wood and were placed in Communist party headquarters around the world. Much like his architecture, Niemeyer's furniture designs evoked the beauty of Brazil, with curves mimicking the female form and the hills of Rio de Janeiro.|$|R
50|$|The {{great variety}} of {{individual}} designs found <b>in</b> <b>this</b> group of <b>chairs</b> suggests that they were made by cabinet makers or carpenters for an individual order, rather than working {{in the tradition of}} the turner who made many chairs in the same design.|$|R

60|$|In {{the room}} where Marco slept, there was a large, stuffed arm-chair, which was {{commonly}} called the easy chair; it was one that was seldom used by the family, except in sickness.

The niggers are snug stowed below before a fire that would roast an ox whole. The thermometer stands now at fifty- five, but if there’s any vartue in good maple wood, I’ll weather upon it, before one glass, as much as ten points more, so that the squire, when he comes home from Betty Hollister’s warm room, will feel as hot as a hand that has given the rigging a lick with bad tar.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{fracture}} {{occurs in the}} joints of wooden structures. The joints are often reinforced with adhesive, stretcher, and shelf brackets. However, {{it is better to}} remove or reduce the number of joints. For this purpose, curved wood can be used instead to the jointed frame. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> study, <b>chairs</b> with curved frames were compared with conventional design. The aim of the study includes the use of reinforced frame and reduces the joints of frame for improving the quality of chairs.|$|R
5000|$|Zaehner {{continued}} {{an interest}} in Zoroastrian studies, publishing his Zurvan book and two others on the subject during the 1950s.
