25|$|The Viggen was {{initially}} developed as an intended {{replacement for the}} Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter. In 1955, as Saab's prototype Draken, the most aerodynamically advanced fighter {{in the world at}} that point, performed its first flight, the Swedish Air Force was already forming a series of requirements {{for the next generation of}} combat aircraft; due to the challenging nature of these requirements, a lengthy development time was anticipated, with the first flight intended to be no early than the middle of the next decade. Between 1952 and 1957, the first studies towards what would become the Viggen were carried out, involving the Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Over 100 different concepts were examined in these studies, involving both single- and twin engine configurations, both traditional and <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> wings, and canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered, with separate lift engines, but were soon identified as being unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Saab {{finalized}} the aerodynamic {{design of}} the aircraft; the aerodynamic configuration was radical: it combined an aft-mounted <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> wing with a small, high-set canard foreplane, equipped with powered trailing flaps mounted ahead of and slightly above the main wing; this would be judged {{to be the best}} means to satisfy the conflicting demands for STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity at low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight. Canard aircraft have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the IAI Kfir, but principally for the purposes of providing agility during flight rather than for its STOL capabilities. Further aerodynamic refinements during the later stage of development included the addition of dog-tooth patterns upon the main wing to generate vortices, allowing for the elimination of blown flaps from the canard. The use of a thrust reverser enabled the sought short landing performance.|$|E

The first prototypes had a straight midsection fuselage that was later improved with a [...] "hump" [...] on the dorsal spine for reduced drag according to the area rule. The wing had the shape of a <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> with a dogtooth added to improve longitudinal stability at high incidence angles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study generalizations of finite-type knot invariants {{obtained}} by replacing the crossing {{change in the}} Vassiliev skein relation by some other local move. There are several ways of formalizing {{the notion of a}} local move. Representing knots as closed braids, one can define local moves as modifications by elements of some subgroup G of the pure braid group P∞ on an infinite number of strands. We prove that if the subgroup G is stable under the “strand-tripling” endomorphisms, the resulting finite-type invariants have properties {{similar to those of the}} usual finite-type invariants. In particular, generalized Goussarov’s n-equivalence classes of knots form groups under the connected sum operation. (Similar results, but with a different approach, have been obtained before by Taniyama and Yasuhara.) These results lead us to ask whether the set of generalized n-equivalence classes, with respect to Garoufalidis and Rozansky’s null-move of pairs (M, k) where M is a homology 3 -sphere and k a knot in M, is, in fact, a group. We answer this question in the affirmative for the submonoid where M = S 3. One can also define local moves as surgeries on claspers. Using this description of local moves, we study two particular cases: the band-pass and the <b>doubled</b> <b>delta</b> move. We show that the primitive finite-type invariants corresponding to the band-pass move coincide with the primitive Vassiliev invariants in orders greater than zero and that the only band-pass invariant of order zero is the Arf invariant. In the case of the <b>doubled</b> <b>delta</b> move there are many more invariants of each order. We show that the only primitive invariants of order zero that are also Vassiliev invariants, come from the Conway polynomial. (Over the rationals this has been established before by Murakami and Ohtsuki.) We find that there is exactly one Vassiliev invariant in each odd degree which is of <b>doubled</b> <b>delta</b> degree one, whereas in each even degree there is at most a Z 2 -valued invariant, which we show exists in degree 4. For higher <b>doubled</b> <b>delta</b> degrees, we observe that the Euler degree n + 1 part of the rational lift of the Kontsevich integral is a <b>doubled</b> <b>delta</b> degree 2 n invariant. 1...|$|R

40|$|Sixty senior design {{students}} at Cal Poly, SLO have completed a year-long project {{to design the}} next generation of High Speed Civil Transports (HSCT). The design process was divided up into three distinct phases. The first third of the project was devoted entirely to research into the special problems associated with an HSCT. These included economic viability, airport compatibility, high speed aerodynamics, sonic boom minimization, environmental impact, and structures and materials. The result of this research was the development of nine separate Requests for Proposal (RFP) that outlined reasonable yet challenging design criteria for the aircraft. All were designed to be technically feasible in the year 2015. The next phase of the project divided the sixty students into nine design groups. Each group, with its own RFP, completed a Class 1 preliminary design of an HSCT. The nine configurations varied from conventional <b>double</b> <b>deltas</b> to variable geometry wings to a pivoting oblique wing design.

40|$|Abstract. We study generalizations of finite-type knot invariants {{obtained}} by replacing the crossing {{change in the}} Vassiliev skein relation by some other local move. First, we represent the local moves by normal subgroups of the pure braid group P∞. Subgroups that are stable under the “strand-tripling ” endomorphisms are shown to produce finite-type invariants with familiar properties; in particular, generalized Goussarov’s n-equivalence classes of knots form groups under the connected sum. (Similar results, but with a different approach, have been obtained before by Taniyama and Yasuhara.) Treating local moves as surgeries on claspers, we study two particular cases in detail: the band-pass and the <b>doubled</b> <b>delta</b> move. While the band-pass move gives only one “new ” invariant (namely, the Arf invariant), the invariants corresponding to the doubled-delta move contain information which is not available to any finite collection of Vassiliev invariants. The complete degree 0 doubled-delta invariant is the S-equivalence class of the knot. In this context, we generalize a result of Murakami and Ohtsuki {{to show that the}} only primitive Vassiliev invariants of S-equivalence taking values in an abelian group with no 2 -torsion arise from the Alexander-Conway polynomial.

Untreated cells of sod 1 deltasod 2 <b>delta</b> <b>double</b> mutants showed increased glutathione peroxidase activity (126 %), while sod 1 delta had lower activity (77 %) than the wild type.

Yeast mutants that lack glutathione reductase (glr 1 delta) accumulate high levels of oxidized glutathione and have a twofold increase in total glutathione. The disulfide form of glutathione increases 200 -fold and represents 63 % of the total glutathione in a glr 1 delta mutant compared with only 6 % in wild type. High levels of oxidized glutathione are also observed in a trx 1 delta, trx 2 <b>delta</b> <b>double</b> mutant (22 % of total), in a glr 1 delta, trx 1 <b>delta</b> <b>double</b> mutant (71 % of total), and in a glr 1 delta, trx 2 <b>delta</b> <b>double</b> mutant (69 % of total).
