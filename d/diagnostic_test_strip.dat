This study was therefore carried out to determine the correlation of HCV infection and diabetes. Methods Three hundred (300) confirmed type 2 diabetic patients were screened for hepatitis C virus antibodies at the Plateau state specialist hospital, Jos, using Grand <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> <b>strip.</b> Questionnaire comprising of age, sex, family history on diabetes, duration of disease and marital status were issued to subjects. Results Overall result showed that the prevalence rate of HCV infection was 33 (11 %). In response to diabetic status, females subjects had a higher prevalence of 178 (59. 3 %) compared to males 122 (40. 7 %). Those aged 47 – 57 recorded the highest seroprevalence 10 (30. 3 %) to the Hepatitis C Virus, while Patients without family history of diabetes showed a higher seroprevalence of 13 (39. 4 %). Subjects who never had any blood transfusion recorded a prevalence rate of 6 (18. 2 %). Marital status showed no significant difference [(P = 0. 275; P. 0. 05) ]. Considering duration of developing diabetes, patients within the range of 1 – 10 years diabetic status recorded the highest prevalence rate 25 (75. 8 %) compared to other ranges considered. Conclusion This study hence, suggests a relatively strong association between HCV infection and diabetes, this therefore call for an urgent approach strategy in the control and management of this disease of the endocrine system. </p...|$|E

Finger-prick blood on filter paper and rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> from P. falciparum-positive individuals of all age groups attending health facilities in six regions of Tanzania between June 2010 and August 2011 were obtained. Using chelex- 100 extracted DNA, genotyping was done for mutations on codons 51, 59 and 108 of Pfdhfr and 437 and 540 of Pfdhps genes using PCR-RFLP technique. A total of 802 malaria-positive samples were screened and genotyped. The prevalence of Pfdhfr 51 I, Pfdhps 437 G and 540 E varied between the regions (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) whereas Pfdhfr 59 R (FE 10. 79, p[*]=[*] 0. 225) and 108  N (FE 10. 61, p[*]=[*] 0. 239) did not vary between the regions. The Pfdhfr triple mutant was above 84 % and close to fixation levels in all regions, whereas the Pfdhps double mutation ranged from 43. 8 to 97 % between the regions. The quintuple mutant (IRNGE) was the most prevalent in all regions and it varied significantly from 37. 5 to 90. 2 % (χ 2 [*]=[*] 1. 11, p < 0. 001). There is evidence of persistent high levels of SP resistance markers in Tanzania with evidence of quintuple mutations that are likely to become fixed in the population.

Selection of SP resistance is ongoing since SP is readily available in health facilities and in private drug shops in sub-Saharan Africa. This study reports on the prevalence and distribution of Pfdhps mutations A 540 E and A 581 G in Tanzania. When found together, these mutations confer high-level SP resistance (sometimes referred to as 'super-resistance'), which is associated with loss in protective efficacy of SP-IPTp. DNA samples were extracted from malaria-positive blood samples on filter paper, used malaria rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> and whole blood collected from eight sites in seven administrative regions of Tanzania. PCR-RFLP and SSOP-ELISA techniques were used to genotype the A 540 E and A 581 G Pfdhps.

There were variations in the distribution of Pfmdr 1 polymorphisms among regions. Tanga region had exceptionally high prevalence of mutant alleles, while Mbeya had the highest prevalence of wild type alleles. The haplotype YFY was exclusively most prevalent in Tanga (29. 6 %) whereas the NYD haplotype was the most prevalent in all other regions. Excluding Tanga and Mbeya, four, most common Pfmdr 1 haplotypes did not vary between the remaining four regions (chi 2 = 2. 3, p = 0. 512). The NFD haplotype was the second most prevalent haplotype in all regions, ranging from 17 % - 26 %. This is the first country-wide survey on Pfmdr 1 mutations associated with ACT resistance.

Methods Retrospective analysis was conducted using pharmacy administrative claims data for NSSPP beneficiaries. Study subjects were aged ≥ 65 years on October 1, 2004, received SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> in the 110 days prior to April 1, 2005, and were alive throughout the twelve month study period. Subjects were categorized into four groups: insulin only, oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAA) only, both OAA and insulin; and no reimbursed diabetes medications. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differences in expenditure by medication group and in frequency of SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> claimed by medication group, age, and sex. Results Of 13, 564 included beneficiaries, 13. 2 % were categorized as insulin only, 53. 5 % OAA only, 7. 2 % both OAA and insulin, and 26. 0 % no reimbursed diabetes medications. Over half (58. 7 %) were femle. The insulin only category had the highest mean (± SD) number of SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> claimed per day (2. 0 ± 1. 5) with a mean annual total cost of $ 615 ± $ 441 /beneficiary.

Different methods of incorporating detector agents into the nanofibre were exploited for the detection of the biomolecules. The methods included physical incorporation of nanoparticles, covalent bonding of ligand/dyes through surface modification of the fibres. The first colorimetric <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for ascorbic acid was based on copper-gold alloy nanoparticles prepared in-situ and hosted in nylon 6. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> showed selectivity in detecting ascorbic acid in the pH range 2 – 7. The suitability of fibres in hosting copper-gold alloy nanoparticles for the colorimetric detection of ascorbic acid was investigated using nylon 6, poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) -styrene and cellulose acetate based <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b> All the <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> exhibited leaching and the nylon 6 based <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was found to be thermally stable up to 60 ˚C. The colorimetric performance of the <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> was maintained and neither was colour decay exhibited after 10 months of storage in a shelf. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> achieved an eye-ball limit of detection of 1. 76 x 10 - 2 mg L- 1 and its suitability was demonstrated by the determination of ascorbic acid in fruit juices, urine, serum, and vitamin C tablets. The second colorimetric <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for ascorbic acid and dopamine employed prussian blue synthesised in-situ in nylon 6. Ascorbic acid turned the deep blue <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> to light blue at pH 3, and a faded navy blue colour at a pH range of 6 - 7 while dopamine changed the strip to purple at the same pH range. The versatility of the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was demonstrated by detecting ascorbic acid in commercial fruit juices as well as by detecting ascorbic acid as well as dopamine in fortified urine. The eye-ball detection limit of the Prussian blue <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for ascorbic acid and dopamine was 17. 6 mg L- 1 and 18. 9 mg L- 1, respectively. The third method involved a covalent approach, where poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) nanofibers were post functionalised with 2 -(2 ′-pyridyl) -imidazole and iron(III) for the selective detection of ascorbic acid and dopamine. The eye-ball detection limit for ascorbic acid and dopamine was 17. 6 mg L- 1 and 18. 9 mg L- 1, respectively. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was selective for dopamine, but the detection of ascorbic acid suffered from interference by glutathione. The application of the <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> was nevertheless demonstrated by the detection of ascorbic acid in fruit juices and dopamine in fortified urine. The developed <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> employing the three approaches were applied without sample pre-treatment and use of supporting equipment...|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{analysis}} of urine <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> using automated urine <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> analysers is a well-established practice in modern-day urinalysis. They can measure calcium, blood, glucose, bilirubin, urobilinogen, ketones, leukocytes, creatinine, microalbumin, pH, ascorbic acid and protein.|$|R
30|$|The {{control line}} of <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> {{was used to}} {{determine}} the optimum amount of labeling. For the optimization of labeling amount of SPA, QDs and colloidal gold labeling different concentration of SPA were used. The colloidal gold <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were inserted into 1.5 -mL test tubes containing 200 μL PBS and the coloring of control line was observed after 10 min. The QD-based <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were inserted into 1.5 mL test tubes containing 200 μL of QD-labeled SPA solution and the coloring of control line was observed after 10 min. A slight difference was that the results of QDs-based <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were observed under the portable ultraviolet lamp.|$|R
40|$|Summary: The mass {{densities of}} 2000 urines from {{children}} and 2000 urines from adults were determined {{with the new}} <b>test</b> <b>strip,</b> Multistix SG, {{and the results were}} compared with osmolality measurements. Normal urinary Parameters were investigated for possible interference with the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> reading. Variations in the pH and ionic composition of urine considerably influenced the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> reading, whereas nonionic compounds, such äs glucose and urea, showed practically no interference. For patients on a normal diet and without metabolic diseases, the new <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> is more appropriate than urometry for the determination of the mass density of the urine.
