50|$|Some common {{magazine}} {{design features}} include sturdy construction, small windows and solid doors, ventilation and overhanging eaves, timber floors with copper nails or timber pegs instead of iron nails, {{and the provision}} of lightning conductors and copper <b>earthing</b> <b>straps.</b> Magazines were generally located away from other buildings, and were sometimes surrounded by earthworks to deflect any blast. Magazine complexes were often surrounded by walls or fences to keep people out.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnostics {{can be used}} {{to diagnose}} insulation defects in medium voltage cables and thereby inform required maintenance planning to extend the lifespan of ageing assets. High frequency current transformers (HFCT) installed on the <b>earth</b> <b>strap</b> at the cable termination are widely used to detect the fast varying pulses resulting from PD. Due to constructional reasons <b>earth</b> <b>strap</b> accessibility in underground cables is often limited. Furthermore in three core cables, phase angle dependency of pulses resulting from PD sometimes fails to induce pulses in the earth screen. This paper investigates an alternative method of PD detection using conventional power frequency current transformers (PFCT) principally used for protection and measurement purposes. This investigation assesses the feasibility of this approach by conducting a magnetic study of the transformer core, frequency response analysis (FRA), and finally capturing and analyzing onsite PD measurements using conventional PFCTs and the developed PD data acquisition/interpretation system. Based on the laboratory and on-site measurement results, PFCTs can be considered for detecting PD. This approach does not require retrofitting additional PD sensors and can also be applied to older switchgear design without any outage. Hence this approach can be considered as a low cost and noninvasive method of PD detection in cables...|$|R
50|$|The brick {{magazine}} {{was used as}} a hall by the local community between the wars, and a photograph, possibly from this period or post World War II, shows a timber skillion extension to {{the east side of the}} magazine building. At this time the ridge ventilator, lightning rods and copper <b>earthing</b> <b>straps</b> were still in place. The lightening rod assembly reportedly survived on a local farm for some time, and consisted of a copper cylinder about 4 inches in diameter, which had holes for three copper spikes (1/2 inch thick by 2 feet long, or 12.7mm by 609.6mm) to jut out at angles, so that the tips were 2 feet apart. Two 2 inch (50.8mm) copper straps at least ¼ inch (6.35mm) thick led down the sides of the building to be earthed. In the photograph double timber doors are shown in the west end of the magazine, and these may have existed before the building became a hall. These doors are not on the 1887 plans for the magazine. Lead sheeting from under the roofing iron (of either the two timber and iron magazines or the brick magazine) were recycled by locals for stump caps and guttering.|$|R
50|$|Juliane Koepcke {{survived a}} long free fall {{resulting}} from the December 24, 1971, crash of LANSA Flight 508 (a LANSA Lockheed Electra OB-R-941 commercial airliner) in the Peruvian rainforest. The airplane was struck by lightning during a severe thunderstorm and exploded in mid air, disintegrating two miles (3.2 km) up. Köpcke, who was 17 {{years old at the}} time, fell to <b>earth</b> still <b>strapped</b> into her seat. The German Peruvian teenager survived the fall with only a broken collarbone, a gash to her right arm, and her right eye swollen shut.|$|R

50|$|A {{dynamite}} {{magazine of}} a similar design to the powder magazine {{was added to the}} site at a cost of £217 over 1885-86. An additional powder magazine was built at a cost of £402 over 1887-88, tenders being invited in September 1887. This third magazine was made of brick, with internal dimensions of 30 feet by 20 feet (9.1m by 6.1m) with 14 inch (355.6mm) thick walls. There were three narrow windows on each side, with a door at one end, and the roof ridge was capped with a round ventilator, on which sat a lightning conductor which was <b>earthed</b> by copper <b>straps</b> which dropped from the hipped roof to the ground and trailed away from the building.|$|R
