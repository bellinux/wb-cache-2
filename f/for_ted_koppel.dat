50|$|McFadden {{became an}} anchor of Primetime in 2004 and, having {{previously}} substituted <b>for</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> on several occasions, an anchor of Nightline on November 28, 2005, along with Martin Bashir and Terry Moran, following the longtime anchor's final broadcast. Bashir left the program due to fallout from credibility problems from the disputed and controversial reports on singer Michael Jackson {{and was replaced}} by Bill Weir in 2010. The three tended to anchor in shifts, leading the show by themselves every third night. While Nightline was threatened with cancellation in 2002 under Koppel's long form journalism format, it saw a resurgence in its ratings and prominence after switching to more celebrity topics, pop culture and entertainment news, often competing for higher numbers with the Late Show with David Letterman. As anchor, McFadden conducted a number of significant interviews including ones with celebrities such as Clint Eastwood and Paul McCartney, past and present world leaders such as Pervez Musharraf and Tony Blair, and five with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5000|$|The {{routine is}} {{essentially}} a twelve-minute rant about behaviors that Rock sees in {{a subset of the}} black community.

In the routine, he says: [...] "When I go to the money machine tonight, alright, I ain't looking over my back for the media, I'm looking <b>for</b> niggas! Shit, <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> ain't never took shit from me. Niggas have. So, you think I've got three guns in my house 'cause the media outside?" ...|$|R
