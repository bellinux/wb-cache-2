40|$|Abstract. The {{extraction}} of natural dye from semen litchi was studied, and {{the stability and}} dyeing ability of the <b>dyestuff</b> <b>for</b> the silk fabrics were also investigated. The {{results showed that the}} extraction efficiency using ethanol and sodium hydroxide was better than other solvents. The results indicated that the stability of the semen litchi stuff was good. The optimum direct dyeing process is at 90 o C for 45 min with pH 4. Meanwhile, the color yield and color fastness of dyed fabrics can be improved by mordant dyeing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to define the {{suitable}} thermoplastic matrix <b>for</b> <b>fibre</b> metal laminate <b>for</b> automotive front hood utilisation. To achieve the accurate and reliable results, the decision making process involved subjective and objective weighting where the combination of Fuzzy VIKOR and entropy method have been applied. Fuzzy VIKOR is used for ranking purpose and entropy method is used to determine the objective weighting. The result shows that polypropylene is the best thermoplastic matrix <b>for</b> <b>fibre</b> metal laminate by satisfying two compromise solutions with validation using least VIKOR index value scored 0. 00, compared to low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene and polystyrene. Through a combination of Fuzzy VIKOR and entropy, it is proved that this method gives a higher degree of confidence to the decision maker especially <b>for</b> <b>fibre</b> metal laminate thermoplastic matrix selection due to its systematic and scientific selection method involving MCDM. ...|$|R
