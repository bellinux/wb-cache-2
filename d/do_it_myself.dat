2500|$|In an October 2006 interview, Michael Palin said, [...] "We’re all hugely {{delighted that}} Spamalot {{is doing so}} well. Because we’re all beneficiaries! It's a great show. It's not ‘Python’ as we would have written it. But then, {{none of us would}} get {{together}} and write a ‘Python’ stage show. Eric eventually ran out of patience and said, ‘Well, I’ll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> then.’ He sent us bits and songs and all that and we said, ‘Yeah, that's all right, have a go.’ But its success is so enormous that it took us all by surprise, including Eric, and now we’re just proud to be associated with it, rather pathetically." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{met with}} more {{success in the}} medium of still photography. Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone {{had asked me to}} take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> It was an adventure for me." [...] Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed me a couple of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E

For a few minutes, he looked at him tenderly and admiringly, then he said in his simple way, [...] "God bless you! God bless you! I couldn't have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> my boy. I couldn't have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> Harry." ...|$|R
5000|$|Intensive (emphatic) pronouns, which re-emphasize a noun or pronoun {{that has}} already been mentioned. English uses the same forms as the {{reflexive}} pronouns; for example: I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> (contrast reflexive use, I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> to <b>myself).</b>|$|R

But I suppose you think I ought to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> as the Altrurian ladies do! I {{can tell you that}} in America it would be {{impossible}} for a lady to do her own work, and there are no intelligence-offices where you can find girls that want to work for love.

60|$|No, <b>it</b> ain't. I've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>It's</b> {{like a high}} dive. When {{you look}} down at the water it fairly takes your breath away, but after you've done it--it's not so bad as you think. You're going to be married, my boy.|$|R
