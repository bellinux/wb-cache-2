5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Ha≈£eg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the <b>jabiru)</b> are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{developed}} into the <b>Jabiru</b> J170, {{by adding the}} wing from the <b>Jabiru</b> J430, for the light-sport aircraft category.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Jabiru</b> J160 is an Australian {{ultralight}} trainer, {{designed and}} produced by <b>Jabiru</b> Aircraft of Bundaberg, Queensland. Certified in the Australian primary aircraft category, the aircraft is supplied complete and ready-to-fly.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Jabiru</b> J230 is an Australian light-sport aircraft, {{designed}} and produced by <b>Jabiru</b> Aircraft. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or {{as a complete}} ready-to-fly aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Many {{parts are}} {{interchangeable}} {{with the original}} components from <b>Jabiru</b> 3300 engine. However, in terms of component design, lubrication, valve train operation and metallurgy, the CAE engine is a completely different motor to the <b>Jabiru</b> design.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{accessories}} {{are being sold}} to complement both CAE and <b>Jabiru</b> engines.|$|E
25|$|The maximum rpm of a {{propeller}} (at about 2800 {{depending on}} its diameter) {{is about half}} that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a drive reduction unit. Such units absorb about 20% of the engine power and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the <b>Jabiru</b> 5100. Recent developments of the <b>Jabiru</b> engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the nose cowling of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be {{in keeping with the}} original sleek design of the Spitfire. First flights of a Mk26 with the redeveloped water-cooled <b>Jabiru</b> 5100 are expected in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of the Spitfire Mk 26 used an eight-cylinder 180 hp <b>Jabiru</b> 5100 horizontally opposed aero engine, but early installations suffered from inadequate cooling. The company now offers a converted General Motors Isuzu V6 engine. The normally aspirated version of this engine produces 226hp (168kW) with a supercharged version producing up to 310hp (231kW).|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{features}} {{several species}} of parrots, owls, and raptors, {{as well as a}} wetland aviary. Birds at the zoo include scarlet macaw, <b>jabiru,</b> great egret, wood stork, brown pelican, ornate hawk-eagle, harpy eagle, common black hawk, king vulture, spectacled owl, barn owl, mottled owl, yellow-headed amazon, white-fronted amazon, collared aracari, and great curassow.|$|E
25|$|The maguari stork (Ciconia maguari) {{is a large}} {{species of}} stork that inhabits {{seasonal}} wetlands over much of South America, and is very similar in appearance to the white stork; albeit slightly larger. It is the only species of its genus {{to occur in the}} New World {{and is one of the}} only three New World stork species, together with the wood stork and the <b>jabiru.</b>|$|E
25|$|The black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) {{is a tall}} long-necked {{wading bird}} in the stork family. It is a {{resident}} species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages {{for a wide range}} of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and glossy blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris. In Australia, it is sometimes called a <b>jabiru</b> although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding.|$|E
25|$|This stork has a {{markedly}} broad {{diet and}} {{is considered to be}} a generalist compared to the sympatric wood stork and <b>jabiru.</b> It feeds on fish, frogs, eels, earthworms, invertebrates, insect larvae, snakes, freshwater crabs, small mammals such as rats, and bird eggs. More rarely, it may take smaller birds; as one case has shown where a large, intact rail was discovered in the gullet of an individual from Patagonia. Despite the maguari stork's apparently generalist diet, one study from Brazil has suggested that this stork may actively target worm lizards Amphisbaenae as prey items. This may be because of the elongated body shape of such taxa that occupies a relatively small volume in the bird's stomach and hence can more compactly fit inside the stomach to optimise the bird's energy intake.|$|E
25|$|Homebuilt {{aircraft}} are generally small, one to four-seat sportsplanes which employ simple methods of construction. Fabric-covered wood or metal frames and plywood {{are common in}} the aircraft structure, but increasingly, fiberglass and other composites as well as full aluminum construction techniques are being used, techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers {{as far back as}} the late World War I era. Engines are most often the same as, or similar to, the engines used in certified aircraft (such as Lycoming, Continental, Rotax, and <b>Jabiru).</b> A minority of homebuilts use converted automobile engines, with Volkswagen air-cooled flat-4s, Subaru-based liquid-cooled engines, Mazda Wankel and Chevrolet Corvair six-cylinder engines being most common. The use of automotive engines helps to reduce costs, but many builders prefer dedicated aircraft engines, which are perceived to have better performance and reliability. Other engines that have been used include chainsaw and motorcycle engines.|$|E
25|$|Although the maguari stork largely {{depends on}} shallow freshwaters {{as a source}} of prey, it has also been {{observed}} to forage solitarily on dry plains outside the breeding season where mice and toads (candidate prey) sometimes occur in large numbers. It also forages on dry, cultivated fields where invertebrates have probably been disturbed. During the evenings in the dry season from December until April, individuals form large assemblages around low-lying water features where prey density is high but prey abundance is not. Notably numerous assemblages of foraging maguari storks have been sighted in the Brazilian municipality Quissama during the dry season in October, where they congregate around shallow pools in search of food. The maguari stork's tendency to forage in both wetlands and dry lands reflects its generalist nature, whereas specialists such as the <b>jabiru</b> depend more on wetlands {{as a source of}} food and are sighted more frequently near to wetlands than the maguari stork.|$|E
25|$|In the Venezuelan llanos, the maguari stork is {{also found}} to nest in low, thick-trunked trees {{including}} Ficus pertusa and Randia venezuelansis. These nests comprise sticks that are usually less than a metre long and less than 2cm in diameter, and often from the palm species Copernicia tectorum. Nevertheless, the species {{does not seem to}} naturally perch in trees because unlike its sympatric heterospecifics such as the <b>jabiru,</b> it cannot stand on its hallux. Therefore, it probably only nests opportunistically above the ground. The same nest may be used by a pair in successive years, sometimes for as long as seven years. However, ground nests composed of herbaceous plants usually disintegrate after a year, whereupon the same breeding pair returns to the nest site to rebuild the nest. Both partners participate in building and lining the nest, which continues throughout incubation and brooding. Nest lining usually begins when the base is about a metre wide, and lining material largely consists of wet grass that dries and hardens in the intense sun.|$|E
25|$|Breeding {{is highly}} {{synchronised}} {{with the onset}} of rain during the wet season, which usually lasts from May to November in the llanos of Venezuela. However, most breeding of the maguari stork happens from July to mid-September, which is earlier than breeding in both the sympatric wood stork and the <b>jabiru.</b> Individuals begin migration to the breeding grounds as the rains begin, although some individuals may migrate and arrive early just before the rains. Despite the lengthy wet season in the llanos, the nesting period in one year never lasts for over four months. Elsewhere in the stork's global range, the timing of the breeding season is slightly different and somewhat shorter. In north east Argentina for example, the breeding season extends from June to August; and in east central Argentina extends from July to October, with eggs probably being laid in late June and early July. On Isla Mexiana in eastern Brazil, the breeding season lasts only from August to September. The timing of onset of the seasonal rain is extremely variable across the maguari stork's global range, with rainfall beginning in some years as early as late March and others as late as June. The start of breeding is therefore correspondingly variable; and in Argentina, nesting may commence as late as August with late rains. In the llanos, breeders may lay eggs as early as late May following unusually early and heavy rainfall; whereas young breeders may lay eggs as late as October with late-arriving rain.|$|E
500|$|Wind gusts up to [...] felled {{power lines}} in Maningrida; 12 homes {{sustained}} damage from fallen trees in Jabiru; and extensive damage {{was reported in}} Oenpelli. Roughly 1,000 people also lost phone service in the region. Several highways were blocked by fallen trees throughout the area. A resort in <b>Jabiru</b> sustained significant damage and was closed for two weeks following the storm. Insured damages to the national parks amounted to A$1.6 million (US$766,000). According to the Northern Territory Insurance Office, structural damage from Cyclone Monica amounted to A$5million (US$4.4million).|$|E
500|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is a huge}} bird, {{standing tall}} at [...] The average length is [...] and average wingspan is [...] While no weights have been published for wild birds, the greater adjutant is among the largest of living storks, with published measurements overlapping {{with those of the}} <b>jabiru</b> (<b>Jabiru</b> mycteria), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) and marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus). Juvenile greater adjutant storks in captivity weighed from [...] For comparison, the heaviest known wild stork was a marabou stork scaling [...] The huge bill, which averages [...] long, is wedge-like and is pale grey with a darker base. The wing chord averages , the tail [...] and the tarsus [...] in length. With the exception of the tarsus length, the standard measurements of the greater adjutant are on average greater than that of other stork species. A white collar ruff at the base of its bare yellow to red-skinned neck gives it a vulture-like appearance. In the breeding season, the pouch and neck become bright orange and the upper thighs of the grey legs turn reddish. Adults have a dark wing that contrasts with light grey secondary coverts. The underside of the body is whitish and the sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Juveniles are a duller version of the adult. The pendant inflatable pouch connects to the air passages and is not connected to the digestive tract. The exact function is unknown, but it is not involved in food storage as was sometimes believed. This was established in 1825 by Dr John Adam, a student of Professor Robert Jameson, who dissected a specimen and found the two layered pouch filled mainly with air. The only possible confusable species in the region is the smaller lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), which lacks a pouch, prefers wetland habitats, has a lighter grey skull cap, a straighter edge to the upper mandible and lacks the contrast between the grey secondary coverts and the dark wings.|$|E
500|$|Arthur was {{discharged}} from the RAAF on 14February 1946, and took up residence in Darwin, Northern Territory. Initially working for the Repatriation Department, in 1950 he joined the Australian School of Pacific Administration, and later travelled to Vietnam to establish a dairy farm at B·∫øn C√°t under the Colombo Plan. He was captured by the Viet Cong in 1961 and was not released until a ransom was paid‚Äîreportedly an Olivetti typewriter. He continued to work in Vietnam after this incident, and by 1966 was running a business supplying duck feathers to the American military for use in life jackets. Returning to Australia, he was administration manager for Geopeko, the exploration unit responsible for discovering the Ranger uranium deposit at <b>Jabiru.</b> Wilf Arthur died on 23December 2000, {{at the age of}} 81. The Kittyhawk [...] "Polly" [...] that he flew in his DSO-winning action of 14April 1943 was purchased by the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, in 1992 and put on display in its Aircraft Hall.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April, the mid-level ridge {{south of}} Monica weakened, causing the storm to turn towards the south-west. Following this, the storm made {{landfall}} in the Northern Territory, roughly [...] west of Maningrida, as a Category5 cyclone with winds of 250km/h (155mph 10-minute sustained). Not long after making landfall, the storm weakened extremely quickly. Most convective activity {{associated with the}} storm dissipated within nine hours of moving onshore. This resulted in the storm's maximum winds decreasing by 155km/h (100mph) in a 12-hour span. After this rapid weakening, the storm turned sharply west moving over the town of <b>Jabiru</b> as a Category2 cyclone. Within six hours of passing this town, the Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Monica to a tropical low, no longer producing gale-force winds. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm at 1800UTC that day. The remnants of Monica persisted for several more days, tracking near Darwin on 25 April before turning south-east and accelerating over the Northern Territory. The remnants eventually dissipated on 28 April over central Australia.|$|E
