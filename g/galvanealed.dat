40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of weld bead shape on the fatigue {{strength}} of lap fillet joints using the {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) process was investigated. The base material used in the experiment was 590 MPa grade <b>galvanealed</b> steel sheet with 2. 3 mm and 2. 6 mm thickness. In order to make the four types of weld beads with different shapes by factors such as length, angle, and area, the welding process, wire feeding speed, and joint shape were changed. The stress-number of cycles to failure (Sâ€“N) curve and fatigue strength were obtained from the fatigue test for four types of weld bead, and the cause of the fatigue strength difference was clarified through the analysis of the geometrical factors, such as length, angle, and area of the weld bead. In addition, the relationship between weld bead shape and fatigue strength was discussed...|$|E
