5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into the series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives {{as part of his}} pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E

In ten rounds he failed to qualify once, at Hockenheim, but when he <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> onto the grid he never reached higher than 21st. His first season was also marred by two {{accidents}} at Barcelona and Enna, although he became more reliable {{towards the end of}} the year, climaxing in an eighth-place finish at Magny-Cours.|$|E

This {{generation}} of Bluebird {{became one of the}} first Japanese cars to be sold in significant numbers in Europe, after Finland fully opened its doors to automobile imports in mid-1962. 700 were brought in, and by the time the 410-series had arrived, Datsun had passed SAAB and Triumph in registrations. Although not very fast, the sturdy Datsun was well-suited to the rugged Finnish roads of the time.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 engines were updated again, the 1.8 L {{carburetor}} {{version was}} replaced with fuel injected 1.8 i.e. and new bigger diesel engine {{was added to the}} range. In the end of 1989 the 1.6 L carburetor version was updated to have fuel injection and 1990 the 1.8 L turbo and 3.0i V6 got some more power and updated suspension. The 3.0 V6 was now equipped with a Motronic system instead of an L-Jetronic. The 1.8L turbo was now also available in 'America'-spec, but strangely enough not available for the USA market. The 3.0 V6 <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the United States, and was sold as Milano Verde.|$|E

On July 24, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. Although some of the ships <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to Jamestown, the leaders, and most of the supplies had been aboard Sea Venture, which fought the storm for three days before Admiral of the Company, Sir George Somers, deliberately drove her onto the reefs of Bermuda to prevent her foundering. This allowed all aboard to be landed safely.|$|E
25|$|On August 15, Golden Boy matchmaker Robert Diaz {{revealed}} that Álvarez would indeed attend the IBF mandatory second day weigh in and fully intended {{to fight for}} the IBF title along with the WBA title. He <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> clear that whilst Golovkin would still defend the WBC and IBO title, Álvarez would not pay their sanctioning fees. On August 22, IBF president Daryl Peoples announced that they would be dropping the mandatory second day weigh in for unification fights, meaning neither fighters are required to participate, however they would still encourage them to do so. It was reported that Álvarez would earn a base minimum $5 million and Golovkin would earn $3 million, before any shares of the revenue are added to their purses.|$|E

25|$|The same {{argument}} for unification {{could be made}} for Latin and Cyrillic -- the American English encoding system known as ASCII never encoded the Cyrillic А (U+0410) differently from the Latin A (U+0041) -- {{but we know that}} ASCII was never intended to display both Latin and Cyrillic in the same document. Similarly, Korean encoding standards never had the aim of displaying Korean and Japanese and Chinese and Cyrillic and Ethiopian all within a single document. Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique codepoints owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently. While most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with codepoints in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into Unicode as unique codepoints.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Martin Lee got {{together}} with songwriters Paul Curtis and David Kane to compose a musical based on The Butterfly Children books by Angela and Pat Mills. The musical had its world premiere at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow, to open the 1990 Glasgow City of Culture and ran {{for a month and}} was performed by the Mitchell Theatre for Youth. Just three months later, the show transferred to the larger Kings Theatre in Glasgow and ran for two weeks. The show transferred in late 1992 to London's West End. Brotherhood of Man recorded the songs themselves and the nineteen track collection, available on cassette only, was available to buy at the theatre. The album was never commercially released, although some tracks <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> onto tie-in cassettes to go with the books a few years later. The Butterfly Children, essentially a children's show, featured many differing styles of music from rap to rock and country and western to the more familiar pop the group were known for. The show's run ended after a short season, and has not been performed since.|$|E

500|$|One {{important}} change that <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{into the final}} version included the agreement between northern and southern delegates to empower Congress to end the slave trade starting in 1808. Southern and northern delegates also agreed to strengthen the Fugitive Slave Clause in exchange for removing a requirement that two-thirds of Congress agree on [...] "navigation acts" [...] (regulations of commerce between states and foreign governments). The two-thirds requirement was favored by southern delegates, who thought Congress might pass navigation acts that would be economically harmful to slaveholders.|$|E

500|$|Drexler {{also wanted}} the bussard {{collectors}} {{at the front}} of the warp nacelles to be orange like The Original Series, but this was overruled by producers once more, who wanted them red also like the later series. Drexler thought that this was because Rick Berman wasn't fond of bright colors, and so Star Trek: Enterprise was filmed in greys and dark blues. The rear ends of the nacelles were influenced by Enterprise from The Original Series, with the spheres that appeared on the 1960s version split in two for the NX-01. Direct elements from The Original Series that <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> on to the NX-01 were the impulse engine cones and the lower sensor dome. The most prominent element from the first television Enterprise was the deflector dish. For the NX-01, it was compressed on the vertical axis and placed {{at the front of}} the saucer. The process of Drexler getting his designs approved by the producers was later described as [...] "a long hard battle" [...] by production illustrator and creator of Enterprise-E, John Eaves.|$|E

500|$|The {{premiere of}} the {{completed}} Kinetoscope was held not at the Chicago World's Fair, as originally scheduled, but at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The first film publicly shown on the system was Blacksmith Scene (aka Blacksmiths); directed by Dickson and shot by Heise, it was produced at the new Edison moviemaking studio, known as the Black Maria. Despite extensive promotion, a major display of the Kinetoscope, involving as many as twenty-five machines, never {{took place at the}} Chicago exposition. Kinetoscope production had been delayed in part because of Dickson's absence of more than eleven weeks early in the year with a nervous breakdown. Robinson argues that [...] "peculation that a single Kinetoscope reached the Fair seems to be conclusively dismissed by an 1894 leaflet issued for the launching of the invention in London," [...] which states, [...] "the Kinetoscope was not perfected in time for the great Fair." [...] Hendricks, in contrast, refers to accounts in the Scientific American of July 21 and October 21, 1893, that constitute evidence no less [...] "conclusive" [...] that one Kinetoscope <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the fair. The weight of evidence supports Hendricks; as fair historian Stanley Appelbaum states, [...] "Doubt has been cast on the reports of [...] actual presence at the fair, but these reports are numerous and circumstantial" [...] (Appelbaum does err in claiming that the device was [...] "first shown at the Exposition").|$|E
