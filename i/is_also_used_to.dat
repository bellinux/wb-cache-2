5|$|Promethium <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{measure the}} {{thickness}} of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample. It has possible future uses in portable X-ray sources, and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites (although the alpha emitter plutonium-238 has become standard for most space-exploration-related uses).|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{catalysts}} {{are used}} {{in a number of}} industrial processes, notably in catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by the Monsanto process. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds, a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers. Rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane.|$|E

5|$|Sabermetrics {{refers to}} the field of {{baseball}} statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).|$|E
5|$|Since {{the model}} assumes {{homogeneous}} mixture, {{the theory is}} well applicable to study the explosive behavior of solid fuels (spontaneous ignition of bio fuels, organic materials, garbage, etc.,). This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> design explosives and fire crackers. The theory predicted critical values accurately for low conductivity fluids/solids with high conductivity thin walled containers.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E

5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
5|$|Design and {{operation}} of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well. Modeling <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E

In spring, the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer. The scheme <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> encourage water birds.|$|E
