5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>school,</b> with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} students’ {{perceptions}} of mathematics, and an examination of factors which may influence these perceptions. [...] Three high schools participated in the study: 1) an all-girls’ school; 2) and all-boys’ school; and 3) <b>a</b> co-educational <b>school.</b> The subjects comprised the following four groups: [...] Group 1 : males <b>in</b> <b>a</b> male <b>school</b> [...] Group 2 : females <b>in</b> <b>a</b> female <b>school</b> [...] Group 3 : males <b>in</b> <b>a</b> co-educational <b>school</b> [...] Group 4 : females <b>in</b> <b>a</b> co-educational <b>school.</b> [...] Students were required to answer a three-part questionnaire which provided both quantitative and qualitative data. The questions {{in the first and}} third parts of the questionnaire were designed by the author. The questions {{in the second part of}} the questionnaire were taken from the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales. [...] The author found no significant differences among the four groups in: 1) attitudes toward success in mathematics; 2) mathematics anxiety; 3) student’s perceptions of mathematics as a male domain; 4) students’ perceptions of the usefulness of mathematics; 5) encouragement given by the mother to the student in his or her study of mathematics; and 6) encouragement given by the teacher to the student in his or her study of mathematics. [...] It was found that males are significantly more confident than females in the learning of mathematics. More males than females stated they would select a career involving mathematics. Males <b>in</b> <b>a</b> male <b>school</b> received significantly more encouragement from their fathers in their study of mathematics than did males <b>in</b> <b>a</b> co-educational <b>school.</b> [...] <b>A</b> much higher percentage of females <b>in</b> <b>a</b> female <b>school</b> than females <b>in</b> <b>a</b> co-educational <b>school</b> stated they would select a career involving mathematics. Females <b>in</b> <b>a</b> co-educational <b>school</b> received significantly more encouragement from their fathers in their study of mathematics than did females <b>in</b> <b>a</b> female <b>school.</b> ...|$|R
