40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} evaluate {{the potential of the}} spark plasma sintering process in producing dense nanostructured materials. Microstructured and nanostructured nickel was sintered by SPS starting from nickel powder (APS 3 – 7 [*]m) in the as-received state and after a mechanical activation using a high-energy ball mill. First, a sintering study to determine SPS processing conditions to reach full densification was carried out with specimens 50 [*]mm in diameter and 10 [*]mm in height. In a second step, an experimental {{investigation was}} undertaken with dense nickel disks to generate tensile properties. The tensile tests were performed at a strain rate of 10 − 3 [*]s− 1 with specimens 16 [*]mm in gage length and 4 [*]mm in <b>gage</b> <b>diameter.</b> Tensile ductility in excess of 40 % was reached with the microstructured nickel. For the nanostructured nickel, high yield stresses in excess of 600 MPa were measured with a tensile ductility of 30 %. These results were analyzed through densification and microstructure measurements...|$|E
40|$|Four {{wrought alloys}} (A- 286, IN 800 H, N- 155, and 19 - 9 DL) and two cast alloys (CRM- 6 D and XF- 818) were tested to {{determine}} their creep-rupture behavior. The wrought alloys {{were used in the}} form of sheets of 0. 89 mm (0. 035 in.) average thickness. The cast alloy specimens were investment cast and machined to 6. 35 mm (0. 250 in.) <b>gage</b> <b>diameter.</b> All specimens were tested to rupture in air at different times up to 3000 h over the temperature range of 650 C to 925 C (1200 F to 1700 F). Rupture life, minimum creep rate, and time to 1 % creep strain were statistically analyzed as a function of stress at different temperatures. Temperature-compensated analysis was also performed to obtain the activation energies for rupture life, time to 1 % creep strain, and the minimum creep rate. Microstructural and fracture analyses were also performed. Based on statistical analyses, estimates were made for stress levels at different temperatures to obtain 3500 h rupture life and time to 1 % creep strain. Test results are to be compared with similar data being obtained for these alloys under 15 MPa (2175 psi) hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of grain orientation on the high cycle fatigue properties of 7050 -T 7452 aerospace grade aluminum, rotating-bending fatigue tests were performed on longitudinal (LG) and short transverse (ST) specimens taken from two sample sets (Method A and Method B) of open die forged 7050 aluminum. The fatigue specimens were machined to a 0. 22 ̆ 2 <b>gage</b> <b>diameter</b> and 42 ̆ 2 length and subsequently hand polished to a mirror finish to minimize potential crack initiation sites. The tests were conducted on a Fatigue Dynamics RBF- 300 HT tester in the fully reversed loading condition, with stress levels varying from 20 ksi - 45 ksi in 5 ksi increments, except the 25 ksi stress level. The applied stress amplitude and number of cycles to failure for each specimen were plotted to generate S-N curves comparing both Method A and B. The fatigue life was comparable between Method A and Method B sample sets and the fatigue life of longitudinal samples was greater than the fatigue life of short transverse samples. Runout tests were stopped at 107 cycles and set as 20 ksi for both orientations. There was no significant statistical difference between Method A and Method B on fatigue life of 7050 -T 7452 aluminum. There was a significant statistical difference between LG and ST specimen orientations on fatigue life due to the precipitate alignment and grain flow from forging...|$|E
50|$|After the war, Vossberg set out {{to apply}} {{electronics}} technology to industrial applications. Electron-Machine Corporation was formed in 1946 {{for the purpose of}} designing automatic electronic gaging and indicating equipment. The company was established {{in the back of a}} radiator repair shop in Lynbrook, New York. Instruments for diameter and thickness measurements for steel and cable products were conceived, developed, and licensed to other manufacturers. These instruments included the first commercial x-ray thickness <b>gage,</b> optical cable <b>diameter</b> <b>gages,</b> and an industrial process control computer. In 1950 he, in partnership, formed the Industrial Gauges Corporation and later established Research Developments, Inc., as a subsidiary. This expansion provided the manufacturing facilities for the products developed by the Electron-Machine Company.|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{pressure}} loads {{were measured}} {{along the top}} interior wall of a generic high-speed engine (GHSE) model undergoing performance tests in the combustion-Heated Scramjet Test Facility at the Langley Research Center. Flow to the model inlet was simulated at 72000 ft and a flight Mach number of 4. The inlet Mach number was 3. 5 with a total temperature and pressure of 1640 R and 92 psia. The unsteady pressure loads were measured with 5 piezoresistive gages, recessed into the wall 4 to 12 <b>gage</b> <b>diameters</b> to reduce incident heat flux to the diaphragms, and distributed from the inlet to the combustor. Contributors to the unsteady pressure loads included boundary layer turbulence, combustion noise, and transients generated by unstart loads. Typical turbulent boundary layer rms pressures in the inlet ranged from 133 dB in the inlet to 181 dB in the combustor over the frequency range from 0 to 5 kHz. Downstream of the inlet exist, combustion noise was shown to dominate boundary layer turbulence noise at increased heat release rates. Noise levels in the isolator section increased by 15 dB when the fuel-air ratio was increased from 0. 37 to 0. 57 of the stoichiometric ratio. Transient pressure disturbances associated with engine unstarts were measured in the inlet and have an upstream propagation speed of about 7 ft/sec and pressure jumps of at least 3 psia...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{specimen}} size on the measured tensile creep {{behavior of a}} commercially available gas pressure sintered Si 3 N 4 was examined. Button-head tensile test specimens {{were used for the}} testing, and were machined to a variety of different <b>gage</b> section <b>diameters</b> (ranging from 2. 5 to 6. 35 mm) or different surface-area-to-volume ratios. The specimens were then creep tested at 1350 Degrees C and 200 MPa with tensile creep strain continuously measured as a function of time. The steady-state creep rate increased and the lifetime decreased with an increase in diameter (or decrease in the ratio of gage section surface area to volume). The time and specimen size dependence of transformation of a secondary phase correlated with the observed creep rate and lifetime dependence...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} tensile testing of {{materials}} in dynamic conditions based on a slightly modified compressive split Hopkinson bar system using a shoulder is described in this paper. The main goal was to solve, {{with the use of}} numerical modelling, the problem of wave disturbance resulting from application of a shoulder, as well as the problem of selecting a specimen geometry that enables to study the phenomenon of high strain-rate failure in tension. It is shown that, in order to prevent any interference of disturbance with the required strain signals at a given recording moment, the positions of the strain gages on the bars have to be correctly chosen for a given experimental setup. Besides, it is demonstrated that - on the basis of simplified numerical analysis - an appropriate <b>gage</b> length and <b>diameter</b> of a material specimen for failure testing in tension can be estimated...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear {{finite element}} (FE) {{analyses}} are performed {{to simulate the}} behavior of top- and seat-angle connections. Contact model with small sliding option is applied between contact pair surfaces of all connecting elements. Bolt pretension force is introduced in the initial steps of analysis. Numerical analysis results together with the prediction by Kishi-Chen power model are compared with experimental ones to examine the applicability of proposed analysis method and power model. The study is farther extended by analyzing the models varying connection parameters, material properties of connection assemblages, and magnitude of bolt pretension. The following results are obtained: 1) bolt sustains additional tensile force due to prying action; 2) prying force develops more quickly due to increment of bolt <b>diameter,</b> <b>gage</b> distance from angle heel to the centerline of bolt hole, and reduction of angle thickness; and 3) bolt pretension increases the initial connection stiffness...|$|R
