5|$|The team's founders enjoy playing {{co-operative}} multiplayer {{games and}} are passionate about them, as they allow players to play alongside each other instead of against each other. In addition, {{they found it}} more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> the typical competitive multiplayer experience. However, they thought {{that this type of}} game was not well-developed, and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone. As a result, the company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players, leading to the development of both Left 4 Dead and Evolve.|$|E
25|$|Martin Sieff, United Press International (December 25, 2001) — The great veteran actor Maury Chaykin {{was born}} to play Nero. And Timothy Hutton is equally perfect as his leg-man and always squabbling employee/amanuensis/Dr. Watson/Captain Hastings sidekick, Archie Goodwin. … Hutton, an Oscar winner, and Chaykin {{are at the heart}} of it all. They have done many prestigious things in their careers and no doubt will do many more. But it is clear they know they will never have more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> doing this.|$|E

[...] Leonard Probst of NBC said [...] "Hair is the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it's more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> any other this season". [...] John Wingate of WOR TV praised MacDermot's [...] "dynamic score" [...] that [...] "blasts and soars", and Len Harris of CBS said [...] "I've finally found the best musical of the Broadway season... it's that sloppy, vulgar, terrific tribal love rock musical Hair." ...|$|E
500|$|None of Ochs's songs became hits, {{although}} [...] "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends" [...] {{received a}} good deal of airplay. It reached #119 on Billboards national [...] "Hot Prospect" [...] listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics, which sarcastically suggested that [...] "smoking marijuana is more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> drinking beer". It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40. Joan Baez, however, did have a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in August 1965, reaching #8 with her cover of Ochs's song [...] "There but for Fortune", which was also nominated for a Grammy Award for [...] "Best Folk Recording". In the U.S. it peaked at #50 on the Billboard charts—a good showing, but not a hit.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman {{gave the}} film a C– rating, praising Petty's {{performance}} {{which he said}} was the only good part of an otherwise [...] "amateurish" [...] film. Jonathan Rosenbaum and Janet Maslin gave moderately positive reviews, with Rosenbaum concluding: [...] "unless you're a preteen boy who hates girls, it's funnier {{and a lot more}} <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> Batman Forever." [...] Maslin wrote: [...] "Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy." [...] Leonard Klady from Variety gave a mixed review, saying: [...] "What's missing from the mix is an engaging story to bind together its intriguing bits. And Lori Petty as 'Tank Girl'... has the spunk but, sadly, not the heart of the post-apocalyptic heroine." ...|$|E

500|$|Eurogamer Schilling {{called the}} self-referential {{nature of the}} release a [...] "very postmodern conceit", which he thought worked well despite the dual faux pas of parodying The Matrix and overtly [...] "satirizing game mechanics". He felt that the satire was not good, though the writing was [...] "genuinely funny", and that the {{repeated}} Dominatrix fight scenes should not have felt as low budget. He recommended the pack for those who love [...] "wry gags about creaky gaming tropes with the occasional belly laugh", {{and said he had}} a better time finding his own <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> playing through the missions. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that those who are looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E
500|$|The game's combat {{was praised}} by most critics. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Crispin Boyer {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a thrill ride. And not just 'cause Return of the King unleashes larger hordes of foes than last year's equally slick Two Towers prequel. Many of Return of the Kings levels actually force you to multitask while you hack and slash." [...] PC Gamer UKs Tony Ellis wrote [...] "combat in RotK is superbly satisfying. Your blows connect with a solid, visceral thud you can almost feel." [...] He also noted the variation between levels. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed praised the [...] "subtleties of the combat." [...] In contrast, Game Informers Matthew Kato found the gameplay to be [...] "repetitious", writing [...] "sometimes I got the feeling that I was working harder only to have less <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> in Two Towers." [...] The co-op mode was also praised.|$|E
500|$|... "No Hay Igual" [...] is a hip hop and reggaeton song, with {{a length}} of three minutes and thirty-five seconds. It is a Spanglish tongue twister over [...] "future-tropic" [...] beats. The song {{contains}} a [...] "sharp mix" [...] of percussion and [...] "empowered chanting". In [...] "No Hay Igual", Furtado sings in Spanish over a reggaeton rhythm. According to Sean Fennessey, the song is called reggaeton [...] "because it's sung in Spanish and isn't salsa, is an aerial assault". He wrote that the song [...] "never wears down the listener" [...] and [...] "uses a few vocal change-ups, unlike the much-maligned genre it's been compared to". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that in the song, Furtado [...] "plays the world traveler", where she deftly blends reggaeton and M.I.A.." [...] According to Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] is a [...] "reggaeton-style trifle" [...] that is [...] "more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> anything else" [...] on Loose.|$|E

500|$|Dee {{was more}} positive, writing that he [...] "enjoyed it very much" [...] and that [...] "there were some lovely gags." [...] He noted, however, {{that he felt}} it took {{slightly}} too much time {{to set up the}} episode, though after the wife swap, [...] "it marched along." [...] The Times critic Dominic Maxwell thought the [...] "languid timing that Gervais brings to Extras and The Office was wrong here. Simpsons cameos are normally lean, but Gervais's shtick ran rampant through the second half, turning the regulars into extras." [...] Maxwell did find the episode entertaining though, stating that [...] "it was a decent late-period Simpsons episode" [...] and that it featured [...] "some fine jokes." [...] He concluded that [...] "even a middling Simpsons episode is still bright and tight and brilliantly rendered. So even if this one didn’t really work, it was still a lot more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> a lot of [...] that do." ...|$|E
500|$|Ginia Bellafante, {{a critic}} for The New York Times, proclaimed the drama gave the {{audience}} [...] "innocent faces and heaving breasts, hyperbolizing the sex that always lurks {{beneath the surface}} of Austen's astringent presence." [...] She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand wrote [...] "Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful and attentive adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed [...] "Northanger Abbey was a perfectly acceptable costume drama – but not one that ever really caught fire." [...] Simon Hoggart, writing for The Spectator, commented that Davies's adaptation of Northanger Abbey [...] "was much bolder and more confident than Mansfield Park the week before." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Amy Ratcliffe rated [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] with a {{score of}} 7.5 out of 10, {{describing}} it as [...] "fun" [...] with [...] "not impressive but not horrible" [...] special effects and a story that was [...] "enjoyable and entertaining but not gripping." [...] Ratcliffe enjoyed the interactions between Emma and Regina, but commented that she [...] "could do with less of Regina's withering stares" [...] and [...] "precious apples." [...] She also found the change of music when switching to the fairy tale realm to be [...] "an unnecessary bat over the head." [...] Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A–. While she liked Bauer van Straten's performance, McLennan wished that her character had been [...] "fiercer" [...] in her first appearance. Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy thought it was more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> the pilot and praised Morrison's [...] "tough-as-nails-but-with-a-secret-heart-of-gold" [...] performance, {{as well as her}} character's feud with Regina.|$|E

According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, a staff writer for The New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E
500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more <b>fun</b> <b>than</b> sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has {{to be the most important}} thing that has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Fred Thomas of AllMusic complimented them for disposing of the introspective material which appeared on prior albums and choosing to [...] "accentuate all the throbbing rhythms, metallic guitars and bilious disgust that defined the band's best work." [...] He went on to suggest that Born Villain could pave the way for future releases. Reviewing for Classic Rock, Mick Farren – who was cynical of the hype the album was receiving – said [...] "to my delight as a closet fan, Born Villain turns out to be little short of excellent", praising its emphasis on [...] "bone-crunching rhythm". A review for Blabbermouth said that several tracks were likely to be considered classics among the band's discography. The Ottawa Sun complimented the album's lyrical themes, saying that it saw Manson [...] " [...] like the slasher-flick antihero he deserves to be."
