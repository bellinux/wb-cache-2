5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no <b>insurance</b> <b>claim</b> can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.|$|E

5|$|Juan caused {{widespread}} {{structural and}} vegetation damage across the region, particularly {{in and around}} the Halifax Regional Municipality. Extensive damage to trees was reported, which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines. Many homes and businesses suffered property damage, particularly roof damage on structures, and some weaker structures were destroyed. HRM estimated that 31% of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27% of homes had enough damage to warrant an <b>insurance</b> <b>claim.</b> In Downtown Halifax, erosion-control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from Halifax Harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers. The Victoria General Hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm, as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences. Billboards and signs were also destroyed, and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris. The city's cherished Point Pleasant Park and Public Gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months.|$|E

40|$|Dr. Tango {{proposed}} {{two methods}} to estimate unobservable random variables, Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and Proportional Allotment Estimator (PAE) {{and claimed that}} the results of both methods demonstrated good agreement in what he described as “health insurance claims”. We dispute these claims. After Tango published his methods first in Japan [1], we applied his two methods as well as our Proportional Disease Magnitude (PDM) method to two different datasets: computer-generated simulation data and actual outpatient health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> of Natori city in Japan [2]. We generated the simulation data with known disease-specific costs resembling Japan’s outpatient health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> [3]. For the actual health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims,</b> disease-specific costs are not known. The results of three methods (MLE, PAE and PDM) were verified against known disease-specific costs for the simulation data and against each other for the actual health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> (concurrent validity). All three methods showed good agreement with known disease-specific costs in the simulation data, but showed disagreement with each other in the actual health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims.</b> MLE showed negative disease-specific costs in 18 out of 154 diagnostic categories and the aggregate total of disease-specific costs exceeded the actual total by 21. 3 % in the actual health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> data leading us to conclude that MLE is not suitable for health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims.</b> Speculating that Tango falsified the results of the simulation data as that of the actual health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims,</b> we matched the 15 “health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> ” presented in [Table 1] with the simulation data we provided to Tango and identified that all 15 “health <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> ” perfectly match with the simulation data. The hand-written numbers in [Table 1] signifiy the corresponding serial number in the simulation data shown in [Figure 1]. Apparently, four cases, 579 - 582 th, in the simulation data appear in [Table 1] as 5, 7, 8 and 13 th cases, respectively, (We have posted the entire simulation data on the web for reference...|$|R

The agency also launched an annual publication titled World Investment and Political Risk which reports on trends in worldwide investment and corporate perceptions of prospects and risk, as well as shifts in the political risk insurance industry.|$|E

25|$|Near the {{completion}} of the £5 million conversion, the vessel caught fire on 9 January 1972. There is some suspicion that the fires were set deliberately, as several blazes broke out simultaneously throughout the ship. The fact that C.Y. Tung had acquired the vessel for $3.5 million, and had insured it for $8 million, led some to speculate that the inferno was part of a fraud to collect on the <b>insurance</b> <b>claim.</b> Others speculated that the fires were the result of a conflict between Tung, a Chinese Nationalist, and Communist-dominated ship construction unions.|$|E

In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry catches Mundungus outside the Three Broomsticks trying to sell what had been Sirius's property (which now belongs to Harry after Sirius's death) to Aberforth, and the boy confronts him.
