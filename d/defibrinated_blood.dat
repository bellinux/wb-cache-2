40|$|Heparin is not {{suitable}} as an anticoagulant in the leucocyte migration test used to demonostrate {{the presence of}} migration inhibition factor (MIF) due to a rapid disappearance of the response after even a short storage of the blood. The use of <b>defibrinated</b> <b>blood</b> is highly recommended and <b>defibrinated</b> <b>blood</b> can be stored for at least 90 min without any diminution of the response. The change in response when using heparinized blood is not due to any direct effect of heparin, because heparin has no effect when added to <b>defibrinated</b> <b>blood.</b> However, heparin, added together with thrombin, is capable of abolishing the MIF effect completely. The basis for this phenomenon is most probably the binding of the heparin-antithrombin cofactor (AT III) to a complex with heparin and thrombin. The activity of MIF requires the presence of AT III, its esterase-inhibiting activity probably being crucial, in order to express MIF activity on macrophages. This mechanism forms a link between certain cellular immune reactions and the blood-clotting system...|$|E

40|$|Hitherto, in {{investigations}} of the stability and distribution of ascorbic acid in blood (1, 2), no attempt {{has been made to}} distinguish the relative activities of erythrocytes and leukocytes. These two groups of cells, however, differ with respect to development, structure, function and fate. It therefore seemed desirable to study the influence on and the reaction to the serum ascorbic acid of each type of cells separately. The results of such an investigation are here reported. Some obser-vations on the influence of composition and con-centration of serum protein on distribution and stability of serum ascorbic acid are added. METHODS Blood from healthy human subjects only was used. For reasons set forth previously (1), no anticoagulant was added, but freshly drawn blood was defibrinated by stirring with a glass rod. In <b>defibrinated</b> <b>blood,</b> leuko-cytes cannot be separated from erythrocytes as distinctly as in oxalated blood. Therefore, a compromise was worked out on the following basis: Instead of studying red blood corpuscles and leukocytes separately, i. e., each without the presence of the other, erythrocytes with and without leukocytes were observed. Once the effect of the presence of erythrocytes became known, differences in reactions noted with erythrocytes plus leukocytes were ascribed to the presence of the latter. <b>Defibrinated</b> <b>blood</b> was transferred to ordinary conical 15 cc. centrifuge tubes (Pyrex glass) which were stop-pered and kept for 1 / hours at about 25 ° C.

40|$|When {{a segment}} of artery, killed by heat, {{formalin}} or glycerin is transplanted, it undergoes a rapid degeneration.

The muscle fibers can keep their normal appearance, even {{for a long time}} after the operation. It is, therefore, demonstrated that arteries can be preserved outside of the body in a condition of unmanifested actual life.

Reference and clinical strains of all organisms were diluted in brain heart infusion and a clinical specimen of cerebrospinal fluid and cultured on all agars.

Susceptibility testing for S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes was performed on <b>defibrinated</b> sheep <b>blood</b> Mueller-Hinton agar, citrated sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar (CSB MHA), and human blood Mueller-Hinton agar plates. For all organisms, the colony numbers were similar on all agars. Substantially smaller colony sizes and absent or minimal hemolysis were noted on HuBA for all organisms. Antibiotic susceptibility results for S. pneumoniae were similar for the two sheep blood agars; however, larger zone sizes were displayed on HuBA, and quality control for the reference strain failed on HuBA. For S. pyogenes, larger zone sizes were demonstrated on HuBA and CSBA than on DSBA. Poor hemolysis made interpretation of the zone sizes difficult on HuBA.
