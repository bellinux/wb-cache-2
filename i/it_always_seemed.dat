It really does feel like an extension of that... It was a chance {{to go back to that}} world and explore it deeper. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> incomplete because I conceived it like a film, and what would you do without Die Hard 2?" [...] Meat Loaf himself was more succinct. He told an interview at the time, [...] "We called it Bat Out of Hell II 'cos that would help it sell shitloads." ...|$|E
500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{failure of}} the plan was {{explained}} in Der Weltkrieg by showing that command in the German armies was often conducted with vague knowledge of {{the circumstances of the}} French, the intentions of other commanders and the locations of other German units. Communication was botched from the start and orders could take hours or days to reach units or never arrive. Auftragstaktik, the decentralised system of command that allowed local commanders discretion within the commander's intent, operated at the expense of co-ordination. Aerial reconnaissance had more influence on decisions than was sometimes apparent in writing on the war but it was a new technology, the results of which could contradict reports from ground reconnaissance and be difficult for commanders to resolve. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> that the German armies were on the brink of victory, yet the French kept retreating too fast for the German advance to surround them or cut their lines of communication. Decisions to change direction or to try to change a local success into a strategic victory, were taken by army commanders ignorant of their part in the OHL plan, which frequently changed. Der Weltkrieg portrays Moltke (the Younger) in command of a war machine [...] "on autopilot", with no mechanism of central control.|$|E
2500|$|CBC's {{deal with}} the NHL ran through the 2013–14 season, and was {{replaced}} in 2014–15 by a sublicensing deal with Rogers Communications (see below). [...] The deal includes airings of games on the conventional over-the-air CBC Television network as well as carriage of those broadcasts through digital media, including CBCSports.ca. [...] The deal came after controversy and discussion {{before and during the}} 2006-07 NHL season, when private broadcaster CTVglobemedia attempted to acquire exclusive Canadian distribution rights to the NHL for its own networks, including broadcast network CTV and cable channels TSN and RDS. [...] Such a package, which would have left CBC without NHL hockey, would have increased TSN's previously existing coverage of NHL games; the attempt also came at a time when CTVglobemedia had outbid the CBC for Canadian television rights to the 2010 and 2012 Olympics (along with Rogers Media), as well as the major television package for curling. [...] Despite the rumours, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> that CTV was unlikely to be interested in the nightly playoff coverage currently provided by the CBC, since weeknight games in April and May would conflict with new episodes of CTV's slate of American programming. [...] As well, the title Hockey Night in Canada could not be used as the name is owned by CBC, unless CTVglobemedia paid royalties to CBC for use of the name. [...] The current deal with CBC and Rogers maintains the 50-plus-year tradition of Hockey Night in Canada on CBC, but also allows Rogers to expand its coverage. [...] A caveat of the deal limits CBC to the number of games per Canadian team it can show so that the seven Canadian-based teams, particularly the Toronto Maple Leafs, can distribute more games to regional carriers, thereby increasing the value of their local packages.|$|E
