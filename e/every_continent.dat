5|$|After 1897, {{the search}} for dinosaur fossils {{extended}} to <b>every</b> <b>continent,</b> including Antarctica. The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi, was found on James Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod Cryolophosaurus ellioti, was formally named and described in a scientific journal.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm humid air from the Gulf and dry air from the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an unstable severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except Antarctica they are especially common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E

5|$|Drosera, {{commonly}} known as the sundews, {{is one of the largest}} genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|Roller {{coasters}} are amusement rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where {{the train was}} attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although wooden roller coasters are still being produced, steel roller coasters are more common {{and can be found}} on <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Spiders (order Araneae) are {{air-breathing}} arthropods {{that have}} eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom. They {{are the largest}} order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exceptions of air and sea colonization. , at least 45,700 spider species, and 113 families have been recorded by taxonomists. However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, {{as evidenced by the}} over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} malaria {{stretches}} from its prehistoric origin as a zoonotic {{disease in the}} primates of Africa through to the 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested <b>every</b> <b>continent,</b> except Antarctica. Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since {{the discovery of the}} parasites which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology, {{as well as that of}} the mosquitoes which transmit the parasites.|$|E

25|$|However, if dualistic cosmologies {{are defined}} {{in a broad}} sense, and not {{restricted}} to certain concrete motifs, then their existence is more widespread; they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but in examples on <b>every</b> inhabited <b>continent.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beer {{may have}} been known in Neolithic Europe {{as far back as}} 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a {{domestic}} scale. Women brewers dominated alcohol production on <b>every</b> occupied <b>continent</b> until commercialization and industrialization of brewing occurred.|$|R
5|$|Tornadoes {{have been}} {{observed}} and documented on <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except Antarctica. However, {{the vast majority of}} tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. They also occasionally occur in south-central and eastern Asia, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a varied}} {{group of animals}} from taxonomic, {{morphological}} and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through {{the first half of}} the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{are found}} on <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except Antarctica. In {{contrast}} to the damselflies (Zygoptera), which tend to have restricted distributions, some genera and species are found across continents. For example, the blue-eyed darner Rhionaeschna multicolor is found all across North America, and in Central America; emperors Anax are found throughout the Americas from {{as far north as}} Newfoundland to as far south as Bahia Blanca in Argentina, across Europe to central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. The globe skimmer Pantala flavescens is probably the most widespread dragonfly species in the world; it is cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents in the warmer regions. Most Anisoptera species are tropical, with far fewer species in temperate regions.|$|E

5|$|Mole crickets are {{relatively}} common, {{but because they}} are nocturnal and spend nearly all their lives underground in extensive tunnel systems, they are rarely seen. They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> with the exception of Antarctica; by 2014, one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species, originating in South America it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa; other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to western Europe), but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} museums in England, {{but perhaps the}} most notable is London's British Museum. Its {{collection}} of more than seven million objects {{is one of the largest}} and most comprehensive in the world, sourced from <b>every</b> <b>continent,</b> illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginning to the present. The British Library in London is the national library and is one of the world's largest research libraries, holding over 150million items in all known languages and formats; including around 25million books. The most senior art gallery is the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, which houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Tate galleries house the national collections of British and international modern art; they also host the famously controversial Turner Prize.|$|E
5|$|Wild-caught and hatchery-reared {{forms of}} this species have been transplanted and {{introduced}} for food or sport in at least 45 countries and <b>every</b> <b>continent</b> except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), Southern Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as whirling disease), or hybridizing with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout {{is included in the}} list of the top 100 globally invasive species. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created sport fisheries such as the Great Lakes and Wyoming's Firehole River.|$|E
