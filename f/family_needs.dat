In the novel, Penman investigates {{the role of a}} strong medieval queen who rebels against her husband. Furthermore, Penman explores the theme of betrayal: Henry II considers the rebellion against him by his sons and wife as personal and political betrayal. Finally, the question of how a man reconciles personal and <b>family</b> <b>needs</b> with the demands of kingship are examined through Henry's actions as father, husband and ruler.|$|E

25|$|Pea Ridge {{settlers}} {{were mostly}} farm families. Early farms usually {{focused more on}} supplying <b>family</b> <b>needs</b> and less on production of crops for market. Most families kept livestock, raised large gardens, and harvested wild berries, such as the plentiful blackberries. As community life developed, farm families could market corn, oats, wheat, tobacco, butter and cream, eggs and meats. After 1881, with {{the building of the}} railroad through nearby Garfield and Avoca, and with the rise of the new city of Rogers (all in Benton County), the area's apple industry grew quite strong, supplying an economic boon to Pea Ridge and the county during the late nineteenth century and into the 1920s.|$|E

Grant is angry when she reveals that she had planned to tell him and Sam through letters to them after she died, and that she plans to commit suicide. Phil and Grant seemingly convince Peggy not to do this. Grant tells Phil he needs the money that he lent him immediately but knows he cannot get it so threatens him unless he returns the money.

25|$|Aboriginally and {{in early}} {{historic}} times the shaman, called as medicine man or medicine woman (Tanacross deshen Upper Tanana dishin) {{was the central}} figure of Athabaskan religious life. The shaman within this culture was the middle man/woman between spirits and the native peoples. Magicoreligious practices included omens, charms, amulets, songs, taboos, and beliefs about the supernatural. Beliefs and practices were associated with certain animals, and many centered on hunting. Animal spirits appear to have predominated in Tanana spiritual life, although an evil spirit was manifested in a half-man, half-animal being. Spirits were influential {{in the activities of}} the living and in guiding the dead to their final resting place. Athabaskan shamans guarded people against the effects of bad spirits. The shaman also diagnosed various illnesses and restored the health of those harmed by bad spirits. The shaman could also provide the valuable service of scapulimancy, which predicted the location of game when hunting was scarce. According to cultural anthropologist Richard K. Nelson (who lived for extended periods in Alaskan Athabaskan villages), Athabaskan traditions teach that everything in nature is fundamentally spiritual and must be treated with respect. This includes not only avoiding waste, but also following an elaborate code of morality toward plants, animals, and the earth itself. For example, if an Upper Tanana man kills a wolf, he should never touch it until he formally apologizes and explains that his <b>family</b> <b>needs</b> it.|$|E

There, they discover Will Wright, who is destroying copies of an old 8-bit The Simpsons game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next The Simpsons game is released. The only way to prevent this is to talk to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the <b>family</b> <b>needs</b> to acquire four key cards from four upcoming Simpsons games.

We had an excellent response from <b>Families</b> <b>Need</b> Fathers, part of which we incorporated, and I think <b>Families</b> <b>Need</b> Fathers has become a key player in the debate about on-going contact and joint residence. We make progress with rational argument; we do not make progress by sloganising.|$|R
