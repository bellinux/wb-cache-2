40|$|Nanocomposites of {{encapsulated}} silica nanoparticles {{were prepared}} by in situ emulsion polymerization of acrylate monomers. The synthesized material showed good uniformity and dispersion of the inorganic {{components in the}} base polymer, which enhances {{the properties of the}} nanocomposite material. A nonionic surfactant with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) was used to encapsulate the silica nanoparticles in the acrylic copolymer matrix. This in situ method combined the surface modification and the encapsulation in a single pot, which greatly simplified the process compared with other conventional methods requiring separate processing steps. The morphology of the encapsulated nanosilica particles was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which confirmed the uniform distribution of the nanoparticles without any agglomerations. A neat copolymer was also prepared as a control sample. Both the neat copolymer and the prepared nanocomposite were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and the <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test.</b> Due to the uniform dispersion of the non-agglomerated nanoparticles in the matrix of the polymer, TGA and <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> results showed remarkably improved thermal stability. Furthermore, DMTA results demonstrated an enhanced storage modulus of the nanocomposite samples compared with that of the neat copolymer, indicating its superior mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{chemical}} and flame retardant (FR) treatment of woven flax fabric and preparation and characterization of flax reinforced phenolic composites. Sheets of flax fabric were subjected to chemical treatments using NaOH and silane coupling agents. A phosphate-based flame retardant (DAP) was applied to decrease the flammability of the flax fabric. The effect of the chemical treatments and FR treatments on the thermal and flammability properties of the fabric and composites was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vertical <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> and cone calorimeter. The mechanical properties of the flax fabric and composites, before and after environmental ageing, were investigated. Ageing {{studies were carried out}} by exposing the samples in an environmental chamber at specified conditions for two weeks. TGA results showed that the treatment of the fabric with FR shifts the decomposition temperature to lower level and increases the char residue. Vertical flame resistance testing showed that FR treatment of the flax fabric improved the flammability properties. There was no after flame and afterglow observed for FR treated flax fabric due to self-extinguishment after removal of the flame. Flax Fabric without FR burned completely and there was no result for the char length due to the complete destruction of the fabric. The FR treatment, however, seemed to have had a negative effect on the tensile strength of the flax fabric. This was further intensified upon exposure of FR treated flax fabric to high temperatures during ageing studies which drastically reduced the tensile strength by more than 90 %, and the flax fabric were found to be brittle and darker in visual appearance. TGA results of flax/phenolic composites showed that for composites containing chemically treated and FR treated flax fabric the decomposition temperatures shifted to lower temperatures; however {{there was no significant difference}} in the amount of char residue. Untreated flax/phenolic composites exhibited the lowest char residue. Cone calorimeter results showed that the peak heat release rate (PHRR), smoke production rate (SPR) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission rate was reduced for the flax/phenolic composite produced using FR treated flax fabric. The tensile strength of these composites was reduced while there was an increase in modulus value. Exposure of the FR treated composites to high temperatures further reduced the tensile strength and increased the E-modulus. Both FR treated and untreated composites changed in colour and the FR treated composites were found to be brittle after exposure to high temperatures...|$|E

50|$|The term {{fire-retardant}} {{as applied}} to organic (i.e., containing carbon) materials, is intended to refer to reduced fire hazard, as all will burn under certain circumstances. The tests used specified in building codes, such as NFPA 701, are more correctly <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tests,</b> which test a fabric's ability to resist ignition with the flame size and duration in the test conditions. The result is a comparative test, which provides {{a measure of the}} material's resistance to propagating combustion caused by small scale ignition sources. These tests do not predict the burning characteristics of full scale hazards. In many cases, if exposed to a sufficiently large and sustained exposure fire, the fire-retardant fabrics will burn vigorously. Polyester is inherently flame retardant, and therefore doesn't flare up when applied to various tests. Any amount of heat delivered within a long enough time interval will have no impact on the fabrics' integrity while a limited amount of heat delivered within short enough time interval may ignite or melt the fabric. A simple method for evaluating the threshold incident energy for ignition or melting of fabrics as a function of convective and radiant heat flux has been developed.|$|R

40|$|Aquion Energy {{received}} a $ 5. 179 million cooperative research agreement under the Department of Energyâs Smart Grid Demonstration Program â Demonstration of Promising Energy Storage Technologies (Program Area 2. 5) of FOA DE-FOE- 0000036. The main {{objective of this}} project was to demonstrate Aquionâs low cost, grid-scale, ambient temperature sodium ion energy storage device. The centerpiece of the technology is a novel hybrid energy storage chemistry that has been proven in a laboratory environment. The objective was to translate these groundbreaking results from the small-batch, small-cell test environment to the pilot scale to enable significant numbers of multiple ampere-hour cells to be manufactured and assembled into test batteries. Aquion developed a proof of concept demonstration unit that showed similar performance and major cost improvement over existing technologies. Beyond minimizing cell and system cost, Aquion built a technology that is safe, environmentally benign and durable over many thousands of cycles as used {{in a variety of}} grid support roles. As outlined in the Program documents, the original goals of the project were to demonstrate a unit that: 1. Has a projected capital cost of less than $ 250 /kWh at the pack level 2. A deep discharge cycle life of > 10, 000 cycles 3. A volumetric energy density of > 20 kWh/m 3 4. Projected calendar life of over 10 years 5. A device that contains no hazardous materials and retains best in class safety characteristics. Through the course of this project Aquion developed its aqueous electrolyte electrochemical energy storage device to the point where large demonstration units (> 10 kWh) were able to function in grid-supporting functions detailed by their collaborators. Aquionâs final deliverable was an ~ 15 kWh system that has the ability to perform medium to long duration (> 2 hours) charge and discharge functions approaching 95 % DC-DC efficiency. The system has functioned, and continues to function as predicted with no indication that it will not tolerate well beyond 10 calendar years and 10, 000 cycles. It has been in continuous operation for more than 1 year with 1, 000 cycles (of varying depth of discharge, including 100 % depth of discharge) and no identifiable degradation to the system. The final thick electrode cell structure has shown an energy density of 25 kWh/m 3 at a five hour (or greater) discharge time. The primary chemistry has remained non-toxic, containing no acids or other corrosive chemicals, and the battery units have passed numerous safety <b>tests,</b> including <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>testing.</b> These tests have verified the claim that the device is safe to use and contains no hazardous materials.

30|$|Both {{mattress}} flammability standards, 16 CFR 1632 and 16 CFR 1633, require {{full scale}} testing of all prototype mattresses or mattress sets introduced {{for sale in}} the United States. In order to minimize the testing burden on the manufacturer, a representative mattress or mattress set to be placed on the market can be tested. If this sample meets both cigarette ignition <b>resistance</b> and open <b>flame</b> ignition <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> criteria, it then becomes a ‘qualified prototype’ that {{can be used as a}} model for the production of these mattresses, as long as the materials, components, design, and method of assembly remain unchanged. Furthermore, manufacturers have been granted the flexibility to produce similar mattresses of differing sizes and to use materials, components, and methods of assembly whose FR performance is similar to or better than the qualified prototype. Such ‘subordinate prototypes’ do not require additional testing as long as a record of the manufacturing specification and a description of the variation from the ‘qualified prototype’ are available. The manufacturer is also required to show sufficient documented evidence that the changes in the subordinate prototype will not cause the prototype to exceed the specified test criteria. There also exists a possibility of ‘pooling’ the qualified prototypes, whereby two or more manufacturers can use qualified prototypes to produce mattress sets. When using pooled prototypes, manufacturers are required to conduct one successful confirmation test. Prototype pooling is only permitted by 16 CFR 1633 however, to improve testing efficiencies and reducing testing burden, International Sleep Product Association (ISPA) has suggested extending the prototype pooling concept to 16 CFR 1632 ([2005]).|$|R

40|$|Cotton {{possesses}} many {{characteristics that}} make it desirable to the consumer, and this has resulted in its usage in {{a broad range of}} products. Cotton, however, is a flammable material that is easily ignited and rapidly consumed. The flame retardant treatment of cotton is, therefore, an important textile process that has received wide attention over many years. There are a number of commercial flame retardant treatments available for cotton, the most common being phosphate-based. These treatments, however, often have drawbacks or {{have a negative impact on}} the desirable properties of the fibre and the challenge still exists for designing better flame retardant products and systems that are durable and have limited impact on fibre properties. The study considers the application of the sol-gel as a coating on fabric that was pre-treated with a phosphate-based flame retardant or as a means for applying a phosphate-based flame retardant. Both treatment methods were found to be suitable for imparting <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> to the fabric. The effect of various phosphate-based flame retardants on flammability and fabric properties such as colour, handle and strength was investigated and it was shown that a diammonium phosphate and urea combination gave the best <b>flame</b> <b>resistance.</b> In this regard, a <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> was achieved with a lower amount of phosphorous than was used in similar conventional treatments. The durability of the coating to rinsing with water and soaping with a detergent was also investigated. It was found that the <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> was lost after rinsing or soaping but the prevention of afterglow combustion was retained. It was shown that the preparatory treatment of the fabric influenced the sol-gel coating process and the flammability of the fabric. Mercerisation and bleaching of the fabric increased the “wet pick-up” during the coating process and improved the <b>flame</b> <b>resistance.</b> The influence of various factors was also investigated in further detail. The ratio of the sol-gel components, the delay after coating prior to drying (hang time) and the curing time were investigated using an experimental design. The curing time and the ratio of components in the sol-gel were shown to have the greatest influence on fabric properties and fabric flammability. It was shown that there is a trade-off between the desired high level of fabric <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> and preserving the inherent properties of the fabric such as colour, handle and strength...|$|R

These immiscible blends were melt-mixed with expanded graphite (EG) (up to 9 wt%) to improve the thermal conductivity and <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> of the material. It was observed that the EG particles agglomerate {{in the absence of}} wax, but disperse much better in the EVA/wax blend, probably because the wax penetrates in between the EG layers (there seems to be a better interaction between wax and EG than between EVA and EG) and separates the layers, giving rise to smaller and better dispersed EG particles. This gives rise to better thermal conductivity and <b>flame</b> <b>resistance.</b> There were no significant changes in the melting temperature of EVA in the EVA/EG composites, while the crystallinities of EVA were observably lower in the presence of EG.
