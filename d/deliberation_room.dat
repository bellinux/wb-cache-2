My talk illustrates one aspect of this phenomenon, from the modest colonial courthouses, in which American jurors enforced (or not infrequently, rejected) English law, to the modern federal courthouses, where the jury <b>deliberation</b> <b>rooms</b> stand empty. Colonial criminal jury trials involved far more than rituals that reflected the administration of power, although they were surely that.

On the other hand, the colonial citizenry was invited in not merely to be passive observers.

Jones was convicted in relation to this murder along with Van Roosevelt Solomon, who was executed on February 20, 1985 by electrocution. In 1989, a federal court ordered Jones to be re-sentenced because the jurors who had convicted him had improperly brought a Bible into the <b>deliberation</b> <b>room.</b> He was re-sentenced to death in 1997. In January 2016, Jones' attorneys asked the Butts County Superior Court to stop his execution by challenging the state's injection drug secrecy law, and arguing that the death penalty was too harsh a punishment for his crime. Both arguments were rejected by the court. On February 2, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit voted 6-5 not to hear Jones' challenge of Georgia's drug secrecy law. Jones was executed early on February 3, 2016 by lethal IV injection. The executioner team struggled for an hour to insert the IV into Jones' veins, spending 24 minutes trying to get it into a vein in his left arm, another eight minutes trying his right arm and then they asked a doctor in attendance to insert it into Jones' groin which took 13 minutes.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{potential}} role {{of culture in}} relation to policy-making and planning activities, exemplified through a discussion on how it may influence sustainable transport policy and planning. It is recognised that discourses and institutions play an essential part in framing problems and solutions, however an improved understanding of barriers and potentials in policy and planning deliberation {{is likely to be}} reached if underlying layers of values and perceptions are considered and illuminated more explicitly. Culture is also changeable, which means that it becomes relevant for policy-making and planning to search for opportunities to strategically identify and bring into play cultural resources. The article debates political-administrative cultures and broader social or local cultures, as well as the circumstances that might influence them, in order to search for transformative potentials and barriers. In conclusion, a culture focus recognises diversity inside and outside normal policy and planning settings and procedures and attempts to bring different cultures to interact and to learn from each other. A transport policy-making and planning process based in a culture approach may illuminate a so-called ‘value-action gap’ concerning the possibility of more sustainable transportation. A closer cultural interaction may point out some of the divides between professionals {{on how to deal with}} transportenvironment issues. Moreover, a more culturally oriented <b>deliberation</b> would provide <b>room</b> for underlying sets of values and norms to enter the policy process more freely and explicitly. However, do we then have the cultures and moral force to build effective sustainable transport policies and plans? The article therefore also looks into a range of overlapping approaches that may potentially aid in rethinking and rebuilding transport policy-making and planning processes in terms of cultural learning processes. Finally, the role of the planner as a ‘cultural entrepreneur’ and ‘cultural story-teller’ is presented as potential tool to push through new agendas or ideas, such as more sustainable transport solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on corporate governance reveals {{an emphasis on}} board characteristics and firm performance. The role of the NED is examined under board roles. The concept NED effectiveness is considered as part of board effectiveness revealing a lack of clarity of what distinguishes NED roles from board roles. The literature suggests that a consideration of board roles and effectiveness ultimately covers the purpose of NEDs. The research examined the roles of NEDs in listed companies in Nigeria. The research method utilised {{in this study was}} the semi structured interview method. Forty directors and company secretaries were interviewed for the research. The findings of the research revolves around five constructs namely board effectiveness, convergence or divergence with corporate governance principles, NED effectiveness, NED roles and power. The NED requires power to perform their roles, as a result their effectiveness as individuals and a group is restricted to, the weight of influence they carry and exhibit in board <b>room</b> <b>deliberations.</b> The NED is thus hindered by challenges such as information asymmetry. The findings also reveal that, collaboration and team work is crucial for NED and board effectiveness. The different director functions may create hierarchy in the board room. However, a board climate which encourages organisational, rather than performance hierarchy may increase cohesiveness in the board room. The findings reveal that understanding and team work are crucial for successful completion of board tasks. This is because NED roles are not independent of board functions. The findings reveal that Nigerian NEDs in listed companies apply corporate governance best practices. The Nigerian listed companies have separated the roles of the CEO from that of the chairman. This suggests that listed company boards are most likely independent. However, Nigerian NED’s are faced with the challenge of not having adequate company information, through which they can perform their roles. Interestingly, majority of the participants in this research seemed to agree that information asymmetry was the greatest challenge faced by Nigerian NEDs. However, the EXEC participants did not agree with the idea that, Nigerian NED’s do not receive adequate information to perform their roles. As a result, the research indicates that NED’s play more of a supervisory and supportive role in the board room. Furthermore, it reveals that Nigerian listed companies may comply with local and international best practices. However, the notion of board room independence is not enshrined in listed companies in Nigeria. The research findings also indicate that, the Nigerian institutional environment restricts the practice of good corporate governance. Furthermore, the control and monitoring role of Nigerian NEDs has been restated by the EXECs and the corporate environment. The findings indicate that Nigerian listed boards use private and public company meetings to create a front and influence shareholders and stakeholders’ perceptions of directors and the company. Furthermore Nigerian directors use impression management strategies to influence the different actors in the company. There are rare occasions where, stakeholders control the impression management process and this leads a break in the frame and director accountability. The overall key finding of this research is that the findings five constructs are intertwined and are necessary ingredients for NED and board effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Juror {{racism in}} the <b>deliberation</b> <b>room</b> is a {{violation}} of a defendant’s right to an impartial jury. If other jurors do not report the occurrence of racism, defendants lack the evidence to move for a new trial. The current studies examine how jurors react to and whether they will report the racist comments of a fellow juror. During participants’ online deliberation, they read the racist comments of someone who they believed to be a fellow participant. In Study 1, the severity and frequency of the comment was manipulated, as well as the race of one of the other co-jurors. In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to be the foreperson and the content of jury instructions were manipulated. As hypothesized, very few participants reported the racist juror’s comments. Frequency decreased the likelihood of juror reports and co-juror race only had an effect when interacting with the frequency of the comment, such that jurors were less likely to confront when a comment was infrequent and the co-juror was Black. Neither the foreperson nor instruction manipulation influenced reporting levels. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{lay judge}} system has {{considerable}} potential both in concept and form. To realize its full potential, the system needs to overcome various structural impediments and cultural challenges. This Article further {{contributes to the}} emerging discussion by detailing three related areas that merit attention and reform if the {{system is going to}} realize its full potential. Namely, the lay judge system would benefit from 1) increased transparency by eliminating punitive measures against citizen judges desiring to freely speak about the trial proceedings or deliberation process oncle the trial is complete; 2) impoved access to the interrogation of detained suspects and defendants; and 3) limited victim participation in trials until a post-verdicgt phase in the proceedings. Part I establishes a foundation by outlining the movement towards citizen participation, the reasons underlying the new lay judge system, and the ongoing debate about the law judge system.

Part III explains the need for increased transparency in the <b>deliberation</b> <b>room,</b> improved access to interrogations, and controls necessary to ensure objective deliberations...|$|E
40|$|The Clerk of the Court (secretario judicial) in Spanish provincial courts is an {{important}} legal actor in {{the proceedings of the}} modern Spanish jury, introduced in 1995. In contrast to the general verdicts of traditional common-law juries, Spanish juries must answer an often lengthy list of specific questions, and must provide the reasoning supporting these responses. Early on, many Spanish juries found the task of providing legally acceptable responses and reasons challenging. Because the law permits the clerk to enter the <b>deliberation</b> <b>room</b> to assist the jury in its writing of the verdict, the clerk has come to act as a principal intermediary between the formal demands of the law and lay citizens serving on the jury. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to analyze the role of the Clerk of the Court in Spanish jury proceedings, including the jury selection phase and the verdict writing process.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{measures the}} levels of trait-like and situational oral communication apprehension in jury bodies and provides some interpretation of these measurements on these bodies. By extending research on oral communication apprehension to juries, {{a clearer understanding of}} the impact of this phenomenon on specialized small groups is possible. Juries constitute a specialized small group because of the manner by which jurors are selected, the rules applying to their discussion of trial matters, their isolation from external influences during a trial, and their objective to determine a trial verdict for which they have personal impunity. Results of this study were obtained from analysis of data acquired from actual venire members and jurors in the Pima County Superior Court in Tucson, Arizona. The study uses a data collection instrument that is a modification of the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension- 24 combined with the Situational Communication Apprehension Measure. This research determined that the overall trait-like oral communication apprehension level of venire members is below that normally found in other groups, whereas, the situational apprehension level of jurors is generally above that level found in nonjury small groups. This situational apprehension level varies considerably depending on the ethnicity of the individual venire member or jurors {{and the nature of the}} trial on which the juror is impaneled. The study further determined that certain factors normally associated with leadership role fulfillment appear to be altered inside the jury <b>deliberation</b> <b>room.</b> Jury service appears to serve as a motivational drive that lowers the fears and anxieties that high communication apprehensives associate with interactive speaking in small groups...|$|E
40|$|Experts” {{appear in}} the modern American {{courtroom}} on the jury {{as well as in}} the witness box, posing a dilemma for the legal system by offering a potentially valuable resource and an uncontrolled source of influence. Courts give ambiguous guidance to jurors on how they should handle their expertise in the <b>deliberation</b> <b>room.</b> On the one hand, jurors are told that they should “decide what the facts are from the evidence presented here in court. ” By direct implication, then, jurors should not use outside information to evaluate the evidence. Jurors are also told, however, that they should “consider all of the evidence in the light of reason, common sense, and experience. ” And indeed, all decision makers, including jurors, are unavoidably influenced by their own backgrounds and experiences as they evaluate evidence and reach decisions. In this Article we examine the actual and desirable behavior during deliberations of jurors with specialized expertise. We draw on three sources to assess how often citizens with specialized knowledge serve as jurors, how they behave when they do, and how legal professionals view the appropriateness of the contributions juror-experts may make. Our sources include: (1) a survey of 167 experienced trial attorneys who reported on their recent trial experience with juror “experts”; (2) the actual deliberations of jurors in fifty civil trials from the Arizona Jury Project, which revealed how real jurors use their expertise in the jury room; and (3) a survey of 128 judges and attorneys who evaluated examples of “expert” juror behavior. Some scholars suggest that jurors with specialized expertise should be excused for cause. In light of our findings, we conclude that such drastic intervention is unwarranted and would inappropriately undermine the increasing heterogeneity on the jury that the elimination of occupational exemptions has worked to promote. We instead advocate a tempered response to the growing presence of juror expertise in the jury room...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how peer court jurors make meaning {{out of the}} sanctioning trials of youth offenders. In particular, it focuses on how peer court jurors understand juvenile delinquency, deterrence and punishment. Data was collected utilizing ethnographic field observation methods while attending a Midwestern County 2 ̆ 7 s peer court program {{between the end of}} the 2011 - 2012 school year and the 2012 - 2013 school year. Thirteen interviews were conducted after the sessions with willing peer court jurors in order to supplement the field work data. During the peer court sessions the youth jurors tried {{to understand the nature of}} the offenses and how to deter future delinquent behaviors. The observations and interview data illustrates how the youth jurors were working together in the <b>deliberation</b> <b>room</b> to give sanctions, which they hoped would provide the informal social control needed to prevent recidivism. Through questioning both offenders and their accompanying parent, we see that these youth were looking to provide sanctions that acted as the missing informal social control agents in the offender 2 ̆ 7 s life. When the youth jurors saw the parents of the offender as being lax on the punishment or rules at home, the jurors provided sanctions that would do this for them. Alternatively, when parents of the offender or even the youth themselves were seen as providing adequate punishments the youth jurors went lighter on the sanctioning. Peer jurors also understood some of the reasoning behind youth crime from their own perspective as a teen and drew upon these experiences when trying to understand the nature of the offense and punishment. Since they are also youth, they understand that some behavior drew from boredom or peer influence and in these cases the youth jurors provide sanctions that fit the missing informal social control in their lives. Sanctions such as curfews, community service, no association with particular peers, mandatory participation in an after school activity and attendance in a future peer court session, were all utilized as informal social control agents for offending youth. Lastly, youth jurors understood impression management and had the tough job making sure the self-presentations of the offenders were authentic when deciding upon sanctions. In all, these youth jurors took their roles seriously and really provided a space where the offender was not seen as a delinquent teen, but instead 2 ̆ 2 a good kid, 2 ̆ 2 who like many teenagers, failed to think through their offense or see the consequences involved prior to committing their act or acts...|$|E
