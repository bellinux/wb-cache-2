40|$|In recent years, Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) {{devices have}} {{attracted}} considerable {{attention in the}} area of VLSI applications due to its high speed performance, latchup immunity and superior isolation characteristics. The advantage of superior isolation is also very important for Power Integrated Circuit (PIC) applications as low voltage and high voltage devices are put together on the same chip. In the case of high voltage SOI devices, they exhibit lower on-resistance than junction isolation (JI) devices when used in high-side switching applications. In addition, conductivity modulated devices such as the LIGBTs (Lateral Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) for <b>high</b> <b>side</b> <b>switching</b> applications can only be implemented on SOI substrate. As the thickness of the SOI film reduces, it brings more merits to the VLSI devices such as easier isolation, higher packing density and reduction of kink effect.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the market demand for faster {{personal}} computers and laptops, microprocessor manufacturers are increasing the clock frequency at which the processor operates. And since the technology used is CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor), the power dissipation of the microprocessor increases linearly with clock frequency. For very powerful processors, conventional heat dissipation methods are insufficient. Normally, a combination of power supply voltage reduction and selective clock speed reduction is used to reduce power dissipation. Thus special power supplies are used that would supply low voltages and high currents to meet the increasing load demands handled by the microprocessor. This work presents a reliable and efficient low voltage high current Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) for devices using microprocessors like desktop computers, laptops and tablets. The Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) generally used in computers essentially converts the input AC supply into ± 12 V or ± 5 V DC supply but to step this DC voltage down to further low voltages (1. 2 V), synchronous converters are the obvious choices owing to their low conduction and switching losses. In this project the various losses occurring in the standard buck converter, synchronous buck converter and multiphase synchronous buck converter (MSBC) is analyzed. It is then found that the <b>high</b> <b>side</b> <b>switching</b> loss dominates the total loss. Also, ZVS (Zero Voltage Switching), the most efficient soft switching technique is employed along with a SBC to form an efficient power supply.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new family}} of zero-current {{switching}} (ZCS) BBR with high power factor using only two active switches is proposed. The proposed BBR {{is based on a}} totem-pole BBR (TPBBR) configuration which allows the current to flow from <b>high</b> <b>side</b> to low side and vice versa during resonance. Hence, no auxiliary active switch is needed to provide soft-switching for all semiconductor devices. The soft-switching also reduces the body diode reverse recovery problem hence allows the TPBLB to operate in continuous conduction mode (CCM). Design considerations and parameter values calculations are given. An experimental prototype is developed and tested to verify the converter performance. The proposed FTBBR is based on an H-bridge rectifier configuration. Only two out of the four switches are needed to be working in order to ensure the continuity of the converter operation. A detailed analysis of the FTBBR operation under all open-circuit faults of the switches is presented. In addition, adding resonant networks to the FTBBR is also analysed. The FTBBR is controlled using similar PWM controller as proposed in the new ZCS BBR. An experimental prototype is developed and tested to verify the converter performance. The TPBBR requires a special switching techniques and sequences, where isolated gate driver is the best solution which allows both <b>high</b> and low <b>side</b> <b>switches</b> to be turned on simultaneously during resonance.
