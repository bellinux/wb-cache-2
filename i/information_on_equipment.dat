40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{replacement}} and innovation in shaping invest-ment and productivity during episodes of lumpy adjustment in capital. To this purpose we use a rich firm-level panel of Spanish manufacturing data that combines <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>equipment</b> investment and firm’s strategies.

We find evidence of replacement activity for firms not involved in process innovation nor plant expansion. Then, we explore how large investment episodes transmit into the evolution of productivity under different in-novative strategies. We find that productivity increases after an investment spike in innovative firms. However, long learning curves seem {{to be associated with}} inno-vative investments.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a mathematical programming model {{for assessing the}} impact of Environmental Policy instruments on French winegrowing farm’s adoption of pesticides-saving technologies. We model choices with regards to investment in precision farming and plant protection practices, in a multi-periodic framework with sequential decision, integrating uncertainty on fungal disease pressure and imperfect <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>equipment</b> performance. We focus on recursive models maximizing a Utility function. These models are applied on {{a representative sample of}} 534 winegrowers from the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). As expected, both ecotaxes and green subsidies make precision farming equipment more profitable, but the investment rate remains however low and concentrated on basic systems. One explanation is grower’s financial constraint in a context of market crisis and farm indebtedness. Shortcomings and further development of the models are discussed.

40|$|PURPOSE: Dredged {{material}} and in situ sediments may contain contaminants at sufficient concentrations to degrade the benthic environment. In cases where unacceptable toxicity or bioaccumulation {{is predicted to}} occur, subaqueous capping {{with a layer of}} clean material is often an acceptable management or remediation alternative. This technical note (TN) describes equipment and placement techniques for subaqueous capping projects. The equipment and techniques are applicable to placement of contaminated material to be capped and clean material to be used for capping and include conventional discharge from barges, hopper dredges, and pipelines; submerged discharge from diffusers and tremies; and surface spreading techniques for cap placement. Both granular capping materials such as sediments and soils and geosynthetic fabrics and armoring materials are considered. BACKGROUND: Detailed guidance on engineering considerations for dredged material capping and in situ sediment capping can be found in Palermo et al. (1998 a, 1998 b). These guidance documents include <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>equipment</b> and placement techniques used in projects up to about 1994.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} an emergency department discharge initiative (EDDI) nurse on discharge processes and patient transition outcomes. Design: Prospective comparative study of two groups of patients, aged 18 - 70 years discharged from a minor injuries unit. Setting: Emergency Department Minor Injuries Unit at a large tertiary hospital in South East Queensland, Australia. Subjects: In total 337 patients were eligible and 231 {{were included in the}} study. Participants were recruited into two groups one before the introduction of the intervention (n= 103) and one after the introduction of the intervention (n= 128). Intervention: Introduction of an EDDI nurse (an advanced practice role) focusing on improving patient pre-discharge care and transition home. Main outcome measures: Data were collected pre-discharge and one week post discharge, using self reports of discharge planning processes and the Care Transitions Measure (CTM) Questionnaire. Results: Patients seen by the EDDI nurse {{were significantly more likely to}} receive written discharge information, a discharge letter, <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>equipment,</b> information on medication side effects and have follow-up arranged, than those not seen. The intervention group also had a better understanding of post discharge healthcare management with a mean CTM score of 83. 3 out of a possible 100 compared with the pre-intervention mean of 64. 4.

40|$|Monitoring {{soil water}} content at high spatio-temporal {{resolution}} and coupled to other sensor data {{is crucial for}} applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost "open hardware" platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system {{is based on an}} open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe 1 : 2. 5 < 0. 1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0. 09 for the overall model, 0. 09 for the sandy soil, 0. 07 for the clay loam and 0. 08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R 2 = 0. 89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSE(training) = 2. 63; RMSE(validation) = 2. 61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>equipment</b> design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{alternatives}} {{were considered to}} keep pecan processing economically competitive and sustainable. The industry needed a low risk evaluation technique for testing new high capital plant configurations. A simulation model was developed using the AweSimTM simulation system to form the model structure and framework. The Visual SLAMTM and Visual BASIC programming languages were used to build a network model that provided a mathematical-logical representation of the system. The model mathematically expresses all sub-processes including moisture conditioning, pasteurizing, cracking, shelling, sizing, manual and electronic sorting, resizing, resorting, and packaging. The pecan process simulation model consists of 24 RESOURCES, 353 ACTIVITIES, 48 AWAIT/QUEUE and FREE nodes, 83 BATCH and UNBATCH nodes, 79 ASSIGN nodes, 20 COLCT nodes, 39 GOON nodes, 10 other miscellaneous nodes and a graphic user interface (GUI). The model provides <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>equipment</b> utilization, delays, queues and bottlenecks for each process in the system. It also predicts total pecan cracked and total pecan packed, including details of production for each size class i. e. halves; large; medium; small; midget; fine; granule; and oil stock. The model was validated quantitatively by comparing output with actual production figures and qualitatively by plant management. Five options of process alternatives were simulated using the pecan simulation model. The first alternative (including 3 options) was a management proposed configuration for dual electronic sorting of pecan halves to reduce the shell pieces and ensure a lighter color product. Two options were found not viable as they required major capital investments and plant reconfiguration. The third option for dual sorting {{was found to be}} a viable process alternative with minor labor additions...|$|E
