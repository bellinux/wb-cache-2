Many larger populated areas have additional UHF frequencies from 470−490 MHz, and 490−512 MHz. Low band has longer range capability, but requires mobile antennas as long as nine feet (2.7 m) tall. VHF bands works well in outdoor environments, over bodies of water, and many other applications. UHF bands typically perform better in urban environments and with penetrating obstacles such as buildings. There are also frequencies in the 800 and 900 MHz range available. Commercial, public safety and government users are required to obtain U.S. Federal Communications Commission licensing in the United States and must follow Government law.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{substitution}} {{network is}} a temporary networkthat self-deploys to dynamically replace {{a portion of a}} damagedinfrastructure by means <b>of</b> a <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobile</b> routers. Someefficient solutions deploy robots based on active measurements. A robot/node in the network may use active link monitoring toassess the link quality towards its neighbors through the useof probe packets. Such probe packets are sent periodically at agiven rate, and so, the accuracy of the measurements depends onthe number and the frequency of exchanged packets. However,exchanging probe packets is energy and bandwidth consuming,thus active monitoring is considered as a costly mechanism. Even so, active link monitoring is a technique widely used onmany network protocols. In this paper, we focus on an adaptivepositioning algorithm (APOLO) to self-deploy a network. APOLOis based on active monitoring to gather essential information fromnodes. Therefore, we show how autoregressive estimation maybe used to reduce the overhead caused by the active measuringtechnique.

40|$|Abstract—Stability and {{convergence}} {{properties of}} control and other algorithms in robotics are essential aspects {{of the development of}} truly autonomous and deployable real-world robotic systems. Because of the desire for flexible, adaptive and reactive robotic systems, i. e., global operation, nonlinear analyses and tools are especially important in robotics. Hence, Lyapunov methods are at the core of many critical robotics methodologies. This paper considers Lyapunov stability for ap-proximately symmetric robotic systems. Many robotic systems, such as swarms and <b>fleets</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobile</b> robots, distributed sensor networks, etc., are comprised many identical interacting agents. Our prior work has considered stability aspects {{of control and}} dynamics of such systems.

For evaluation purposes a monitoring network is necessary, which is also supported by several papers, that argue the need for a monitoring network to assure compliance of (DSA) radio equipment with regulatory rules.
