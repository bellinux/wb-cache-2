500|$|While Luigi Fucci, {{known as}} O Gassusaro, was the nominal head, the capintesta, of the Camorra at the time, Alfano was the actual leader and was {{described}} as [...] "a kind of president of the confederation." [...] He had his own representative in the twelve districts next to the capintrito rionale that answered to Fucci. He worked closely with his associate Giovanni Rapi – a former primary school teacher turned <b>gambling</b> <b>operator</b> and usurer –, who after a gambling stint in France opened the Unione del Mezzogiorno club in 1902, popular among the aristocracy. Rapi and Alfano specialised in providing usury loans to merchants and gamblers, collecting extortion money, as well as procuring. He lived the good life and dressed very elegantly in Poole suits from London and Boivin shirts from Paris. He followed his rich clientele to the casinos in Nice, Montecarlo and Aix-les-Baines in the spring. Even the Naples lighting company paid protection money to prevent their wires being stolen.|$|E

40|$|Social {{responsibility}} in gambling is increasingly becoming both a policy issue for governments and industries, and a management issue for <b>gambling</b> <b>operators.</b> While many legalised commercial <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> adopt a purely economic orientation to their business, non-profit, charity <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> tends {{to focus on}} the social benefits of their activities. However, this paper argues that neither a purely economic nor social orientation to gambling operations is sustainable in the long-term, but that a balance between the two is needed. A well accepted model of corporate social responsibility is adapted to illuminate the competing forces at work in achieving sustainable gambling, and to advocate an approach which balances the economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities of <b>gambling</b> <b>operators.</b> Examples from three Australian jurisdictions are presented to provide preliminary support for the relationships in the model...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, online {{gambling}} {{has been steadily}} increasing both in availability and in popularity. Player protection {{has been in the}} centre of gambling regulation, and various initiatives have been set in place by some online gambling companies in order to ensure responsible gambling and harm minimisation. The aim of the present exploratory study was to evaluate how online <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> protect and minimize harm for their consumers (i. e., their gambling clientele). In order to evaluate the responsible gambling initiatives aiding player protection, the 50 most advertised online gambling websites were examined in relation to their responsible gambling practices (including which responsible <b>gambling</b> tools the <b>operator</b> offered, {{the presence or absence of}} a responsible gambling page, problem gambling self-assessment test, age verification procedures, etc.). The findings demonstrated that although most operators engage in at least some responsible gambling practices, there is wide inconsistency amongst different online <b>gambling</b> <b>operators.</b> To evaluate customer service communication, one of the research team posed as a potential problem gambler and collated all verbatim interaction. Again, the findings demonstrated wide inconsistencies between online <b>gambling</b> <b>operators.</b> It is concluded that while some online <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> appear to be socially responsible, there are a number of areas where further improvement is needed (e. g., age verification, customer service feedback, direct marketing to players) ...|$|R

40|$|Advertisements for {{gambling}} {{products have}} historically been restricted due to their potential to normalize gambling and contribute to excessive gambling behaviours among vulnerable populations. However, social media enables <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> to promote products and brands with fewer constraints than in traditional forms of media. This study investigated how social media is used by <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> to promote <b>gambling</b> activities including {{an analysis of the}} latent messages that are conveyed. A representative sample of major land-based and online <b>gambling</b> venues and <b>operators,</b> including casinos, clubs, hotels, lottery and wagering operators (n = 101), was obtained. Websites and social media profiles of <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> were audited to investigate the types of social media used, content of promotions, and prevalence of responsible gambling messaging. The results showed that Facebook and Twitter were the dominant platforms used, most commonly by casinos and online wagering operators. A key finding was that online <b>gambling</b> <b>operators</b> included <b>gambling</b> content in conjunction with related news and events, as well as unrelated content, as way of normalizing gambling within a broader social context. Unlike land-based gambling promotions, responsible gambling information tended not to feature in operators’ posts and profiles. The key messages propagated in social media gambling promotions were positively framed, and tended to encourage gambling using a range of cross-promotional tactics to emphasize the winning aspect of gambling. The implications of freely accessible and pervasive gambling promotions via social media are discussed with respect to the general community as well as vulnerable populations...|$|R
