40|$|A {{comparative}} study of gastric evacuation rates (GERs) and digesta content, moisture and pH values along the gastrointestinal tract was performed between gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. In order to distinguish species-specific differences from diet-elicited effects, all parameters were determined under either a fishmeal diet or a carob seed germ meal diet that contained high levels of total and soluble non-starch polysaccharides. GERs were significantly different between species {{and they were not}} affected by diet. Similarly, species-specific patterns were revealed in the distribution of digesta and water content along the gastrointestinal tract. In sea bream, stomach digesta and water content decreased with time, whereas in sea bass stomach retained the highest digesta and water content throughout the sampling period. The anterior and distal intestine exhibited the lowest accommodating capacities of digesta and water in either species. Overall, sea bream performed stomach digestion at lower hydration levels and higher pH compared with sea bass. Diet affected stomach moisture in both species and pH of stomach digesta in sea bass and of all intestinal sections in sea bream. The results obtained indicated that water and <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchanges</b> through the gut may differentiate between the species and warrant further investigation.

30|$|The {{variation}} in conductivity with the loading of different amount pyrrole monomer {{is shown in}} Table  2. At 7 % loading of pyrrole monomer high improvement in electrical conductivity and IEC was observed. Electrical conductivity increases significantly up to 5 % loading of pyrrole monomer and decreases slightly at 7 % loading. It means that by adding 5 % PPy the percolation threshold might be achieved after further addition of PPy: no significant change in conductivity was observed. Since conductivity increases due to increase in concentration of conducting particles, {{it is to be}} well understood that conductivity depends significantly on the carrier transport through the conducting fillers. However, the formation of percolation network within the matrix of the composite also affects the conductivity. Thus after getting percolation threshold, further addition of PPy may change the network of the matrix and further addition of <b>inorganic</b> part (<b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> material) to get better <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity may also decrease the electrical conductivity due to its insulating property.|$|R

The results present the effect of operating conditions (CoTreat dose, pond water chemistry) on CoTreat performance {{for the removal of}} Co- 57 tracer from simulated pond water. Major findings include the strong dependence of Co- 57 decontamination factor (DF) on feed activity. At the 200 Bq/L feed level, the observed DF was 10 - 20 but rose to 1000 and above when the feed level was increased to 20000 Bq/L. Calcium present in the feed was found to decrease the DF at concentrations higher than 1 ppm. The laboratory studies showed significantly higher DF's than what has been observed in large-scale THORP tests. This discrepancy is likely to be due to the technique used in applying the Co Treat layer to the Thorp HEFP Funda filter.

The Sandia National Laboratories Laboratory Directed Research and Development program provided the initial funding for this effort and this report summarizes the rapid progress that was achieved. A wide range of compositions were synthesized, evaluated for cesium (Cs) removal efficiency, and a composition called TAM- 5 was developed that exhibits high selectivity and affinity for Cs and strontium (Sr). Tests show it can remove parts per million concentrations of Cs{sup +} from highly alkaline, high-sodium, simulated radioactive waste solutions modeled after those at Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Savannah River. In experiments with solutions that simulate highly alkaline Hanford defense wastes, the crystalline silicotitanates exhibit distribution coefficients for Cs{sup +} of greater than 2, 000 ml/g, and distribution coefficients greater than 10, 000 ml/g for solutions adjusted to a pH between 1 and 10.

30|$|Inadequate {{wastewater}} management has resulted continuous discharge of heavy metals in the aquatic system. The heavy metals released in excess have significant adverse environmental impacts. These are toxic to many organ systems including the heart, bone, intestine, kidney, reproductive and nervous system, in varying degrees. Consequently, significant research attention {{has recently been}} focused on the environmental behavior of heavy metals. The heavy metals are easily concentrated by the food chain, which threatens human health. The heavy metals have entered into the atmosphere, water and soil through mining, electroplating, dyeing, tanning and metal processing industries in large scale [1, 2, 3, 4]. In drinking water, the authorized limit set by WHO for the three metals is chromium (0.05  mg/dm 3), nickel (0.07  mg/dm 3) and zinc (3.0  mg/dm 3). Therefore, it is necessary to remove heavy metals from the wastewaters before they are discharged into the natural water system. Various materials, such as (MnO 2 /CNT) nanocomposite, fertilizer waste activated carbon, waste materials, MWCNT/TiO 2 composite, alumina-coated CNT, orange peel/Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticle composite and agriculture waste, have been used to remove hazardous wastes from water [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Several other techniques have also been developed for the treatment of undesired waste containing heavy metals and dyes [3, 17, 18]. Among these, ion exchange technique is the most common and effective method for the treatment and identification of industrial wastes [19, 20]. The <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> materials are more stable to high temperatures and ionizing radiation than organic exchangers. For this purpose, first inorganic ion exchangers and later on organic resins have been used [21]. However, <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> materials have their own limitations, e.g., these materials in general are reported to be not much reproducible in behavior and fabrication of fine powder of it in rigid-type media suitable for column operations is quite difficult. Organic–inorganic hybrid composite materials, due to its exceptional chemical, mechanical and thermal properties as compared to pure inorganic and organic materials, have attracted a great attention in scientific community. Converting the organic and inorganic materials into an organic–inorganic hybrid composite with better properties is an economic method which has been a hot topic [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. The organic–inorganic hybrid composite minimizes the limitations of organic and inorganic materials by modifying individual properties of each of the organic and inorganic materials. These materials have been obtained by incorporating the organic polymers into the matrix of inorganic precipitates of multivalent metal acid salts [39]. Recently, use of organic–inorganic hybrid composite to separate metal ions has been discussed widely [24, 37, 40]. Therefore, organic–inorganic hybrid composite, cellulose acetate–tin (IV) phosphate, has been preferred to synthesize and use in heavy metal decontamination. This material has better granulometric properties, good ion exchange capacity, reproducibility and possesses good selectivity for heavy metals [21]. However, to our knowledge, {{there is little or no}} information about the preparation of cellulose acetate–tin (IV) phosphate composites (CA/TPC) and their use in separation and removal of heavy metals from electroplating wastewater. Thus, this study was aimed at developing a simple and efficient laboratory-scale adsorption technique to remove heavy metals such as chromium, nickel and zinc from synthetic and electroplating wastewater using cellulose acetate–tin (IV) phosphate composite (CA/TPC) material. The material was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The adsorption mechanism was evaluated from kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of emerging contaminants that are cationic at environmentally relevant pH, {{there is a need for}} robust predictive models for organic cation sorption coefficients (Kd). Column chromatography was validated as a method to obtain organic cation sorption isotherms for environmental solids; thereby enabling a less labor intensive means to generate the extensive datasets of linear Kd values. Current predictive models fail to account for the differences in the abundance and affinity of <b>inorganic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>ions</b> naturally present on environmental solids. To better understand how organic cation sorption is influenced by <b>inorganic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>ions,</b> sorption coefficients of ten cationic pharmaceuticals were determined for six homoionic forms of the aluminosilicate clay mineral, montmorillonite. Regular trends in compound sorption coefficients across the clays were consistent with competition according to the inorganic cation selectivity sequence. Such regular changes in competition suggested that a probe compound, such as phenyltrimethylammonium, could capture soil-to-soil variations in inorganic cations for the prediction of organic cation sorption to soils and soil minerals. Structure-affinity relationships from a literature model allowed for extrapolation of phenyltrimethylammonium Kd values for soils to those of different compound structures. The use of a probe compounds is only valid if organic cations interact with all sites on clay minerals in the manner. However, charge sites on clay minerals vary in hydration and the area over which the charge is spread. To understand the how differences in clay site structure influence sorption, a number of specific structural moieties were investigated from the base structure of benzylamine. The ordered hydration and increased charge focus of sites within a clay interlayer caused for large differences in the sorption coefficients of organic cations with polar moieties. These interactions where exemplified by deviations in quantitative trends in sorption coefficients of complex cationic pharmaceuticals, making organic cation sorption to clay minerals a function of hydration and charge focus...|$|R

CST exhibits high selectivity for the ion exchange of cesium from highly alkaline solutions containing large quantities of sodium. Through the Tanks Focus Area (TFA), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was funded to demonstrate the effectiveness of CST as an ion exchange material using supernate from the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVST). After processing the supernate through columns containing CST, the CST will be sluiced into drums and dewatered. Some of the CST will be shipped to the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) to demonstrate vitrification of the cesium-loaded CST in the shielded cells facility of SRTC. Vitrification is considered to be the Best Demonstrated Available Technology for immobilization of high-level waste and is currently being investigated for the treatment of low-level/mixed wastes. Vitrification of cesium-loaded CST offers a number of benefits. Vitrification: (1) is less expensive than many of the technologies available; (2) offers a large volume reduction; (3) produces a waste form that is very durable; (4) is an established technology; (5) can be used {{for a wide variety of}} waste streams; and (6) produces a waste form that is resistant to radiation damage. Prior to a full-scale demonstration, a glass formulation that will produce a glass that is both processable and durable must be developed. Crucible studies using unloaded CST and reagent grade glass-forming chemicals (or frit) were performed. Initially, scoping studies were performed to determine the chemicals necessary to form a glass.

The data described in this report can be applied for developing and evaluating ion exchange pre-treatment process flowsheets. Cesium and strontium batch distribution ratios (K{sub d}`s), decontamination factors (DF), and material loadings (mmol g{sup - 1 }) are compared {{as a function of}} ion exchange material and initial cesium concentration. The actual and simulated N-Basin waters contain relatively low levels of aluminum, barium, calcium, potassium, and magnesium (ranging from 8. 33 E- 04 to 6. 40 E- 05 M), with slightly higher levels of boron (6. 63 E- 03 M) and sodium (1. 62 E- 03 M). The {sup 137 }Cs level is 1. 74 E- 06 Ci L-{sup 1 } which corresponds to approximately 4. 87 E- 10 M Cs. The initial Na/Cs ratio was 3. 33 E+ 06. The concentration of total strontium is 4. 45 E- 06 M, while the {sup 90 }Sr radioactive component was measured to be 6. 13 E- 06 Ci L{sup - 1 }. Simulant tests were conducted by contacting 0. 067 g or each ion exchange material with approximately 100 mL of either the actual or simulated N-Basin water.

40|$|Presence {{of heavy}} metals in the {{environment}} is a worldwide known contamination problem. Depending on their chemistries and level of contamination, these heavy metals can have severe effects on the ecosystem, aquatic life and eventually humans. Researchers have been particularly interested in finding methods {{for the removal of}} these pollutants from the environment. Several methods have been proposed and some have been used with some degree of success. Methods used for trace metal removal include, chemical precipitation, chemical reduction, solvent extraction, micellar ultrafiltration, organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchange,</b> adsorption processes, etc. However, the matrix in which these heavy metals are present in is sometimes very complex and some of these heavy metals are present {{in the environment}} at very low concentrations, say ppb levels. However, they can have adverse effects even at such low-level concentrations. The above-mentioned methods usually suffer from the effects of the matrix and by-products produced after treatment such as sludge in the case of precipitation. Hence, in this study molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were used. MIPs are highly cross-linked polymers prepared with the presence of template molecule. Once the template has been removed it leaves behind a cavity that can only fit the template, hence MIPs are very selective for the template molecule. Metals of interest in this study were uranium (VI) and chromium (VI). Therefore, two separate imprinted polymers were prepared using chromium and uranium as template molecules for selective extraction of these oxy-ions from aqueous samples. Beside removal of heavy metals, the study also focussed on developing MIPs for selective recovery of high value compounds from plant materials (onion and Moringa oleifera). Three separate imprinted polymers using chromium, uranium or quercetin templates were prepared by bulk polymerization method. Functional monomers used were 4 -vinylpyridine; 1 -(prop- 2 -en- 1 -yl) - 4 -(pyridin- 2 -ylmethyl) piperazine (PPMP) and methacrylic acid; and 4 -vinylpyridine for chromium, uranium and quercetin imprinted polymers, respectively. For all imprinted polymers, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) and 1, 1 ‘-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (ACCN) were used as the cross-linking monomer and initiator, respectively. Control polymers (CP) or non-imprinted polymers (NIP) for each imprinted polymer were prepared and treated exactly the same as imprinted polymers but with omission of respective templates. Following removal of respective templates with appropriate solutions, various parameters that affect selective adsorption such as solution pH, initial concentration, aqueous phase volume, sorbent dosage, contact time, breakthrough volumes etc., were optimized to get optimal adsorption of the imprinted polymers. Optimal parameters for Cr (VI) adsorption were as follows: solution pH, 3; contact time, 120 min; eluent, 20 mL of 0. 1 M NaOH; and sorbent amount, 125 mg. Maximum retention capacity of IIP and CP was 37. 58 and 25. 44 mg g- 1, respectively. The observed selectivity order was as follows, Cr (VI) > SO 4 2 - > F- > PO 4 3 - > NO 2 - > NO 3 - > Cl-. However, in the presence of high concentrations of sulphate ions, the selectivity on the CP completely collapsed. For uranium VI removal, the optimal pH was 4. 0 - 8. 0, sorbent amount was 20 mg, contact time was 20 min and the retention capacity was 120 mg of uranyl ion per g of IIP. The selectivity order observed was as follows, UO 2 2 + > Fe 3 + >> Cu 2 + > Co 2 + > Mn 2 + > Zn 2 + Ni 2 +. The binding capacity of quercetin MIPs was investigated at 25 and 84 °C, respectively, in batch mode. The slopes for the effect of extraction time revealed that the mass transfer of the analytes was higher at 84 °C than at 25 °C. Also, the binding capacity for the most promising MIP and its corresponding NIP increased at 84 °C but the MIP had higher binding capacity. The increase in binding capacity for the MIP was from 30 μmol g- 1 at 25 °C to 120 μmol g- 1 at 84 °C. For the corresponding NIP, the binding capacity values were 15 and 90 μmol g- 1, at 25 and 84 °C, respectively. A demonstration of MIP selectivity at higher temperature using standard solutions of selected flavonols showed that the MIP still retained its selectivity for quercetin. Similar selectivity was observed when preliminary application studies on aqueous yellow onion extracts were investigated. The study clearly demonstrated the suitability of the developed imprinted polymers (for chromium, uranium and quercetin) for selective adsorption of Cr (VI), UO 2 2 + and quercetin from their respective complex matrices. Breakthrough volume of molecular imprinted polymer solid-phase extraction (MISPE) was investigated using a mixture of myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol. The breakthrough volumes for quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin were 22, 27 and 8 mL, respectively. The number of theoretical plates (N) for the MISPE column corresponding to these volumes were 18, 47 and 4 for quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin, respectively. Using these results, selectivity of MIP and its retention capacity was evaluated. The extractions of Moringa leaves and flowers were carried out using a MISPE cartridge and various solvents were investigated for the selective elution of quercetin from the MIP sorbents. For identification and quantification of quercetin and other flavonols, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used. Recoveries of quercetin from different Moringa extracts ranged from 87 – 92...|$|E

Other inorganic adsorbent were also investigated e. g. mixtures of NaF with other metal fluorides and an aluminophosphate molecular sieve. It was noted that most of the calcium salts do have a capacity for HF, but can release their anions as impurities in the gas streams. However, the other inorganic adsorbents, including CaF 2 did not have an HF adsorbtion capacity. Secondly polymeric resins were assessed for HF removal in non-fluorine environments, in particular, a perfluorinated resin, a polyacrylate and a series of commercial <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins. Most of the polymeric material did have a HF capacity, however the weak base acrylic resins has the best capacity and kinetics for the removal of HF from organic streams.

Organic <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins have been developed over a much longer period of time than the selective <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchangers that have recently become available in commercial quantities and can now meet the demands of the nuclear industry. The organic <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins are very effective at transferring the radioactive content of a large volume of liquid into a small volume of solid and have proved to be reliable and effective for the control of both the chemistry and radiochemistry of water coolant systems at nuclear power plants and also for processing some liquid radioactive waste (Samanta et al. [1992]; Samanta et al. [1993]; Samanta et al. [1995]; Kulkarni et al. [1996]; Bray et al. [1990]). In a number of cases, for specific physical and chemical reasons, organic resins cannot be replaced by commercially available <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchangers. Also, organic <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins are used globally (Tomoi et al. [1997]; Zhu et al. [2009]; Kumaresan et al. [2006]). The selection of an appropriate <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> material for treatment of liquid waste is possible on the basis of information provided by the manufacturer. However, since the selection of the appropriate ion-exchange material depends on the needs of the system, it is expected that the data obtained from the actual experimental trials will prove to be more helpful in the characterization and subsequent selection of the resins.|$|R

40|$|Zirconium {{phosphate}} (ZrP) is synthesized and {{characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) {{as well as}} pH titration experiments. A distribution coefficient (K d) at different trace elements for pH value of 4 and at different pH was calculated experimentally. Also the K d of strontium at different shaking times was calculated. Stability of <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchanger at different pH was investigated too. The results show that ZrP is almost stability in acid medium, especially with the lower molarity. Also titration shows a that it has high ability of displacement of ions previously attached and loosely incorporated into its structure by oppositely charged ions present in the surrounding solution. In pH value of 4, ZrP is an useful <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchanger and shows a high affinity for some elements such as Cs and Sr. The degree of ionization of ZrP depends on acid strength of solution. So when the pH drops, the capacity and K d values fall off. In conclusion ZrP ion exchanger {{was found to have}} very good <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity and high distribution coefficient for some elements. Also ZrP is a good <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchanger for separation of strontium from other elements...|$|R

A fluorinated monomer (EDOT-F 8) {{is used to}} reach superhydrophobic properties and a monomer containing an ammonium function (EDOT-N+) to induce changes in the surface wettability by <b>ion</b> <b>exchange.</b> We also study {{the change in the}} surface wettability by dedoping at a different voltage. Surprisingly, an increase in the water and oil repellency was observed by introduction of hydrophilic monomers (EDOT-N+), which is due to a modification in the surface morphology and more precisely to the presence of small spherical particles containing thin fibrils on their surface (multi-scale roughness). The dedoping and the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> (ClO 4 - by BF 4 -, Tf 2 N- or C 8 F 17 SO 3 -) modify especially the oil-repellency. Here, the highest oleophobic properties are obtained with the <b>inorganic</b> <b>ions</b> (ClO 4 - and BF 4 -) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Variety of soil {{reactions}} {{govern the}} distribution of metal micronutrients that includes complexation with organic and <b>inorganic</b> ligands, <b>ion</b> <b>exchange,</b> adsorption and desorption processes, precipitation and dissolution of solids and acid-based equilibria. The relative importance of these reactions depends on many factors such as soil physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties {{and the nature of}} metal ions. Environmental factors such as climate, physiographic position, and soil development may affect variability of some soil properties and thereby nutrient availability. The present research was conducted to find relationships between Iron, manganese, zinc, and copper availability and some major soil properties, physiographic condition and soil development. Materials and Methods: Golpayegan region is located in northwest of Isfahan province in central Iran. The mean elevation of the studied area is 1790 above sea level. Annual precipitation was about 244 mm and mean monthly temperature ranges from - 6 in January to 34 °C in August. The soils were developed on different physiographic conditions including piedmont plains, alluvial-fan, plateaus, and flood plains belonging to Entisols and Aridisols. Soil samples (0 – 60 cm) were collected from 98 grid points with 2000 m distance in the agricultural area of Golpayegan. Particle size distribution, calcium carbonate, organic carbon, available potassium and phosphorus of the soils were measured by SWRI standard methods. Available Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe were determined by addition of 10 g soil to 20 mL 0. 005 M diethylentriaminepentacetic‏. The solutions were shaken for 2 h at 25 °C, centrifuged, filtered, and Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu concentrations were measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

40|$|D. Sc. The <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> {{properties}} {{of a number}} of synthetic <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchangers and the natural zeolite, clinoptilolite, were evaluated with respect to the elements Na, Cs, Sr, Ba, Ce(III), Eu, Zr, U(VI), Np(V), PU(IV) and Am(III). The role of the structure of crystalline exchangers in determining the selectivity thereof, {{especially in the case of}} clinoptilolite, was also investigated. Hydrated antimony pentoxide and antimonic acid showed high sorption {{of a number of}} ions over a wide pH range (2 - 10). The selectivity order of hydrous oxides for the actinides was as follows: PU(IV) > Am(III) > U(VI) > Np(V). Titanium phosphate, zirconium phosphosilicate and sodium titanate, however, preferred U to Am. To predict the selectivity order of crystalline <b>inorganic</b> <b>ion</b> exchangers, the Eisenman theory could be used, but other factors such as ion sieve effects had to be taken into account. In such cases the parameters contributing to the change in free energy during <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> plays a major role. Samples containing clinootilolite from two deposits in South Africa were evaluated with respect to chemical composition, conversion to the sodium, calcium and cesium forms, as well as the sorption of Cs and Sr from various media. Similar trends to those:reported for clinoptilolite from other parts of the world were found. Rietveld refinement of the structure of Cs-exchanged clinoptilolite was carried out using powder diffraction data and the computer program WYRIET. The zeolite was not isolated from the natural matrix, which meant that a number of phases had to be included in the refinement process. The refinement confirmed the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} the {{capacitive}} deionization (CDI) of water {{with a stack of}} carbon aerogel electrodes has been developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Unlike <b>ion</b> <b>exchange,</b> one of the more conventional deionization processes, no chemicals are required for regeneration of the system. Electricity is used instead. Water with various anions and cations is pumped through the electrochemical cell. After polarization, ions are electrostatically removed from the water and held in the electric double layers formed at the surfaces of electrodes. The water leaving the cell is purified, as desired. The effects of cell voltage on the electrosorption capacities for Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }, Na{sub 3 }PO{sub 4 }, and Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } have been investigated and are reported here. Results for NaCl and NaNO{sub 3 } have been reported previously. Possible applications for CDI are as a replacement for <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> processes which remove heavy metals and radioisotopes from process and waste water in various industries, as well as to remove <b>inorganic</b> <b>ions</b> from feedwater for fossil and nuclear power plants...|$|R
40|$|Presently, the Hanford Site {{contains}} approximately 230, 000 m{sup 3 } {{of mixed}} waste stored in 177 underground tanks. Approximately 55, 000 m{sup 3 } of this waste is sludge, 90, 000 m{sup 3 } is salt cake, and 80, 000 m{sup 3 } is supernate. Although the pretreatment and final disposal {{requirements for the}} waste have not been entirely defined, {{it is likely that}} some supernatant pretreatment will be required to remove {sup 137 }Cs and possibly {sup 90 }Sr and the transuranic components.
