25|$|Israeli forces, {{commanded}} by General Moshe Dayan, attacked Egypt on 29 October 1956. On 30 October Britain and France made their pre-arranged call {{for both sides}} to stop fighting and withdraw from the Canal area, and {{for them to be}} allowed to take up positions at key points on the Canal. Egypt refused and the allies commenced air strikes on 31 October aimed at neutralizing the Egyptian air force. By 5 November the Israelis had overrun the Sinai. The Anglo-French invasion began that day. There was uproar in the UN, with the United States and USSR <b>for</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> agreement in denouncing the actions of Israel, Britain and France. A demand for a ceasefire was reluctantly accepted on 7 November.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, {{the group}} {{found out that}} [...] "Sad Song" [...] had become their most popular song, despite the song not having a music video nor being {{performed}} live on tour. They noticed that the song had accumulated around 20 million plays on Spotify, which Clark initially presumed to be a mistake. Previously, [...] "Check Yes Juliet" [...] was the group's most popular song, selling 2,000 copies per week. [...] "Sad Song", however, was selling 3,000 copies per week. Clark called it [...] "so strange. [...] I just remember finding out that it happened and just being so blown away that <b>for</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> our career, we let our fans choose, kind of accidentally, which song {{we were going to}} go with." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend and {{landlord}} Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: [...] "Now <b>for</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be [...] "the most ungrateful creature". He was said to have describe Wolfgang as [...] "The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg". Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: [...] "Too soon, [...] father dragged [...] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child..." [...] However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eliezer {{interpreted}} the conjugal duty of [...] to require relations: for men of independence, every day; for laborers, twice a week; <b>for</b> donkey-drivers, <b>once</b> a week; <b>for</b> camel-drivers, <b>once</b> <b>in</b> 30 days; <b>for</b> sailors, <b>once</b> <b>in</b> six months.|$|R

500|$|Other federal {{action on}} behalf of blacks was equally ineffective: when the Supreme Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), Arthur {{expressed}} his disagreement with the decision in a message to Congress, {{but was unable to}} persuade Congress to pass any new legislation in its place. Arthur did, however, effectively intervene to overturn a court-martial ruling against a black West Point cadet, Johnson Whittaker, after the Judge Advocate General of the Army, David G. Swaim, found the prosecution's case against Whittaker to be illegal and based on racial bias. The administration faced a different challenge in the West, where the LDS Church was under government pressure to stop the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory. [...] Garfield had believed polygamy was criminal behavior and was morally detrimental to family values, and Arthur's views were, <b>for</b> <b>once,</b> <b>in</b> line with his predecessor's. [...] In 1882, he signed the Edmunds Act into law; the legislation made polygamy a federal crime, barring polygamists both from public office and the right to vote.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{nearly a}} year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California, Downey, on condition of posting $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (spawned from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release. A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal, playing the new love interest of Calista Flockhart's title character. His performance was praised and the following year he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category and won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a mini-series or television film. He also appeared {{as a writer and}} singer on Vonda Shepard's Ally McBeal: <b>For</b> <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> My Life album, and he sang with Sting a duet of [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] in an episode of the series. Despite the apparent success, Downey claims that his performance on the series was overrated and said, [...] "It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give a fuck whether I ever acted again." [...] In January 2001, Downey was scheduled {{to play the role of}} Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson.|$|E

[...] In the competition, she was even likened to her inspiration, Lauryn Hill, {{one of the most}} influential women in hip-hopa comparison that nearly brought Velasco to tears. [...] In the Top 12 finals, however, she sang Son of a Preacher Man, Desperado, <b>For</b> <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> My Life, and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in her own personal style, without consciously applying a particular genre to her performances.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to Gordy's instincts, [...] "For Once in My Life" [...] was {{a highly}} {{successful}} record, peaking at number-two on both the Billboard Pop Singles and Billboard R Singles (it was held off from the number-one spot on each chart by another Motown single Gordy had originally vetoed, Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine"). [...] "For Once in My Life", issued by Tamla with [...] "Angie Girl" [...] as its B-side, was later included as the title track on Wonder's <b>For</b> <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> My Life album.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1967, Tony Bennett's {{recording}} of the song peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart (number 8 on the Easy Listening survey) and was the title track of his album <b>For</b> <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> My Life. [...] "For Once in My Life" [...] remained in Bennett's concert repertoire into the 2000s. In 2006 Bennett teamed up with Stevie Wonder to record a ballad tempo version for his [...] album, for which Bennett and Wonder received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Bennett also performed it on the grand finale of the sixth season of American Idol and in the Grammy Award-sponsored tribute Stevie Wonder: Songs in the Key of Life – An All-Star Salute, which aired February 16, 2015, on CBS.|$|E
2500|$|Guiteau became {{something}} of a media sensation during his entire trial for his bizarre behavior, which included him frequently cursing and insulting the judge, most of the witnesses, the prosecution, and even his defense team, as well as formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He dictated an autobiography to the New York Herald, ending it with a personal ad for [...] "a nice Christian lady under 30 years of age". He was oblivious to the American public's hatred of him, even after he was almost assassinated twice himself. He frequently smiled and waved at spectators and reporters {{in and out of}} the courtroom, seemingly happy to be the center of attention <b>for</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> his life.|$|E

2500|$|... "Just imagine Mayor Emanuel had {{released}} the video in, say, November —without {{being forced to}} by a lawsuit.... But of course, he didn't do the right thing. He buried the video. He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, <b>for</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Refusing {{to believe}} that the play is real in the wake of this discovery, Arthur tries to get Random House to call off the project, but they refuse: {{forensic}} and historical evidence has all but confirmed the play's veracity, and they claim that the ambiguous [...] "clues" [...] on this index card prove nothing against the word of numerous Shakespeare experts. He continues to argue with his publishers and Dana – who insists that the play is real – and is ultimately threatened with breach of contract if he stands {{in the way of the}} play's publication. Ultimately, Dana (having found out about Petra's affair with Arthur) confronts him and demands that he allow the play to be published, and instructs him to write an Introduction – [...] "the truth… <b>for</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> [...] life" [...] – and [...] "be judged for what [...] did." ...|$|E
