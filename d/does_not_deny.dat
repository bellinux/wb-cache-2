5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|However, Dot causes {{trouble for}} certain {{residents}} too, although not intentionally. She {{is responsible for}} the break-up of Saeed Jeffery's (Andrew Johnson) marriage to Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). Due to the lack of lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting prostitutes. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> it so she leaves him.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny.</b> They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E

25|$|In September 2016, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of the Diocese of Phoenix {{issued the}} fourth {{edition of his}} guide, Catholics in the Public Square. In it, he {{suggested}} to politicians supporting abortion that {{they would need to}} repent and go to Confession before receiving Holy Communion, dissenting from most other bishops including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Cardinal Donald Wuerl who said the Church <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> communion over issues of legislation.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> being a Sophist, {{and claims}} {{that it is an}} ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used the arts as a screen, a front, to protect {{themselves}} from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus would not want to miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him from his bed (317c–e). According to Francis Bacon, Prodicus is led to produce a speech in the dialogue (337a), which seems to Bacon as humiliating for him.|$|E
25|$|Adherents of {{different}} religions generally disagree {{as to how}} to best worship God and what is God's plan for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement.|$|E

25|$|NCIS Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) {{agrees to}} a request from Eli and brings the {{involved}} parties to Israel. Eli interrogates Tony and accuses him of killing Rivkin out of jealously, a motivation that Michael Weatherly voiced to have been plausible. Tony, in turn, accuses him of ordering Rivkin to seduce Ziva {{in order to keep}} an eye on her, which he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny.</b> Under pressure from her father, Ziva stays in Israel and returns to the Mossad as a full-time operative, taking Rivkin's place on a mission to assassinate Saleem Ulman (Omid Abtahi), the leader of a terrorist training camp in Somalia which also sees her leaving NCIS as well and seeing the Major Case Response Team being reduced to three active members: Gibbs, DiNozzo and McGee. Gibbs confronts Vance about the turn of events, insisting that he still trusts Ziva because of her choice to save him by killing her brother four years earlier. In response, Vance claims that she had only done so because her father had ordered to. The final moments of the episode show her to have been taken hostage and tortured by Saleem.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} Owen's poem {{is part of}} a line from the Roman poet Horace [...] ("It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country"). [...] The phrase was inscribed over the chapel door at Sandhurst, the British {{military}} academy, in 1913. [...] The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes [...] "Dulce— No— Decorum— No— Pro patria mori." [...] The writer Will Heaven said that, whilst the poem denies that death in war is [...] "sweet and proper" [...] (dulce et decorum), it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> that the soldiers died for their country (pro patria mori).|$|E

He has {{said that this is}} the song people most often sing to him when they spot him on the street. In the book and film adaptation of American Psycho, the main character (Patrick Bateman) briefly discusses it, amongst other work by Collins. The synthesizer riff was heavily criticised for sounding too much like Prince's 1982 song [...] "1999", a similarity that Collins <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny,</b> citing that he is a big fan of Prince's work.|$|E

500|$|Love <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> expressing {{reservations}} {{with the}} lyrics of Pet Sounds and Smile, but believes that the [...] "formula" [...] quote crystallizes a reductive [...] "morality tale" [...] that positions Wilson as [...] "the tormented genius who was undone by his own family", a theme which appears throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers". During the 1960s, [...] "The Beach Boys" [...] and [...] "Brian Wilson" [...] were synonymous entities, and Wilson was expected to fulfill the band's commercial interests. When he explored creative avenues that contrasted the Beach Boys' signature conventions, it was negatively received by fans and critics who wished that Wilson {{would return to the}} group's early style. This prevailing attitude changed after the 1970s, as rock music journalists started valuing the band's experimental work over their early records.|$|E
500|$|In side plots, Nina has {{recovered}} different translations of the tomes about the First People, including one from William Bell's personal safe, and realizes {{that they all}} {{say the same thing}} in different languages. She identifies the name of the author of each book as an anagram of the name [...] "Sam Weiss", the bowling alley owner who she had directed Olivia to after her initial return from the parallel universe. She approaches Sam, who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> he wrote the books, and who explains that the doomsday device being constructed can either create or destroy a universe; how that will work will depend on Peter, who is biologically tuned to the device. Sam posits that Peter will most likely save the universe from which the Olivia he loves originates. The episode ends with Olivia reading the note from Simon, which states that Peter still has feelings for Fauxlivia.|$|E
500|$|Like other American {{films of}} 1999—such as Fight Club, Bringing Out the Dead, and Magnolia, American Beauty instructs its {{audience}} to [...] " [...] more meaningful lives".

Jim and Jim, the Burnhams' other neighbors, are a satire of [...] "gay bourgeois coupledom", who [...] " [...] in the numbing sameness" [...] that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples. The feminist academic and author Sally R. Munt argues that American Beauty uses its [...] "art house" [...] trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a [...] "cliché of bourgeois preoccupation; the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Morran of Consumerist said Philip Morris did a [...] "really {{poor job}} of trying to defend its actions". He wrote, [...] "... this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic {{non-response}} in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth." [...] He noted that Philip Morris <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: [...] " [...] {{to be taken seriously}} when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'". Furthermore, Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it [...] " [...] and [...] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: ... the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle — or realizes a battle can't be won — then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.|$|E
500|$|Griffin has {{frequently}} expressed views on Judaism, Islam and homosexuality. His {{comments on the}} Holocaust (which he once referred to as [...] "the Holohoax") made as an editor of The Rune demonstrate revisionism. He criticised Holocaust denier David Irving for admitting that up to four million Jews might {{have died in the}} Holocaust; he wrote [...] "True Revisionists will not be fooled by this new twist to the sorry tale of The Hoax of the Twentieth Century." [...] In 1997, he told an undercover journalist that he had updated Richard Verrall's booklet Did Six Million Really Die? and, in the same year, he wrote Who are the Mindbenders?, about a perceived domination of the media by Jewish figures. [...] Despite this, the BNP had a Jewish councillor, Patricia Richardson, and spokesman Phil Edwards has stated that the party also has Jewish members. The BNP has stated that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> the Holocaust, and that [...] "Dredging up quotes from 10, 15, 20 years ago is really pathetic and, in a sense, rather fascist." [...] In an interview with the BNP deputy leader Simon Darby, Griffin claimed that the English Defence League was a [...] "Zionist false flag operation", and added that the organisation is [...] "a neo-con operation". He also claimed that the EDL's activities are an attempt to provoke civil war.|$|E
