40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} based on the {{researches}} carried out in a former bauxite quarry from Zece Hotare, Bihor County. The bauxite exploitation ended in 1998 and in 2004 complex works took place in order to set up experiments. In 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 determinations were made as to what concerns the settling of <b>herbs</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The three soil profiles located in the levelled area and the slope area were compared to the profile of the soil from the limitrophe beech tree (Fagus silvatica) forest. In the profiles from the former bauxite quarry, the colloidal clay content increased significantly compared to the soil from the limitrophe beech tree (Fagus silvatica) forest. The bulk density, the total porosity and the hydraulic conductivity had lower favourable values and the pH values were lower. The humus content was determined only on a 0 – 30 cm depth and on a 0 – 17 cm in soil profile from the hillside. Phosphorous and potassium had low values. The enzymatical activity- the actual dehydrogenase activity, the acid phosphatase activity, the catalase activity, the urease activity – was reduced in the soil profiles from the former bauxite quarry than in the beech tree (Fagus silvatica) forest. The process of vegetation settlement (Robinia pseudocaccia) was severely influenced by fertilization, and the <b>herbs</b> <b>vegetation</b> was influenced by its location in the quarry, the number plants grew from one year to another. Thus we can strongly affirm that the reconstruction process is underway...|$|R

Many of these species, most notably the large Azorella compacta (Yareta) has been heavily harvested for fuel and medicinal use.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the vegetation and discusses the prevailing ecological factors of a savanna region near Jodensavanne, Suriname; savanna being defined {{in this context}} as a landscape with low and often open woody vegetation, relieved by tracts with a thin to dense cover of herbs. The methodology of the French-Swiss school of phytosociologists appeared appropriate for semi-quantitative description of the vegetation but, because of the limited scope of the study, it was considered premature to apply the synsystematic rules of this school, so the established units are called “major vegetation types”, with “variants”, “subvariants” and “facies” as subunits. Three major vegetation types of scrub and five of <b>herb</b> <b>vegetation</b> are described in detail and some {{attention has been given}} to the surrounding woods and forests. Except for small fringe areas, the savanna is limited to rather coarse white-sandy soils, the characteristics and genesis of which are discussed. It is demonstrated that the hardpan which occurs in places is a paleopedogenelic feature and that this hardpan does not influence the presentday drainage conditions, for the drainage pattern could be explained on the basis of topography alone. The drainage condition {{which is one of the}} more important edaphic factors affecting the vegetation, allows a division of the vegetation types into two groups, one representing the “dry savanna” and the other the “wet savanna”. On the wet savanna much of the differentiation in the <b>herb</b> <b>vegetation</b> is produced by water flowing over the soil.

It is argued that crypsis of all the age stages was more necessary in riparian stands, as this habitat is more risky for the species owing to a high ground vegetation surrounding a foraging bird. Poorer crypsis of Blackbird plumage in pale-litter habitats may be a neutral feature, being compensated by easier scanning of the surroundings over the lower and sparcer <b>herb</b> <b>vegetation</b> and by a tendency to remain in dark sites.

Fortyone 10 x 10 m plots were established under the closed canopy (18 plots), small and medium canopy gaps (11) and large canopy gaps dominated by Guadua tagoara (Ness) Kunth (12). Inside each plot, the line intercept method was applied to assess soil coverage as an estimate of density of <b>herb</b> stratum <b>vegetation.</b> Hemispherical photographs were taken at the centre of the plots to evaluate the annual light regime. Overall, Calathea communis Wanderley and S.

There were strong correlations among several groups of the herb stratum, such as the negative correlations between woody seedlings with the coverage of C. communis and with rocks. The analysis of the hemispherical photographs confirmed the difference among environments that led to significant differences in the soil coverage of the <b>herb</b> stratum <b>vegetation</b> but woody seedlings. For instance, C. communis showed great coverage in large gaps while ferns were more abundant in small and medium gaps and in the understorey.

30|$|Nitrogen {{fertilization}} {{has been}} shown to decrease the biomass of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Bahr et al. 2013), which may {{have an effect on the}} nutrient intake of trees. Fertilization also affects the species composition of forest floor so that the abundance of herbs and grasses increases at the cost of dwarf-shrubs (Hedwall et al. 2014). The growth of grass and <b>herb</b> <b>vegetation</b> may decrease the crops of wild berries (Issakainen and Moilanen 1998) and fertilization may also decrease mushroom yields (Ohenoja 1994). Leakage may also be a problem, especially if high amounts of N are used (Insam and Palojärvi 1995; Ring 1995; Gundersen et al. 2006). Leaching can be minimized by proper timing of the fertilizer application (season of the year) and by using fertilizer types that are not prone to leaching (Saarsalmi and Mälkönen 2001). In addition, it may be expected that leaching is minimized when the ability of trees to use the nutrients is good and the N dose is not too large.|$|E
