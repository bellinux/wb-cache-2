Conservatism exists due to factors of safety that are incorporated into any hard-landing analysis process to account for uncertainty in the measurement of certain flight parameters. The flight parameter sensor simulation model consists of 1) an aircraft and landing gear dynamic model to determine the “actual” landing <b>gear</b> <b>loads</b> during a hard landing; 2) an aircraft sensor and data acquisition model to represent the aircraft sensors and flight data recorder systems to investigate the effect of signal processing on the flight parameters; and 3) an automated hard-landing analysis process, representative of that used by airframe and equipment manufacturers, to determine the “simulated” landing <b>gear</b> <b>loads.</b> Using a technique of Bayesian sensitivity analysis, a number of flight parameters are varied in the flight parameter sensor simulation model to {{gain an understanding of}} the sensitivity of the difference between actual and simulated loads to the individual flight parameters in symmetric and asymmetric two-point landings.

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{contributes}} {{to the analysis of}} the interactions between gears, shafts and hydrodynamic journal bearings in geared drives. In contrast to the majority of the models in the literature, the time-varying properties and nonlinearities of gears and bearings are introduced in the simulations. A finite element model is used for the shafts, and a specific gear element is used to account for nonlinear time-varying mesh stiffness as well as tooth shape deviations. The nonlinear hydrodynamic forces are computed with the Reynolds equation for finite-length journal bearings. An iterative Newmark scheme is used to solve simultaneously the motion equations for the shafts, the contact problem for the gears, and the fluid forces in the bearings. The resulting algorithm is applied to a single stage geared system with two shafts, four bearings, a pinion and a gear. Gear-bearing dynamic interactions are demonstrated through the analysis of dynamic <b>gear</b> <b>loads,</b> dynamic bearing loads and bearing displacements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory tests that {{were aimed at}} detecting early stages of various faults in toothed wheels by measurement and analysis of transverse vibration speed of the transmission gear shafts. In experimental investigation, cracking of the root tooth and chipping of the tooth were detected. The laser vibrometer Ometron VH 300 + was used for non-contact measurement of shaft transversal vibration speed. Gear vibrations were recorded in selected points of gear housing and gear shafts at different speeds and <b>gear</b> <b>loads.</b> Results were analyzed and compared but in this paper is presented only selected examples.

40|$|One major task of an {{aircraft}} landing gear is the absorption of vertical energy which will mostly result either from the landing impact of from overrunning bumps and other ground irregularities. The necessity to limit the applied landing <b>gear</b> <b>loads</b> at the high stroke velocities at touch-down leads to damping characteristics which provide only lillte damping action at less vehement movements. Aircraft with high fuselage flexibility are therefore prone to vibration and resonance phenomena. The vonventional approach of developing the landing gear separetely from the airframe with only simple models to represent the aircraft ground dynamic properties seems no longer appropriate.

40|$|Gears are {{important}} mechanical components for power transmissions. Tooth wear {{is one of}} the most common failure modes, which can present throughout a gear’s lifetime. It is significant to accurately monitor gear wear progression in order to take timely predictive maintenances. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is an effective and non-intrusive approach which is able to monitor faults from both electrical and mechanical systems. However, little research has been reported in monitoring the gear wear and estimating its severity based on MCSA. This paper presents a novel gear wear monitoring method through a modulation signal bispectrum based motor current signal analysis (MSB-MCSA). For a steady gear transmission, it is inevitable to exist load and speed oscillations due to various errors including wears. These oscillations can induce small modulations in the current signals of the driving motor. MSB is particularly effective in characterising such small modulation signals. Based on these understandings, the monitoring process was implemented based on the current signals from a run-to-failure test of an industrial two stages helical gearbox under a moderate accelerated fatigue process. At the initial operation of the test, MSB analysis results showed that the peak values at the bifrequencies of gear rotations and the power supply can be effective monitoring features for identifying faulty gears and wear severity as they exhibit agreeable changes with <b>gear</b> <b>loads.</b> A monotonically increasing trend established by these features allows a clear indication of the gear wear progression. The dismantle inspection at 477 hours of operation, made when one of the monitored features is about 123 % higher than its baseline, has found that there are severe scuffing wear marks on a number of tooth surfaces on the driving gear, showing that the gear endures a gradual wear process during its long test operation. Therefore, it is affirmed that the MSB-MSCA approach proposed is reliable and accurate for monitoring gear wear deterioration...|$|E

40|$|The Active Gear, Flexible Aircraft Takeoff and Landing Analysis program, AGFATL, was {{developed}} to provide a complete simulation of the aircraft takeoff and landing dynamics problem. AGFATL can represent an airplane either as a rigid body with {{six degrees of freedom}} or as a flexible body with multiple degrees of freedom. The airframe flexibility is represented by the superposition of up to twenty free vibration modes on the rigid-body motions. The analysis includes maneuver logic and autopilots programmed to control the aircraft during glide slope, flare, landing, and takeoff. The program is modular so that performance of the aircraft in flight and during landing and ground maneuvers can be studied separately or in combination. A program restart capability is included in AGFATL. Effects simulated in the AGFATL program include: (1) flexible aircraft control and performance during glide slope, flare, landing roll, and takeoff roll under conditions of changing winds, engine failures, brake failures, control system failures, strut failures, restrictions due to runway length, and control variable limits and time lags; (2) landing <b>gear</b> <b>loads</b> and dynamics for up to five gears; (3) single and multiple engines (maximum of four) including selective engine reversing and failure; (4) drag chute and spoiler effects; (5) wheel braking (including skid-control) and selective brake failure; (6) aerodynamic ground effects; (7) aircraft carrier operations; (8) inclined runways and runway perturbations; (9) flexible or rigid airframes; 10) rudder and nose gear steering; and 11) actively controlled landing gear shock struts. Input to the AGFATL program includes data which describe runway roughness; vehicle geometry, flexibility and aerodynamic characteristics; landing gear(s); propulsion; and initial conditions such as attitude, attitude change rates, and velocities. AGFATL performs a time integration of the equations of motion and outputs comprehensive information on the airframe, state-of-maneuver logic, autopilots, control response, and aircraft loads from impact, runway roll-out, and ground operations. Flexible-body and total (elastic plus rigid-body) displacements, velocities, and accelerations are also output in the flexible-body option for up to twenty points on the aircraft.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} for NASA Glenn Research Center under contract NNC 10 BA 05 B, Task NNC 11 TA 80 T to identify beneficial arrangements of the turboshaft engine, transmissions and related systems within the propulsion pod nacelle of NASA's Large Civil Tilt-Rotor 2 nd iteration (LCTR 2) vehicle. Propulsion pod layouts were used to investigate potential advantages, disadvantages, as well as constraints of various arrangements assuming front or aft shafted engines. Results from previous NASA LCTR 2 propulsion system studies and tasks performed by Boeing under NASA contracts are {{used as the basis}} for this study. This configuration consists of two Fixed Geometry Variable Speed Power Turbine Engines and related drive and rotor systems (per nacelle) arranged in tilting nacelles near the wing tip. Entry-into-service (EIS) 2035 technology is assumed for both the engine and drive systems. The variable speed rotor system changes from 100 percent speed for hover to 54 percent speed for cruise by the means of a two speed gearbox concept developed under previous NASA contracts. Propulsion and drive system configurations that resulted in minimum vehicle gross weight were identified in previous work and used here. Results reported in this study illustrate that a forward shafted engine has a slight weight benefit over an aft shafted engine for the LCTR 2 vehicle. Although the aft shafted engines provide a more controlled and centered CG (between hover and cruise), the length of the long rotor shaft and complicated engine exhaust arrangement outweighed the potential benefits. A Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) approach for transmission sizing was also explored for this study.

Another initial goal was to link information from RomaxDESIGNER (such as hp, rpm, gear ratio) to populate Boeing's parametric weight spreadsheet and create an automated method to estimate drive system weight. This was only partially achieved due to the variety of weight models, number of manual inputs, and qualitative assessments required.

And various kinds of engaged helical gear models with helix slope and form deviation were developed using finite element method software.

The effects of the helix slope deviation, different shape, period, and amplitude of helix form deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress were investigated {{and the results were}} compared to each other as specified by grades 5 and 7. It is found that the single helix slope deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress shows “superposition” effect. Especially, the different shapes, periods, and amplitudes of helix form deviation exhibit significant effect on tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress. Helix form deviation mainly affects the tooth surface load distribution and tooth root bending stress along the tooth longitudinal direction, while has little impact between tooth pairs.
