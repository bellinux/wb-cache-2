The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175miles (280km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E
5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E

5|$|Katrina {{continued}} to track over Central America {{for most of}} October30 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24hours after landfall, the depression moved back over water, in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Honduras; however, by this time, there was no convection remaining around the system. The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward. Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed to regenerate convection before moving back over land near the northern Belize-Mexico border. Around this time, forecasters reported that the depression would re-intensify once in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Although situated over land, the depression began to regenerate convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. By the evening of November1, the depression weakened again and moved into the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later.|$|E

On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som.
