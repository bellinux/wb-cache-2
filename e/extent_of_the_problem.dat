25|$|Bangkok's {{rapid growth}} in the 1980s {{resulted}} in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued—in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles. These increases, {{in the face of}} limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s. The <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is such that the Thai Traffic Police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time. While Bangkok's limited road surface area (8 percent, compared to 20–30 percent in most Western cities) is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams, other factors, including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level, inadequate public transport systems, and lack of transportation demand management, also play a role. Efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways, as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems. The city's overall traffic conditions, however, remain bad.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{modeling and}} optimization of two NP-hard problems in {{flexible manufacturing system}} (FMS), part type selection problem and loading <b>problem.</b> Due to <b>the</b> complexity and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>the</b> paper was split into two parts. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papers has discussed <b>the</b> modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> and showed how the real coded genetic algorithms (RCGA) {{can be applied to}} solve <b>the</b> <b>problems.</b> This second part discusses <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RCGA which uses an array of real numbers as chromosome representation. The novel proposed chromosome representation produces only feasible solutions which minimize a computational time needed by GA to push its population toward feasible search space or repair infeasible chromosomes. The proposed RCGA improves the FMS performance by considering two objectives, maximizing system throughput and maintaining <b>the</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system (minimizing system unbalance). The resulted objective values are compared to the optimum values produced by branch-and-bound method. The experiments show that the proposed RCGA could reach near optimum solutions in a reasonable amount of time.
