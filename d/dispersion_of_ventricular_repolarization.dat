40|$|To {{study the}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> {{following}} double and triple programmed stimulation and its correlation with the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias, monophasic action potentials were simultaneously recorded {{from the right}} ventricular apex and outflow tract during programmed stimulation in 12 patients with ventricular arrhythmias and a normal QT interval. The time difference between {{the ends of the}} two monophasic action potentials were used as a measure of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization,</b> which consists of the activation time difference and the monophasic action potential duration difference. During double and triple programmed stimulation, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> increased significantly with the shortening of the coupling interval but decreased slightly with the shortening of the preceding interval. The induction of the ventricular arrhythmias in these patients was invariably associated with a marked increase in the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization.</b> The maximal <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> was significantly larger in the seven patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular flutter/fibrillation induced than in the four patients with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced. Analysis of the two components of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> revealed that the increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> was mainly caused by an increase in the activation time difference in the monomorphic ventricular tachycardia subgroup, and by increases in both the activation time difference and monophasic action potential duration difference in the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation subgroup.

For this study, magnetocardiography and electrocardiography were compared from automatic measurements of <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization.</b> Methods and results <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> time was determined in MCGs and standard ECGs recorded simultaneously from 27 healthy volunteers and 22 cardiac patients.

40|$|<b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> (DVR) {{is known}} to be an {{immediate}} precursor of potentially mortal arrhythmias.

For this purpose, the Luo-Rudy dynamic (2000) model was used in combination with a monodomain model of the ventricular tissue to simulate the electrical activity of a ventricular strand. The results of the simulations show that the duration of the T-wave increases almost linearly with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization,</b> independently of the cause of the increased DRV.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} the effects of acute global ischemia on the vulnerable window, the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold. Background. Myocardial ischemia, an important factor for arrhythmogenesis and sudden death, may affect the inducibility <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation by T wave shocks {{as well as the}} defibrillation threshold. However, studies of the effect of ischemia on the defibrillation threshold remain inconclusive, and the effect of ischemia on recently established variables <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation vulnerability is still unknown. Methods. Ten isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were immersed in a tissue bath between two shock plate electrodes. Truncated 5 -ms biphasic shocks were used to determine the vulnerable window, the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold. Measurements were performed during baseline and at 10 to 15 min of acute ischemia induced by an 80 % reduction of coronary flow. The effects of ischemia were monitored by measuring the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> activation and <b>repolarization</b> using multiple monophasic action potential recordings. Results. Acute ischemia caused an increase in <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> activation (baseline vs. ischemia [mean ± SD]: 22 ± 6 vs. 34 ± 10 ms, p < 0. 001) and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization (37 ± 16 vs. 69 ± 29 ms, p < 0. 01). The width of the vulnerable window increased from 25 ± 22 ms during baseline to 75 ± 26 ms during ischemia (p = 0. 001). The upper limit of vulnerability (baseline vs. ischemia: 294 ± 44 vs. 274 ± 53 V, p = 0. 21) and the defibrillation threshold (271 ± 33 vs. 268 ± 42 V, p = 0. 74) remained unchanged during ischemia. Conclusions. Acute global ischemia caused a threefold increase in the width of the vulnerable window. This increase was associated with increased heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> activation and <b>repolarization.</b> Despite these marked changes, the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold were not affected by acute myocardial ischemia. Thus, the previously reported similarity between both measures was maintained under these adverse conditions. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 817 – 24...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> {{has been}} shown to be a marker for {{increased}} risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in various cardiac disorders. The present study is aimed at comparing the values of four dispersion indices in four clinical groups: normal subjects (n = 23), patients with intraventricular conduction defects (QRS > 0. 12 s) without underlying cardiac disease (n = 30), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 36), and patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction defects (n = 18). METHODS: On an averaged cycle from a 10 s record of 15 simultaneous leads (12 -lead ECG and XYZ leads), and after interactive editing, four intervals were computed: JTapex, JTend, QTapex and QTend. For each interval, the dispersion is defined as the difference between the maximal and minimal values across the 15 leads. RESULTS: The mean values of all four dispersion indices were significantly smaller in the normal group than in the three other groups (P < 0. 001). Among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, those with intraventricular conduction defects had significantly higher dispersion values than those without, even disregarding the QRS duration (P < 0. 01). Thus, patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction defects have larger dispersion values than patients with ventricular conduction defects alone (P < 0. 01) and than those with dilated cardiomyopathy without intraventricular conduction defects. CONCLUSION: <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> is increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in those with ventricular conduction defects, suggesting that they are at higher risk of arrhythmic events...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{assessing}} effect <b>of</b> ischemia on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> {{are mostly}} directed towards patients with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD); however, similar reports on cardiac syndrome X (CSX) are scarce.

In the present study, ECG measures <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> were compared between CAD and CSX patients (40 subjects in each group).

Results showed comparable QT intervals and QTd in CAD and CSX patients even after adjustment for the possible variations in gender, age and body mass index of the studied groups. Although JTd was increased in CSX subjects (26. 6 ± 7. 2 ms) compared with CAD patients (22. 7 ± 6. 5 ms, p = 0. 019), statistical significance disappeared after correcting JT for variations in heart rate.

40|$|Introduction: Activation {{recovery}} time (ART), {{defined as the}} time from the earliest ventricular activation time {{to the end of}} T wave on unipolar electrograms, has been used as an index of myocardial repolarization time. However, it is unknown whether the ART can be used to estimate the global sequence and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> as determined by the monophasic action potential (MAP) mapping technique. Methods and Results: Endocardial MAPs and unipolar electrograms were simultaneously recorded using the CARTO system from 34 +/- 12 left (n = 6) or right (n = 9) ventricular sites in 12 patients. End-of-repolarization (EOR) times from the MAPs and ARTs from the unipolar electrograms were calculated, based on which 15 sets of 3 -dimensional maps of global EOR sequence and ART sequence were reconstructed. The ART sequence was consistent with the EOR sequence in 14 of 15 maps. In the 473 paired measurements obtained, the differences between the ART and the EOR time were 2 +/- 22 milliseconds (NS). A significant positive correlation between the ART and the EOR time was found in all the maps (r = 0. 58 +/- 0. 22). Agreement analyses showed that the differences between these 2 measurements were almost all within the range of mean difference +/- 2 SD for each individual map and for all the 473 recordings. The global dispersion of ART was 79 +/- 35 milliseconds, as compared with that of EOR time of 78 +/- 35 milliseconds (NS). Conclusion: The ART from unipolar electrograms is a good estimate of EOR time measured from MAPs, suggesting the usefulness of the former in evaluation of global sequence and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization...</b>|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that exposure to concentrated ambient particles (CAP) and/or ozone (O 3) would increase <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization.</b> BackgroundElevated levels of air pollution are associated with cardiac arrhythmias through mechanisms yet to be elucidated. MethodsEach of 25 volunteers (18 to 50 years of age) had four 2 -h exposures to 150 μg/m 3 CAP; 120 parts per billion O 3; CAP + O 3; and filtered air (FA). Exposure-induced changes (Δ = 5 -min epochs at end-start) in {{spatial dispersion of repolarization}} were determined from continuous 12 -lead electrocardiographic recording. ResultsSpatial dispersion of repolarization assessed by corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval increased significantly for CAP + O 3 (0. 17 ± 0. 03, p < 0. 0001) exposure only, remaining significant when factoring FA (CAP + O 3 − FA) as control (0. 11 ± 0. 04, p = 0. 013). The influence on repolarization was further verified by a significant increase in ΔQT dispersion (for CAP + O 3 compared with FA (5. 7 ± 1. 4, p = 0. 0002). When the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio of heart rate variability (a conventional representation of sympathetic-parasympathetic balances) was included as a covariate, the effect estimate was positive for both corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval (p = 0. 002) and ΔQT dispersion (p = 0. 038). When the high-frequency component (parasympathetic heart rate modulation) was included as a covariate with corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval, the effect estimate for high frequency was inverse (p = 0. 02). ConclusionsCAP + O 3 exposure alters <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> in part by increasing sympathetic and decreasing parasympathetic heart rate modulation. Detection of changes in repolarization parameters, even in this small cohort of healthy individuals, suggests an underappreciated role for air pollutants in urban arrhythmogenesis...|$|E

Mathematical modeling of the heart rate variability (RR interval variability) and <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> variability (QT interval variability) {{is one of the}} popular methods to understand the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization.</b> Although ECG derived respiration (EDR) was previously suggested as a surrogate of respiration, but the effect of respiratory movement on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> dynamics was not studied. In this study, the importance of considering the effect of respiration and the validity of using EDR as a surrogate of respiration for linear parametric modeling <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> variability is studied in two cases with different physiological and psychological conditions. In the first case study, we used 20 young and 20 old healthy subjects’ ECG and respiration data from Fantasia database at Physionet to analyze a bivariate QT–RR and a trivariate QT–RR–RESP or QT–RR–EDR model structure to study the aging effect on cardiac repolarization variability. In the second study, we used 16 healthy subjects’ data from drivedb (stress detection for automobile drivers) database at Physionet to do the same analysis for different psychological condition (i. e., in stressed and no stress condition). The results of our study showed that model having respiratory information (QT–RR–RESP and QT–RR–EDR) gave significantly better fit value (p 0. 05) performance as that of respiration as an exogenous model input in describing repolarization variability irrespective of age and different mental conditions. Another finding of our study is that both respiration and EDR-based models can significantly (p < 0. 05) differentiate the <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> dynamics between healthy subjects of different age groups and with different psychological conditions, whereas models without respiration or EDR cannot distinguish between the groups.

While neither the normal range of Tp-e interval nor the indications for the need of correction by heart rate have been defined yet, mean Tp-e intervals in healthy children or adults have been reported to be approximately 65 or 76  ms, respectively [13 – 15].

40|$|Background: Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) {{is characterized}} by myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, fibrosis, and increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Increased QT dispersion {{has been reported in}} patients with HCM, but the underlying mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we examined the relationship between diffuse interstitial fibrosis, replacement fibrosis, QTc dispersion and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM. We hypothesized that fibrosis would slow impulse propagation and increase <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization,</b> resulting in increased QTc dispersion on surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: ECG and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image analyses were performed retrospectively in 112 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HCM. Replacement fibrosis was assessed by measuring late gadolinium (Gd) enhancement (LGE), using a semi-automated threshold technique. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis was assessed by measuring T 1 relaxation times after Gd administration, using the Look–Locker sequence. QTc dispersion was measured digitally in the septal/anterior (V 1 –V 4), inferior (II, III, and aVF), and lateral (I, aVL, V 5, and V 6) lead groups on surface ECG. Results: All patients had evidence of asymmetric septal hypertrophy. LGE was evident in 70 (63 %) patients; the median T 1 relaxation time was 411 ± 38  ms. An inverse correlation was observed between T 1 relaxation time and QTc dispersion in leads V 1 –V 4 (p< 0. 001). Patients with HCM who developed sustained ventricular tachycardia had slightly higher probability of increased QTc dispersion in leads V 1 –V 4 (odds ratio, 1. 011 [1. 004 – 1. 0178, p= 0. 003). We found no correlation between presence and percentage of LGE and QTc dispersion. Conclusion: Diffuse interstitial fibrosis is associated with increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> in leads, reflecting electrical activity in the hypertrophied septum.

40|$|A {{survey of}} current {{literature}} suggests an increasing interest {{in both the}} desirable and undesirable implications of a prolonged QT interval, the former {{perceived to be the}} beneficial effect of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the duration of ventricular action potential, and the latter considered to be a potential marker for sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic heart disease. In addition, there has been an increasing interest in the congenital long QT syndrome associated with an apparent dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and serious, potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these arrhythmias are due to increased dispersion of repolarization which may be aggravated by psychologic and emotional perturbations. In this review, the associations between the long QT interval, autonomic nervous system, dispersion of repolarization, antiarrhythmic drugs and ventricular arrhythmias are examined. Attention is directed to the difficulties of accurate QT measurement, problems related to the correction of the QT interval for heart rate and sex (QTC), the wide range of normal values and the modest QT alterations after various manipulations of the autonomic nervous system. Clinical conditions as- sociated with marked, moderate and occasional QT lengthening are listed and discussed briefly in relation to the disturbances of nervous system, <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> and ventricular arrhythmias. It is proposed that the absence of relevant animal models of neurogenic or psychogenic QT prolongation hinders the investigation of the neurogenic factors associated with QT lengthening. QT prolongation is most often induced by antiarrhythmic drugs and ischemic heart disease. However, it is not known whether the occurrence of torsade de pointes type of ventricular tachycardia in patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs is related to a critical drug dose or a critical degree of QTC prolongation.

We studied pts with unexplained syncope to determine if inducible VT could be predicted by QT dispersion (QTd, defined as QTmax-QTmin), QT standard deviation (QTstd), and equivalent JT intervals. Values were also corrected using Bazett's formula. We enrolled 38 pts (22 M, age= 59 ± 18 yrs, 29 % prior MI) who underwent programmed electrical stimulation (PES). Standard ECGs were recorded prior to PES and analyzed by a computerized analyzer/digitizer. ResultsOf the 38 pts, 9 (24 %) had inducible sustained VT and 29 pts did not.

Results: Sotalol significantly prolonged QTc (corrected QT) and JTc (corrected JT) intervals at rest compared with propranolol (QTc 324. 86 ms vs 305. 21 ms, P< 0. 001; JTc 245. 04 ms vs 224. 17 ms, P< 0. 001) and placebo (QTc 324. 86 ms vs 314. 06 ms, P< 0. 01; JTc 245. 04 ms vs. 232. 69 ms, P< 0. 001). The JTc percent reduction increased progressively with each stage of exercise and correlated positively with exercise heart rate (r= 0. 148, P< 0. 01). The JTc percent reduction correlation with exercise heart rate did not exist with either propranolol or placebo. Conclusions: These results imply that with sotalol <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> is progressively shortened after exercise. Thus the specific class III antiarrhythmic activity of sotalol, present as delay <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization,</b> may be attenuated during exercise.

40|$|IntroductionThe aim of {{the study}} was to assess the time course effect of IKr {{blockade}} on ECG biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> and to evaluate the accuracy of a fully automatic approach for QT duration evaluation. Methods 12 -lead digital ECG Holter were recorded in 38 healthy subjects (27 males, mean age= 27. 4 ± 8. 0 years) on baseline conditions (day 0) and after administration of 160 mg (day 1) and 320 mg (day 2) of d-l Sotalol. For each 24 -hour period and each subject, ECGs were extracted every 10 minutes during the 4 -hour period following drug dosage. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> was characterized using 3 biomarker categories: conventional ECG time intervals, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis on the T-wave, and fully automatic biomarkers computed from a mathematical model of the T-wave. ResultsQT interval was significantly prolonged starting 1 h 20 minutes after drug dosing with 160 mg and 1 h 10 minutes after drug dosing with 320 mg. PCA <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> parameters sotalol-induced changes were delayed (> 3 hours). After sotalol dosing, the early phase of the T-wave changed earlier than the late phase prolongation. Globally, the modeled surrogate QT paralleled manual QT changes. The duration of manual QT and automatic surrogate QT were strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 92, p< 0. 001). The Bland & Altman plot revealed a non-stationary systematic bias (bias = 26. 5 ms ± 1. 96 *SD = 16 ms). ConclusionsChanges in different ECG biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> display different kinetics after administration of a potent potassium channel blocker. These differences need to be taken into account when designing <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> ECG studies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiabetes is {{associated}} with prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram and enhanced <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization,</b> factors that, together with atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia, may promote the occurrence of electrical disorders. Thus, we tested the possibility that alterations in transmembrane ionic currents reduce the repolarization reserve of myocytes, leading to action potential (AP) prolongation and enhanced beat-to-beat variability of repolarization. Diabetes was induced in mice with streptozotocin (STZ), and effects of hyperglycemia on electrical properties of whole heart and myocytes were studied with respect to an untreated control group (Ctrl) using electrocardiographic recordings in vivo, ex vivo perfused hearts, and single-cell patch-clamp analysis. Additionally, a newly developed algorithm was introduced to obtain detailed information {{of the impact of}} high glucose on AP profile. Compared to Ctrl, hyperglycemia in STZ-treated animals was coupled with prolongation of the QT interval, enhanced temporal dispersion of electrical recovery, and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, defects observed, in part, in the Akita mutant mouse model of type I diabetes. AP was prolonged and beat-to-beat variability of repolarization was enhanced in diabetic myocytes, with respect to Ctrl cells. Density of Kv K(+) and L-type Ca(2 +) currents were decreased in STZ myocytes, in comparison to cells from normoglycemic mice. Pharmacological reduction of Kv currents in Ctrl cells lengthened AP duration and increased temporal dispersion of repolarization, reiterating features identified in diabetic myocytes. Reductions in the repolarizing K(+) currents may contribute to electrical disturbances of the diabetic heart...|$|E
40|$|Background: Electrophysiological {{characteristics}} of early repolarization syndrome (ERS), i. e., the spatial and transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> and ventricular late potentials can be evaluated using a signal-averaged vector-projected 187 -channel high-resolution electrocardiogram (187 -ch SAVP-ECG). We investigated these characteristics as markers of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest in patients presenting with an ER pattern. Methods: The 187 -ch SAVP-ECGs were recorded for 8 patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation associated with ERS (ERS patients), and 5 patients with an ER pattern without arrhythmic events (ER pattern patients). Results: The ER pattern {{was located in}} the inferior leads (n= 7), lateral leads (n= 1), or both inferior and lateral leads (n= 5). The corrected RT(RTc) (peak point of the R wave − positive maximum peak of the first derivative of the T wave interval corrected using the Bazett formula) interval and T(peak-end) -c interval from the 187 channels were calculated. Late potentials were positive in 7 of 8 ERS patients and in 3 of 5 ER pattern patients (P= 0. 25). The average RTc was shorter in patients with ERS (192. 6 ± 29. 8  ms vs. 234. 0 ± 25. 5  ms, P= 0. 04). However, average T(peak-end) -c interval did not differ between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Late ventricular potentials were common in ERS and ER pattern patients. Lethal arrhythmia in ERS patients appeared {{to be related to}} the relatively short average repolarization time rather than the spatial and transmural dispersion of repolarization...|$|E
40|$|A new {{computer-assisted}} {{method for}} the {{quantitative assessment of}} the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> (DVR) has been developed. Through interactive editing of an averaged QRS-T cycle from a 15 -lead electrocardiographic (ECG) record (12 -lead ECG + XYZ leads), five ECG indices of DVR are automatically computed: they represent the maximal interlead difference of QT and the intervals from the J point to the T wave end, from the J point to the T wave apex, and from the T wave apex to the T wave end. The standard limits of these indices were then established in six clinical groups, including normal subjects and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, with myocardial infarction, and with intraventricular conduction defect, all subjects being without ventricular arrhythmias and without interacting drugs. The mean values and percentile ranges of all DVR indices were lower in the normal group than in all pathologic groups. The 97. 5 th percentiles of the QT end dispersion and the JT end dispersion were, respectively, 65 and 76 ms in normal subjects, 84 and 86 ms in patients with inferior MI; 89 and 100 ms in those with anterior MI; 90 and 98 ms in those with left ventricular hypertrophy; and 94 and 99 ms in those with intraventricular conduction defects. This suggests that increased DVR {{is associated with the}} varieties of heart disease represented in this study, {{even in the absence of}} ventricular arrhythmias, and also that individual measurements of DVR used as predictors of future arrhythmic events should be referred to the standard range of their own clinical group...|$|E
40|$|Background:: Obstetricians regard {{maternal}} age of 20 to 35 {{years as}} the optimal age for pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy at the ages of 35 years and above are associated with higher risks. Pregnancy is pro-arrhythmic and rarely precipitates ventricular arrhythmias. Objectives:: QT dispersion is an index <b>of</b> heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> and a predictor <b>of</b> propensity <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmias. In this study, this index was used to find any relationship between maternal age and ventricular arrhythmia risk. Methods:: This study was performed {{among a group of}} healthy pregnant ladies between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation. An ECG was taken from each patient. QT dispersions were calculated on a computer screen with high magnitude. The results were then divided into three groups based on the age of the participants. The first, second, and third groups included the women below 20, between 20 and 35, and over 35 years, respectively. The three groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Results:: The mean QTd was 61. 77 ms (± 16. 61) in the first group, 64. 15 ms (± 18. 65) in the second group, and 55. 95 ms (± 23. 04) in the third group. Although QTd was prolonged in all, no significant difference was observed among the three groups regarding QTd. Conclusions:: Our results showed QT prolongation in pregnancy, but showed that maternal age did not affect the heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> and propensity <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmias in pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} is a severe neurological developmental disorder. In this syndrome, the {{high incidence of}} sudden death is correlated with an alteration <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this study was to evaluate plasmatic levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in Rett patients with prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval in comparison with those of Rett patients with normal QTc. We observed 23 female Rett patients (9. 9 +/- 4. 7 years). NGF plasma levels and QTc interval were measured in all patients. Student t-test was performed for statistical analysis. NGF plasma levels were significantly lower in Rett patients with QTc interval prolongation (QTc > 0. 44 sec) in comparison with Rett patients with a normal QTc interval (4. 5 +/- 4. 5 vs 11 +/- 8. 3 pg/ml, p = 0. 02). The alteration of NGF levels, observed in Rett patients with a long QTc interval, may explain the presence <b>of</b> an altered <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|The role of IKCa in cardiac repolarization remains {{controversial}} and varies across species. The {{relevance of the}} current as a therapeutic target is therefore undefined. We examined the cellular electrophysiologic effects of IKCa blockade in controls, chronic heart failure (HF) and HF with sustained atrial fibrillation. We used perforated patch action potential recordings to maintain intrinsic calcium cycling. The IKCa blocker (apamin 100 nM) {{was used to examine}} the role of the current in atrial and ventricular myocytes. A canine tachypacing induced model of HF (1 and 4 months, n = 5 per group) was used, and compared to a group of 4 month HF with 6 weeks of superimposed atrial fibrillation (n = 7). A group of age-matched canine controls were used (n = 8). Human atrial and ventricular myocytes were isolated from explanted end-stage failing hearts which were obtained from transplant recipients, and studied in parallel. Atrial myocyte action potentials were unchanged by IKCa blockade in all of the groups studied. IKCa blockade did not affect <b>ventricular</b> myocyte <b>repolarization</b> in controls. HF caused prolongation <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> myocyte action potential repolarization. IKCa blockade caused further prolongation <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> in HF and also caused repolarization instability and early afterdepolarizations. SK 2 and SK 3 expression in the atria and SK 3 in the ventricle were increased in canine heart failure. We conclude that during HF, IKCa blockade in ventricular myocytes results in cellular arrhythmias. Furthermore, our data suggest an important role for IKCa in the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarization</b> stability during chronic heart failure. Our findings suggest that nove...|$|R
