25|$|In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe {{began to}} {{formally}} demonetise the Zimbabwean dollar, to officially value the fiat currency at zero, {{in order to}} complete a switch to the US dollar {{by the end of}} September 2015. The Zimbabwean government stated that it would credit 5 US dollars to domestic bank accounts, with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars, and that it would exchange Zimbabwean dollars for US dollars at a rate of 1 USD to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars to accounts with balances above 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars. This move was meant to stabilise the economy and establish a credible nominal anchor under low inflation conditions. The exercise brought closure to the outstanding issue on the Zimbabwe dollar, further confirming the government's position that the local unit will not return anytime soon. The Government has maintained that the return of the Zimbabwe dollar would only be considered when key <b>economic</b> <b>fundamentals,</b> such productivity in key sectors, have been achieved.|$|E

40|$|Increases {{in house}} prices {{can lead to}} higher house price volatility, a {{significant}} determinant of default and the prepayment of housing loans (Miles, 2008). Many researchers believe that significant growth in house price {{has the potential to}} generate a house price bubble. The bursting of a house price bubble is likely to endanger the stability of the country’s real economy. China experienced substantial increases in house prices at the end of 1990 s. In Beijing, house prices increased dramatically following the liberalization of China’s housing market in 1998, and especially so after reforms in 2004. The significant growth of Beijing house prices could have generated a house price bubble, thus endangering the stability of the Beijing housing market and thereby the overall Chinese economy. This paper investigates whether a bubble existed in the Beijing housing market from 1998 to 2010, using <b>economic</b> <b>fundamental</b> variables such as interest rates, inflation, and cost of supply. Results of the analysis revealed that the Beijing house price index was significantly larger than the equilibrium value, based on the relative <b>economic</b> <b>fundamental</b> variables (income, inflation, interest rate and construction cost) during 2004 to 2007. This result is similar to the findings of Hou (2009), where nearly 75 percent of the changes in Beijing house price were thought to be explained by the economic variables used in the models. </p...|$|R

Model failure from this violation is robust to otherwise ideal circumstances (e. g., perfect credibility) ...|$|R

We find compelling evidence of a long-run relationship between exchange rates and the <b>economic</b> <b>fundamental</b> determinant. Macroeconomic factors systematically affect the long-run movement of the RM/USD rate. Additionally, the RM/USD rate was overvalued by about 10 % several quarters before the 1997 crisis; after the crisis, rates fluctuated close to the equilibrium value. The out-of-sample forecasts demonstrate that the monetary model outperforms the naive random walk model. The monetary and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) models do well at the four to eight quarters horizon. ...|$|R

Empirical evidence on contagion in Asia supports the hypotheses that contagion is regional and trans-mitted through developed markets.

Contagion affects both developed and developing markets, and does not seem to vary with the relative <b>economic</b> <b>fundamental</b> health or trade and financial linkages of the Asian economies. The discussion of the behaviour of correlation coefficients in the presence of contagion and crises suggests they are not a reliable metric for detecting contagion...|$|R
