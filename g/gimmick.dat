5|$|Newly–appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm {{credits the}} {{invention}} of and the vision behind the Broken <b>gimmick</b> to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan, and while Borash specifically had the most input into the <b>gimmick</b> of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the <b>gimmick.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Gimmick!</b> {{initially}} garnered lackluster {{interest and}} mixed reviews from publications like Famitsu, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Nintendomagasinet. This lack of popularity was blamed on casual players {{being unable to}} handle the difficulty, and the industry's transition to newer 16-bit consoles like the Super NES and Mega Drive. When <b>Gimmick!</b> was exhibited at places like the Tokyo Toy Show, Sakai recalled that he was hoping a dealer would see <b>Gimmick!</b> as a next-generation title developed for the original Nintendo and distribute it, only for them to lose interest once they learned it was an NES game. In retrospect, he joked that the game took 10 years for people to appreciate.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken <b>gimmick,</b> with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken <b>gimmick.</b> It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken <b>gimmick</b> remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken <b>gimmick</b> through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken <b>gimmick</b> at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gimmick!</b> {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} {{and a lack}} of interest at release. Distributors were more interested in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan. Sunsoft of America did not approve of the game for a North American release due to its quirky character design. Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized the game for its challenging difficulty, and some thought the game was designed exclusively for children due to its character design. In retrospective reviews, <b>Gimmick!</b> has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gimmick!</b> {{was also}} ported to the PlayStation in Japan {{as a part}} of Sunsoft Memorial Collection: Volume 6 along with Super Spy Hunter. This version {{contains}} some sound differences from its Famicom counterpart. This collection package was made available on the PlayStation Network in Japan on 22 December 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gimmick!,</b> known outside Japan as Mr. <b>Gimmick,</b> is a {{platform}} video game developed {{and published by}} Sunsoft, and originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on 31 January 1992. The story follows a small green character named Yumetaro who was given to a young girl as a birthday present. One night, the girl's other toys become jealous of the attention he is receiving, and whisk the girl away to another dimension. Playing as Yumetaro, the player must maneuver {{through a variety of}} levels, using the protagonist's star-shooting power to defeat enemies and progress through the game.|$|E

5|$|Cosme participated as Banderas in the Wrestling Society X {{television}} series (taped in Los Angeles, California), with the <b>gimmick</b> of a disgruntled and kayfabe disfigured man pursuing a feud with Vampiro.

5|$|Helms and {{his friend}} Shannon Moore signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 1999. In WCW, Helms, along with Moore and Evan Karagias, formed the heel (villainous) stable (faction) 3 Count, and the trio debuted on the December 23 episode of WCW Thunder. The trio was a parody of the boy bands 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys, and their <b>gimmick</b> {{involved}} making music videos and performing songs before their matches.|$|E

5|$|The Great American Bash event {{featured}} a card, which contained matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines.

The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character.|$|E

Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite <b>gimmick</b> as they followed {{a series of}} events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. All wrestlers were from the SmackDown! brand– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being Raw.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the World Wrestling Federation, she was sent to their training ground in Memphis Championship Wrestling to work off ring-rust. She became the manager of William Regal and was known as Lady Ophelia. While there, she squared off against The Kat, Bobcat, and Victoria. In 2000, she reappeared in the World Wrestling Federation under the Lady Ophelia <b>gimmick,</b> wrestling dark matches and valeting for William Regal.|$|E
5|$|After regaining the title, Yokozuna {{challenged}} any American {{athlete to}} bodyslam {{him on the}} deck of the USS Intrepid on July 4, 1993. After many challengers failed, Lex Luger arrived by helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger became a fan favorite and changed his <b>gimmick</b> to an American patriot. He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993; he won the match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.|$|E

In October 2014, she began starring in the reality television series Total Divas on E! as part of the main cast.|$|E
5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap <b>gimmick</b> and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
