5|$|Four {{services}} per day operated, taking around 40 minutes <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> to {{the other}} in 1900, falling to 32 minutes by 1931 after the upgrading of the route {{and the introduction of}} the A Class locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Altar N {{is another}} small {{rhyolite}} sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has {{the form of}} a turtle shell with a skeletal head with a mirror on its forehead emerging sideways <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the bicephalic deity Pawatun (GodN), a prominent underworld deity.|$|E
5|$|At around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield {{to ask the}} resort's {{reception}} desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4's Dispatches that, <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.|$|E

5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons {{that they can use}} as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was {{previously}} the airfield's armoury. The various buildings are arranged roughly {{parallel to the}} A505; AirSpace is furthest east, with Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5 running westwards, followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall. The museum site is approximately 1800m <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> to the other, and a visitor bus operates during opening hours.|$|E

5|$|Races over short distances, or sprints, {{are among}} the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games {{featured}} only one event, the stadion race, which was a race <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route {{to ensure that there}} would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} {{and within the}} first two minutes forced Manchester United defender Gary Neville to concede a throw-in. In the fifth minute, Manchester United won a free kick, but nothing {{came out of it}} as José Antonio Reyes blocked Paul Scholes's shot. Good play by Reyes and Henry {{fashioned}} a chance for Bergkamp in the ninth minute, but his strike was off target. Two minutes later a shot by Bergkamp from outside the box was saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard. Before Henry was about to take a corner for Arsenal in the 16th minute, a cigarette lighter was thrown at him from the section occupied by Manchester United supporters – this resulted in police making two arrests during the game. Quinton Fortune used his pace to get the better of Lauren, but his cross into the Arsenal penalty area was cleared by Pascal Cygan. Arsenal continued to threaten – Henry's free kick prompted Howard to make a save and tip the ball over the crossbar, and Bergkamp came close to scoring in the 27th minute after clever play to lose his marker John O'Shea. The football continued to move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> to the other, with Giggs and Reyes causing problems for their respective defences. In stoppage time {{at the end of the}} first half, Henry had his shot saved by Howard, while Scholes was similarly denied by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.|$|E
40|$|Planar locally finite graphs {{which are}} almost vertex {{transitive}} are discussed. If the graph is 3 -connected and has at most <b>one</b> <b>end</b> then {{the group of}} automorphisms is a planar discontinuous group and its structure is well-known. A general result is obtained for such graphs where no restriction is put {{on the number of}} ends. It is shown that such a graph can be built up <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>ended</b> or finite planar graphs in a precise way. The results give a classification of the finitely generated groups with planar Cayley graphs. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

5|$|Blackwood's {{attack was}} so {{successful}} that by dawn on 31 March Guillaume Tell had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard, considerably reducing {{the speed at which}} Decrés could travel. The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, but Penelope had lost only one man killed and three wounded, and was almost undamaged. British reinforcements were now arriving from the south: the 64-gun HMS Lion under Captain Dixon had received Minorcas warning at 01:00 and immediately sailed in pursuit, sending the brig on to Captain Sir Edward Berry in HMS Foudroyant, who lay some distance to leeward. By 05:00, Dixon was close enough to engage, passing between Penelope and Guillaume Tell and firing a triple-shotted broadside into the port side of the French ship. Shooting ahead of the now sluggish Guillaume Tell, Lion crossed its opponent's bows and shot away the jib boom, allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the bow, raking the French ship <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> while Penelope did the same to the other. During these manoeuvres, Dixon's ship had briefly become entangled with Guillaume Tells rigging, and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled.|$|E

25|$|Some {{satellites}} {{with long}} conductive tethers can also experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the Earth's magnetic field. As the wire cuts {{the magnetic field}} it acts as a generator, moving electrons <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> to the other. The orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire.|$|E
