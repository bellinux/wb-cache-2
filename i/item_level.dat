25|$|RFID is {{used for}} <b>item</b> <b>level</b> tagging in retail stores. In {{addition}} to inventory control, this provides both protection against theft by customers (shoplifting) and employees ("shrinkage") by using electronic article surveillance (EAS), and a self checkout process for customers. Tags of different type can be physically removed with a special tool or deactivated electronically once items have been paid for. On leaving the shop customers have to pass near an RFID detector; if they have items with active RFID tags, an alarm sounds, both indicating an unpaid-for item, and identifying what it is.|$|E
500|$|The GBA version also {{received}} good reviews. GameZone's Steve Hopper {{found it very}} similar to the GBA version of Two Towers, but wrote [...] "all in all this is solid action game that I can wholeheartedly recommend for gamers who loved The Two Towers and want more of the same brand of hack and slash action." [...] IGN's Craig Harris wrote [...] "the enhancements to the gameplay definitely enhance an already solid action game, and it's also a very recommended two player experience as well. The Return of the King is a nice compliment to a great film, and a decent follow-up to an already enjoyable action title on the handheld." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo called it [...] "more satisfying and ultimately more playable" [...] than Two Towers, and praised the differentiation between the characters, the graphics and the experience system. GameSpy's Matt Chandronait was less impressed, criticizing the game's [...] "technical flaws," [...] especially its collision detection. He called it a [...] "repetitive beat-'em-up that require dozens of hours of devotion to unlock every last <b>item,</b> <b>level,</b> and character." ...|$|E

30|$|Rasch’s analysis, {{specifically}} infit analysis, {{shows that}} the 36 remaining items were adequate. In regard to outfit, however, three items (2, 21 and 27) presented unexpected pattern of answers, indicating a discrepancy in the answers related to the sample’s theta level {{in comparison to the}} <b>item’s</b> <b>level</b> of difficulty (i.e., children with theta levels above or below these <b>item’s</b> <b>level</b> of difficulty were not answering as expected).

500|$|Players {{are able}} to improve their {{characters}} by gaining experience points (EXP)—when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will [...] "level up" [...] and gain improved statistics which further enhance performance in battle. The four primary sources of experience points in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn are through completing quests, exploring instanced dungeons, participating in Full Active Time Events (FATE), and slaying monsters which exist in the game world. Quests, including the [...] "main scenario" [...] questline, are generally short, specific tasks given to the player by non-player characters which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario quests progresses the overarching plot of the game. Guildleves are a type of repeatable quest which may be undertaken using leve allowances. These allowances are limited but regenerate over time. Instanced dungeons are confined locations with specific objectives that must be achieved within a time limit. These dungeons require multiple players to form a party before entry is granted. Some dungeons are for lower-leveled players to gain EXP quickly while others are for experienced players to collect rare items and equipment. FATE is a new gameplay mechanic where {{a large number of}} players may participate in the same event, regardless of party status. These location-specific events include battles with notorious monsters, defending a location from invading forces, culling hostile local wildlife, and assaulting enemy fortresses, among other types. Finally, slaying monsters for EXP is aided by the Hunting Log, which tasks players with defeating specific enemies in exchange for EXP bonuses. Upon reaching the level cap, character progression shifts to improving <b>item</b> <b>level</b> by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources including endgame dungeons, crafting, raids, primal battles, and elite mark hunts.|$|E

50|$|Each {{character}} may equip one weapon, {{one piece}} of armor, and one accessory at a time. Weapons and armor may be leveled up via a refinement process carried out by Cid. This costs gil and requires the sacrifice of another piece of equipment or an equipment refinement item. Once the <b>item's</b> <b>level</b> gauge is filled, it levels up and its stats improve. Filling the gauge requires more <b>items</b> at higher <b>levels.</b> The <b>item's</b> <b>level</b> limit is based on its rarity, with ☆ equipment having a maximum level of three and ☆☆☆☆☆ equipment having a maximum level of twenty. In addition to using up other pieces of equipment, players may also use Adamantite or Scarletite. Higher rarity equipment and materials add more to the item's leveling gauge.|$|R

50|$|In Legion {{there were}} a number of changes to the PvP aspects of the game. There is a PvP honor system that unlocks PvP honor talents and there are {{separate}} abilities for use only in PvP that are not available in regular gameplay. Honor talents are abilities earned through increased levels in PvP and are activated while players engage in PvP. Once players hit maximum honor level, they can choose to earn a prestige level that resets the honor talents earned and gives cosmetic bonuses. In PvP combat, gear will be nullified and all bonuses related to gear will be deactivated, with the exception of artifact weapons and their related powers. Instead, the game will predetermine a set of stats configured to a player's specialization that can be modified for class balance purposes. However, a player's average <b>item</b> <b>level</b> will still factor in PvP; every point above <b>item</b> <b>level</b> 800 results in a 0.1% increase to a player's PvP stats.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 70 - 82). The Undergraduate Placement Examination (UPE) determines students’ future careers in three hours. The {{content of the}} UPE, its quality, and the cognitive <b>level</b> of the <b>items,</b> must have high selectivity features {{in terms of getting}} students into higher education programs. The aim of this study is: to classify UPE science items in accordance with Bloom’s Taxonomy, to determine the difficulty parameters of those items, and the cognitive levels of the students who take the UPE according to science subtests. Four science pre-service teachers classified 30 science items in regards to Bloom’s Taxonomy. Quantitative exploratory research was employed as a research design. Quantitative analyses were carried out by using SPSS. Sample science responses of 3382 randomly selected students were analysed. It was found that there were 4 knowledge <b>level</b> <b>items,</b> 10 comprehension <b>level</b> <b>items,</b> 11 application <b>level</b> <b>items,</b> and 5 analysis <b>level</b> <b>items</b> as defined by Bloom’s Taxonomy.

40|$|Objective: To set out {{the methodological}} process for using Rasch {{analysis}} alongside traditional psychometric methods {{in the development of}} a health state classification that is amenable to valuation. Methods: The overactive bladder questionnaire is used to illustrate a four step process for deriving a reduced health state classification from an existing nonpreference based health related quality of life instrument. Step I excludes items that do not meet the initial validation process and step II uses criteria based on Rasch analysis and psychometric testing to select the final items for the health state classification. In step III, <b>item</b> <b>levels</b> are examined and Rasch analysis is used to explore the possibility of reducing the number of <b>item</b> <b>levels.</b> Step IV repeats steps I to III on alternative data sets in order to validate the selection of items for the health state classification. Conclusions: The techniques described enable the construction of a health state classification amenable for valuation exercises that will allow the derivation of preference weights. Thus, the health related quality of life of patients with conditions, like overactive bladder, can be valued and quality adjustment weights such as quality adjusted life years derived. ...|$|R
