5|$|Belcourt was {{appointed}} {{as an assistant}} at several parishes in the area, before becoming pastor of a parish at Sainte-Martine, Quebec in 1830. As he was bilingual and spoke English as well as French, {{he was able to}} minister to his parish of mostly <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was born}} on April 5, 1900, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was the second son of Caroline (née Brown; 1874–1942) and John Edward Tracy (1873–1928), a truck salesman. His mother was a Presbyterian from a wealthy Midwestern family, and his father was of <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> background. His one brother, Carroll, was four years older.|$|E
5|$|Nash did not rush {{to enlist}} in the Australian armed forces on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. While there was no public statement from Nash, {{it is thought that}} with a family to support and an <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> anti-pathy to the British, Nash did not feel an urgency to fight. However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E

25|$|By 1901 Ontario <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> and Scottish Presbyterians {{were among}} the most likely to own homes, while Anglicans did only {{moderately}} well, despite their traditional association with Canada's elite. French-speaking Catholics in Ontario achieved wealth and status less readily than Protestants and <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics.</b> Although differences in attainment existed between people of different religious denominations, the difference between <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> and <b>Irish</b> Protestants in urban Canada was relatively insignificant.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the crisis}} was unique in Ireland at the time, it {{followed}} similar campaigns in Australia (1916-17) and Canada (1917). In Australia, <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> mostly opposed conscription; in Canada (and the US), <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> supported conscription.|$|R
5|$|Rosenberg {{was born}} in Marin County, California. Her father is Jack Lee Rosenberg, a {{psychotherapist}} {{and the founder of}} integrative body psychotherapy. Her mother was Patricia Rosenberg, a lawyer. She was the second of four children by her father's first marriage and another by his second. Rosenberg's father was Jewish, and her mother was of <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Shea {{was born}} September 5, 1925, {{and grew up}} in the Bronx, the eldest son in a working-class <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> family. His father worked as a {{mechanic}} on the New York City Subway. As a child, Shea had no interest in engineering; he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete. He attended a Catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen.|$|E
5|$|Suspicious of the <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> establishment, {{embodied}} by the Labor Party, Weaver joined the Protestant Federation in 1921 {{and became a}} sympathiser of the right-wing New Guard. At the 1922 election, he was re-elected with an increased margin of 20.16%, gaining first place once again. He served until, citing business reasons, he retired from parliament on 18 April 1925.|$|E
25|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> in America seldom {{challenged}} {{the role of}} slavery in society as it was protected at that time by the U.S. Constitution.

5|$|The {{second son}} of <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> parents, Carroll was educated in France {{as a lawyer}} before {{returning}} to England, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as Attorney General of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder George Calvert and his descendants intended it as a refuge for Catholics.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} {{preliminary}} pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers {{realized there was}} no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{decided that}} the train {{journeys}} and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick's College, Goulburn as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming {{a member of the}} school's rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams. He held a state record for the triple jump. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> {{are found}} in many {{countries}} around the world, especially in the English-speaking world. Emigration following the Famine in the late 1840s saw the population of Ireland drop from over 8 million to just over 4 million. In the United States, hostility and violence towards <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics,</b> together with Hispanic and Italian Catholics as well, were expressed through the Know Nothings and Nativist movement by the American Protestants (for future reference, see anti-Catholicism, anti-Irish sentiment, anti-Italianism, hispanophobia). Today, <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> are very well established in the United States and are part of mainstream American society.|$|R

He {{received}} 1,376,957 popular votes (second at 29%), but only 12 electoral votes (fourth and last at 4%), with Lincoln receiving 180. The support for Douglas in the North came from <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> and poorer farmers; in the South, <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholics</b> were his main supporters.|$|R
5|$|In 1935, O'Reilly took up an {{appointment}} at Sydney Grammar School, {{one of the}} leading private schools in the state, having been offered 50% paid leave for his cricket commitments. There he taught English, history and business. In 1939 he took a job in the sports store of close friend, teammate and fellow <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> Stan McCabe, which was located on George Street, the city centre's main thoroughfare. O'Reilly was a financial partner in the business, but following the outbreak of World War II, the sales revenue began to suffer and O'Reilly left as the store {{would not be able to}} support two stakeholders.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 Joseph S. Clark {{was elected}} {{as the first}} Democratic mayor in 80 years. Clark filled {{administration}} positions based on merit and worked to weed out corruption. Despite reforms and the Clark administration, a powerful Democratic patronage organization eventually replaced the old Republican one. Clark was succeeded by Richardson Dilworth, who continued the policies of his predecessor. Dilworth resigned {{to run for governor}} in 1962, and city council president James H. J. Tate was elected as the city's first <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> mayor. Tate was elected mayor in 1963 and reelected in 1967 despite opposition from reformers who opposed him as an organization insider.|$|E

Her parents, Winfield and Marjorie, raised their <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> middle-class family on Winfield’s salary as a bank credit manager and Marjorie's income as a registered nurse. She became a Girl Scout and won a scholarship to Marycrest Girls High School, a Catholic school in Colorado. While in high school, she won a Betty Crocker cooking award, wrote a regular column for the Denver Post, graduated as valedictorian and received a full scholarship to Brandeis University, a liberal arts school in Waltham, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic,</b> and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable <b>Irish</b> <b>Catholic</b> minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E
