40|$|To {{assess the}} state of {{knowledge}} regarding the effectiveness of distribution system disinfectant residuals during accidental microbial intrusions, the authors reviewed laboratory-, pilot-, and full-scale experimental studies. The persistence of microorganisms in the biofilms of simulated mains at the laboratory scale was much longer than in pilot-scale settings, under the typical disinfectant residual concentrations used in distribution systems. Most of the studies reviewed used culture-based methods for the enumeration of microorganisms, which are known to underestimate the number and diversity of microorganisms. Because the distribution system is the last barrier between the treatment plant and the consumer, intrusion is of concern to utility managers. Conditions experienced during some repairs—zero- or low-flow conditions and/or <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> of disinfection—are likely to be critical for the persistence of intruded microorganisms in the biofilm, a fact that {{underscores the importance of}} adequate chlorination and flushing procedures. For the research community, this review highlights the need for additional studies using methods (e. g. molecular tools) that allow the detection of viable but nonculturable microorganisms. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Endogenous opioids play an {{important}} role <b>in</b> regulating <b>reinstatement</b> of extinguished drug seeking. Ten experiments investigated the neuroanatomical locus for opioid regulation of renewal, alcohol-primed reinstatement, and re-acquisition of extinguished beer seeking response. Rats were trained to nose poke for alcoholic beer in a particular context. This response was extinguished in either an alternate context or in the same context. Recovery of responding was produced in one of three ways. In renewal, rats were returned to the acquisition context. <b>In</b> primed <b>reinstatement,</b> rats were allowed to consume a small amount of beer at the commencement of test. In reacquisition, rats were allowed to respond once more for alcoholic beer. Within each of these experiments three different challenges to opioid neurotransmission were applied: a systemic injection of the general opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, an infusion of the µ-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP into the accumbens shell, or a similar infusion into the ventral pallidum. Systemic naloxone attenuated renewal, primed reinstatement, and reacquisition. Intra-pallidal infusions of CTAP also attenuated all three forms of relapse; however intra-accumbal infusions reduced context-induced <b>reinstatement</b> only. <b>In</b> order to characterise the role of the ventral pallidum <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement,</b> active projections to this region during renewal were examined. The retrograde neuronal tracer Cholera Toxin-b subunit was injected into the pallidum of rats prior to training and testing for renewal. Retrograde-labelled neurons and c-Fos protein immunoreactivity within the accumbens shell and elsewhere in the brain were examined. Active projections specific to renewal were not found in the accumbens shell, however they were seen in the accumbens core, rostral basolateral amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that opioid receptors mediate the hedonic impact of ethanol and ethanol associated cues. While µ-opioid receptors in the accumbens shell play a more specific role <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> for context, the ventral pallidum may represent a final common locus for production of ethanol-seeking responding. The pathways recruited during context-induced reinstatement support and extend the current understanding the role of the ventral pallidum <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement,</b> showing that it is a site of convergence of striatal, thalamic and amygdala inputs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a two-paper {{investigation of}} the basic associative and arousal-based processes involved <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> of conditional fear. Clarifying the factors involved <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> of fear [...] a behavioral phenomenon in which the experience of an aversive event following fear extinction produces a return of fear [...] provides {{a better understanding of}} the factors that contribute to the waxing and waning of untreated fear and the return of fear following exposure treatment. Shedding light on the processes involved <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> of fear will contribute to the development of science-based interventions that offset return of fear following fear extinction and improve long term outcomes from exposure therapies for phobias and anxiety disorders. Study 1 compared the effects of physical pain versus social pain as a reinstating US on reinstatement of conditioned fear, and compared standard reinstatement (same acquisition and reinstatement US) with cross-US reinstatement (different acquisition and reinstatement US). Results indicated that <b>in</b> standard <b>reinstatement</b> procedures social pain produced differential reinstatement of conditional responding, while physical pain produced non-differential reinstatement (i. e., sensitization) in standard and cross-US reinstatement procedures. Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1, and investigated the role of CS+ belongingness on reinstating of fear. Combining data from both studies, the hypothesis was tested that greater physiological arousal experienced during the reinstatement would predict greater post-reinstatement return of conditional responding. Results replicated Study 1 findings, and found that CS+ belongingness may promote differential return of conditional responding in both standard and cross-US reinstatement. Additionally, findings indicated that higher arousal experienced during reinstatement predicts greater non-differential reinstatement, while concordance between arousal experienced during acquisition and <b>reinstatement</b> does not. <b>In</b> sum, these studies indicate that both social pain and physical pain can reinstate extinguished fear. Social pain promoted differential return of conditional responding (<b>in</b> standard <b>reinstatement)</b> while physical pain elicited a non-differential increase in responding in both standard and cross-US reinstatement. Unforeseen methodological issues may have muddled the findings regarding cross-US reinstatement with qualitatively distinct USs, while providing tentative evidence that individuals under chronic stress might be at elevated risk of an acute stressor triggering a return of fear generalized beyond the original feared stimulus...|$|R
40|$|The {{thalamus}} {{is considered}} an important interface between the ventral striatopallidum and the dorsal striatum, and may therefore contribute to compulsive drug-seeking behaviour. Recent {{evidence suggests that the}} paraventricular thalamus (PVT), a dorsal midline thalamic nucleus, and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) are involved in drug self-administration and respond to drug-associated cues. At present, however, the role of these thalamic regions <b>in</b> mediating cue-induced <b>reinstatement</b> of cocaine-seeking is unclear. Similarly, the habenula complex, part of the epithalamus, has been implicated in nicotine self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking, but the role of this region <b>in</b> cocaine <b>reinstatement</b> behaviour has received little attention. Rats (n= 20) were trained to self-administer cocaine in the presence of discriminative stimuli associated with drug availability (S +) or drug non-availability (S −). Once a stable level of responding was reached, lever pressing was extinguished. Animals were then tested for reinstatement and sacrificed immediately following the presentation of either the S − or S + discriminative stimuli, and Fos-protein expression was assessed in thalamic and epithalamic regions. Interestingly, significant variation was observed <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> behaviour, allowing a comparison between high-reinstating (HR), low-reinstating (LR) and control animals. Compared with LR animals, HR animals exhibited increased Fos-protein expression in the PVT, intermediodorsal thalamus and the medial and lateral divisions of the habenula. Our data provide evidence that activation of thalamic and epithalamic nuclei is associated with propensity to reinstate to cocaine-seeking elicited by drug-related cues. We also build upon existing data highlighting the importance of the PVT <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> behaviour...|$|R

Nevertheless, the potential association between early onset of drug use and higher rates of addiction in adulthood has not been thoroughly studied. In this series of experiments, we used a rodent model of adolescence and behavioral assessments of intravenous (i. v.) cocaine self-administration and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking to explore age differences in these cocaine-related behaviors, and then tested for the influence of environmental enrichment and for correlations between behavior and expression of plasticity genes. Male rats were trained to self-administer cocaine during either adolescence (adolescent-onset groups) or adulthood (adult-onset groups), and reinstatement of drug-seeking induced by cocaine or cocaine-associated cues was assessed after various durations of abstinence from cocaine intake.

The set of studies presented in this dissertation extended this limited evidence by identifying sex-dependent neural substrates correlated with meth-triggered reinstatement (Experiment 1) and by examining sex-differences <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> triggered by drugs of abuse that are commonly co-abused with meth (Experiment 2). Female and male rats were trained to self-administer meth, received subsequent extinction sessions, and then tested for <b>reinstatement.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 1, rats were perfused following reinstatement testing and c-Fos activity was examined as a measure of neural activation. Meth triggered <b>reinstatement</b> <b>in</b> both sexes and this effect was more robust in females compared to males.

In males, {{there were no significant differences}} following meth-primed <b>reinstatement.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 2, nicotine and cocaine were utilized as drug primes to determine if administration of these drugs could trigger meth-seeking behavior. Nicotine and cocaine reinstated meth-seeking behavior in male and female rats with no difference between the sexes. Females were more sensitive to reinstatement triggered with the original self-administration drug and this effect may not generalize to priming with other drugs of abuse. ...|$|R

40|$|Rational and {{objectives}} Neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic peptide that is released {{during periods of}} food restriction, {{has been shown to}} have a significant modulatory impact on drug-related behaviors. We have previously reported that both acute food deprivation (FD) and NPY injections can reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behavior, a proposed animal model of relapse to drug abuse. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the FD effect on drug seeking is dependent on NPY transmission. Here, we used the reinstatement model to assess the role of NPY Y 1 and Y 5 -receptor-mediated transmission <b>in</b> FD-induced <b>reinstatement</b> of heroin seeking. Methods Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 10 – 12 days (0. 1 mg/kg/infusion/intravenous). Animals then underwent extinction training followed by drug-seeking reinstatement tests under 21 h of FD and sated conditions. Results Injections of a novel NPY Y 5 -receptor antagonist, Lu AA 33810 (0. 0, 1. 0, or 30. 0 mg/kg/IP), resulted in a significant attenuation of FD-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking. However, no significant effects on reinstatement were found for the Y 1 -receptor antagonist, BIBO 3304 (0. 0, 5. 0, or 10. 0 nmol/intracerebroventricular). Conclusions These results suggest that while signals mediated through NPY Y 1 receptors play a modest role <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement,</b> activation of Y 5 receptors has a critical function <b>in</b> FD-induced <b>reinstatement</b> of heroin-seeking behavior...|$|R

The present study examined the role of -adrenergic receptor subtypes in the stressor-induced rein-statement of extinguished cocaine-induced (15 mg/kg i. p.) con-ditioned place preference in mice. Forced swim (6 min at 22 °C) stress or activation of central noradrenergic neurotransmis-sion by administration of the selective 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist 2 -[(4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl) methyl]- 2, 3 -dihydro- 1 -methyl- 1 H-isoindole (BRL- 44, 408) (10 mg/kg i. p.) induced <b>reinstatement</b> <b>in</b> wild-type, but not - adrenergic receptor-deficient Adrb 1 /Adrb 2 double-knockout, mice. In contrast, cocaine administration (15 mg/kg i. p.) resulted <b>in</b> <b>reinstatement</b> <b>in</b> both wild-type and -adrenergic receptor knockout mice. Stress-induced reinstatement probably in-volved 2 adrenergic receptors. The 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist-(isopropylamino) - 1 -[(7 -methyl- 4 -indanyl) oxy]bu-tan- 2 -ol (ICI- 118, 551) (1 or 2 mg/kg i. p.) blocked reinstate-ment by forced swim or BRL- 44, 408, whereas administration of the nonselective -adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (2 or 4 mg/kg i. p.) or the 2 adrenergic receptor-selective agonist clenbuterol (2 or 4 mg/kg i. p.) induced reinstatement. Forced swim-induced, but not BRL- 44, 408 -induced, reinstate-ment was also blocked by a high (20 mg/kg) but not low (10 mg/kg) dose of the 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist betaxolol, and isoproterenol-induced reinstatement was blocked by pre-treatment with either ICI- 118, 551 or betaxolol, suggesting a potential cooperative role for 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors <b>in</b> stress-induced <b>reinstatement.</b> Overall, {{these findings suggest that}} targeting -adrenergic receptors may represent a promis-ing pharmacotherapeutic strategy for preventing drug relapse, particularly in cocaine addicts whose drug use is stress related...|$|R

We studied the effect of the dual antidepressant milnacipran on ethanol operant self-administration in acutely withdrawn ethanol-dependent and in -non-dependent Wistar rats, and used fluoxetine and desipramine to dissect both 5 -HT and NE components, respectively, in the effect of milnacipran. Milnacipran was also tested for relapse after protracted abstinence and on ethanol-induced (1. 0 [*]g/kg) conditioned place preference in control rats and ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization in DBA/ 2 J female mice. Milnacipran dose dependently (5 – 40 [*]mg/kg) attenuated the increased ethanol self-administration observed during early withdrawal and was more potent <b>in</b> preventing <b>reinstatement</b> <b>in</b> dependent rats after protracted abstinence as compared with non-dependent rats. Desipramine and fluoxetine (10 [*]mg/kg) blocked ethanol self-administration during early withdrawal, and recovery was <b>delayed</b> <b>in</b> dependent animals, indicating a potent effect. Ethanol self-administration was also reduced 1 day after treatment with desipramine and fluoxetine but not with milnacipran. Finally, milnacipran prevented ethanol-induced place preference in ethanol-naive rats and reduced the magnitude of ethanol-induced sensitization associated with a <b>delayed</b> induction <b>in</b> mice. Desipramine (20 [*]mg/kg) countered sensitization development and reduced its expression at 1 week after treatment; fluoxetine (10 [*]mg/kg) reduced sensitization expression. Thus, 5 -HT and NE transmissions during sensitization expression may mediate the effect of milnacipran on sensitization induction.
