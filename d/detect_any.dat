5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of the Phantoms was {{undertaken}} by No.482 Squadron and No.3 Aircraft Depot, {{both of which}} were located at Amberley. In addition to routine servicing, these units modified the Phantoms' AN/APQ-120 radars during early 1971. In response to problems detected during maintenance, RAAF technical personnel checked all the aircraft for defects to their emergency flap system in September 1971 and used X-ray testing to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> cracks in their stabilators during early 1972.|$|E

5|$|Observations of 55 Cancri A in the {{submillimeter}} {{region of}} the spectrum have thus far failed to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not exclude {{the presence of an}} asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.|$|E
5|$|When Dexter visits Rita {{the next}} morning, Gail—who {{suspects}} {{that he is}} hiding something—announces {{that she will be}} staying in Miami and will live with Rita. Dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets, so he begins by cleaning his boat that night with a black light to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> blood. He is unaware that the marina is being videotaped by the Miami-Metro Police, who believe that the Bay Harbor Butcher may be keeping his boat at that marina.|$|E
5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots.|$|E

5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted {{a bright}} star (HIP106829) with a visible {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and ephemeris, and to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, {{it would have to be}} far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} in the 1900s gave the first {{clues about the}} Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been thought. Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde. Radar observations of Venus were first {{carried out in the}} 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the modern value.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{planes were}} {{initially}} only fitted at the stern, but additional planes were {{mounted on the}} conning tower during construction of B1, B2, and B3; B4 was not fitted with them and it is uncertain if the remaining boats received them during construction. These greatly improved the boats' depth-keeping, surfacing and diving abilities compared to the A-class boats. These were later exchanged for bow planes; the last boat to receive them was B6, which did not get hers until January 1916. The B-class submarines lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed the crew to the petrol engine's exhaust fumes. In fact mice were used to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the hull. Ventilation was provided for the batteries, but none for the crew's living area. No accommodations were provided for the crew and {{they were forced to}} improvise while at sea. In recognition of this issue, the crew's endurance was only expected to be four days during the summer and three days during the winter.|$|E

5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E
5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E

5|$|Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator, dreams of being interviewed {{by a woman}} off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has {{standards}} and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him {{to the scene of}} the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar, but he insists that they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to <b>detect</b> <b>any</b> further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
