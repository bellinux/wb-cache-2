40|$|Fa?ade heating is {{a special}} {{application}} of radiant heating and cooling technology and is used to enhance the indoor comfort level of offices, hotels and museums. Mullion radiators are typically used to implement fa?ade heating. This paper analyzes the heat transfer process of facade heating (mullion radiators) in a pilot research project in Pittsburgh, PA. The heat transfer model for facade heating is developed and verified by measured data. The comparison shows that the heat transfer model predicts the measured temperatures with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>return</b> temperature, the mullion surface temperature, and the window surface temperature of 0. 90 ?F, 0. 98 ?F and 1. 15 ?F, respectively. The factors which affect the heating capacity of mullion radiators have been analyzed. The analysis shows that the supply water temperature is the primary factor which affects the heating or cooing capacity of window mullions and the mullion surface temperature. Return water temperature and mullion surface temperature are quasi-linear functions often water supply temperature. Mullion surface temperature, indoor air temperature gradient on the glazing surface within one foot from mullions {{is much higher than}} in {{the central part of the}} window. The temperatures in the central 2 feet of a 4 -foot window show almost no influence by the mullion surface temperature. Also, the conductive thermal resistance of the mullion double tubes with fillings between two tubes plays a decisive role in controlling the mullion and window frame temperatures...|$|E

For <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> heating direct <b>return</b> system, {{the common}} {{hydraulic}} calculation method in engineering design is constant temperature drop method，which is {{calculated from the}} farthest riser loop. Due to the limit of the minimum pipe size, the method is usually difficult to achieve the hydraulic balance for every riser loop, and it needs the utilization of valves to meet the need. In this paper, through a calculation example, it has explained that every riser loop {{is very easy to}} achieve hydraulic balance without the utilization of valves when the system is calculated from the nearest riser loop.

This consists of determining the total heat transfer from the service <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> system piping to the surrounding environment. The heat transfer is then used to define the total pumping capacity based on a given temperature change in the circulating <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> as it flows through the closed loop piping system. The total pumping capacity is used to select a pump model from manufacturer's literature. This established the head generation for that capacity and particular pump model. The total length of all <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply and <b>return</b> piping including fittings is then estimated from the plumbing drawings which defines the pipe friction losses that must fit within the available pump head. Several iterations may be required before a pump can be selected that satisfies the head-capacity requirements...|$|R

Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> line siphoning in open-loop <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> circulation systems which utilize the cold <b>water</b> line to <b>return</b> <b>water</b> back to the <b>water</b> heater. <b>Hot</b> <b>Water</b> Line Siphoning occurs when water from within the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> line siphons or is forced into the cold water line due to differences in water pressure between the <b>hot</b> and cold <b>water</b> lines.
