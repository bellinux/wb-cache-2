50|$|Firm services, {{also called}} {{uninterruptible}} services, are services, such as electricity {{and natural gas}} supplies, that are intended to be available at all times during a period covered by an agreement. Also, the service {{is not subject to}} a prior claim from another customer and receives the same priority as any other firm service. Conditional firm service is similar to firm service in that it is reserved and has priority over <b>interruptible</b> <b>service.</b> However, it can have restrictions, such as times when it would be curtailed before firm service but after <b>interruptible</b> <b>service.</b> The cost per unit with this service is called a firm rate or uninterruptible rate. The opposite of firm service is non-firm service, also called <b>interruptible</b> <b>service</b> or as-available service. The cost per unit for this service is called a non-firm rate or interruptible rate. The interruptible load is the portion of a utility's load that comes from customers with <b>interruptible</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{modeling}} framework for analyzing if {{the use of}} <b>interruptible</b> transportation <b>services</b> can improve capacity utilization in a natural gas transportation network. The network consists of two decision makers: the transmission system operator (TSO) and a shipper of natural gas. The TSO {{is responsible for the}} routing of gas in the network and allocates capacity to the shipper to ensure that the security of supply in the network is within given bounds. The TSO can offer two different types of transportation services: firm and <b>interruptible.</b> Only firm <b>services</b> have a security of supply measure, while the <b>interruptible</b> <b>services</b> can freely be interrupted whenever the available capacity in the transportation network is not sufficiently large. We apply our modeling framework on a case study with realistic data from the Norwegian Continental Shelf.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} optimal {{procurement}} of <b>interruptible</b> load <b>services</b> within secondary reserve ancillary service markets in deregulated power systems. The proposed model {{is based on}} an optimal power flow framework and can aid the independent system operator (ISO) in real-time selection of interruptible load offers. The structure of the market is also proposed for implementation. Various issues associated with procurement of interruptible load such as advance notification, locational aspect of load, and power factor of the loads are explicitly considered. It is shown that interruptible load market can help the ISO maintain operating reserves during peak load periods. Econometric analysis reveals that a close relationship exits between the reserve level and amount of <b>interruptible</b> load <b>service</b> invoked. It was also found that at certain buses, market power exists with the loads, and that could lead to unwanted inefficiencies in the market.

40|$|The {{electric}} power industry {{has become increasingly}} interested in the value customers place upon service reliability, with the demand for reliability couched in terms of outage or shortage costs. The survey-based method of eliciting these costs dominates the literature. This paper explores and demonstrates a method for estimating outage and shortage costs based upon behavioral data. A discrete choice model is developed for estimating shortage costs using observed decisions of industrial customers regarding participation in <b>interruptible</b> <b>service</b> programs. The resulting shortage cost estimates of $ 4 per kWh unserved for a one-hour interruption are consistent with previous survey-based estimates. ...|$|E

In particular, we propose a new contract form that bundles simple forwards with exotic call options that have two exercise points with different strike prices. Such options allow hedging and valuation of supply curtailment risk, while explicitly accounting for the notification lead time before curtailment. The proposed instruments are priced under the traditional GBM price process assumption and under the more realistic assumption (for electricity markets) of a mean reverting price process with jumps.

40|$|We develop {{rules for}} pricing and {{capacity}} choice for an <b>interruptible</b> <b>service</b> that recognise the interdependence between consumers' perceptions of system reliability and their market behaviour. Consumers post ex ante demands, {{based on their}} expectations on aggregate demand. Posted demands are met if ex post supply capacity is sufficient. However, if supply is inadequate all ex ante demands are proportionally interrupted. Consumers' expectations of aggregate demand {{are assumed to be}} rational. Under reasonable values for the consumer's degrees of relative risk aversion and prudence, demand is decreasing in supply reliability. We derive operational expressions for the optimal pricing rule and the capacity expansion rule. We show that the optimal price under uncertainty consists of the optimal price under certainty plus a markup that positively depends on the degrees of relative risk aversion, relative prudence and system reliability. We also show that any reliability enhancing investment - though lowering the operating surplus of the public utility - is socially desirable as long as it covers the cost of investment.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{trade-offs}} among purchases, storage, and service reliability decisions faced by natural gas distribution utilities. The short-term demand {{for natural gas}} fluctuates because of the weather. To encourage load leveling, the pipeline transmission companies that supply the utilities use a demand contract that charges utilities based on their peak day needs and often charge for a minimum daily purchase requirement whether that purchase is made or not. The policy variables available to the utility include increasing its storage capacity and providing <b>interruptible</b> <b>service</b> to some customers thereby lowering reliability of service. There are also technological constraints on the maximum storage gas flows. To explore these trade-offs, a chance-constrained cost minimization problem is formulated. Two decision rules for gas purchases and storage operation are examined. In these rules, an initial decision is made {{at the beginning of}} each month about either the level of purchases or the level of storage flow for that month. The two rules differ in that the supplier is assumed either to be able to adjust sales during the month up to the limit set by the demand contract or to be inflexible. In the latter case, storage must provide flexibility for meeting demand. Solutions have been obtained under the conditions that apply to the East Ohio Gas Company. A large number of cases have been considered for several levels of increased storage capacity, decreased reliability of service, and conversion capability from gas to oil for commercial and industrial customers. The results show the breakeven points in storage costs under which various policies become feasible and the savings that can be achieved. industries: petroleum/natural gas, inventory/production: capacity, programming: chance constrained...|$|E
40|$|The cloud {{computing}} services market exhibits unique {{characteristics such as}} instant accessibility, fluctuating demand and supply, and <b>interruptible</b> <b>service</b> provision. Various pricing mechanisms exist in current industry practice. None of these pricing mechanisms, however, is comprehensive enough to capture all these features {{in a way that}} allows the vendors to optimize resource allocation. This dissertation identifies key factors related to {{cloud computing}} pricing, and examines their interplays. This research uses multiple approaches, including a market survey, game theory modeling, simulation, lab experiments and econometric modeling, to analyze the pricing strategy of cloud services vendors. A field study of a representative set of cloud vendors’ pricing approaches provides background information to motivate this dissertation. Important factors in current cloud pricing practice are highlighted. This part of the work offers an overview of how cloud computing services are priced and how the pricing approaches have evolved over time. This is important for identifying the causes of confusion among clients regarding the pricing of cloud computing services, especially when new pricing methods emerge. The following study reports on an analytical model and simulations to derive optimal pricing strategies for a monopoly cloud services vendor that operates in the re-served and spot-price services market. Although interruptible spot services potentially cause undesired consequences for clients, the cloud services vendor can improve its profit by offering low quality interruptible spot-price services, together with high quality fixed-price reserved services. The last study examines clients’ willingness-to-pay for brokered cloud services offered with a hybrid pricing mechanism in the presence of fixed-price reserved and spot-price on-demand services through behavioral experiments. This study yields two findings. First, subjects’ willingness-to-pay is affected by their informedness of the service interruption risk associated with spot-price on-demand services. Second, this effect is moderated by their aversion to risk...|$|E
30|$|Demand {{response}} can {{be divided}} into the following two categories [22, 23]: Non-dispatchable (price-based) DR load such as time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing require, and dispatchable (incentive- based) DR load such as direct load control and <b>interruptible</b> load <b>service,</b> etc. Dispatchable DR is easier to be implemented and allows more certainties in the planning stage compared with non-dispatchable DR. Reference [24] applied the direct load control method to a planning model as a virtual active generator with example of an air condition load, a kind of controllable one. Reference [25] used a real-time electricity model to construct a planning scheme for low carbon policy. The integration of controllable load or demand response has great effect on the peak load shifting, and it obviously has much more positive effect on the ADS planning, such as investment deferral, increase of renewable energy in the system [26], etc.|$|R
30|$|Gas-fired units consume {{natural gas}} to {{generate}} electricity, {{which leads to the}} growing reliance of the power system on the natural gas system in recent years. Accordingly, several concerns on the interdependency and reliability of both energy systems need be considered. ① Unlike coal and fuel oil, natural gas is usually not stored on-site. That is, gas-fired units rely on real-time delivery of natural gas fuel through the natural gas network. ② Residential gas loads have higher priorities than industrial gas-fired power plants. Thus, peak demands of natural gas end-users would significantly affect the delivery of <b>interruptible</b> gas transportation <b>service</b> to gas-fired power plants. ③ As an inspiring feature for offering flexible dispatch and fast ramping capabilities, gas-fired units are expected {{to play an important role}} in offsetting variability and uncertainty associated with renewable resources. In turn, the natural gas network needs to provide enhanced operational flexibility for meeting volatile gas demands of gas-fired units.|$|R
40|$|An {{agent-based}} model, the Driver Vehicle Use Decision (DVUD) model, {{was developed}} that uses simple assumptions about travel demand and statistical information on travel by U. S. drivers. From these, and {{data on the}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the fuel supply network and from electric utilities, the electricity and fuel demand and the resulting GHG emissions are estimated. This model represents a population of drivers as agents, some of whom drive plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Driver agents make decisions about how frequently to drive trips and when to recharge their PHEV batteries. In deciding whether to take trips, driver agents consider their schedule and travel cost. They also consider cost, location and planned length of time they will stay at a location when deciding whether to recharge their PHEV batteries. This enables the agents to respond to changes in electricity rates and gasoline prices and to constraints on when (time of day) and where (home or both home and work) they can recharge PHEV batteries. For a fleet penetration of 50 % by PHEVs in Michigan, with a total fleet of 7. 3 million vehicles, gasoline consumption is projected to decrease from 11. 4 million gallons per day to 7. 4 million gallons per day. Total fuel-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from the fleet are projected to decrease from 128, 000 metric tons CO 2 eq/day to 95, 000 metric tons CO 2 eq/day. Peak electricity demand for PHEV charging is projected to reach about 1400 MW. Most PHEV charging is projected to occur overnight, with the peak in charging demand occurring soon after most drivers get home in the evening. Model results show that PHEV drivers are less sensitive to changes in gasoline prices than drivers of less fuel-efficient conventional vehicles. Response to changes in electricity prices is more complex, with drivers showing little or no response at low electricity rates, but not charging at all at very high electricity rates, depending {{on the price of}} gasoline and the efficiency of their vehicle. Under <b>interruptible</b> electricity <b>service,</b> in which the electric utility shuts off power to PHEV chargers during peak demand hours, nearly all PHEV owners were able to fully charge their vehicles overnight, and there was very little impact on PHEV operating cost, indicating that this may be a feasible approach to managing increased electric demand for PHEV charging...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} data collected from gas service providers and end-use customers in the six New England States and offers a preliminary assessment {{of the impact of}} interruptible gas customers on the distillate fuel oil market this past winter. Based on information collected and analyzed as of October 2000, the main findings areas follows: (1) For interruptible gas customers with distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel, their volume of interruptions was equivalent to about 1 to 2 percent of the total sales of distillate fuel oil in New England during January-February 2000. For the two peak weeks of gas supply interruptions, however, the equivalent volume of distillate fuel oil amounted to an estimated 3 to 6 percent of total sales in New England. There were no interruptions of the natural gas service during the 2 -month period. (2) Purchases of distillate fuel oil by interruptible gas customers may have contributed somewhat to the spike in the price of distillate fuel oil in January-February 2000, especially during the peak weeks of gas interruptions. Nevertheless, other factors [...] a sudden drop in temperatures, low regional stocks of distillate fuels, and weather-related supply problems during a period of high customer demand [...] appear to have {{played a significant role in}} this price spike, as they have in previous spikes. (3) While this preliminary analysis suggests that interruptible natural gas service does not threaten the stability of the home heating oil market, several steps might be taken-without undermining the benefits of <b>interruptible</b> <b>service</b> [...] to reduce the potential adverse impacts of gas supply interruptions in times of market stress. Regardless of the magnitude of the impact of distillate fuel oil purchases by interruptible gas customers on Northeast heating oil markets, the threat of future heating oil price spikes and supply problems still remains. To help counter the threat, President Clinton in July 2000 directed Secretary Richardson to establish a heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast, and 2 million barrels of heating oil are now stored in the reserve. Other possible policy options are outlined...|$|E
40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this work is: “It is possible to operate future Norwegian natural gas transportation systems {{at a level that}} is approximately optimal, technically and economically, with major stakeholders duly attending to requirements specified in the Norwegian statutory framework and in the implemented “Gas Directive. ” In order to test this hypothesis a multidisciplinary systems approach has been applied that includes analyses based on fluidmechanics and thermodynamics, economic theory and constrained by the prevailing and future legislative requirements. Operational experiences and empirical data also support the analyses. It is assumed {{in this work}} that the introduction of the European Union’s Gas Directive will result in some new or altered legal requirements for how to conduct future Norwegian natural gas transport operations. The work has identified these new requirements and the work has suggested realistic solutions for how to conduct future operations. The author therefore concludes that the main hypothesis above is true provided five recommendations are observed. The first recommendation is to implement into the Norwegian legislation provisions that make possible two core requirements of the Gas Directive. The first provision is to allow domestic gas sellers to compete in the downstream market by marketing and selling their gas individually. The second provision is to allow access to the transportation systems for those stakeholders who according to the Gas Directive are defined as “eligible customers” and “natural gas undertakings”, i. e. the future shippers. The second recommendation follows as consequence of the latter provision and it recommends the future Norwegian regulatory regime to incorporate three main features. First, the transportation system is to be operated by an organization unit that has a transparent account on its transportation services or alternatively by an organization (i. e. the operator) that is functionally separated from and does not participate in any gas marketing and sales activities. Secondly, and {{due to the fact that}} the Norwegian natural gas transportation systems are highly physically integrated it is recommended to have one and only one transportation system operator. Only one operator will be in the best position to enhance cost efficiency in daily operations, energy efficiency, resource management in daily operations, optimized utilization and optimized gas blending. Thirdly, new and altered transportation services must be designed to meet the future needs and requirements of the shippers and these services must be offered to all shippers. The latter feature is elaborated in the third recommendation. The third recommendation is to redefine and develop new transportation services that support shippers’ elastic demands for transportation services, both during periods of sufficient capacity as well as during peak load periods. The above recommendation will imply that the future transportation services must comprise firm services i. e. booked and guaranteed transportation, and <b>interruptible</b> <b>services</b> i. e. transportation being interrupted either during off-peak periods or during peak periods as well as peak load services i. e. transportation services offered during peak load periods. The services must be offered to all shippers in an equal and impartial manner and be supported by a transparent and feasible tariff and toll regime. The toll regime must feature several properties that ensure recovery of fixed costs, cost efficiency in operations and maintenance, and rationing efficiency and this work recommends that the future toll regime shall be reasonable and fair and cost-based. This work has identified that the existing toll regime does not feature all of the above properties and this work therefore suggests that the existing toll regime is re-designed and extended to include new elements. The first recommendation is to re-design the existing toll formula so that it acts as a two-part toll for firm capacity. The fixed part of the toll shall act as a booking charge or capacity charge and it shall cover the financial costs based on the historic investment costs for the pipeline systems. It shall also include the fixed (annual) operations and maintenance costs, and any new costs for incremental new investments. The variable part of the toll may be set equal to average marginal costs per unit of gas, or be paid “in kind” as done in the current regime. Further, a unitization of the fixed part of the firm toll is suggested here. The unitization shall include all pipelines that comprise the dry gas system. This means that the fixed part of the firm toll shall be calculated as an average fixed toll based on the historic investment costs for all the pipelines included. The unitization schema shall include the existing ship-or-pay contracts and any new firm contracts in the dry gas system. The unitization will accomplish a possibility for eliminating specific shipper’s preferences for where to physically route gas in the dry gas system. This will subsequently improve rationing efficiency at high levels of utilization of the system when there is a concurrent need for auctioning of spare capacity. This is due to the physical behavior of the integrated system as any “internal” pre-booked routing in the system effectively may reduce the total throughput and thus a rationing efficient utilization of the system. The above recommendations mean that the firm toll shall be charged as a “postage-stamp” toll for all pipeline systems comprising the dry gas systems. This means in practical terms that the dry gas system is to be considered as one zone only and pre-defined entry points and exit points must be established. As a consequence of unitizing the toll for firm capacity either a unitization of the ownership structure must be done or a payment mechanism must be in force that secures the pipeline owners no extra profit or loss due to the introduction of unitization. A new two-part toll formula that in its form is equal to the firm capacity toll is recommended for covering <b>interruptible</b> off-peak <b>services.</b> It is recommended to set the fixed part of the toll lower than the fixed part of the firm toll. A new toll must be developed and be based on auctioning principles for allocation of spare capacity in the system during peak load periods. In order to facilitate the auction a tool is required for predicting the level of spare capacity that is available from time to time. This tool is also needed for optimizing the total throughput based on the different auction bids. In a similar manner as for the firm toll, the auction bids shall refer to a unitized dry gas system and the bids shall refer to transportation requests between any of the pre-defined entry and exits points. No shipper shall thus have a right to specify “internal” routing in the dry gas system. The total revenues for the pipeline system owners shall not yield higher profits than the allowable regulated return and the balance shall be levied – at least in theory – the firm transportation shippers only. It is recommended to conduct such reallocations of revenues periodically. The fourth recommendation is related to the necessity of changing documents and requirements, altering organizational forms and working processes, and how current incentive structures will be affected. All these issues will be influenced by an implementation of the Gas Directive. The work has briefly discussed these issues, but due to the many uncertainties no detailed assessments are conducted or recommendations given. The work has however indicated that a majority of the documents assessed in this work must be revised and updated to reflect the new requirements caused by liberalization. It is recommended here that the governing documents more clearly specify which new responsibilities the independent transportation system operator shall be assigned. A vital area of concern is how the transportation system operator and the shippers’ and sellers’ dispatching representatives shall communicate and perform their duties in the future. To day these functions are highly integrated, but liberalization will make them counterparts. Further, a detailed specification of the future working processes for the independent transportation system operator must be clarified. This applies especially for the how to optimize the operations in a liberalized context. New and carefully designed incentives are needed for enhancing optimal usage of the network during capacity constraints. The last recommendation regards allocative and dynamic efficiency in a liberalized context. In the prevailing regime the individual company acts normally both as shipper and pipeline system owner. This regime ensures proper incentives for cost efficient development of new capacity and cost efficient operations and this regime may continue to exist in a liberalized context. This regime will continue to create proper incentives for allocative and dynamic efficiently in a liberalized context as well. Further, in order to enhance allocative and dynamic efficiency on the Norwegian Continental Shelf a centralized planning and development system must be in force in order to secure resource management and utilization of the significant conditions for economy of scale. The transportation system operator must have a close liaison with these functions in order to share information about operational experiences, capacity constraints and shadow prices on capacity of constraints. Finally, the work has provided several observations that show how a systems approach is quite attractive for finding solutions to complex and multidisciplinary problems as considered in this work. The systems approach applied here consists of two engineering processes comprising well-defined activities. These activities comprise assessment of information, definition of effectiveness measures and creation of information models. Trade-offs are identified between contradicting requirements and the outcome of the processes is accurate descriptions of the systems operations in the prevailing context and to some extent also in a future context. The systems engineering processes have included several methodologies to solve specific tasks. Several analyses based on economic and technical theories are included, as imperative activities required for solving the problems. The ultimate results of a systems approach are solutions that go beyond traditional and non-disciplinary approaches. This is particularly true if the objective is to find concrete and sound solutions applicable in a “real-world” context where specific stakeholders’ needs and legal requirements are present and well defined. Several observations are provided in the work showing how economic analyses are improved by combining them with technical theory, empirical data, operational experiences and last but not least: legal requirements. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|Power {{companies}} world-wide {{have been}} restructuring their electric power systems from a vertically integrated entity to a deregulated, open-market environment. Previously, electric utilities usually sought {{to maximize the}} social welfare of the system with distributional equity as its main operational criterion. The operating paradigm was based on achieving the least-cost system solution while meeting reliability and security margins. This often resulted in investments in generating capacity operating at very low capacity factors. Decommissioning {{of this type of}} generating capacity was a natural outcome when the vertically integrated utilities moved over to deregulated market operations. The erstwhile objective of maximizing social welfare with distributional equity was then replaced by a profit-maximizing objective with efficiency as the main criterion for the generating companies. As a consequence, power producers are no longer responsible for the system reliability margins in deregulated markets. Additionally, new investments in generating capacity are not easily forthcoming since private investors look for a high rate of return of capital employed, which becomes increasingly difficult to ensure in a competitive environment. These factors, being a consequence of deregulation, have triggered a need for the research and implementation of interruptible load management - ILM. In an ILM program, the customer enters into a contract with the independent system operator (ISO) to reduce its demand as and when requested. The ISO benefits in having additional reserve for its security management services, while the customer benefits from reduction in energy costs and from incentives provided by the contract. Though this concept is not new, it has attained a new significance because of the deregulation. This thesis proposes a model for a competitive market for interruptible load customers where they can offer to reduce (a part of) their demand, as an ancillary service provision to be procured by the ISO. The operational objective of the proposed market would be minimizing the total ILM procurement costs while satisfying the system operational constraints. It is shown that an interruptible load market can help the ISO to maintain the operating reserves during peak load periods. Econometric analysis reveals that a close relationship exits between the reserve level and the amount of <b>interruptible</b> load <b>service</b> invoked. It was also found that at certain buses, market power could exist which may lead to unwanted inefficiencies in the market. Investing in generation capacity at such buses can mitigate this. The thesis also examines the role of interruptible load during contingencies and peak demand in the power system. In particular the ability of the interruptible load market in providing transmission congestion relief is analysed. In the proposed congestion management scheme, interruptible loads can specifically identify those load buses where corrective measures are needed for relieving congestion in a particular transmission corridor. While examining the role of interruptible load in providing for congestion management, it is necessary to arrive at a long-term solution for persistent congestions, i. e., bottlenecks in the system. An answer to this, is investment in reserve generation at strategic locations in order to provide for efficient congestion relief. Long-term investment needs for fast start-up generators that can alleviate transmission bottlenecks and provide additional operating reserves were investigated by a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and a least-cost optimization scheme...|$|R
