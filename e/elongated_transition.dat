40|$|Based on 424 {{qualitative}} {{interviews with}} a racially, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse population {{of young people}} {{ranging in age from}} 21 to 38, the authors ponder the paradox of the evolving role for contem porary mar-riage within the developmental perspective of the transition to adulthood. The authors identify two groups: marriage naturalists and marriage planners. Naturalists comprise one fifth of the sample, are largely from rural America, and follow the fast-track into marriage that defined the mid-twentieth centu-ry. Planners comprise the remainder of the sample, are based in metropolitan areas, and follow an <b>elongated</b> <b>transition</b> to adulthood. The authors examine the views of each group on commitment and the nature of relationships, and apply their findings to the debates about whether marriage is resilient, in decline, or becoming deinstitutionalized...|$|E
40|$|Structure and {{substrate}} {{activation of}} bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase were investigated when the enzyme {{was in its}} native state or was covalently bound via primary amino groups to a solid Sepharose bead. In this research, the enzyme was covalently bound directly to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B or indirectly, via a six-carbon spacer arm, to CH-activated Sepharose 4 B. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy was employed to study structure. This study required spin labeling glutamate dehydrogenase with either 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 - oxopiperidine- 1 -oxyl or 4 ((4 -(chloromercurio) benzoyl) amino) - 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -piperidinyloxy. Substrate activation of the deamination of glutamate by NAD was visible in Lineweaver-Burk plots of inverse rate vs. inverse substrate concentration. The electron spin resonance spectrum of glutamate dehydrogenase spin labeled with 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -oxopiperidine- 1 -oxyl was a composite consisting primarily of two populations of spin labels with outer peak separations of 33 gauss (population A) and 69 gauss (population B). For the native enzyme in solution, population A accounted for 10 % of the spectrum. This percentage increased to 21 when the active site was saturated with substrates during spin labeling and increased to 34 when the enzyme was immobilized to either CNBror CH-activated Sepharose. The roles of aspecific labeling and structural heterogeneity in these spectral changes were discussed. Modification of the native and immobilized enzyme with pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate characterized the binding site(s) for the spin label. Deconvolution of experimental spectra into populations A and B divulged a subpopulation of labels with a mobility unlike those of the two principal components. Linear combinations of the deconvoluted line shapes for populations A and B successfully represented all spectra of glutamate dehydrogenase from this and previous investigations. Conformational change in glutamate dehydrogenase was investigated by spin labeling the enzyme at cysteine 319 with 4 ((4 -(chloromercurio) benzoyl) - amino) - 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -piperidinyloxy. Electron spin resonance spectra of spin-labeled glutamate dehydrogenase showed that immobilization of the enzyme on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B suppressed conformational change induced by GTP and NADPH and profoundly altered that induced by aketoglutarate. Moreover, the spectrum of the immobilized enzyme provides evidence for structural heterogeneity at cysteine 319. Covalently binding glutamate dehydrogenase to CNBr- and CH-activated Sepharose 4 B altered the substrate activation pattern of the biocatalyst. Specifically, the sharp discontinuity, which characterizes Lineweaver-Burk plots of free enzyme kinetics with NAD as the varied substrate, became elongated when the biocatalyst was attached to either support. The <b>elongated</b> <b>transition</b> region contains two inflection points and resembles substrate activation of several other allosteric oligomers. Under the same experimental conditions, glutamate induced varying degrees of abrupt activation in immobilized glutamate dehydrogenase and inhibited the enzyme in solution. The intensity of this activation is inversely proportional to the rate constant of the biocatalyst-Sepharose conugate. These modified activation patterns may be {{due in part to}} increased structural heterogeneity and altered conformational change. The above kinetic results are free of mass transport effects: the external effectiveness factor was unity, the observable Thiele modulus was less than 2. 0 • 10 [superscript - 4], and reaction- generated pH change was less than 0. 01 for all data reported in this paper...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{polarization}} properties of emission lines from single InGaN/GaN quantum dots (QDs). The QDs, formed by spinodal decomposition within ultra-thin InGaN quantum wells, are investigated using single-QD cathodoluminescence (CL). The emission lines exhibit a systematic linear polarization in the orthogonal crystal directions [1 1 - 2 0] and [- 1 1 0 0] [...] a symmetry that is non-native to hexagonal crystals. Eight-band k. p calculations reveal a mechanism that can explain the observed polarizations: The character of the hole(s) in an excitonic complex determines the polarization direction of the respective emission if the QD is slightly <b>elongated.</b> <b>Transitions</b> involving A-band holes are polarized parallel to the elongation; transitions involving B-type holes are polarized in the orthogonal direction. The energetic separation of both hole states is smaller than 10 meV. The mechanism leading to the linear polarizations is not restricted to InGaN QDs, but should occur in other wurtzite-nitride QDs and in materials with similar valence band structure. Comment: Conf.

40|$|Using {{high-speed}} {{video recording}} and {{the method of}} dual laser scanning the gas-liquid flow was investigated in rectangular microchannels with an aspect ratio of 2. 35 and 1. 26. Experiments were earned out for the vertical flow of ethanol-nitrogen mixture in a microchannel with {{a cross section of}} 553 × 235 µm and for the horizontal flow of water-nitrogen mixture in a microchannel with a cross section of 315 × 250 µm. The T-mixer was used at the channel's inlet for gas-liquid flow formation. It was observed that <b>elongated</b> bubble, <b>transition,</b> and annular flows are the main regimes for a microchannel with a hydraulic diameter substantially less than the capillary constant.

40|$|The {{initiation}} of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a multistage process. X-ray crystal structures of transcription complexes containing short RNAs reveal three structural states: one with 2 - and 3 -nucleotide RNAs, {{in which only}} the 3 '-end of the RNA is detectable; a second state with 4 - and 5 -nucleotide RNAs, with an RNA-DNA hybrid in a grossly distorted conformation; and a third state with RNAs of 6 nucleotides and longer, {{essentially the same as}} a stable <b>elongating</b> complex. The <b>transition</b> from the first to the second state correlates with a markedly reduced frequency of abortive initiation. The transition from the second to the third state correlates with partial "bubble collapse" and promoter escape. Polymerase structure is permissive for abortive initiation, thereby setting a lower limit on polymerase-promoter complex lifetime and allowing the dissociation of nonspecific complexes. Abortive initiation may be viewed as promoter proofreading, and the structural transitions as checkpoints for promoter control...|$|R
40|$|Collision {{cross-section}} (CCS) measurements {{obtained from}} ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) analyses often provide useful information concerning a protein’s {{size and shape}} and can be complemented by modeling procedures. However, {{there have been some}} concerns {{about the extent to which}} certain proteins maintain a native-like conformation during the gas-phase analysis, especially proteins with dynamic or extended regions. Here we have measured the CCSs of a range of biomolecules including non-globular proteins and RNAs of different sequence, size, and stability. Using traveling wave IMS-MS, we show that for the proteins studied, the measured CCS deviates significantly from predicted CCS values based upon currently available structures. The results presented indicate that these proteins collapse to different extents varying on their <b>elongated</b> structures upon <b>transition</b> into the gas-phase. Comparing two RNAs of similar mass but different solution structures, we show that these biomolecules may also be susceptible to gas-phase compaction. Together, the results suggest that caution is needed when predicting structural models based on CCS data for RNAs as well as proteins with non-globular folds...|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} of the lily (Lilium), three phases can be distinguished: the juvenile, the vegetative adult and the flowering phase. Juvenile bulblets sprout with one or a few leaves whereas vegetative adult bulblets sprout with a stem with <b>elongated</b> internodes. The <b>transition</b> to the vegetative adult phase was studied in lily (Lilium x cv. Star Gazer) bulblets regenerating on bulb scale segments in vitro. The phase change was marked by {{the development}} of a tunica-corpus structure in the apical meristem which leads to the formation of an actively growing stem primordium. This structure is absent in juvenile bulblets. Juvenile bulblets first developed competence for phase change during a culture period of at least 6 weeks at 25 degreesC. Subsequent induction of the phase change occurred during a period of 2 weeks at lower temperature (15 degreesC). A major factor influencing phase transition was bulblet weight. Small bulblets never formed a stem whereas large bulblets always formed a stem under inducing conditions. Large bulblets more often formed a stem than small ones but the relation between bulb growth and phase transition was not absolute. A high sucrose concentration, a large explant and a prolonged period for competence development stimulated bulb growth but also phase transition independently of growth. Lowering the concentration of MS-minerals reduced bulb growth but did not affect phase transition. Under these conditions, phase change was correlated with a low phosphorus content...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Reproductive {{phase change}} in Arabidopsis thaliana is {{characterized}} by two transitions in phytomer identity, the differentiation of the first <b>elongate</b> internode (bolting <b>transition)</b> and of the first flower (floral transition). An evaluation {{of the dynamics of}} these transitions was sought by examining the precision of the corresponding phytomer identity changes. Methods: The length of the first elongate internode and the frequency of chimeric inflorescence structures, e. g. paraclades not subtended by a leaf (no-leaf/paraclades) and flowers subtended by a bract (bract/flowers), were measured in the Wassilewskija (Ws) accession and 47 early flowering mutants under a wide range of photo-periods. The impact of photoperiodic perturbations applied to Ws plants at different times of development was also evaluated. Key Results: In Ws, both types of characters were remarkably constant across photoperiods in spite of a high degree of interindividual variability. Bract/flowers were not normally produced in Ws, but they were observed in conditions that suggest enhanced light signalling, e. g. in response to continuous light perturbations and in mutants with reduced hypocotyl elongation. In contrast, no-leaf/paraclades were normally present in approx. 20 % of Ws plants, and their frequency was increased in conditions that suggest reduced light signalling, e. g. in mutants with altered specification of long-day responses. The length of the first elongate internode was unrelated to the rate of stem elongation and to the regulation of reproductive phase change. Conclusions: Bract/flowers and no-leaf/paraclades corresponded to opposite effects on the floral transition that reflected different dynamics of progression to flowering. In contrast, the length of the first elongate internode was only indirectly related to the regulation of reproductive phase change and was mainly dependent on global morphogenetic constraints. This paper proposes that morphogenetic variability could be used to identify critical phases of development and characterize the canalization of developmental patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{is a part of}} a long term {{experimental}} project devoted to investigate flow boiling heat transfer, pressure drop and flow visualization of R 134 a in small to mini/micro-diameter tubes. The experimental facility was first designed and constructed by X. Huo (2005) with the contribution of L. Chen (2006). In the present study, the experimental facility was upgraded by changing the heating system from AC to DC heating and also upgrading the logging system through using a faster data logger and developing a new Labview program. The objectives of the current study include (i) contribute in identifying the reasons behind the wide scatter in the published flow boiling heat transfer results, (ii) contribute in understanding the fundamentals of flow boiling heat transfer in mini/micro-diameter tubes and (iii) evaluation of the existing heat transfer and pressure drop prediction methods. Two sizes of stainless steel tubes were investigated in the current study; 0. 52 mm and 1. 1 mm diameter. In the current study, the 0. 52 mm tube was roughly called a “micro-tube” whilst the 1. 1 mm tubes were called “mini-tubes”. The present study proposes two possible reasons for the scatter in the published heat transfer results. The first reason is the variations in the heated length from one study to another–there is no criterion for choosing the heated length. The second reason is the variations in the inner surface characteristics of the channels from one study to another. These two important parameters were not taken into consideration by researchers in the past studies. Accordingly, the effect of the heated length was investigated in the current study using a seamless cold drawn tube with diameter of 1. 1 mm and heated length ranging from 150 to 450 mm. The effect of the tube inner surface was also tested here by conducting the test in two stainless steel tubes with diameter of 1. 1 mm and manufactured by two different processes. The first tube was manufactured by welding technique whilst the second tube was a seamless cold drawn tube. Both tubes were identical in design and dimensions. The inner surface of each tube was examined first using SEM analysis and demonstrated that, the surface morphology is completely different. The local heat transfer coefficient was determined through measuring the local wall temperature using 14 K-type thermocouples attached to the wall using thermally conducting but electrically insulating epoxy supplied by Omega. Pressure drop was measured directly across the heated section and a high speed camera was used for the flow visualization at 1000 frames/s. All measurements were recorded after the system attained steady state. The experimental conditions include mass flux range of 100 – 500 kg/m 2 s, system pressure range of 6 – 10 bar, inlet sub-cooling of about 5 K and exit quality up to about 0. 9. The most frequently observed flow regimes in the 0. 52 mm tube were found to be slug (<b>elongated</b> bubble), <b>transition</b> to annular and annular flow regimes. In the 1. 1 mm tube, the observed regimes were found to be slug, churn and annular. The transition from slug flow to annular flow in the 0. 52 mm tube occurred smoothly with little disturbances at the liquid vapour interface compared to the 1. 1 mm tube. Additionally, increasing the heated length of the 1. 1 mm tube was found to shift the transition to annular flow to occur at lower vapour quality. The heat transfer results demonstrated that the behaviour of the local heat transfer coefficient in the 0. 52 mm diameter tube is different compared to that in the 1. 1 mm tubes. Also, the tube inner surface characteristics and the heated length were found to strongly influence the local behaviour of the heat transfer coefficient. Flow boiling hysteresis was investigated and the results indicated that hysteresis exists only at very low heat fluxes near the boiling incipience. Existing heat transfer and pressure drop correlations were examined using the results of the 0. 52 and 1. 1 mm seamless cold drawn tubes. The pressure drop data were predicted very well using the Muller-Stienhagen and Heck (1986) correlation, the homogeneous flow model and the correlation of Mishima and Hibiki (1996). On the contrary, all macro and microscale heat correlations failed to predict the current experimental data. The mechanistic models failed to predict the data of all tubes with the same accuracy. Accordingly, two heat transfer correlations were proposed in the current study. The first correlation is based on dimensionless groups whilst the second is based on the superposition model of Chen (1966). Both correlations predicted the current experimental data and the data of Huo (2005) and Shiferaw (2008) very well.
