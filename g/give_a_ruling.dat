50|$|In 1895, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{was asked}} to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> {{on the status of}} an 1895 match versus Cambridge University and {{declared}} it not first-class. From that date no matches played by Liverpool and District have been ranked first-class in Wisden or other publications. In 1904, the Liverpool authorities applied to MCC for first-class status for their matches versus first-class teams but, as recorded in the MCC Minutes for May 1904, it was ruled that no Liverpool matches should rank first-class.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Hampshire Trading Standards {{requested}} that the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> on the website www.lightningprocess.com, arguing that {{the information on the}} site was misleading in four areas. The ASA upheld two of the four challenges. They concluded that although there seemed to be some evidence of participant improvement during trials conducted, the trials were not controlled, the evidence was not sufficient enough to draw robust conclusions, and more investigation was necessary; consequently, the website's claims at the time were deemed misleading.|$|E

50|$|Following the judgment, Chevron {{claimed that}} it had been {{procured}} by fraud and brought a RICO claim against lead American counsel Steven R. Donziger in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.). Judge Lewis Kaplan issued an opinion on 4 March 2014, accepting Chevron's allegations. The court found that lead Donziger corrupted the Ecuadorian case by submitting fraudulent evidence, coercing the judge, paying off a supposedly impartial expert, paying a Colorado consulting firm to write the expert's report, falsely presenting the report as the expert's own work, bribing the judge to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> against Chevron and then trying to mislead the US courts. Judge Kaplan's ruling, which is based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act was affirmed by the Second Circuit on August 8, 2016.|$|E

50|$|Chevron in 2011 {{brought a}} civil RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) claim against Donziger, Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo, Ecuadorian {{community}} leader Luis Yanza, and all 47 named plaintiffs {{in the case}} in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.). Chevron sued initially Donziger and his clients for an estimated $60 billion. Chevron dropped all money damages claims on the eve of trial to avoid a jury. During the subsequent bench trial, Judge Lewis Kaplan refused to permit the defendants to present any scientific evidence of environmental damage relied on by Ecuador’s courts to find Chevron liable. Judge Kaplan issued an opinion on March 4, 2014, accepting Chevron's allegations and finding that Donziger {{and other members of the}} legal team corrupted the Ecuadorian case by submitting fraudulent evidence, coercing the judge, paying a supposedly impartial expert, paying a Colorado consulting firm to write the expert's report, falsely presenting the report as the expert's own work, bribing the judge to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> against Chevron, ghostwriting the judgment, and then trying to mislead the US courts. Donziger and his colleagues have rejected the allegations made by Chevron, saying they were largely the product of Kaplan’s bias and a witness to whom Chevron admitted paying $2 million and who lied on the witness stand. Donziger and his colleagues also submitted evidence after the trial demonstrating the ghostwriting allegation has been contradicted by forensic evidence after an independent examination of the judge’s office computer found he saved the document that became the judgment more than 480 times prior to its issuance. Both Judge Kaplan and the federal appellate court that reviewed the case refused to consider the new evidence that Donziger claims disproves ghostwriting.|$|E

50|$|From {{this point}} of view that ijtihād {{essentially}} consists of an inference (istinbāṭ) that extents to a probability (ẓann).

A knowledgeable person who <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> on Sharī‘ah, but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings (aḥkām) from the sources, is not called a mujtahid but rather a muqallid.|$|R
