5|$|Connected to Point Loma Village by a {{causeway}} is Shelter Island, {{which is}} actually not an island but a former sandbank in San Diego Bay.

Texas State Historical Association.Davenport (1843), p. 170. Throughout the 19th century these three cities developed increasing influence on the Bay Area communities, particularly as railroads were built through the region.|$|E
5|$|Oysters {{come from}} the Oléron-Marennes basin, while mussels come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Aiguillon. High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, {{especially}} goat cheese. This region and in the Vendée is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. The region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. Limousin {{is home to the}} high-quality Limousin cattle, as well as high quality sheep. The woodlands offer game and high-quality mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner may relate to the sharp turn in the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E

5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, {{especially}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Street {{wing of the}} party as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to remove him without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{regional}} theater service organization Theatre Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay Area is the third largest center of activity for theater companies and actors in the United States, after the New York City and Chicago metropolitan areas, with 400 companies spread throughout the region. The organization was founded in 1976 by the Magic Theatre and American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco and the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Berkeley. The latter two, along with the San Francisco Mime Troupe, have since gone on to win one Regional Theatre Tony Award each. Several famous actors have arisen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area's theatre community, including Daveed Diggs from Hamilton and Darren Criss from Hedwig, A Very Potter Musical, and Glee. Locally, well-regarded actors include James Carpenter, a stage actor who has performed at the ACT, Berkeley Repertory, and San Jose Repertory Theatre among others, Rod Gnapp of the Magic Theatre Company, Sean San Jose, {{one of the founders}} of the Campo Santo theater, and Campo Santo member Margo Hall.|$|E

5|$|By 17:10, Thetis and Blonde {{began to}} {{withdraw}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> {{as the fire}} {{took hold of the}} first frigate. The rest of the British squadron, despite heavy cannon fire from a fort on shore, successfully landed their troops and stormed and captured the defences. There were heavy casualties in the storming parties, including Hugh Cameron, captain of Hazard, who was killed by grapeshot. At 17:20, the fire reached the magazines of the burning flûte, and the ensuing explosion hurled burning wreckage across the bay. The British ships were largely untouched, but the second French flûte was struck by a large piece of flaming timber, which ignited her mainmast and destroyed her as well. The operations successfully completed, the British ships embarked their landing parties, who had demolished the fortifications around the bay, and returned to open water.|$|E
5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E
5|$|Few {{official}} surface {{observations are}} available for {{the passage of the}} hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16foot (4.9m) storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of 10foot (3m) waves rushing inland <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> The hurricane dropped about 1.38inches (35mm) of precipitation while passing about 60mi (95km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Marías. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106mph (170km/h). On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91inches (480mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89inches (327mm) near Manzanillo, Colima. The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100mph (161km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50mph (80km/h). The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas.|$|E
