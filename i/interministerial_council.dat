In 1975 the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute was created under MoD, making the nation's Antarctic presence - through an expeditionary program begun in 1984 - a government matter. It has {{an annual budget}} specially assigned by the Ministry of Economy and it is ruled by an <b>Interministerial</b> <b>Council,</b> with delegates of Ministry of Defense, Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education and Culture.|$|E

50|$|The Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger (Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à Fome, {{abbreviated}} MDS) is a cabinet-level federal {{ministry in}} Brazil. It {{was established in}} 2004 from the merger of the Special Ministry of Food and Nutritional Security, the Ministry of Social Assistance, and the Executive Secretariat of the <b>Interministerial</b> Manager <b>Council</b> of Bolsa Família. It administers Bolsa Família, the National Social Assistance Fund (SANF), Industry Social Service (SESI), Commerce Social Service (SESC), and Transport Social Service (SEST).

50|$|The overall {{strategic}} {{responsibility for}} ICT in the Swiss federal administration {{lies with the}} <b>interministerial</b> Federal IT <b>Council</b> (FITC) operating under the Ministry of Finance and chaired by the President of the Swiss Confederation. FITC {{is supported by the}} Federal Strategy Unit for IT (FSUIT) which acts as an administrative unit to the council. Moreover, the eGovernment Strategy of Switzerland is supervised by a steering committee, also under the Ministry of Finance, comprising three high-ranking representatives each from the confederation, the cantons, and the communes. The committee is supported by the eGovernment Switzerland Programme Office (within FSUIT) and an advisory board, composed of a maximum of nine experts from administration, the private sector, and academia. The Framework Agreement on eGovernment Cooperation, which covers the period 2007 to 2011, presents the above collaboration scheme shared by all levels of government (confederation, cantons, municipalities).|$|R
40|$|The {{project had}} the {{objective}} of strengthening food control activities related to PCB residue contaminants in dairy and meat products by providing advice, guidance and training {{in the management of}} food contaminant monitoring and detection. A review and assessment was made of available information concerning the government's findings related to PCB contamination and potential sources. In consultation with government and national experts, the primary source of PCB contamination was identified as paint and sealant coatings of farm and animal premises and silos resulting in contamination of animal feed materials. Removal of this material resulted in a dramatic reduction in the levels of PCB in animal feeds and in animal and dairy products. The project also assisted in improving and standardizing the analytical methods of detection of PCB in animal products in both Republics. A laboratory proficiency testing study was conducted and revealed the satisfactory performance at PCB levels greater than 0. 03 mg/kg of government and institutional laboratories which participated in the study. Below this level additional method modification is needed. Of the many recommendations in the technical reports, the following were considered to be the most important. Firstly, there is a considerable stock of PCB containing materials in storage awaiting safe destruction. This material, if not properly controlled and monitored, can become indirect sources of environmental contamination and subsequently contaminate the food chain. It is recommended that suitable controls be established to maintain this material safely until destroyed. Secondly, it is recommended that an <b>interministerial</b> committee or <b>council</b> be established to focus on the problems of industrial and environmental contaminants in food. Thirdly, it is recommended that a "market basket" approach for the assessment of the quality and safety of food be utilized continually to monitor all contaminant levels of food...|$|R
