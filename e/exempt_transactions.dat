40|$|Member States of the European Union in {{the period}} of years 2007 – 2013 {{increased}} the rate of value added tax several times in an attempt to consolidate public budgets. While the Czech Republic is a typical representative of country changing VAT rates several times, Slovakia made practically only one change in the VAT rate.

Changes in VAT are naturally reflected in household expenditures which are analyzed by the consumer basket, whose composition is also a subject of changes. Another factor that has an impact on household spending is swapping commodities between the rates of VAT. The aim of this paper is, based on the analytic-synthetic methods, to determine how are these changes differently manifested in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in reference to the share of commodity consumption included in the standard and reduced VAT rates and to the <b>exempt</b> <b>transactions,</b> and, in particular, to determine how they affected the VAT burden of the hypothetical household in both countries...|$|E

40|$|The Section 3 (a) (10) {{exemption}} of the Securities Act of 1933 {{is meant}} to <b>exempt</b> securities <b>transactions</b> where a fairness hearing by a judge or government agency’s ruling replaces the usual SEC registration requirements. Recently, {{there has been a}} rise in 3 (a) (10) financing schemes, where a third party investor, what I call a “ 3 (a) (10) financier,” will offer to purchase the outstanding debts of a company from its creditors in exchange for discounted, and unregistered, shares of stock. In many cases these exchanges are done with no notification to current shareholders whose value falls precipitously when the 3 (a) (10) financier begins not only selling, but through a common clause in these 3 (a) (10) financing contracts, also demanding that the company issue more shares to them at any time. The companies who work with 3 (a) (10) financiers have, in some cases, become complicit in the scheme in order to hide these transactions from investors who provide the liquidity for the 3 (a) (10) financier sell-offs. I conclude that the SEC needs to provide updated guidance on Section 3 (a) (10) as well as bring significant enforcement actions to curtail this budding predatory finance scheme...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the recent history}} and implementation {{of one of the}} central provisions in U. S. banking law, section 23 A of the Federal Reserve Act. Enacted in 1933 in response to one of the perceived causes of the Great Depression, section 23 A imposes quantitative limitations on certain extensions of credit and other transactions between a bank and its affiliates that expose a bank to an affiliate 2 ̆ 7 s credit or investment risk, prohibits banks from purchasing low-quality assets from their nonbank affiliates, and imposes strict collateral requirements with respect to extensions of credit to affiliates. The key purpose of these restrictions is twofold: to protect federally insured depository institutions from excessive credit exposure to their affiliates, and to prevent transfer of federal subsidy to nondepository financial institutions. After the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which removed the Glass-Steagall era prohibition on affiliation between commercial banks and investment banks, section 23 A effectively became the principal statutory safeguard preventing the depository system from subsidizing potentially risky activities of nonbanking institutions. However, despite its officially endorsed significance, section 23 A remains a largely obscure statute that has not attracted much scholarly attention to date. This Article seeks to fill that important gap and to explore how effective section 23 A is in achieving its purported goals in practice. It {{examines the}} body of interpretive letters issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 2 ̆ 2 Board 2 ̆ 2) between 1996 and 2010, in which the Board granted individual banking institutions 2 ̆ 7 requests to <b>exempt</b> their proposed <b>transactions</b> with affiliates from the requirements of section 23 A. This Article argues that section 23 A falls short of delivering the kind of robust protection for the depository system it allegedly promises, primarily because it was not designed for fulfilling such a grand task. This mismatch between its professed function and practical efficacy became particularly clear during the global financial crisis of 2007 - 2009. The Article puts together a comprehensive record showing how the Board 2 ̆ 7 s use of exemptive authority effectively rendered section 23 A irrelevant during the crisis, by allowing commercial banks to provide financing to their affiliated securities firms, derivatives dealers, money market funds, and even automotive companies, in order to prevent potentially disastrous effects of their failure on the financial system and the broader economy. Crisis containment and systemic risk considerations consistently prevailed over the statutory purpose of preventing the leakage of the federal subsidy outside the depository system. This Article further argues that the recent amendments to section 23 A under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 fail to address this fundamental tension in the operation of the statute. The Article concludes with a discussion of potential implications of this argument for future financial regulatory reform...|$|R
40|$|The Securities Act of 1933 is an {{important}} restriction on capital markets in the United States. Unless an exemption is available, the Act requires companies selling securities to the public first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement containing detailed information about the company, its business, its finances, and the contemplated offering. Offers cannot be made (except to underwriters) until the registration statement is filed, and the securities can be sold only after the registration statement survives the sometimes lengthy SEC review process and becomes effective. In addition, the securities seller must at some point furnish investors with a prospectus, which contains {{much of the information}} in the registration statement. Economic analysis of the Securities Act, both theoretical and empirical, has focused on the desirability of the registration requirement. Some scholars have questioned whether the registration requirement is economically sound; others have argued that mandatory disclosure is necessary to correct market failures in the securities markets. Lost in the debate on the economic merits of the registration requirement are the exemptions from that requirement-the offerings for which registration is not required. This Article fills the gap in the economic analysis of the Securities Act by examining the economics of the exemptions from registration. I will assume for the purpose of analysis that, in at least some cases, the registration requirement is economically sound: its benefits exceed its costs. I will then review the exemptions to see why that conclusion might not hold for particular types of exempted offerings. For the reader who believes the registration requirement is economically efficient, my analysis of the exemptions will highlight offerings in which that efficiency is less likely. For the reader who believes the registration requirement is economically inefficient, my analysis of the exemptions will highlight offerings for which the inefficiency is greatest. I begin in Part II with a brief focus on the registration requirement itself. Part II summarizes the economic debate concerning registration and, as a prelude to an economic analysis of the exemptions, discusses {{the costs and benefits of}} registration. In Part III, I turn to the exemptions from registration and ask why, if the benefits of registration generally exceed the costs, that might not be true for these <b>exempted</b> offerings. The <b>transaction</b> exemptions are extraordinarily different from each other. Some exemptions limit the dollar amount of the offering; others limit the number or types of purchasers to whom securities can be sold; others are contingent on oversight by some authority other than the SEC. I show that the exemptions can be placed into three categories, each with a slightly different economic justification. After establishing an economic model for each type of exemption, I explore some of the requirements of the current exemptions to see if they are economically sound. In Part IV, I focus on one particular feature of some of the exemptions-limits on the number of purchasers in an offering. Finally, in Part V, I examine an issue that has caused great difficulty for scholars, practitioners, the courts, and the SEC: What should happen when a single issuer makes two ostensibly separate, but roughly contemporaneous offerings and claims a different exemption for each? In determining whether an exemption is available, should the offerings be combined and treated as a single offering, or should their separation be respected? I explore how well the integration doctrine and the safe-harbor regulations that the SEC and the courts have developed to deal with this problem fit the economic model...|$|R
