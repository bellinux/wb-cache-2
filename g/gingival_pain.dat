5000|$|Acute necrotizing {{ulcerative}} gingivitis (ANUG; colloquially {{known as}} trench mouth) is a common, non-contagious {{infection of the}} gums with sudden onset. The main features are painful, bleeding gums, and ulceration of inter-dental papillae (the sections of gum between adjacent teeth). This disease, along with necrotizing (ulcerative) periodontitis (NP or NUP) is classified as a necrotizing periodontal disease, {{one of the seven}} general types of periodontitis. The often severe <b>gingival</b> <b>pain</b> that characterizes ANUG distinguishes it from the more common chronic periodontitis which is rarely painful. ANUG is the acute presentation of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG), which is the usual course the disease takes. If improperly treated or neglected, NUG may become chronic and/or recurrent. The causative organisms are mostly anaerobic bacteria, particularly Fusobacteria and spirochete species. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress and immunosuppression (sub-optimal functioning of the immune system). When the attachments of the teeth to the bone are involved, the term NUP is used. Treatment of ANUG is by debridement (although pain may prevent this) and antibiotics (usually metronidazole) in the acute phase, and improving oral hygiene to prevent recurrence. Although the condition has a rapid onset and is debilitating, it usually resolves quickly and does no serious harm. The synonym [...] "trench mouth" [...] arose during World War I as many soldiers developed the disease, probably because of the poor conditions and extreme psychological stress.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Crimean-Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} (CCHF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever of the Nairovirus group. Although {{primarily}} a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting human do occur. The disease is endemic {{in many countries}} in Africa, Europe and Asia. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia. There may be nausea, vomiting and sore throat early on, which may be accompanied by diarrhea and generalized abdominal pain. IgG and IgM antibodies may be detected in serum by ELISA. Case Report: A pregnant woman was admitted in a hospital with severe vaginal bleeding.

40|$|Necrotizing {{ulcerative}} gingivitis (NUG) is {{a typical}} form of periodontal diseases. It has an acute clinical presentation with the distinctive characteristics of rapid onset of interdental gingival necrosis, <b>gingival</b> <b>pain,</b> bleeding, and halitosis. Systemic symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and malaise could be also found. There are various predisposing factors such as stress, nutritional deficiencies, and immune system dysfunctions, especially, HIV infection that seems {{to play a major}} role in the pathogenesis of NUG. The treatment of NUG is organized in successive stages: first, the treatment of the acute phase that should be provided immediately to stop disease progression and to control patient's feeling of discomfort and pain; second, the treatment of the preexisting condition such as chronic gingivitis; then, the surgical correction of the disease sequelae like craters. Moreover, finally, maintenance phase that allows stable outcomes.

40|$|Background: Oral health {{studies to}} address dental needs of {{children}} have been conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. However, limited data is available for the rural areas of Kenya. The {{aim of this study}} was to gather baseline oral health data on primary school children in the rural Kithoka community of Meru, Kenya. Methods: A cross sectional dental examination and oral health survey of 583 children, aged 3 - 18 years, were performed. Decayed, missing, and filled primary/permanent teeth (dmft/DMFT) values were recorded. Gingival recession ranking, a gingival inflammation index, and a fluorosis index were also employed. Children were surveyed regarding dental visits, toothbrush ownership, and oral pain. Results: The average dmft/DMFT score was 1. 2, fluorosis prevalence was 29 %, gingival disease prevalence was 75. 1 %, oral pain prevalence was 29 %, and 72 % of children had never been to a dentist. Conclusions: DMFT scores for Kenyan children were almost exclusively comprised of decayed teeth. This finding probably reflects the low dentist-to-population ratio and the scarcity of dentists practicing in Kenyan rural areas. <b>Gingival</b> disease and <b>pain</b> prevalence in these children were high, exceeding those reported in developed countries.

40|$|Injuries to oral soft-tissues {{can occur}} due to accidental, iatrogenic, and {{factitious}} traumas. Traumatic lesions, whether chemical, physical, or thermal in nature, {{are among the}} most common in the mouth. A type of physical injury to the gingival tissues is self-inflicted. Sometimes the lesions are termed gingivitis artefacta. Self-inflicted gingival injuries in children and adolescents can occur as a result of accidental trauma, premeditated infliction, or chronic habits such as fingernail biting, digit sucking, or sucking on objects such as pens, pencils or pacifiers. The purpose of this case report was to illustrate the destructive nature of the habit and to describe the successful treatment of this case. A 14 -year-old girl with moderate <b>pain,</b> <b>gingival</b> bleeding and recession in the anterior mandibulary region was admitted to periodontology clinic. Upon questioning, the patient readily admitted traumatizing her gingiva with her fingernail. Treatment consisted of oral hygiene instruction, mechanical debridement, psychological support and surgical periodontal treatment. Postoperatively, complete root coverage, gains in clinical attachment levels, and highly significant increases in the width of keratinized gingiva were observed. This case report shows {{that it is possible to}} treat gingival injury and maintain the periodontal health of a patient with destructive habit. Patient compliance, regular dental follow-ups, and psychological support may be useful in stabilizing the periodontal condition of these patients.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate patient response and recurrence of pigmentation following gingival depigmentation carried out with a surgical blade and diode laser. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients who were esthetically conscious of their dark gums and requested treatment for the same were selected for this study. Complete phase I therapy was performed for all the patients before performing the gingival depigmentation procedures with laser and scalpel on a split-mouth basis. Patients were evaluated for pain (1 day, 1 week), wound healing and melanin repigmentation (Melanin Pigmentation Index) immediately and at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months, respectively. Results: The final results were statistically analyzed and significance was evaluated. The {{results of this study}} indicated that both scalpel and laser were efficient for <b>gingival</b> depigmentation. Comparative <b>pain</b> assessment (P = 0. 148) and repigmentation scores (P = 0. 288) at various time intervals between the two groups did not show any statistical significance. Conclusion: Both the procedures did not result in any post-operative complications and the gingiva healed uneventfully. When compared, both the techniques were found to be equally efficacious. Care must be taken to assess the gingival biotype and the degree of pigmentation in deciding which technique is to be used. Clinical Significance: Various methods of depigmentation are available with comparable efficacies. Depigmentation is not a clinical indication but a treatment of choice where esthetics is a concern and is desired by the patient...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the association between periodontal disease and self-rated oral health among Brazilian adults. Material and Methods: Data on 11, 874 adults in 250 cities from all the Brazilian regions were analysed. The outcome investigated was self-rated oral health (dichotomized into ‘‘Good’’ and ‘‘Poor’’) and the main exposure was periodontal disease defined as the combination of periodontal pocket depth X 4 mm and clinical attachment loss X 4 mm. Demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, clinical oral health conditions (dental caries, dental and <b>gingival</b> <b>pain,</b> tooth loss and use of prosthesis) and use of dental services were the other explanatory variables. Simple and multivariate Poisson regression was performed allowing the estimation of prevalence ratios (PRs). All analyses were adjusted for the cluster sampling design. Results: The prevalence of periodontal disease was 8. 9 % (95 %CI 7. 6 – 10. 3) and poor self-rated oral health was 23. 6 % (95 %CI 21. 9 – 25. 2) which was significantly higher among those who presented periodontal disease (PR 1. 4; 95 %CI 1. 2 – 1. 5), after the adjustment for possible confounders. Conclusions: Periodontal disease was associated with poor self-rated oral health. The results of this study should be considered by population health planners in order to assess and plan periodontal services.

40|$|In recent years, the {{delivery}} of osteoinductive factors such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) has become an alternative approach to traditional bone grafting due to their capacity to produce bone healing and new bone formation. BMP- 2 has proved to possess the highest osteoinductive potential among BMPs. The case reported the clinical use of recombinant human BMP- 2 for bilateral vertical alveolar ridge augmentation. In a case of 61 year-old patient with a significant bilateral vertical bony deficiency of the mandible, rhBMP- 2 administered via an absorbable collagen sponge carrier (ACS) was used for bilateral alveolar ridge bone induction. Augmented sites were covered and fixed with titanium mesh. Augmented sites were reopened 6 months after surgery. Titanium membrane and retaining screws were removed and three dental implants were placed. The tissue samples for the histologic analysis were harvested. Following 3 months healing period, the submerged implants were uncovered and restored with zirconium-ceramic crowns. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), panoramix and 3 D radiographic evaluation were obtained prior to and after the surgical procedure. Vertical gain of the bone was 5, 5 mm {{on the left and}} 5 mm on the right side, with 6 mm width of the bone. Histologic analysis revealed formation of mature trabecular bone with signs of osteoblastic proliferation. Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were in the range between 69 and 75 for all three implants. No suppuration, <b>gingival</b> recession or <b>pain</b> were present 24 months after surgery.

40|$|Background: Special Olympics Special Smiles (SOSS) is an {{initiative}} created for oral health {{data collection and}} education in oral hygiene for athletes with an intellectual disability. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate treatment needs of participants of Special Olympics in Belgium 2013 in comparison with those from 2008 and {{to assess the impact of}} screening and referral within the SOSS in a group of athletes who participated in two consecutive events, 2012 and 2013. Methods: Data were collected following a standardized protocol developed by the U. S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Oral Health. Oral hygiene habits, treatment urgency and reports of oral <b>pain,</b> <b>gingival</b> signs, sealants, untreated caries, missing and filled teeth were recorded. Data analysis of data from 2013 consisted in descriptive statistics followed by the analysis of the data by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. This data was compared with data from 2008 published by Leroy et al., 2012 using Chi square tests. Data from athletes who participated in both Special Olympics events (2012 and 2013) were compared using Exact McNemar's test and Chi-square test for homogeneity of proportions. The level of significance for all tests was set at a p-value < 0. 05. Results: A total of 627 athletes with intellectual disability participated to the SOSS program in 2013, while 132 athletes met the inclusion criteria of being a participant at both SO Belgium 2012 and 2013. The prevalence of gingival signs was 44. 3 % in 2013, slightly higher than in 2008 (42. 4 %). The burden of untreated decay affected 27. 1 % of the population showing a net increase in comparison to 2008 (20. 9 %). McNemar's test and Chi-square test revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of all compared parameters between 2012 and 2013. Conclusion: Special Olympics results from 2013 indicate a considerable unmet treatment need among Belgian Special Olympics Athletes, persistent from 2008 to 2013. Moreover, SO intervention had no impact in the oral health of athletes who participated in 2012 and 2013 events.

Recently, several reports have suggested that CaN is also associated with schizophrenia. However, little data are currently available on the direct effect of tacrolimus on the human brain. Case: A 23 -year-old Japanese female experienced severe delusion of persecution, delusional mood, suspiciousness, aggression, and excitement. She visited our hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. When she was 27  years old, she had severe general fatigue, persistent fever, systemic joint <b>pain,</b> <b>gingival</b> bleeding, and breathlessness and was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Later she underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT), she was administered methotrexate and cyclosporin A to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Three weeks after BMT, she showed initial symptoms of GVHD and was prescribed tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin A. Seven months after BMT {{at the age of}} 31  years, she died of progression of GVHD. Pathological anatomy was examined after her death, including immunohistochemical analysis of her brain using anti-CaN antibodies. For comparison, we used our previous data from both a schizophrenia group and a healthy control group. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of CaN-immunoreactive neurons among the schizophrenia group, healthy control group, and the tacrolimus case (all P> 0. 5, analysis of covariance). Compared with the healthy control group and schizophrenia group, the percentages of CaN-immunoreactive neurons in layers III–VI of the BA 46 and the putamen tended to be lower in the tacrolimus case. Conclusion: Tacrolimus may decrease CaN immunoreactivity in some regions of the human brain. Thus, tacrolimus may introduce side effects such as cognitive dysfunction and extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, we also found that the effect of tacrolimus on CaN immunoreactivity in human brain was stronger than the effect of schizophrenia.

40|$|This is {{a review}} and update on acute {{conditions}} affecting the gingival tissues, including abscesses in the periodontium, necrotizing periodontal diseases, and other acute conditions that cause gingival lesions with acute presentation, such as infectious process {{not associated with}} oral bacterial biofilms, muco-cutanenous disorders, and traumatic and allergic lesions. A periodontal abscess is clinically important since it is a relatively frequent dental emergency, it can compromise the periodontal prognosis of the affected tooth, and because bacteria within the abscess have been identified, mainly {{by the type of}} etiology, and there are clear diffrences between those affecting a previously existing periodontal pocket ahd those affecting healthy sites. Therapy for this acute condition consists of drainage and tissue debridement, with individual evaluation of the need for systemic antimicrobial therapy. the definitive treatment of the pre-existing condition should be accomplished after the acute phase is controlled. Necrotizing periodontal disease (NPD) present three typical clinical features : papilla necrosis, <b>gingival</b> bleeding, and <b>pain.</b> Although the prevalence of these diseases is not high, their importance is clear, since they represent the most severe conditions associated with dental biofilm, with very rapid tissue destruction. In adittion to bacteria, the etiology of NPD includes numerous factors that alter the host response and predispose to these diseases, including HIV infection, malnutrition, stress, and tobacco smoking. The treatment consists of superficial debridement, careful mechanical oral hygiene, rinsing with chlorhexidine, and daily re-evaluation. Systemic antimicrobials may be used adjunctively in severe cases or in non-responding conditions and the best option is metronidazole. Once the acute disease is under control, definitive treatment should be provided, including the adequate therapy for the pre-existing gingivitis or periodontitis. Among other acute conditions affecting the periodontal tissues, but not caused by the microorganisms present in oral biofilms, are infectious diseases, muco-cutaneous diseases and traumatic or allergic lesions. In most cases, the gingival envolvement is not severe, though they are common and may prompt a dental emergency visit. These conditions may the direct result of a trauma or the consequence of the breaking of vesicles and bullae. A proper differential diagnosis is important for an adequate management of the case...|$|R
