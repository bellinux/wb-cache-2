25|$|Three {{days after}} the {{disappearance}} of Beineman, her nude body was discovered face-down in a wooded gully alongside the Huron River parkway. A medical examination revealed Beineman had been extensively beaten about the face and body, with some lacerations inflicted being so severe sections of skin had been removed, exposing subcutaneous tissues. She had received extensive skull and brain injuries which had been inflicted with a blunt instrument, {{had been forced to}} ingest a caustic substance, and her neck, shoulders, nipples and breasts had been burned with the same caustic agent. As had been the case with previous victims, her killer had placed a section of cloth <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> to muffle her screams throughout her torture.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, she {{was rushed}} to {{hospital}} when a fish bone became stuck <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and had an operation to remove it. Being a keen angler, she calmly joked afterwards, [...] "The salmon have got their own back." [...] Similar incidents occurred at Balmoral in August 1986, when she was hospitalised at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary overnight but no operation was needed, and May 1993, when she {{was admitted to the}} Infirmary for surgery under general anaesthetic.|$|E

500|$|Tina's {{cover of}} [...] "My Funny Valentine" [...] stirred mixed {{emotions}} in Gonzalez. She criticized the ending: [...] "When she started sobbing, it got weird. Then weirder. Then downright uncomfortable." [...] However, {{she liked the}} earlier part of the performance, and wrote, [...] "It was übersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts. If she would have continued the song with a mild lump <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> I think I might have gotten choked up with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{began her}} three-year-old {{season in the}} Grade II Santa Ynez Stakes over seven furlongs at Santa Anita on January 21. She started the 1–5 {{favorite}} but was beaten three-quarters of a length by Renee's Titan. An explanation for her poor performance emerged a week later when an examination revealed an ulcer <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> At the same course on March 2, Beholder started 4–5 favorite for the Grade I Las Virgenes Stakes over one mile. She led from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by [...] lengths from Fiftyshadesofhay. Beholder's next race was the Grade I Santa Anita Oaks on April 6, for which she started the 3–10 favorite. Despite an unfavorable draw, she quickly went into the lead and went clear of {{the field in the}} straight to win by [...] lengths from Iotapa. Mandella described the winner as having [...] "the heart of a warrior". [...] Throughout her spring campaign, she continued to be ridden by Gomez.|$|E
500|$|One {{evening in}} January 1842, Virginia showed {{the first signs}} of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano. Poe {{described}} it as breaking a blood vessel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> She only partially recovered. Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of Virginia's illness. He left Graham's and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal and, later, sole owner. There he alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded. On January 29, 1845, his poem [...] "The Raven" [...] appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly, though he was paid only $9 for its publication. It was concurrently published in [...] under the pseudonym [...] "Quarles".|$|E
50|$|On 25th August, Lane {{waited until}} Grice was alone at home, then let himself <b>in,</b> slit <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and {{set fire to}} her bedroom.

Her body was found by Ian Cooke, <b>her</b> boyfriends' father, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> home at Chrisdory Road, Portslade, East Sussex.|$|R
5000|$|On May 28, 1911, {{the body}} of Belle Walker, an African-American cook, was found 25 yards from her home on Garibaldi Street <b>in</b> Atlanta. <b>Her</b> <b>throat</b> had been cut by an unknown slayer, and the crime was {{reported}} in the Atlanta Constitution under the headline [...] "Negro Woman Killed; No Clue to Slayer."

5000|$|Jo is so {{committed}} to uncovering {{the mysteries of}} the voice that she agreed to have 12 needles inserted <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth, <b>throat,</b> and voice musculature.

2500|$|With the new {{recording}} contract, Loveless {{headed into}} the recording studio to record new material for Epic. In the studio, her producer (Gordy) noticed that her voice was {{not as strong as}} it had been when she last recorded two years previously. [...] The fact was that beginning as far back as 1990, Loveless felt some pain <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> when singing, and when she saw a doctor, he noticed a red spot on her vocal cords. [...] By 1992, Loveless was on a regimen of steroid tablets and cortisone to prop up her voice.|$|E

Mrs. McGillicuddy is instructed by Miss Marple {{to ask to}} use the lavatory {{as soon as they}} arrive, but is not told why. Miss Marple is eating a fish-paste sandwich when she suddenly begins to choke. It seems she has a fish bone stuck <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> Dr. Quimper moves to assist her. Mrs. McGillicuddy enters the room at that moment, sees the doctor's hands at Miss Marple's throat, and cries out, [...] "But that's him – that's the man on the train!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 2000, Eminem was {{to perform}} at a concert in Toronto's SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. [...] "I {{personally}} don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women", he said. Flaherty claims to have been [...] "disgusted" [...] when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song [...] "Kill You", which includes lines like [...] "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> no more?" [...] Eminem's fans argued {{that this was a}} matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In a Globe and Mail editorial, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, [...] "Being offensive is Eminem's job description." [...] Eminem was granted entry into Canada.|$|E
60|$|With {{this end}} in view {{he shut his}} eyes, and {{remained}} quite still for a few seconds, and when Di looked at his pinched and pale face in this placid condition, the tears would overflow their natural boundary, and sobs would rise up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>throat,</b> but she choked them back for fear of disturbing her boy.|$|R
60|$|Her {{voice broke}} down now <b>in</b> a sob, <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> seemed choked, {{but with an}} effort which seemed indeed amazing <b>in</b> one of <b>her</b> years, she {{controlled}} her tears, {{and for a moment}} was silent. The gray twilight crept in through the door of the cottage, where Mat, bareheaded and humble, still waited for the order to go.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1948, Scott {{played the}} {{ultimate}} femme fatale in Too Late for Tears, with Don DeFore, Dan Duryea, Arthur Kennedy, [...] and Kristine Miller. The story again {{takes place in}} postwar Los Angeles, where the facade of a typical married couple is shattered when someone by mistake throws $60,000 into their car. In {{an effort to keep}} the money, the wife, Jane Palmer (Scott), leaves a trail of bodies to the very end. [...] During the shooting of a scene where Scott screamed at Duryea, she accidentally broke a blood vessel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> This Hitchcock-like, black-and-white noir is widely considered Scott's best film and performance, eliciting praise even from the normally hostile New York Times. But, the film was a box-office failure when it was released, and the producer, Hunt Stromberg, was forced into bankruptcy. Decades later, one film historian noted the film's staying power: [...] "Too Late for Tears is a relatively 'unknown and unseen' noir and deserves this recognition, especially for its storyline, acting, and the incredible performance of Lizabeth Scott in the femme fatale role." ...|$|E

60|$|Talking, {{falling into}} silences touched with {{the mystery of}} sun and sea, they confessed youth's excited wonder about the world; Carl sitting cross-legged, rubbing his ankles, a springy figure in blue flannel and a daring tie; while Ruth, <b>in</b> deep-rose linen, <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> bright and bare, lay with <b>her</b> chin <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands, a flush beneath the gentle brown of her cheeks, her white-clad ankles crossed under her skirt, slender against the gray sand, {{thoughtful}} of eye, lost in happiness.|$|R
40|$|A 28 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of {{snorting}} heroin and cocaine was admitted with facial cellu-litis secondary to a dental phlegmon.

She self-medicated with a topical application of crushed acetaminophen and oxy-codone tablets to <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> to prevent discomfort while eating. Physical examination revealed poor dentition, palatal destruction, absent soft palate and a white substance (acetaminophen powder) at the posterior pharyngeal wall and buccal mucosa (figure 1).

60|$|She was glowing {{from her}} morning toilet as only healthful youth can glow: there was gem-like {{brightness}} on her coiled hair and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hazel eyes; there was warm red life <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lips; <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> had a breathing whiteness above the differing {{white of the}} fur which itself seemed to wind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a tenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which kept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.

50|$|Four {{brothers}} {{traveling to}} work at the felt mills by Bloodgood's Pond in Clark, New Jersey early one morning found the young woman lying off Central Avenue near Jefferson Avenue several hundred feet from the Central Avenue Bridge over the Rahway River.
