5|$|The {{best known}} <b>fields</b> are {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other <b>fields,</b> such as <b>fields</b> of rational functions, algebraic function <b>fields,</b> algebraic number <b>fields,</b> and p-adic <b>fields</b> are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite <b>fields,</b> i.e., <b>fields</b> with finitely many elements.|$|E

5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic <b>fields,</b> <b>fields</b> which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic <b>fields.</b> However, these cosmic magnetic <b>fields</b> may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fields</b> {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on <b>fields</b> with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number <b>fields,</b> the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function <b>fields</b> can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E

5|$|Ashburton Playing <b>Fields</b> {{are just}} off Shirley Road, behind the school.

Following pressure from the Mayor of Croydon, concerned about the large crowds, the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to public use as playing <b>fields.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>field</b> can be {{classified}} as a scalar <b>field,</b> a vector <b>field,</b> a spinor <b>field</b> or a tensor <b>field</b> according to whether the represented physical quantity is a scalar, a vector, a spinor or a tensor, respectively. A <b>field</b> has a unique tensorial character in every point where it is defined: i.e. a <b>field</b> cannot be a scalar <b>field</b> somewhere and a vector <b>field</b> somewhere else. For example, the Newtonian gravitational <b>field</b> is a vector field: specifying its value {{at a point in}} spacetime requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational <b>field</b> vector at that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a <b>field</b> can be either a classical <b>field</b> or a quantum <b>field,</b> depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators respectively. In fact in this theory an equivalent representation of <b>field</b> is a <b>field</b> particle, namely a boson.|$|R
50|$|If {{the vector}} <b>field</b> {{describes}} a velocity <b>field,</b> then the <b>field</b> lines follow stream {{lines in the}} flow.

30|$|Interaction of the sectorial type {{toroidal}} flow {{with the}} axial dipole <b>field</b> induces the sectorial type poloidal <b>field.</b> Since the sectorial harmonics dominates in the toroidal flow, the sectorial harmonics is also predominant in the poloidal <b>field.</b> As the generating layer rotates westward, the sectorial <b>field</b> rotates together. This is observed as the drifting <b>field</b> with sectorial harmonics predominant. On the other hand, the meridional type flow, {{interacting with the}} axial dipole <b>field,</b> induces the poloidal <b>field</b> of zonal harmonics. Rotation of the zonal <b>field</b> induces zero secular variation. Therefore, the zonal <b>field</b> is not observed as the drifting <b>field.</b> Consequently, the sectorial type <b>field</b> produced by the sectorial type toroidal flow is the only <b>field</b> that is observed as the drifting <b>field.</b>|$|R
