50|$|Major {{oxidative}} {{degradation products}} of MDEA include monoethanol amine (MEA), methyl-aminoethanol (MAE), diethanolamine (DEA), amino acids bicine, glycine and hydroxyethyl sarcosine (HES), formyl amides of MAE and DEA, ammonia, and stable salts formate, glycolate, acetate, and oxalate. In an industrial plan that utilizes MDEA, oxidative degradation {{is most likely}} to shift to the cross exchanger where temperatures are greater than 70 °C. Higher temperatures and higher CO2 loading accelerate the rate of degradation, resulting in an increase of alkalinity loss as well as total formate production. While MDEA is more resistant to degradation as a standalone compared to MEA, MDEA is preferentially degraded when in an MDEA/MEA blend. Because of the formation of DEA and MAE, which could form nitroso-compounds or diethylnitrosamine and diethylnitraine, the blend could potentially have an adverse impact in terms of atmospheric admissions. In the Boundary Dam plant, emissions increased when CO2 loading of lean amine increased for the blend and MEA. However, decreasing the lean loading increases the reboiler <b>heat</b> <b>duty,</b> which results in an obvious tradeoff between emissions and <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> or energy costs.|$|E
5000|$|MDEA is less {{reactive}} towards CO2, but has an {{equilibrium loading}} capacity approaching 1 mole CO2 per mole amine. It also requires less energy to regenerate. To combine {{the advantages of}} MDEA and the smaller amines, MDEA is usually mixed with a catalytic promoter such as piperazine, PZ, or a fast reacting amine such as MEA to retain reactivity, but lower regeneration costs. Activated MDEA or aMDEA uses piperazine as a catalyst {{to increase the speed}} of the reaction with CO2. It has been commercially successful. Many tests have been conducted on the performance of MDEA/MEA or MDEA/Piperazine mixtures compared to single amines. CO2 production rates were higher than MEA for the same <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> and total molar concentration when experiments were performed in the University of Regina pilot plant, which is a modeled after a natural gas plant. There were also insignificant trace amounts of degradation products detected. [...] However, when the same control variables and tests were conducted at the Boundary Dam plant, the CO2 production rate for the mixed solvent was lower than MEA. [...] This was a result of the reduction in the capacity of the solvent to absorb CO2 after degradation. Because the Boundary Dam plant is a coal-fired power plant, it operates under harsher environments and produces an impure flue gas containing, fly ash, SO2, and NO2 that are fed into carbon capture. Even with flue gas pretreatment, there is still enough to produce degradation products such as straight chain amines and sulfur compounds, which accumulate so it is no longer possible to regenerate MEA and MDEA. [...] For these blends to be successful in reducing <b>heat</b> <b>duty,</b> their chemical stabilities must be maintained.|$|E
40|$|Multicomponent {{distillation}} is a workhorse {{of current}} chemical engineering, {{used on a}} large scale in the petrochemicals, petroleum and bulk chemicals sectors. Due to its widespread use, any performance improvements developed have a substantial real-life impact. In this work, we focus on reducing the <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> requirement for multicomponent distillation through finding good configurations of distillation columns. We first explore the search space of distillation column configurations, and classify the search space into categories. We find that some categories have many more configurations than other categories, and grow much more rapidly with the number of feed components. We ask whether there are any categories that will always dominate other categories in our chosen performance measure of low <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> requirement. We find through extensive computational experiments that indeed the hypothesis is verified, and that the so-called non-sharp configurations almost always require less <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> than sharp-split configurations. Further, we find that configurations that use n– 1 columns for an n-component feed (the socalled basic configurations) require less <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> than configurations that have more columns (the so-called non-basic configurations), which would imply that basic configurations dominate non-basic configurations in both reduced <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> and lower capital cost. Subsequently, we formalize the results into a mathematical framework to generate all basic configurations, and nothing but basic configurations, which we call the supernetwork formulation. We solve for minimum <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> using conventional mathematical programming local search techniques, global search techniques, and stochastic methods. We find that local search over the continuous decisions that describe the parameters for each configuration is currently the most reliable and robust approach, beating out global search techniques in robustness and beating stochastic search in efficiency. Overall, we find that solving many relatively small non-linear programs is better than solving a single mixed-integer non-linear program for the problem of distillation configuration synthesis. We then explore ways to develop heuristics automatically from the results of the optimization through machine learning techniques. Finally, we use our methods to solve three case studies in the broad area of hydrocarbon separation. We find configurations and corresponding molar flow parameters for the recovery of ethylene from cracked naphtha which require 13 to 17 % less <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> overall and up to 17 % less methane condensation duty than configurations currently used in industry. We find configurations that reduce the <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> requirement of atmospheric crude distillation by 17 % to 20 % depending on the composition of the crude.

This paper presents the latest research results on fundamental studies of CO 2 capture process technologies at the International Test Center for CO 2 Capture (ITC). Specifically, it looks at recent advances made in reducing the reboiler <b>heat</b> <b>duty.</b> Four approaches were developed and evaluated for their contributions to the reduction of reboiler <b>heat</b> <b>duty.</b> These were: development of energy efficient solvent, process optimization, process configuration optimization, advanced process configuration optimization plus thermal energy optimizer, and activated process. In all cases, the CO 2 capture process was operated at 90 % absorber efficiency. All these approaches were compared with the conventional process using 5 molar MEA (case 1). The test results for the first 6 scenarios were obtained experimentally in 12 -inch ID absorber and regenerator columns (1 tonne/day CO 2 capture pilot plant) and by modeling using Promax. The results for the last scenario (activated process) were obtained experimentally using 2 -inch ID absorber/regenerator columns. The results showed that for the conventional configuration with 5 molar MEA, the <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> was 5. 1  GJ/tonne of CO 2 produced whereas with the same configuration with RS- 2 solvent, the <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> was 4. 3  GJ/tonne of CO 2 produced. For the process optimization case, the heat duties were 3. 0 and 2. 9  GJ/tonne of CO 2 produced for MEA and RS- 1 solvents, respectively. In the case of process configuration optimization, the heat duties were 2. 6 and 2. 1  GJ/tonne of CO 2 produced for MEA and RS- 2 solvents, respectively. For advanced process configuration optimization plus thermal energy optimizer, the heat duties were reduced to 1. 8 and 1. 6  GJ/tonne of CO 2 produced for RS- 2 and RS- 3 solvents, respectively. It was interesting to observe that with the catalyst activated process with MEA, the <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> was 2. 0  GJ/tonne CO 2 produced, and when the catalyst activated process was superimposed on the advanced process configuration process, the <b>heat</b> <b>duty</b> reduced drastically to 1. 2  GJ/tonne CO 2 produced...|$|E

The main processes installed are based on absorption, and the selection of the solvent is based on its capability to absorb or remove acid gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S). Realizing such acid gases can cause operational problems such as corrosion and equipment plugging, the solvent used for absorption can be classified into chemical and physical types. The widely used absorption processes to sweeten natural gas are using chemical solvent such as alkanolamines or simply called “amine”. In this context, monoethanolamine (MEA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) are among the most common amine used in the aqueous solution to remove both CO 2 and H 2 S gases from natural gas stream. In this research, existing process flow diagram of industrial Acid Gas Removal Unit (AGRU) has been modified in terms of solvent used for absorption process. The mixture of MEA and MDEA in aqueous amine solution replaces the existing solvent known as Benfield solution. Simulation using Aspen Hysys is then performed to compare both existing and modified absorption processes according to four parameters, which are absorption column removal efficiency, power consumption, <b>heating</b> <b>duty</b> and cooling duty. The simulation results shows amine solution offers attractive solvent option to be used in improving existing AGRU system. For the same absorption column removal efficiency, amine solution can save 11. 2 % annual power consumption, which is equivalent to RM 967270 per year. Even though there is no change for <b>heating</b> <b>duty,</b> the cooling duty requirement however can be reduced by 17 %, which saves about RM 27324 per year for the amine solution.
