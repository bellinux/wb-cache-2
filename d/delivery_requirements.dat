A key issue is to develop an effective scheduling algorithm for multiple services with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we investigate the downlink service scheduling problem in HSR network taking account of end-to-end deadline constraints and successfully packet <b>delivery</b> ratio <b>requirements.</b> Firstly, by exploiting the deterministic high-speed train trajectory, we present a time-distance mapping {{in order to obtain}} the highly dynamic link capacity effectively. Next, a novel service model is developed for deadline constrained services with <b>delivery</b> ratio <b>requirements,</b> which enables us to turn the <b>delivery</b> ratio <b>requirement</b> into a single queue stability problem. Based on the Lyapunov drift, the optimal scheduling problem is formulated and the corresponding scheduling service algorithm is proposed by stochastic network optimization approach.

In the paper, we consider a source-initiated (one-to-all) broadcast scenario in wirelessly-relay sensor networks (WSNs) with a high <b>delivery</b> probability <b>requirement.</b> We analyze both the transmission and the reception power to gain insights into the optimization of the overall power consumption of WSNs at network planning stage. Specifically, at the network planning stage, one wishes to maximize the network lifetime of the network through a proper selection of three key design parameters including the transmission range, the sleep period, and the broadcast probability. As a rule of thumb, the optimal number of nodes awaken to broadcast messages within a transmission range is constant with a given network size and path loss exponent for a target <b>delivery</b> probability <b>requirement.</b> Given the optimal settings above, we also present the trade-off between the delay requirement and power consumption. Our results can serve as general guidelines at the network planning stage. ...|$|R
