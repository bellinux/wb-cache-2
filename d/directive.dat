Article 31C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to the <b>Directive</b> Principles in Article 39(b)–(c) would not be invalid {{on the grounds that they}} derogated from the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the <b>Directive</b> Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1970, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights and <b>Directive</b> Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has adopted the view of the Fundamental Rights and <b>Directive</b> Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{preparedness}} of medical students towards advance <b>directives</b> and related end-of-life issues, {{and to examine}} background factors such as knowledge, attitudes, and experience concerning advance <b>directives</b> and related end-of-life issues. Methods: In 2007, 448 medical students in years 3 to 5 were surveyed at the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of advance <b>directives</b> and related end-of-life issues, and their self-perceived preparedness to discuss these matters with patients were evaluated. Results: A total of 220 (49 %) of the eligible students responded, of whom 79 % supported the use of advance <b>directives.</b> Only 65 (30 %) students were certain of what advance <b>directives</b> meant and 198 (90 %) students felt that their knowledge of advance <b>directives</b> was inadequate. Also, 197 (90 %) students felt unprepared about advance <b>directives</b> and end-of-life issues. Factors associated with positive attitude towards advance <b>directives</b> included religion and knowledge. No factors {{were found to be}} associated with self-perceived preparedness towards advance <b>directives</b> or end-of-life issues. Conclusions: Most of the medical students surveyed demonstrated a positive attitude towards advance <b>directives</b> and recognised the importance of advance <b>directives.</b> However, they felt that they were unprepared and lacking in knowledge and experience of advance <b>directives</b> and end-of-life issues.

40|$|European {{environmental}} law {{consists of a}} large number of <b>directives</b> and regulations dealing with environmental domains such as air, water, or waste, or with issues such as greenhouse gases, chemicals or industrial emissions. These <b>directives</b> and regulations do not form a comprehensive system of {{environmental law}}. Particularly those subjects which have transboundary effects or affect the internal market are regulated at the EU level. In view of the subsidiarity principle (Article 5 (3) TEU), other parts of environmental law are left to the Member States. Member States each have their own existing national system of environmental law. <b>Directives</b> have to be transposed into those national systems by the Member States. It is in this process of transposition that flaws in or discrepancies between <b>directives</b> are likely to be felt. In order to facilitate their implementation, it is important that <b>directives</b> form a coherent system: provisions from different <b>directives</b> should not clash, and preferably the same terms and definitions should be used. This enables the Member States to implement the <b>directives</b> in a general act in the field of environmental law, and moreover does not force them to differentiate between terms coming from different <b>directives.</b> This chapter will first pay attention to the implementation of environmental <b>directives</b> (Section 1).
