SEIU's Los Angeles Justice for <b>Janitors</b> campaign was portrayed in the motion picture Bread and Roses.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} strike of <b>Janitors</b> for Justice in Los Angeles began on April 3, 1990. The <b>janitors</b> marched and held demonstrations during the daytime for the 3 weeks.

The archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony, held a special mass for the <b>janitors.</b> Also, mayor Richard Riordan joined the campaign by voicing his support for the <b>janitors</b> and their union.The <b>janitors</b> in Los Angeles stayed on strike until April 22. By this time, they had reached a contract that guaranteed at least a 22% raise over the next three years.|$|R

Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in the position to give it to the women.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiple}} Justice for <b>Janitors</b> {{campaigns have}} made many developments for <b>janitors</b> across the country. SEIU {{has worked with}} immigrant <b>janitors,</b> providing English language programs. SEIU also provides classes for <b>janitors</b> to help improve their computer skills. So far, 27 master contracts have been made with commercial cleaning contractors across the country. These contracts have helped to increase wages as well as health benefits for the <b>janitors.</b> The contracts have also created full-time jobs for some previously part-time workers. All of these accomplishments have led to an ensured stability for the labor force.|$|R
50|$|Justice for <b>Janitors</b> (JfJ) is {{a social}} {{movement}} organization that fights {{for the rights of}} <b>janitors</b> (caretakers and cleaners) across the US and Canada.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{important}} cause of infection, and brings additional concern with methicillin resistance. In addition, nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization rates among health care workers are higher than that for general population. To determine the prevalence rate and risk factors for the colonization of S. aureus, including MRSA, among <b>janitors</b> working in hospitals in northern Taiwan, we conducted this study. Between June and August, 2014, a total of 186 <b>janitors,</b> 111 working in hospitals and 75 working in non-medical institutions, were recruited. Specimens {{were obtained from the}} nares of the subjects for the detection of S. aureus, with a questionnaire completed for each subject. All the S. aureus isolates, including MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), were further molecularly characterized. The nasal carriage rate of S. aureus was 15. 3 % for hospital <b>janitors</b> and 13. 3 % for non-medical <b>janitors.</b> The carriage rate of MRSA was 3. 6 % for hospital <b>janitors</b> and 1. 3 % for non-medical <b>janitors.</b> No statistically significant difference was found in the nasal carriage rate of S. aureus (p = 0. 707) and MRSA (p = 0. 65) between hospital <b>janitors</b> and non-medical <b>janitors.</b> Hospital <b>janitors</b> working in hospital more than 6 years and cleaning microbiologic laboratories were significantly associated with nasal S. aureus colonization. All 5 MRSA isolates carried either staphylococcal cassette chromosome type IV or V and three of them belonged to sequence type (ST) 59, the community clone prevailing in Taiwan. Of the 22 MSSA isolates, six pulsotypes were identified, with one major type for 14 isolates (shared by five STs) and another type for 4 isolates (all belonged to ST 188). Exposure to the hospital environment may not increase the nasal carriage rate of S. aureus, including MRSA, among <b>janitors</b> in hospitals in Taiwan. However, for <b>janitors</b> in the hospital setting, working for more than six years in hospital and cleaning laboratories may be risks factors for carrying S. aureus...|$|R

5|$|In 2006, a <b>janitor</b> of Sony/ATV Music Publishing {{found in}} a {{dumpster}} the unfinished lyrics written by Williams that {{had been found in}} his car the night he died.

The <b>janitor</b> was accused of theft, but the charges were later dropped when a judge determined that her version of events was true. The unfinished lyrics were later returned to Sony/ATV, which handed them to Bob Dylan in 2008 to complete the songs for a new album.

40|$|This study, using {{individual}} worker data on <b>janitors</b> {{taken from}} the 1985 – 2001 Current Population Survey and industry injury data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, examines whether compensation for working in a high-risk work environment contributes to the relatively high wage rates of hospital <b>janitors.</b> The authors find that when the analysis corrects for risk endogeneity (workers’ tendency to sort themselves according to their tolerance for workplace risk), risk compensation increases wage rates by 13. 4 % for union hospital <b>janitors</b> and is {{a major source of}} their wage advantage over nonunion <b>janitors</b> in other industries. Since this risk compensation is only available to union workers, the authors interpret this result as the effect of the union voice mechanism...|$|R
50|$|The {{campaigns of}} Justice for <b>Janitors</b> also use master {{contracts}} that are market-wide.

40|$|Excerpt] The Justice for <b>Janitors</b> {{campaign}} was conceived during a bitter labor dispute with Pittsburgh 2 ̆ 7 s Mellon Bank which started late in 1985. Mellon Bank, having just renewed an Service Employees International Union collective-bargaining agreement, replaced their former cleaning contractor with a nonunion company. The new contractor refused {{to honor the}} Mellon-SEIU labor accord and was willing to hire only half of Mellon 2 ̆ 7 s 80 <b>janitors</b> on a part-time basis with a substantial pay cut and no benefits. Mellon disclaimed any responsibility, stating that the dispute was strictly between the new cleaning contractor and the <b>janitors.</b> In response the SEIU called a strike, filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB and began an active media campaign against Mellon. The strike was settled in September 1987 when the NLRB ruled Mellon to be a 2 ̆ 2 co-employer 2 ̆ 2 of the <b>janitors.</b> Mellon subsequently agreed to reinstate <b>janitors</b> under the union contract and to pay 750, 000 in back wages (Wright 1987) ...|$|R
