500|$|In {{contrast}} to the strained relationship depicted on-camera among Colbert, O'Brien and Stewart, the three are actually good friends and admire each other's shows. O'Brien admitted that, [...] "{{the three of us}} have come along in the same comedic environment," [...] and that, while [...] "our shows all probably have their distinct flavor, [...] this happened because the three of us <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> like doing this with each other."

500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E

500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.' Before we left the hotel that night, we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue {{and fell in love with}} it, believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E

2500|$|Mahindra team {{principal}} Dilbagh Gill eulogised his team's maiden victory, {{calling it}} [...] "a massive breakthrough for Mahindra and Indian sport" [...] but stated {{the company would}} not get eager for more wins but believed further successes would come: [...] "We knew it would happen soon because we have had increased confidence with multiple podiums. For some reason when I {{woke up this morning}} I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> win." [...] After starting from 14th and gaining positions to finish in fifth place, Buemi was disqualified from the race after post-race scrutineering determined that all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of [...] set by tyre supplier Michelin, causing him to be in breach of Article 25.11 of the series' sporting regulations. Buemi's disqualification meant his teammate Prost, Bird, Vergne and Engel all gained one place and Turvey moved into the final points-scoring position of tenth. e.Dams-Renault co-owner Alain Prost admitted it was a mistake by his team but stated their task was to improve in the following day's race and enable Buemi to remain in contention for the championship. Buemi spoke of his disappointment in the outcome but said he would remain focused on the second race and return with stronger form.|$|E

It's a game that's ready to be made, but that decision is Capcom's to make". However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of Life Is Strange before proceeding with the sequel to Remember Me.

Biddy kept us going by her eating-house, but eventually we wanted machinery, and we mortgaged the eating-house, and the money went into that hole in the ground.

The first of the flood tide was setting in, when we ran below where we thought the line was stretched and dropped over a fishing-boat anchor. Keeping a short rope to the anchor, so that it barely touched the bottom, we dragged it slowly along until it stuck and the boat fetched up hard and fast.|$|E

Señor Kenwardine knew {{it would have been a}} mistake to show he thought I suspected him and that he had something to conceal. We were both very frank, to a point, and now and then talked about the complications that might spring from the coaling business. Because we value our trade with England and wish to attract British capital, he <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not interfere with him unless we had urgent grounds, and wished to learn how far we would let him go. It must be owned that in this country official suspicion can often be disarmed." ...|$|E

Each night he boiled pieces of his moccasins in a cup, and ate them. He did not have much moccasins left. And he was a Coast Indian, and told us these things through Passuk, who talked his tongue. He was a {{stranger}} in the Yukon, and he knew not the way, but his face was set to Pelly. How far was it? Two sleeps? ten? a hundred--he did not know, but he was going to Pelly.
