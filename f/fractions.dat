5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog <b>Fractions</b> {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog <b>Fractions</b> was taken more seriously among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog <b>Fractions</b> with that in mind. Instead, Crawford explained that Frog <b>Fractions</b> had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered educational games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} consistency {{in the way in which}} decimal <b>fractions</b> were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal <b>fractions.</b> Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E
5|$|Decimal <b>fractions</b> can {{be added}} by a simple {{modification}} of the above process. One aligns two decimal <b>fractions</b> above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E
50|$|A complex <b>fraction</b> is a <b>fraction</b> whose {{numerator}} or denominator, or both, {{contains a}} <b>fraction.</b> A simple <b>fraction</b> contains no <b>fraction</b> either in its numerator or its denominator.

5|$|In {{order to}} make money from Frog <b>Fractions,</b> Crawford first sold the game's soundtrack, with part of the {{proceeds}} going to the game's music team. He later decided to sell T-shirts containing jokes from the game in order to benefit its art team. While developing Frog <b>Fractions,</b> Crawford said that {{he came up with}} a lot of other video game ideas, but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into Frog <b>Fractions</b> rather than start a new project, due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E

40|$|A {{long-term}} continuous runoff monitoring {{was carried}} out in a highway in Winterthur, Switzerland. The total suspended solids (TSS) samples were fractionated into fine (45 μm) <b>fraction</b> and their washoff behavior was studied. The fine and coarse <b>fraction</b> showed different washoff behaviors. During the runoff the concentration of the fine <b>fraction</b> was less fluctuated compared to coarse. The fluctuation of the coarse <b>fraction</b> was more influenced by TSS concentration.

5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written {{as many times as}} necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most <b>fractions</b> with a numerator greater than one, they had to write <b>fractions</b> as the sum of several <b>fractions.</b> For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common <b>fractions,</b> however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|Crawford {{announced}} {{his plans for}} a sequel, Frog <b>Fractions</b> 2, via a Kickstarter campaign in March 2014, with a planned release in 2015. The campaign included a number of elements that pointed players towards a larger alternate reality game (ARG) that incorporated a number of web sites, social media accounts, real-life locations, and around two dozen independent video games. The ARG was solved by players around December 2016, discovering a physical box that triggered the release of Frog <b>Fractions</b> 2, hidden within {{the content of the}} video game Glittermitten Grove.|$|E

5|$|Frog <b>Fractions</b> is a 2012 browser game {{developed}} by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, {{has been described}} as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling a frog to eat bugs and defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in <b>fractions,</b> but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.|$|E
5|$|Its sequel Frog <b>Fractions</b> 2, {{announced}} by a Kickstarter in 2014, {{was released in}} December 2016 after players successfully completed a multi-segmented alternative reality game assembled by Crawford.|$|E

5|$|Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{is named after}} James Joseph Sylvester, who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially, and {{the sum of its}} reciprocals forms a series of unit <b>fractions</b> that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit <b>fractions</b> with the same number of terms. The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian Einstein manifolds, and hard instances for online algorithms.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between canopy gap <b>fraction</b> and grey-pixel <b>fraction</b> is actually {{mediated by the}} SCB length (Fig.  11).

Moreover, in the model canopy system, the SCB length and gap <b>fraction</b> could be varied independently (Table  1, Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). These {{results indicated that the}} {{relationship between}} gap <b>fraction</b> and the SCB length in Figs.  2 and 3 is a tendency rather than a cause-and-effect relationship, so is the relationship between gap <b>fraction</b> and the grey-pixel <b>fraction</b> (Fig.  11).|$|R
