50|$|Encephalartos is a genus of cycad {{native to}} Africa. Several species of Encephalartos are {{commonly}} referred to as <b>bread</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>bread</b> palms or kaffir bread, since a bread-like starchy food can be prepared from the centre of the stem. The genus name is derived from the Greek words en (within), kephali (head), and artos (bread), referring {{to the use of the}} pith to make food. They are, in evolutionary terms, some of the most primitive living gymnosperms.|$|R

Recently, a leaf blight disease was noted on several E. altensteinii plants growing at the foot of Table Mountain in the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens of South Africa. Preliminary isolations from dead and dying leaves of E. altensteinii, E. lebomboensis and E. princeps, collected from South Africa, revealed the presence of several novel microfungi on this host. Novelties include Phaeomoniella capensis, Saccharata kirstenboschensis, Teratosphaeria altensteinii and T. encephalarti. New host records of species previously only known to occur on Proteaceae include Cladophialophora proteae and Catenulostroma microsporum, as well as a hyperparasite, Dactylaria leptosphaeriicola, occurring on ascomata of T. encephalarti...|$|R

The body of a canoe is assembled {{from a combination of}} wood types; based {{on the size of the}} body, approximately 21 – 27 pieces of wood plates are used. Based on position and functional necessity, the wood plates must be made of different materials; for example, Fiji longan is used for the bilge keel, and <b>bread</b> <b>tree</b> is used for the top level of the side panel. No nails are used to fabricate the ship; only wood nogs made of small-leaved Mulberry are used for joining. To avoid leaks, the gaps between plates are stuffed with fibers from the root of Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum.|$|R
5000|$|In {{several species}} the pith {{of the trunk}} {{contains}} a copious amount of high quality starch below the crown. This was formerly cut out by native people as food. Thunberg recorded around 1772 that the Hottentots removed the stem's pith at the crown and buried it wrapped in animal skin for about two months, after which they recovered it for kneading into bread, whence the vernacular name [...] "broodboom" [...] (i.e. <b>bread</b> <b>tree).</b> The burial of the pith apparently facilitated its fermentation and softening, and the dough was lightly roasted over a coal fire. In 1779 Paterson likewise found that the pith of a [...] "large palm" [...] near King William's Town was utilised by the Africans and Hottentots as bread. The pith was removed and left till sourish, before it was kneaded into bread.|$|R

Chukwu ordered Nri to sacrifice his first son and daughter and bury them in separate graves. Nri complied with it. Later after three Igbo-weeks (12 days) yam grew from the grave of the son and coco yam from that of the daughter.
