The Away-From-Home terminal {{could be described}} as the objective terminal for a train crew. Schreiber was, and remains, a <b>home</b> <b>terminal</b> train crew change point for the railroad. As such, a portion of its populace is trained and employed to operate the trains from Schreiber in both directions, westward on the Nipigon Subdivision to Thunder Bay, the next train crew change-off point or eastward on the Heron Bay Subdivision to the change-off terminal of White River, Ontario. This status of being a <b>home</b> <b>terminal</b> for train crews ensures the township of a number of high-quality skilled jobs.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the Berendrecht Lock (1989), a {{crowning}} achievement in developing the right bank dock complex was obtained. With a length of 500 m between the lock gates and a width of 68 m, the Berendrecht lock is the largest lock in the world. This lock has a depth of 13.50 m, which makes the sill depth at mean high water equal to 17.75 m. Apart from the Lock, still further development of the right bank has been undertaken {{on the banks of the}} Scheldt outside the dock complex. Two large container terminals have been opened here. In 1990, the Europe terminal was operative, while secondly, the North Sea terminal became operative in 1997. The older areas of the port, such as the Bonaparte dock, are being modernized as needs dictate to make them suitable for modern cargo handling operations. Among this modernisation, an upgrade of the Amerika dock, the Albert dock and the third harbour dock are being done to make them accessible to Panamax ships, which have a draught of 42 feet (13 m). Other modernisation projects being undertaken is the Delwaide dock, which will soon be able to serve the latest generation of container vessels. The Southern part of the Delwaide dock, the MSC <b>Home</b> <b>Terminal</b> is a partnership between PSA Hesse-Noord Natie and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC).

Some of the more popular routes included the Los Angeles-Washington D.C transcontinental and the Rocky Mountain Adventure. Both featured breathtaking scenery throughout the trips with layovers in select cities affording the passengers the opportunity to enjoy the amenities each city offered.

5000|$|The {{economic}} {{possibilities that}} came with the railroad caused business leaders in Pekin to be very interested to pull the switch yard closer and get the new [...] "railroad people" [...] with steady work and good pay in their town. Ultimately most employees opted to settle close to the yard which was already located in South Pekin. In addition to the numerous blue collar jobs the C&NW operation also brought management positions and erected a three story masonry office building (Demolished near the beginning of the 21st century). South Pekin was a <b>home</b> <b>terminal</b> for Chicago and Northwestern Railroad crews in the twentieth century. Trains were made {{up in the middle of}} the town in a [...] "Kick" [...] Yard. After the trains were put together, crews would get on the train and proceed south to East St. Louis or north to Nelson, where they would be relieved and allowed to sleep for the next tour of operation. The Chicago and Northwestern also maintained a bunkhouse in South Pekin where crews could stop for the night. In the 1970s train crews would go onward through Nelson and proceed to Proviso (a suburb of Chicago) or to Clinton, Iowa. At times there were as many as 20 + trains per day either made up at South Pekin or that went through South Pekin.|$|E

Using Lagrangian relaxation, the other formulation allows a very tight bound on the optimal solution to be calculated. The quality of the heuristic solution can be determined by comparison with this bound. A large scale example based on actual truck shipments demonstrates how the model might be used in planning truck backhauling. For this example, the heuristic yields a solution within 1 % of optimal. ...|$|E

Among the health problems under surveillance was acute diarrhoea. Data for each patient who fulfilled the usual case definition for acute diarrhoea were reported by general practitioners using <b>home</b> <b>terminals</b> (Minitels) connected to a central computer by telephone. Over one year 2234 cases of diarrhoea were reported, the incidence varying from 0. 8 to 1. 5 cases per doctor per week. Seasonal variations in incidence were observed, with peaks in the winter and in the summer. Only 379 (17 %) episodes of diarrhoea were classified as severe, and these patients consulted their general practitioners earlier than patients whose diarrhoea was less severe. Foreign travel was rarely found in the patients' histories, but clusters of cases were found in communities (4. 6 %) and in families (22. 3 %). The advantages of this system were easy reporting and immediate feedback, but it was difficult to extrapolate the data, and the system was inadequate for intervening in outbreaks of diarrhoeal disease.

40|$|Truck {{backhauling}} reduces empty truck-miles {{by having}} drivers haul loads on trips {{back to their}} <b>home</b> <b>terminal.</b> This paper 1) examines the impact on backhauling opportunities of terminal locations and directional imbalances {{in the flow of}} freight from the terminals, and 2) develops a method for determining which truckloads should be backhauled. Backhauling is studied for two terminals sending full truckloads to many customers under steady-state conditions. This research develops two backhauling models. The first is a continuous model that makes simplifying assumptions about customer locations and travel distances. It results in formulae showing that 1) savings from backhauling increase at a decreasing rate as the directional flow of freight between two terminals becomes more balanced and 2) backhauling is an important, but often ignored, factor in terminal (e. g. trucking terminal, warehouse, or plant) location and supplier selection decisions. The second model is a more general discrete model that determines which loads should be backhauled to minimize empty truck-miles. ...|$|E
