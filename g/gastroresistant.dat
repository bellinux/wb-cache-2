40|$|Nutraceuticals {{provide an}} {{additional}} health or medicinal benefit besides their nutritional value {{and are therefore}} marketed for the prevention and treatment of certain conditions. Nutraceuticals contain natural ingredients, usually presented {{in the form of}} functional foods or as dietary supplements. Many of the ingredients are susceptible to degradation by gastric acid or can provoke nauseatic feelings or induce vomiting on oral administration. <b>Gastroresistant</b> coatings, widely researched and used in pharmaceuticals, employ enteric polymers which are not regarded as natural ingredients or do not possess GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status by the regulatory bodies, thus cannot be used for nutraceutical products. Consequently, most nutraceuticals are not formulated as <b>gastroresistant</b> and can therefore lack efficacy or are well tolerated. This manuscript provides a critical review of natural substances employed in producing <b>gastroresistant</b> products, their shortcomings, and potential industrial applications. It also identifies current gaps in our knowledge to encourage further research in this area...|$|E

These tablets were prepared either by direct compression of both powders or by the formulation of microspheres that were then compressed. The microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffractometry analyses.

40|$|Spray-dried {{aqueous extract}} from citrus {{by-product}} (“pastazzo”, ExO) was studied {{to evaluate the}} polyphenols content, the antioxidant properties and the inhibition of metalloproteinases over-expressed in dysmetabolic disease. During shelf life studies, ExO changes polyphenols content and decreases the antioxidant properties. Furthermore, Citrus flavonoids are unstable in gastric environment and ExO showed an incomplete in vitro dissolution rate in simulated biological fluids, probably due to their low solubility. For these reasons, formulation studies have been performed to develop spray-dried <b>gastroresistant</b> microsystems for oral administration. Our studies revealed that all the prepared <b>gastroresistant</b> microsystems preserved the polyphenols content, prolonged the shelf-life and the antioxidant efficiency of ExO and maintaining its inhibitory effects on metalloproteinases...|$|E
40|$|Diclofenac Sodium (DS) {{was chosen}} as model drug for colonic drug {{delivery}} because of its large use against the Arthritis rheumatoid therapy, that determines an increment of pain during the early morning. This aspect drove this study to the preparation of colon specific formulations able to guarantee the absorption of the drug several hours after the oral administration. Nanoparticles hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP) based containing DS were prepared. The efficacy of HP as <b>gastroresistant</b> polymer was evaluated. Comparison between <b>gastroresistant</b> properties of HP and the characteristics of <b>gastroresistant</b> polymer Eudragit L 100 ® was done.

40|$|Nanoparticles {{can be used}} as an {{attractive}} carrier for the controlled delivery of drugs by the oral route. This nanoparticular delivery system can protect an active ingredient from enzymatic degradations and enhance its absorption from the intestinal mucosa. We studied the development of a <b>gastroresistant</b> dosage form for the oral administration of nanoparticles. Fast disintegrating pellets were used for the administration of nanoparticles and for their transit to the site of absorption. A <b>gastroresistant</b> film was applied onto the pellets to protect the nanoparticles and/ or the active substance from the acid gastric environment. The integrity of the nanoparticle size was assessed after two critical manufacturing steps: the extrusion/spheronisation process and the coating process. The determination of the nanoparticles size distribution was performed by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). The comparison of the PCS results between the original nanoparticles and the nanoparticles incorporated in the pellets shows a very low aggregation. Moreover the coating process was not a critical step since it was not responsible for an additional agglomeration of the nanoparticles. In conclusion, our manufacturing process allows the redispersion of the nanoparticles with a little change of the size distribution. In a next study we well try to quantify the release of the nanoparticles from the pellets. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Naringenin (Nn) and Quercetin (Q) have {{numerous}} {{health benefits}} particularly {{due to their}} antioxidant properties. However, their low solubility, bioavailability and stability limit their use as components for functional foods, nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical agents. In this research, Nn- and Q-microparticles were produced by a spray-drying process {{using a combination of}} cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) as coating <b>gastroresistant</b> polymer and swelling or surfactant agents as enhancers of dissolution rate. Raw materials and microparticles produced were all characterized by particle size analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and imaged by electron and fluorescence microscopy. During 12 months, storage stability was evaluated by analyzing drug content, HPLC and DSC profiles, as well as antioxidant activity (DPPH test). In vitro dissolution tests, using a pH-change method, were carried out to investigate the influence of formulative parameters on flavonoid release from the microparticles. Presence of a combination of CAP and surfactants or swelling agents in the formulations produced microparticles with good resistance at low pH of the gastric fluid and complete flavonoid release in the intestinal environment.

40|$|Ketoprofen <b>gastroresistant</b> {{microspheres}} {{were prepared}} by spray-drying using common pH dependent polymers, such as Eudragit S and L, CAP, CAT and HPMCP. The long ketoprofen recrystallization {{time was a}} serious hindrance to the preparation of microspheres having a drug content higher than 35 %. Microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry and in vitro dissolution studies, and used for the preparation of tablets. During this step, the compaction ability of the spray-dried powders was measured. While the compressibility of the microspheres containing the enteric cellulosic derivatives are not acceptable and {{different from those of}} the microcrystalline cellulose, the compaction properties of ketoprofen/Eudragit L or S microspheres are comparable to those of the Avicel PH 101. In vitro dissolution studies were performed on the microspheres and the tablets. All microspheres showed a good gastroresistance, but some differences among the five polymers in reducing drug release at low pH values are present. Acrylic polymers (Eudragit L or S) are considerably more effective than the cellulosic derivatives CAP and CAT, while the HPMCP profile is in an intermediate position. These differences are erased by the microspheres compression process.

The raw materials and the microparticles were investigated by differential-scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and imaged using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy. In vitro dissolution tests were conducted using a pH-change method to investigate the influence of formulative parameters on the dissolution/release properties of the drug. CAP/Hd microparticles showed a good gastro-resistance but incomplete drug dissolution in the simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). The presence of the enhancers in the formulation produced well-formed microparticles with different size and morphology, containing the drug well coated by the polymer. All the enhancers were able to increase the dissolution rate of Hd in the simulated intestinal environment without altering CAP ability to protect Hd in the acidic fluid.

40|$|Hydroxytyrosol (HT) plays a {{significant}} role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) protection, and its metabolites are able to protect from the endothelial dysfunction commonly present in atherosclerosis. This randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial determined the effect in healthy volunteers of two <b>gastroresistant</b> capsules containing 15 [*]mg/day of HT, for a 3 -week period (HTT). Evaluation of nutritional status, serum metabolites, oxidative stress biomarkers, and gene expression of 9 genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and CVDs was performed. Oxidation biomarkers like thiol group (p= 0. 001), total antioxidant status (TAS) (p= 0. 001), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) (2 −ΔΔCt[*]=[*] 3. 7), and plasma concentration of HT (2. 83 μg·mL− 1) were significantly increased, while nitrite (p= 0. 001), nitrate (p= 0. 001), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p= 0. 02) were drastically reduced after HTT. A significant reduction of body fat mass percentage (p= 0. 01), suprailiac skinfold (p= 0. 01), and weight (p= 0. 04; Δ%[*]=[*]− 0. 46 %) was observed after HTT.

In this study, Zn-alginate beads containing ketoprofen (K) were developed by a tandem technique prilling/ionotropic gelation. The effect of main critical variables on particles micromeritics, inner structure {{as well as on}} drug loading and in vitro drug release was studied. The in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy was evaluated using a modified protocol of carrageenan-induced edema in rat paw administering beads to rats by oral gavage at 0, 3, or 5  h before edema induction. Good drug loading and desired particle size and morphology were obtained for the optimized formulation F 20. In vitro dissolution studies showed that F 20 had a <b>gastroresistant</b> behavior and delayed release of the drug in simulated intestinal fluid. The in vitro delayed release pattern was clearly reflected in the prolonged anti-inflammatory effect in vivo of F 20, compared to pure ketoprofen; F 20, administered 3  h before edema induction, showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity, reducing maximum paw volume in response to carrageenan injection, whereas no response was observed for ketoprofen.

40|$|Purpose: Loratadine {{is used as}} {{antihistaminic}} without {{side effects}} in nervous systems. This drug is a weak base and it is absorbed from the intestine. The nitrogen of the pyridine ring is protonated in the stomach affecting the oral bioavailability. The aim {{of this paper was}} obtaining, characterize and evaluate the release profiles and the stability of a <b>gastroresistant</b> loratadine nanosuspension. Methods: The nanosuspension was prepared by the solvent displacement evaporation method, using three different polymers (Eudragit® L 100 55, Kollicoat® MAE 100 P and PEG 4000) and Polysorbate 80. Dynamic Light Scattering was used for evaluating the particle size (PS), zeta potential, and conductivity of the nanosuspension. Loratadine release profiles were evaluated in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The shelf and accelerated stability were assessed during three months. Results: Nanosuspension particle size was 45. 94  ±  0. 50  nm, with a low polydispersion index (PdI, 0. 300). Kollicoat® MAE 100 P produced a hard and flexible coating layer. In simulated intestinal fluids, the 100 percent of loratadine was released in 40  min, while in simulated stomach fluids the release was lesser than 5 %. Nanosuspension presented a good physicochemical stability showing a reduction in PS and PdI after three months (43. 29  ±  0. 16 and 0. 250; respectively). Conclusions: A promissory loratadine nanosuspension for loratadine intestinal delivery was obtained, by using a low energy method, which is an advantage for a possible scale up for practical purpose...|$|E
40|$|Luca Prosperini, Simona Pontecorvo Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy Abstract: Delayed-release {{dimethyl}} fumarate (DMF), {{also known}} as <b>gastroresistant</b> DMF, is the most recently approved oral disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for relapsing multiple sclerosis. Two randomized clinical trials (Determination of the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Fumarate in Relapsing–Remitting MS [DEFINE] and Comparator and an Oral Fumarate in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis [CONFIRM]) demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing relapse rate and radiological signs of disease activity, as seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The DEFINE study also indicated a significant effect of DMF on disability worsening, while the low incidence of confirmed disability worsening in the CONFIRM trial rendered an insignificant reduction among the DMF-treated groups when compared to placebo. DMF also demonstrated a good safety profile and acceptable tolerability, since the most common side effects (gastrointestinal events and flushing reactions) are usually transient and mild to moderate in severity. Here, we discuss the place in therapy of DMF for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis, providing a tentative therapeutic algorithm to manage newly diagnosed patients {{and those who do}} not adequately respond to self-injectable DMTs. Literature data supporting the potential role of DMF as a first-line therapy are presented. The possibility of using DMF as switching treatment or even as an add-on strategy in patients with breakthrough disease despite self-injectable DMTs will also be discussed. Lastly, we argue about the role of DMF as an exit strategy from natalizumab-treated patients who are considered at risk for developing multifocal progressive leukoencephalopathy.

40|$|AbstractFondaparinux (Fpx) is the {{anticoagulant}} {{of choice}} {{in the treatment of}} short- and medium-term thromboembolic disease. To overcome the low oral bioavailability of Fpx, a new nanoparticulate carrier has been developed. The nanoparticles (NPs) contain squalenyl derivatives, known for their excellent oral bioavailability. They spontaneously self-assemble upon both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the polyanionic Fpx and cationic squalenyl (CSq) derivatives. The preparation conditions were optimized to obtain monodisperse, stable NPs with a mean diameter in the range of 150 – 200 nm. The encapsulation efficiencies were around 80 %. Fpx loadings reached 39 wt. %. According to structural and morphological analysis, Fpx and CSq organized in spherical multilamellar (“onion-type”) nanoparticles. Furthermore, in vivo studies in rats suggested that Fpx was well absorbed from the orally administered NPs, which totally dissociated when reaching the blood stream, leading to the release of free Fpx. The Fpx:CSq NPs improved the plasmatic concentration of Fpx in a dose-dependent manner. However, the oral bioavailability of these new NPs remained low (around 0. 3 %) but of note, the Cmax obtained after oral administration of 50 mg/kg NPs was close to the prophylactic plasma concentration needed to treat venous thromboembolism. Moreover, the oral bioavailability of Fpx could be dramatically increased up to 9 % by including the nanoparticles into <b>gastroresistant</b> capsules. This study opens up new perspectives for the oral administration of Fpx and paves the way towards elaborating squalene-based NPs which self assemble without the need of covalently grafting the drug to Sq...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{platform}} of alginate beads loaded with Prednisolone in hypromellose/gellan gum capsules (F 6 /Cps) able to delay steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (SAID) release as needed for chronotherapy of rheumatoid arthritis is proposed. Rheumatoid arthritis, showing a worsening in symptoms in the morning upon waking, is a pathology that can benefit from chronotherapy. With the aim to maximize prednisolone therapeutic action allowing the right timing of glucocorticoid therapy, different engineered microparticles (gel-beads) were manufactured using prilling (laminar jet break-up) as micro-encapsulation technique and Zn-alginate as <b>gastroresistant</b> carrier. Starting from various feed solutions and process parameters, {{the effect of the}} variables on particles size, morphology, solid state properties and drug release was studied. The optimization of operative and prilling/ionotropic gelation variables led to microspheres with almost spherical shape and a narrow dimensional range. The feed solution with the highest alginate (2. 5 % w/v) amount and drug/polymer ratio (1 : 5 w/w) gave rise to the highest encapsulation efficiency (78. 5 %) as in F 6 formulation. As to drug release, F 6 exhibited an interesting dissolution profile, releasing about 24 % of the drug in simulated gastric fluid followed by a more sustained profile in simulated intestinal fluid. #F 6, acting as a gastro-resistant and delayed release formulation, was selected for in vivo studies on male Wistar rats by means of a carrageenan-induced oedema model.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Bacteria {{might be}} {{involved}} in the development and persistence of inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and antibiotics could be used in therapy. We performed a clinical phase 2 trial to determine whether a <b>gastroresistant</b> formulation of rifaximin (extended intestinal release [EIR]) induced remission in patients with moderately active CD. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of the efficacy and safety of 400, 800, and 1200 mg rifaximin-EIR, given twice daily to 402 patients with moderately active CD for 12 weeks. Data from patients given rifaximin-EIR were compared with those from individuals given placebo, and collected during a 12 -week follow-up period. The primary end point was remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index < 150) {{at the end of the}} treatment period. RESULTS: At the end of the 12 -week treatment period, 62 % of patients who received the 800 -mg dosage of rifaximin-EIR (61 of 98) were in remission, compared with 43 % of patients who received placebo (43 of 101) (P =. 005). A difference was maintained throughout the 12 -week follow-up period (45 % [40 of 89] vs 29 % [28 of 98]; P =. 02). Remission was achieved by 54 % (56 of 104) and 47 % (47 of 99) of the patients given the 400 -mg and 1200 -mg dosages of rifaximin-EIR, respectively; these rates did not differ from those of placebo. Patients given the 400 -mg and 800 -mg dosages of rifaximin-EIR had low rates of withdrawal from the study because of adverse events; rates were significantly higher among patients given the 1200 -mg dosage (16 % [16 of 99]).

40|$|SummaryThe {{pharmacokinetics}} of chondroitin sulfate (CS, Condrosulf®, IBSA, Lugano, Switzerland) {{were investigated}} in rats and in healthy volunteers using CS tritiated at the reducing end and CS labeled with 131 I or 99 mTc respectively. A rapid absorption of orally administered CS is observed in rats and in humans when {{the drug is}} dissolved in water. Lower and delayed absorption is observed when CS is administered in <b>gastroresistant</b> capsules. The absolute bio-availability is 15 and 12 % for rats and humans respectively. The CS shows a tropism for cartilagineous tissues in rats and for knee tissues in humans as demonstrated by scintigraphic analysis with 99 mTc-CS. Monomers, oligo and polysaccharides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of CS appear in the blood and tissues together with native CS. The effects of partially depolymerized (m. m. 3 to 15 kD) and desulfated fractions on human leukocytes were investigated. CS and its fractions inhibit the directional chemotaxis induced by zymosan-activated serum, are able to decrease the phagocytosis {{and the release of}} lysozyme induced by zymosan and to protect the plasma membrane from oxygen reactive species. In rats the oral administration of CS significantly decreases granuloma formation due to sponge implants and cell migration and lysosomal enzyme release in carrageenan pleurisy. Compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin ibuprofen), CS appears to be more effective on cellular events of inflammation than on edema formation. It is noteworthy that CS is devoid of dangerous effects on the stomach, platelets and kidneys. In synovial fluid of patients requiring joint aspiration, treated orally for 10 days with CS (800 mg/day) the hyaluronate concentration and the intrinsic viscosity significantly increased, while collagenolytic activity, phospholipase A 2 and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) decreased. These results give an insight into the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective actions demonstrated by this drug in a number of clinical trials in, patients with osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{possibility}} of producing highly porous pellets of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was examined. High porosity is expected to reduce the density of pellets and affect the gastric emptying. Furthermore, {{it is expected to}} improve the loading ability. Initially were examined the effects of MCC type, of wetting liquid and drying method on the micromeritic, mechanical and disintegration properties of MCC pellets. Extrusion/spheronization was applied by using three types of MCC powder (Avicel®, Prosolv® and modified Avicel®) and two wetting liquids (water or water-isopropanol 60 : 40 w/w). Also, highly porous Avicel® pellets were prepared by the incorporation and extraction of pore former (NaCl). All the wet pellets were dried by employing three methods (fluidized bed, microwaves and freeze drying). It was found that the drying method has the greatest effect on the pellet size and porosity followed by the wetting liquid. Combination of water-isopropanol, freeze drying and modified MCC gave the greatest increase in pellet size and porosity. The increase in pellet porosity caused reduction in the resistance to deformation, tensile strength and disintegration time. Since the freeze drying caused the greatest increase on pellet porosity, the effects of initial freezing conditions (before the sublimation) on the pore volume and pore size distribution were evaluated. Freeze drying was applied after initial freezing under three different conditions (- 30, - 80 and - 197 oC). Pellet porosity was found to increase with decreasing initial freezing temperature. The mean pore diameter was greater for the extracted pellets, followed by non extracted pellets made with water and water-isopropanol. Also, the pore diameter was greater for freezing at - 80 o C while it was smaller at - 197 o C. It was also noticed that the size of the pores formed by extraction of pore former is much smaller than that of pore former particles. This may be caused by the presence of “ink-bottle” pores. Therefore, pore shape of pellets was estimated by repeated mercury porosimetry and evaluation of mercury entrapment. From the mercury reintrusion {{it was found that the}} volumes of the second intrusion are considerably lower compared to the volumes of the first intrusion. Freeze-dried non-extracted pellets show lower formation of “ink-bottle” pores than fluidized bed dried pellets. Furthermore, water-isopropanol as wetting liquid results in higher “ink-bottle” percentage than water. The decrease of initial freezing temperature reduces the “ink-bottle” formation only when water is used as the granulating liquid. For the evaluation of drug loading ability as well as the release properties of porous pellets, MCC pellets with small pores or large pores were used. The pellets after loading by immersion in aqueous solution of riboflavin under vacuum and drying were coated with enteric and colonic coatings using methacrylic polymers. The requirements for effective <b>gastroresistant</b> coating and the release before and after coating were also evaluated. It was found that: a) The drug loading ability was higher for the pellets with large pores. b) The drug release from the non coated pellets was immediate, controlled by diffusion and faster for pellets with large pores. c) The required polymer dispersion for the effective gastro-resistance was higher for the case of pellets with large pores and the profile of drug release was delayed and reduced with the increase of the coating applied. ...|$|E
