25|$|In mid-January 2006, Intel {{announced}} that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors. The Pentium name was first {{used to refer to}} the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not <b>just</b> <b>call</b> their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD). They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first, when the new Yonah chips, branded Core Solo and Core Duo, were released. The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released. By 2009, Intel was using a good-better-best strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. <b>Just</b> <b>call</b> Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E
500|$|The aliens seen at {{the start}} of the episode were portrayed by children. Carter wrote {{specifically}} the part of Duane Barry with Steve Railsback in mind, saying [...] "I've resisted casting the marquee names only because it takes you out of the show; makes the show less believable. But there are certain actors who <b>just</b> <b>call</b> out for the part." [...] Originally, Railsback character was named Duane Garry, but it was changed to Duane Barry after learning that a person within the Federal Bureau of Investigation had the same name. Carter has mentioned that he disliked the new name at first, but got used to it over time.|$|E

500|$|In 1943, the Texas League disbanded {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of players during World War II. [...] Oana was sold to the Milwaukee Brewers in February 1943, and he appeared in 20 games for that team. [...] However, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ruled that Oana was a free agent since the Texas League had disbanded. In late June 1943, Oana signed with the Detroit Tigers. In an introductory interview with the Detroit press, Oana {{had this to say}} about his supposed connection to Hawaiian royalty: When I first joined the Seals, stories were published that I was a Hawaiian prince. The more I denied them, the more people believed them. I'm plain plain Henry Oana. <b>Just</b> <b>call</b> me Hank.|$|E
500|$|After {{consulting}} with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery {{responded to the}} Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: [...] "I'm keeping my domain, see you in court." [...] Again {{in an interview with}} ONE News, Stollery reiterated {{that he was going to}} retain rights to [...] "ScienTOMogy", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they <b>just</b> <b>call</b> and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my 'vendetta' with the church." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{pulsating}} rhythm {{is present}} in the song [...] "Isaac", which is regarded as the only song close to a ballad on the album. However, the song was criticised heavily by a group of Israeli rabbis who commented that Madonna was committing a blasphemy with their religion. They said that the song was about sixteenth century Kabbalah scholar Yitzhak Luria. In reality, the song was named after the featured vocalist Yitzhak Sinwani, who sang portions of the Yemenite Hebrew poem Im Nin'alu in the track. Initially Madonna {{toyed with the idea of}} calling the song as [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] since the idea behind the composition was to let go. However, at the end she decided to <b>just</b> <b>call</b> it [...] "Isaac" [...] after the English version of Sinwani's name. Regarding the song's development and the condemnation of the Rabbis, Madonna said: ...|$|E

500|$|The plot for [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] {{originated}} from an idea by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{to have a}} boy try to convince his gay dog not to be homosexual. Michael Smith, a childhood friend of Parker and {{a basis for the}} Ned Gerblansky character, claimed that Big Gay Al was based in part on a real-life resident of Fairplay, Colorado. Smith, a minister at a Fairplay church, said of the resident, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>call</b> him Big Al, but he cross-dresses every year for Fairplay Day. He lives out of town, which is why Big Gay Al's cartoon pet sanctuary is set out in the hills". However, Stone said the name [...] "Big Gay Al" [...] and the idea of his [...] "gay animal sanctuary" [...] came from Pam Brady, a producer and writer with the show.|$|E
500|$|Staff from E! Online seemed {{impressed}} with the video's concept and choice of background scenery. They said [...] "what better place for some introspection than the desert, right? No sexy bikini-clad ladies or blue-haired Nicki Minajs to distract you, and when you're done, <b>just</b> <b>call</b> up the helicopter {{to pick you up}} (Pro tip: Hang your leg outside of the chopper for extra cool points.)". Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said [...] "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's – then Puff Daddy – first solo video, [...] "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down," [...] which featured him and Mase introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert." [...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed with the number of videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can <b>just</b> <b>call</b> up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect Him to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

500|$|While the {{sequence}} featuring Mercedes singing [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] {{was very well}} received, Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch was not happy {{about the state of}} Mercedes and Sam's relationship: [...] "If these two don't get together soon, I'm voting we <b>just</b> <b>call</b> the whole thing off, because I'm tired of these false starts." [...] VanDerWerff, referring to the third member of that romantic triangle, wrote that one of the two [...] "tertiary characters" [...] he responded to most was [...] "Shane, who didn’t say anything but gave good cry-face". VanDerWerff's other character was Karofsky, and Michael Slezak of TVLine characterized his scene with Kurt as [...] "electric, with Kurt tenderly giving the 'just friends' speech to Dave". Lynch thought the plot of having Karofsky be Kurt's secret admirer was [...] "vaguely stalker-ish on Karofsky's part, and contrived {{on the part of the}} show", and Canning accurately predicted that after Karofsky had been seen by his classmate, it would [...] "just be an episode or two before Karofsky gets bullied into thinking about suicide, if not actually taking his own life".|$|E
500|$|With Election Special, Cooder {{wanted to}} write an album with direct lyrics and {{encourage}} urgency in listeners during the US presidential election of 2012. He felt that the election season was [...] "the time of decision in this country... the most critical {{time in the history}} of the country". When asked about concerns over [...] "", Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I thought I should have a record that says, 'This here record is for you during election time.' Rather than be vague and poetic, let's <b>just</b> <b>call</b> this what it is. That way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic about, saying that [...] "There's a sign of something. Those people are having conversations, and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about. Pretty soon, the rest of the world picks up on it, even the politicians." ...|$|E

As Capp was ushered into the Oval Office, his prosthetic leg suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, [...] "Call Walter Reed (Hospital), or maybe Bethesda," [...] to which Capp replied, [...] "Hell no, <b>just</b> <b>call</b> a good local mechanic!"

The movie that was eventually made was simply titled Doctor Who. To distinguish it from the television series, Segal later suggested the alternate title Enemy Within.
