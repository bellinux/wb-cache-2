500|$|The central {{argument}} in the letter is that the British have negated {{the rights of the}} Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts. Wood, the Drapier claims, [...] "hath already tried his Faculty in New-England, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; what That was I leave to the Publick Intelligence."

[...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|E

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> comes back." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly.

500|$|After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, Willkie offered his full support to Roosevelt. Willkie was {{interested}} in the post of war production czar, but that position went to Donald M. Nelson. Labor Secretary Perkins offered to have Willkie arbitrate between management and labor in war industries, but Willkie declined after White House officials informed the press. In early 1942, Willkie considered a run for Governor of New York. He later stated that Roosevelt had been willing to endorse him, but Willkie ultimately concluded that the Dewey forces were too strong and a defeat might eliminate him from a possible run for president in 1944. In July, Willkie proposed to Roosevelt that he go on another foreign mission, and the following month Willkie announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union, China, and the Middle East. [...] Dewey wrote, [...] "I hear he is going to Russia before the Republican [...] convention, so he will be where he belongs and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> stays there until Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E

According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} thing. I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative.

500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes. It’s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week." [...] Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, [...] "Bryan Cranston remains a god among men." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E

[...] Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki expressed hope for openness for a new direction, noting that [...] "if Obama chooses the right path, compensates the past, lifts hostility and U.S.hegemony, and revises the previous political mistakes, we will have no hostility." [...] State-owned Channel One Russia, Russia's flagship early evening news show, covered Obama's presidential inauguration as a minor news story, devoting much of the day's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine. The People's Republic of China covered the Obama inauguration live on its state‑controlled China Central Television, providing simultaneous translation into Mandarin Chinese with a brief delay to allow censoring of Obama's comments. When President Obama mentioned [...] "earlier generations faced down fascism and communism", Chinese state television officials cut away abruptly from the televised speech and switched to a discussion in the studio. State-controlled print, radio and television media in North Korea provided no coverage or mention of the Obama inauguration in the hours after the event, opting instead to cover news about Equatorial Guinea welcoming the North Korean ambassador.|$|E

Its New York production, starring Kathleen Chalfant, Tonya Pinkens, and David Margulies, was prized by the few who came to see it after its negative review by The New York Times. Social critic and writer Susan Sontag wrote of the piece, [...] "Larry Kramer is one of America's most valuable troublemakers. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> never lowers his voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away.

In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people."

2500|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the trial took place were unusual in that, while Lever’s legal team were accommodated at Thornton Manor, Lord Northcliffe, the principal witness for the defence, was overseas and, according to Jolly, “had no intention of returning within range of any writ server while the case was on.” It seems clear, therefore, that Northcliffe {{was in the wrong}} and, moreover, he knew that he would most probably lose the case: he reportedly offered Lever a public apology shortly {{before the start of the}} trial. For the plaintiff, Carson accused Associated Newspapers of conduction a malicious campaign ‘with the object of smashing up Lever Brothers.’ Speaking for more than five hours, he listed a number of complaints and asked the jury to award punitive damages. He then called Lever as his first witness, inviting the leader of the defence team to [...] "cross-examine him to his heart's content, and, when his time comes, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will be able to follow my example and do the same, and call as his first witness his own client, Lord Northcliffe..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sunderland’s {{relations}} with Paul Barillon, whose long tenure as Ambassador from Louis XIV (from 1677 to 1688) produced many memorable exchanges between the twain, were tenuous and strained.

When Barillon protested that his master's aim was [...] "the Peace of Europe" [...] Sunderland said that it was impossible for everyone in Europe to want peace at the same time: [...] "myself I think it will last until {{one side or the other}} has a good reason for breaking it". To prevent Barillon from gaining too much influence, Sunderland intercepted and leaked an unusually indiscreet dispatch where the Ambassador boasted of having blocked an Anglo-Dutch treaty. Charles II was predictably furious, and Barillon was for a time forbidden the Court. [...] Sunderland remarked that if Barillon would behave himself so, it was “but just that it come home to him".|$|E
