40|$|The Perkin Elmer Genetic Screening Processor (GSP) ™ is a fully {{automated}} {{system for the}} processing of immunoassays for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OHP), <b>immuno</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT), biotinidase, and total T 4, as well as enzymatic assays for total galactose and galactose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) from dried blood spots (DBS). The system however, has one drawback: it cannot transfer samples from one microtiter plate to another. While {{this is not a}} problem for immunoassays, it makes enzymatic assays more problematic. The remaining DBS can either cause significant signal quenching, or they can increase fluorescence intensity, when the DBS are floating on the surface. The latter can cause false negative results, when GALT is measured for galactosaemia screening. To overcome this problem, an additional measurement step to check for floating disks is incorporated, leading to prevention of the affected measurements. However, this causes a secondary problem in this totally closed system. We detected floating disk signals in approx. 0. 7 % of all screening samples as well as quality control samples, which had to be repeated. We describe a simple method, which is just a re-measurement on a victor fluorescence reader, or any other plate fluorimeter, with filters for excitation wavelength 340 nm, and emission wavelength 405 nm. The introduction of this second-tier measurement made all repeat measurements unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma evansi is {{the most}} {{extensively}} distributed trypanosome responsible for disease called surra in livestock in many countries including frequent outbreaks in India. The prevalence of this disease is most commonly reported by standard parasitological detection methods (SPDM); however, antibody ELISA is being in practice by locally produced whole cell lysate (WCL) antigens in many countries. In the present investigation, we attempted to identify and purify immuno dominant, infection specific trypanosome antigens from T. evansi proteome using experimentally infected equine serum by immuno blot. Three immuno dominant clusters of proteins i. e. 62 - 66 kDa, 52 - 55 kDa and 41 - 43 kDa were identified based on their consistent reactivity with donkey sequential serum experimentally infected T. evansi up to 280 days post infection (dpi). The protein cluster of 62 - 66 kDa was purified in bulk in native form and comparatively evaluated with whole cell lysate antigen (WCL). ELISA and immuno blot showed that polypeptide of this cluster is 100 % sensitive in detection of early and chronic infection. Further, this protein cluster was also found <b>immuno</b> <b>reactive</b> against hyper immune serum raised against predominantly 66 kDa exo antigen, revealed {{that this is a}} common immunodominant moieties in proteome and secretome of T. evansi...|$|R
40|$|The granule {{exocytosis}} cytotoxicity pathway is {{the major}} molecular mechanism for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity, {{but the question of}} how these cytotoxic lymphocytes avoid self-destruction after secreting perforin has remained unresolved. We show that CTL and NK cells die within a few hours if they are triggered to degranulate in the presence of nontoxic thiol cathepsin protease inhibitors. The potent activity of the impermeant, highly cathepsin B- specific membrane inhibitors CA 074 and NS- 196 strongly implicates extracellular cathepsin B. CTL suicide in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors requires the granule exocytosis cytotoxicity pathway, as it is normal with CTLs from gld mice, but does not occur in CTLs from perforin knockout mice. Flow cytometry shows that CTLs express low to undetectable levels of cathepsin B on their surface before degranulation, with a substantial rapid increase after T cell receptor triggering. Surface cathepsin B eluted from live CTL after degranulation by calcium chelation is the single chain processed form of active cathepsin B. Degranulated CTLs are surface biotinylated by the cathepsin B-specific affinity reagent NS- 196, which exclusively labels <b>immuno</b> <b>reactive</b> cathepsin B. These experiments support a model in which granule-derived surface cathepsin B provides self-protection for degranulating cytotoxic lymphocytes...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the relationships existing between peptide contents of FF and both oocyte-cumulus-corona-complex (OCCC) maturity and the success of IVF. Peptides and steroids were measured by RIA after FF extraction with liquid chromatography and ethyl-ether, respectively. Out of the total of 76 oocytes, 52 were fertilized in vitro and 35 of them underwent normal cleavage and were transferred. Among the three peptides, only i. r. beta-EP levels were higher in FF from follicles which contained oocytes that were subsequently fertilized (127. 6 +/- 16. 2 pmol/L mean +/- SE) than in FF from follicles which contained oocytes that did not subsequently fertilized (62. 9 +/- 8. 4, p less than 0. 04). Independent of subsequent fertilization, i. r. alpha-MSH values in FF were 5 times higher than those of i. r. beta-EP and i. r. gamma-EP. In the presence of a morphologically mature oocyte, FF i. r. gamma-EP levels (165. 2 +/- 45. 3 pmol/L) were higher than in FF from follicles yielding immature (63. 6 +/- 13. 5, p less than 0. 01) or luteinized (32. 7 +/- 9. 2, p less than 0. 01) oocytes. Steroid levels in FF did not change in relation to oocyte maturity or subsequent oocyte fertilization. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the primary}} {{structure}} of protein inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes and α-amylase were undertaken. The complete amino acid sequence of an α-amylase inhibitor and a bifunctional trypsin/α - amylase inhibitor from seeds of ragi (Eleusine coracana Gaertn.) and of the proteinase inhibitor PI-I from the Tracy cultivar of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr) were determined. The bifunctional trypsin/ α-amylase inhibitor from ragi seeds was {{shown to be a}} single polypeptide of 122 amino acids with a molecular weight of 13400. The two <b>reactive</b> (<b>trypsin</b> inhibitory) sites were also determined. Sequence comparisons revealed that this inhibitor seems to be divergently related to other trypsin and α-amylase inhibitors and also to the reserve protein from castor bean. In addition it is proposed that a new inhibitor family should be added to the existing ones (Laskowski and Kato, 1980) to accomodate this bifunctional inhibitor and its related proteins. The secondary structure of this inhibitor was also predicted. The α-amylase inhibitor from ragi seeds was shown to be a single polypeptide of 95 amino acids with a molecular weight of 9300. The existence of two homologous regions in the amino acid sequence of this inhibitor seemed, to indicate that the inhibitor molecule has arisen by a process of gene duplication. Sequence comparisons revealed that this inhibitor has no homology to any other α-amylase inhibitors, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors or any other plant protein of known primary structure. In addition the secondary structure of the α-amylase inhibitor from ragi seeds was also predicted. The amino acid sequence of the proteinase inhibitor PI-I from the Tracy cultivar of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr) was shown to be identical to another proteinase inhibitor PI-II) from the same cultivar, which have been previously sequenced by Kashlan(1980) ...|$|R

The protein, termed Cl, is a chymotrypsin inhibitor {{and is one of}} five homologous proteinase inhibitors that are proteolytically cleaved from a 40. 3 -kDa precursor protein. The other four proteinase inhibitors (Tl to T 4) contain <b>reactive</b> sites for <b>trypsin.</b> The three-dimensional structure of Cl is generally well defined and contains a triple stranded P-sheet as the dominant secondary structural feature. Several turns and a short region of 3 (10) helix are also present. The putative chmotrypsin reactive site is present on an exposed loop which is less defined {{than the rest of the}} protein. The overall shape of Cl is disc-like and the N and C termini are exposed, supporting the proposal that this protein results from post-translational processing of the 40. 3 -kDa precursor protein...|$|R
40|$|The indole {{side chain}} of {{tryptophan}} residues absorbs strongly near 280 mµ. It is relatively reactive but is often {{protected from the}} solvent and reagents contained in the solvent by being buried {{in the interior of}} proteins along with other hydrophobic side chains. The lability of tryptophan to conditions normally used for acid hydrolysis of proteins has, in the past, made its quantitative determination relatively difficult. Treatment with N-bromosuccinimide (see Section 8 - 9) or 2 -hydroxy- 5 -nitrobenzyl bromide (see Section 6 - 6) is recommended to effect is selective modification in proteins. Treatment with N-bromosuccinimide is usually done in acetate or formate buffers (pH 3 to 4), but values closer to neutrality can also frequently be used. Higher pH has an advantage in that little or no peptide bond cleavage takes place. Also higher pH is usually more selective, apparently differentiating between more and less reactive tryptophan residues (Spande et al., 1966). Reaction is uaually relatively specific for tryptophan in the absence of sulfhydryl groups which are even more <b>reactive.</b> Oxidation of <b>trypsin</b> by N-bromosuccinimide was studied from pH 3 to 7 at 25 °C in 0. 1 M acetate or phosphate (pH 7) buffers.

40|$|Clearance {{rates in}} the guinea pig were {{determined}} for intact guinea pig and human C 1 inhibitor, the complexes of both inhibitors with human C 1 s, β factor XIIa and kallikrein, and for each inhibitor cleaved at its <b>reactive</b> centre with <b>trypsin.</b> Intact human and guinea pig C 1 inhibitor were cleared from the circulation more slowly (t½s of 9. 7 h and 12. 1 h and fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) of 0. 09 and 0. 117) than any of their cleaved or complexed forms. The reactive centre-cleaved inhibitors were cleared with half-lives of 6. 75 h for humans and 10. 1 h for the guinea pig. The complexes with target proteases were catabolized much more rapidly, with half-lives ranging from 3. 08 h to 4. 3 h. The complexes with kallikrein were cleared more slowly than those with C 1 s and β factor XIIa. Complexes prepared with the guinea pig and human inhibitors were cleared at equivalent rates. The free inactivated proteases were cleared at rates similar to the equivalent complexes, except for kallikrein, which was cleared more rapidly than its complex. The fact that the complexes with different target proteases differed in their catabolism and that protease and complex catabolism were similar suggests that protease may play a direct role in clearance...|$|R
40|$|Peanut {{inhibitor}} B-in {{was found}} to form two types of complexes with trypsin, T,I and TT, by gel filtration HPLC. Two cleaved peptide bonds, Arg(10) -Arg(ll) and Arg(38) -Ser(39), in the trypsin modified inhibitor (TM-B-HIy) (/. Biochem. 93, 479 — 485 (1983)) were resynthesized by the complex formation with 2 mol of trypsin. These {{results suggest that the}} two peptide bonds may be the <b>reactive</b> sites for <b>trypsin.</b> TM-B-mjjg inhibited bovine trypsin as well as native B-III but had little chymotryp-sin inhibitory activity. The two peptide bonds, Arg(10) -Arg(ll) and Arg(38) -Ser(39), in B-Hl were cleaved partly by prolonged incubation with a catalytic amount of chymotrypsin. But gel filtration HPLC of the chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex showed the forma-tion of only CI complex. Incubation of TM-B-III^ | with an equimolar amount of chymotrypsin resulted in the resynthesis of only the Arg(10) -Arg(ll) bond. These findings suggest that Arg(10) -Arg(ll) may be a true reactive site for chymotrypsin. An inhibition mechanism of B-III against trypsin and chymotrypsin was proposed from the results obtained by the present studies. Five Bowman-Birk type (BBI-type) inhibitors (A- similar inhibitory properties which were unique I, A-II, B-I, B-II, and B-III) were isolated from compared with those of other BBI-type inhibitors peanut seeds (7) and their amino acid sequences (7).

40|$|Human alpha 2 -antiplasmin (alpha 2 -AP) has {{previously}} been shown to possess overlapping inhibitory sites for trypsin and chymotrypsin [Potempa, Shieh and Travis (1988) Science 241, 699 - 700]. Since this is currently unique among active-site-directed inhibitors of proteinases, and difficult to explain in terms of accepted inhibitory mechanisms, we re-examined the claim. Initial characterization of purified alpha 2 -AP revealed an additional 12 residues preceding the published N-terminus, prompting us to revise the previous numbering. We found that trypsin caused cleavage of the Arg 376 -Met 377 bond in the reactive-site loop of the inhibitor, whereas chymotrypsin caused cleavage at two sites in approx. equal amounts at 37 degrees C: Met 374 -Ser 375 (site 1) and Met 377 -Ser 378 (site 2). At 0 degrees C alpha 2 -AP became a more efficient inhibitor of chymotrypsin, {{and the proportion of}} cleavage at site 1 declined, indicating that chymotrypsin prefers to react with site 2 at 0 degrees C. Inhibitors of the alpha 2 -AP type are inactivated when cleaved in their reactive-site loops by proteinases that they do not inhibit, so we conclude that site 1 is treated as a substrate by chymotrypsin. Site 2 is the inhibitory site for chymotrypsin. We confirm that alpha 2 -AP does indeed have overlapping <b>reactive</b> sites for <b>trypsin</b> and chymotrypsin, and since the locations of chymotrypsin-interaction sites vary with temperature, we suggest that alpha 2 -AP cannot have rigid reactive-site geometry. More likely, it has a mobile reactive-site loop of the type that has been recently demonstrated for eglin C...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) has {{turn out}} to be a fundamental technology which has produced tremendous strides in the biological sciences. In the last three decades, MS has witnessed convincing growth. Mass spectrometry has rapidly evolved to the forefront of analytical techniques; its ability to analyze proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and carbohydrate biomolecules has been a major driving force in the field of proteomics, genomics and glycomics. The level of performance that is achievable with MS today allows scientists to study various biomolecules in ways that were inconceivable 25 years ago. In this thesis, two different kinds of biomolecules will be covered: oligonucleotides and carbohydrate-protein neoglycoconjugates. [...] First of all, the differentiation and sequencing of three constitutional isobaric 18 -mer DNA oligomers, namely: GATTC A TAG CTACGAATC 1, A ATTCG TAG CTACGAATC 2, and A ATTCG TAC CTACGAAT G 3 were investigated using electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry with a hybrid QqTOF-MS/MS instrument. Our main objective was to differentiate and to sequence these oligonucleotides. The hypothesis was that the single scan ESI-QqTOF-MS analyses of the DNA oligomers will afford the same series of deprotonated molecular ions and that low-energy collision tandem mass spectrometric analyses (CID-MS/MS) will allow us to differentiate and to sequence the three DNA oligomers using the Mongo Oligo Software. Another objective was also to establish a mass fingerprint of these three oligonucleotides. This will aid to characterize the structure of covalently linked carcinogens to these three isobaric oligonucleotides. [...] The second part of the thesis, which includes several chapters, is concerned with the use of MS for the localization of the glycation sites of neoglycoconjugate vaccine models formed by the covalent attachment of specific immunogenic carbohydrates obtained from different virulent bacteria to the protein carrier bovine serum albumin (BSA). This can be accomplished using a methodology based on squaric acid chemistry which was developed to conjugate carbohydrate antigens to lysine residues in proteins. Three different examples of hapten-BSA glycoconjugate vaccines were used: the Vibrio cholerae O 1 antigenic specific hapten conjugated to the BSA, the tetrasaccharide side chain of the Bacillus anthracis exosporium conjugated to the BSA, and finally the model β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 4) -β- D-glucopyranoside (β-lactoside) conjugated to the protein carrier BSA. Initially, the recording of the MALDI-TOF-MS of the different hapten-BSA glycoconjugate vaccines allowed us to determine the hapten-to-BSA ratios. The neoglycoconjugates were then digested and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS and LC-ESI-QqTOF-MS/MS for the determination of the glycation sites. Our hypothesis was that the trypsin digestion will not allow a complete digestion of the protein, since the glycated lysines are not <b>reactive</b> with <b>trypsin.</b> Thus we had to use another protease, the GluC V 8 which is known to digest proteins at the C-terminus of the aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues. We also suspected that the LC-ESI-QqTOF-MS/MS analysis was going to afford the identification of a higher number of glycation sites than the MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS analyses. ...|$|R
40|$|NA-proPI is a 40. 3 -kDa multidomain {{precursor}} protein {{found in the}} stigma of the ornamental tobacco Nicotiana alata, It is selectively targeted to the vacuole and, as the plant matures, is processed to produce a series of five 6 -kDa proteinase inhibitors (one chymotrypsin and four <b>trypsin</b> <b>reactive</b> sites) which are thought to {{play a vital role}} in plant protection against insect pests. A putative sixth domain with a chymotrypsin reactive site is likely to be formed by three disulfide bridges linking the N- and C-terminal fragments of NA-proPI, This domain contains two distinct structural elements: a 54 -residue sequence with high identity to each of the five repeated PI domains, and a nonrepeated 25 -residue sequence at the C-terminus which is proposed to contain a vacuolar targeting peptide. The structure of the putative sixth domain was predicted using a combination of secondary structure prediction and homology modeling based on the known structure of one of the intact domains. A 26 -residue peptide corresponding to the nonrepeated C-terminal sequence and encompassing the putative vacuolar targeting sequence was synthesized and its structure determined using H- 1 NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations, The peptide was found to adopt an amphipathic helical structure. The calculations based on NOE data suggested that the helix is curved, with a hydrophobic concave face and a hydrophilic convex face. This curvature is consistent with an observed periodicity in backbone NH chemical shifts. The structure of the entire sixth domain was modeled by combining the experimentally determined structure of the putative vacuolar targeting peptide with the homology model of the PI domain. In this model the alpha-helix of the putative targeting peptide protrudes from the otherwise compact PI domain. This observation is consistent with the requirement for targeting sequences to be relatively exposed for recognition by the sorting apparatus. As there is no consensus on the structure of vacuolar targeting sequences, this study provides a valuable insight into their potential mechanism of interaction with the cellular sorting apparatus...|$|R
