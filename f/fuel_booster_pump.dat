5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the <b>fuel</b> <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
25|$|The Sea Fury was {{powered by}} the newly {{developed}} Bristol Centaurus piston engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and <b>fuel</b> <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems, a pneumatic pump was also driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored {{in a total of}} five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage {{directly in front of the}} cockpit and three housed within the wings.|$|E
25|$|During the war years, the C-46 {{was noted}} for an {{abnormal}} number of unexplained airborne explosions (31 between May 1943 and May 1945) that were initially attributed to various causes. In particular, the fuel system, which was quickly designed, then modified for the new, thirstier Pratt & Whitney engines, was criticized. The {{cause of the}} explosions was eventually traced to pooled gasoline from small leaks in the tanks and fuel system, combined with a spark, usually originating from open-contact electrical components. Though many service aircraft suffered small fuel leaks in use, the C-46's wings were unvented; if a leak occurred, the gasoline had nowhere to drain, but rather pooled at the wing root. Any spark or fire could set off an explosion. After the war, all C-46 aircraft received a wing vent modification to vent pooled gasoline, and an explosion-proof <b>fuel</b> <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> was installed with shielded electrical selector switches {{in lieu of the}} open-contact type used originally.|$|E
25|$|A crash {{investigation}} revealed {{water in}} the <b>fuel</b> tank <b>booster</b> <b>pump.</b> Because water is more dense than fuel it can settle {{to the bottom of}} the tank, into the pump inlets; when it freezes it blocks inlets and deprives the engine of fuel. This deprivation of fuel caused the Munich C-131 to lose power and eventually shut down the engine.|$|R

The engine successfully completed the Flight Acceptance Hot Test in 2008, and was integrated with propellant tanks, third-stage structures and associated feed lines {{for the first}} launch. The first flight attempt took place in April 2010 during the GSLV Mk.II D3/GSAT-3 mission. The engine ignited, but the ignition did not sustain as the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Booster</b> Turbo <b>Pump</b> (FBTP) shut down after reaching a speed of about 34,500 rpm 480 milliseconds after ignition, due to the FBTP being starved of Liquid Hydrogen (LH2). On 27th March 2013 the engine was successfully tested under vacuum conditions. The engine performed as expected and was qualified to power the third stage of the GSLV Mk-2 rocket. On 5 January 2014 the cryogenic engine performed successfully and launched the GSAT-14 satellite in the GSLV-D5/GSAT-14 mission.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action in valvular heart disease and to dissect <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> from reservoir-conduit functions. In five patients with aortic stenosis and six with mitral stenosis, sequential atrioventricular (A-V) pacing was instituted during the course of diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Continuous recording of valvular gradient allowed estimation of flow for each cardiac cycle by transposition of the Gorlin formula. Left ventricular ejection time and left ventricular stroke work in aortic stenosis or left ventricular mean systolic pressure in mitral stenosis were also determined. Control observations were recorded during sequential A-V pacing with well-timed atrial systole. Cardiac cycles were then produced with no atrial contraction but undisturbed atrial reservoir function by intermittently interrupting the atrial pacing stimulus during sequential A-V pacing. This intervention significantly reduced valvular gradient, flow, left ventricular ejection time, and left ventricular mean systolic pressure or stroke work. Cardiac cycles were then produced with atrial booster action eliminated by instituting synchronous A-V pacing. The resultant simultaneous contraction of the atrium and ventricle not only eliminated effective atrial systole but also placed atrial systole during the normal period of atrial reservoir function. This also significantly reduced all the hemodynamic measurements. However, comparison of the magnitude of change from these two different pacing interventions showed no greater impairment of hemodynamic state when both <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action and reservoir function were impaired than when <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action alone was impaired. The study confirms the potential benefit of well placed atrial <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> action in valvular heart disease in man...|$|R

40|$|A {{project was}} carried out in {{conjunction}} with an Australian dredging company and served the purpose of increasing their operational efficiency through advanced monitoring and control. A system consisting of wireless communications, PLCs, HMIs and SCADA was implemented to provide the dredge operator and management staff remote monitoring and control of the operation. The pre-existing dredging arrangement relied on frequent visits to the land-based engine-driven <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> to tune the engine speed for optimal pipeline flow. These visits were carried out by land-based staff, {{at the request of the}} offshore dredge operator who monitors the flow via a magnetic flowmeter. The dredge operator needed to control the <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> remotely to save time and resources. For improved project supervision, it was also envisaged that management should have access to daily shift reports and live monitoring from the office. Electrical systems were implemented at the dredge and <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> to accommodate wireless and wired industrial networks. The new arrangement allows the dredge operator to monitor and control operations via a HMI display mounted in the dredge cabin. From the cabin, the dredge operator can view data from both engines and process instrumentation such as pipeline flow. The <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> also contains a HMI display from which it can be independently monitored and controlled. A SCADA system was installed on the dredge to generate daily reports and provide management with live access to operations from the office. The new system was a complete success increasing production efficiency and improving operations management. Eliminating visits to the <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> and improved supervision of equipment significantly reduces dredging downtime. Access to daily reporting and live operations allows management to supervise operations without travelling to site resulting in cost and time savings. This project not only provides a solution to a gap in the dredging market, it provides a knowledge-base for future students or engineers to continue development of diesel engine monitoring and control using commercially available components...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} started within the Texas Utilities Generating Company Power station feedwater pump systems due to unsatisfactory unit availability, frequent equipment breakdown, high maintenance costs, and high replacement parts costs. This action was greatly encouraged by successful corrective {{actions taken by}} other utilities [1, 2, 3], results of failure surveys across the U. S. A [4, 5), and systematic long range research and development, field testing and troubleshooting by the authors, and close cooperation and exchange of ideas and results with at least on oil company [6].

This included 16 boiler feed pumps (BFP), 7 high pressure (HP) <b>booster</b> <b>pumps,</b> 6 low pressure (LP) <b>booster</b> <b>pumps,</b> and 7 other pump applications.
