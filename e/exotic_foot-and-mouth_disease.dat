40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that the quasispecies nature (extreme genetic heterogeneity) of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus is relevant to the virus evading an immune response. A monoclonal antibody neutralizing the viral infectivity (clone SD 6) recognizes an epitope located around a highly conserved sequence (amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Leu-Ala at positions 141 - 145) in the capsid protein VP 1 of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus of serotype C 1.
