60|$|While she {{ascended the}} first flight of stairs, Mrs. Thorpe's ears {{informed}} her that her son was firing off one uninterrupted volley of kicks against {{the door of his}} place of confinement. As this was by no means an unusual circumstance, whenever the boy happened to be locked up for bad behavior, she felt distressed, but not at all surprised at what she heard; and went into the drawing-room, on her way up stairs, to deposit her Bible and Prayerbook (kept in a morocco case, with gold clasps) on the little side-table, upon which they were always placed during week-days. Possibly, she was so much agitated that her hand trembled; possibly, she was in too great a hurry; possibly, the household imp who rules the brittle destinies of <b>domestic</b> <b>glass</b> and china, had marked her out as his destroying angel for that day; but however it was, in placing the morocco case on the table, she knocked down and broke an ornament standing near it--a little ivory model of a church steeple in the florid style, enshrined in a glass case. Picking up the fragments, and mourning over the catastrophe, occupied some little time, more than she was aware of, before she at last left the drawing-room, to proceed {{on her way to the}} upper regions.|$|E

50|$|Until the 12th century, {{stained glass}} - glass to which {{metallic}} or other impurities {{had been added}} for coloring - was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for Romanesque art and especially Gothic art. Almost all survivals are in church buildings, {{but it was also}} used in grand secular buildings. The 11th century saw the emergence in Germany of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century Venice. The Crown glass process was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the glassblower would spin approximately 9 pounds (4 kg) of molten glass {{at the end of a}} rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. <b>Domestic</b> <b>glass</b> vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as Forest glass.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{assessing}} {{the impacts of}} different approaches to IPPC implementation on competitiveness of companies in two industrial sectors (electric steelmaking and <b>domestic</b> <b>glass</b> production). As {{the provisions of the}} IPPC Directive allow a certain flexibility for Member States to set permit conditions and to apply the concept of Best Available Techniques (BAT), the implementation of the IPPC Directive is likely to differ across the EU.

Therefore, while differences in implementation of the IPPC Directive across the EU might be justified due to specific circumstances, this may result in distortion of competition and an influence on the competitiveness of certain production sites and industry sectors within and across Member States. There may also be competitiveness impacts relative to non-EU competitors...|$|E

25|$|Glass {{was used}} {{extensively}} during the Middle Ages. Anglo-Saxon glass {{has been found}} across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period {{was used in the}} manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, windows, beads, and was also used in jewelry. From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis. By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203–1248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th-century. With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent. The use of <b>domestic</b> stained <b>glass</b> increased until most substantial houses had glass windows. These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets. This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} was to map the {{innovation}} potential of selected commodities produced by the glass industry. Those selected are <b>domestic</b> <b>glass</b> (beverage glasses, kitchenware, decorative glass, artistic glass, etc.) and jewelry.

The identified characteristic of these commodities was an insufficiently innovative approach throughout the business process of the companies. The intention of the authors, {{based on their own}} assessment of the innovation potential of the mentioned commodities, is to propose a procedure for the companies' possible involvement in innovative projects within the activities of the RCO (Regional Contact Organisation) Liberec. The present study was conducted from January 2001 to April 2012. First, an analysis of selected economic indicators was carried out for individual commodities produced by the glass industry of the Czech Republic. According to the results, commodities were selected for the evaluation of their innovation potential. The survey was preceded by a summary of the CSO survey for the period 2008 – 2010, focused on the innovative activity of firms (by sector) of the Czech Republic. To evaluate the innovative activities for selected glass commodities in the Czech Republic, according to industrial classification, the following sectors were selected: the manufacture of glass CZ-NACE 231 and jewelry CZ-NACE 321 (source of input data – Czech Statistical Office). Valuable information was obtained about the type of innovation and how it was funded. The authors’ survey of the innovation potential of glass companies engaged in manufacturing <b>domestic</b> <b>glass</b> and jewelry was focused on companies in the Liberec Region municipalities with a high concentration of these businesses. 84 questionnaires were distributed, and 30 completed questionnaires were evaluated.

Therefore, a smaller number of companies were chosen to be offered cooperation with RCO Liberec, namely companies in which at least a moderate potential for innovation had been identified...|$|E
