5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's <b>initial</b> <b>program,</b> and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The Mississippi State University XV-11A Marvel was an {{experimental}} American STOL research aircraft of the 1960s. The MARVEL (Mississippi Aerophysics Research Vehicle with Extended Latitude) was a single-engined pusher monoplane {{fitted with a}} boundary layer control system. The first all-composite aircraft, it carried out its <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> of research {{on behalf of the}} US Army in the late 1960s, and was rebuilt in the 1980s as a proof-of-concept for a utility aircraft.|$|E

The original 421-a program also required that rents in buildings receiving the tax abatement be at least 15% less than the rents of comparable units nearby. 421-a housing units were also subject to all local rent stabilization laws that were passed for a period of ten years or however long the rent stabilization laws lasted, whichever period was shorter.|$|E

The <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> {{was intended to}} be a one-time special event, and featured Williams's medley of Oscar-winning film scores first performed at the previous year's Academy Awards. Its unprecedented popularity led to two concerts in 2006: fundraising gala events featuring personal recollections by film directors Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Continuing demand fueled three more concerts in 2007, which all sold out. These featured a tribute to the musicals of film director Stanley Donen, and had the distinction of serving as the New York Philharmonic season's opening event. After a three-season absence, Williams conducted the Philharmonic once again in October 2011.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to the induction of recursive structures from examples {{which is based on}} the notion of recursive program schemes. We separate induction from examples in two stages: (1) constructing <b>initial</b> <b>programs</b> from examples and (2) folding <b>initial</b> <b>programs</b> to recursive program schemes. By this separation, the induction of recursive program schemes can be reduced to a pattern-matching problem which can be handled by a generic algorithm. Construction of <b>initial</b> <b>programs</b> is performed with {{an approach to}} universal planning. "Background knowledge" is given in the form of operators and their conditions of application. Furthermore synthesizing recursive program schemes instead of programs in a predefined programming language enables us to combine program synthesis and analogical reasoning. A recursive program scheme represents the class of structural identical programs and can be assigned different semantics by interpretation. We believe that our appr [...] ...|$|R

After the telemetry station closed in 1974, the airport was taken over by Kings Bay. Svalbard Airport, Longyear, opened in 1975, allowing better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport and took over the flights to Ny-Ålesund.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Figure 1, for instance, a first step would be {{to decide on the}} piece sizes to be used (in this case all the same), and the shape of the desired target. An <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> would then be able to {{generate}} a list L corresponding to every possible tiling of this target shape by 3 distinct decominoes (polyominoes of size 10). Each decomino is represented by a unique integer, so that L will consist of a list of integer triads. A subsequent routine can then run through and test every combination of three different triads in turn. The test will consist in treating the candidate triads as the row entries in a 3×3 square, and then checking to see whether the columns and diagonals thus formed each contain 3 integers that are also in L—which is to say, are also target-tiling triads. If so, a 3×3 geomagic square using 9 decominoes and selected target has been identified. If this fails, alternative target shapes can be tried. An elaborated version of the same method can be used to search for larger squares, or for squares including differently-sized pieces.|$|E
500|$|On June 9, 2006, {{officials}} announced {{their intention to}} reopen the Jerusalem Center for the Fall 2006 semester. [...] However, escalating violence in the area from the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict frustrated these plans and raised new concerns about students' safety in the area. [...] School officials deemed the center would remain closed until the conflict was resolved. [...] During this time, some LDS members in Northern Israel were [...] "voluntarily relocated" [...] into the center, away from border missile strikes. [...] BYU {{officials announced}} on October 9, 2006 that the center would be reopening for student academic programs for Winter Semester 2007. The <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> was limited to only 44 students. [...] The center remains open into future academic terms.|$|E

2500|$|The show {{featured}} {{a panel of}} four celebrities who questioned the contestants. On the <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> of February 2, 1950, the panel was former New Jersey governor Harold Hoffman, columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, poet Louis Untermeyer, and psychiatrist Richard Hoffmann. [...] The panel varied somewhat in the following weeks, but {{after the first few}} broadcasts, during the show's earliest period the panel generally consisted of Kilgallen, actress Arlene Francis, Untermeyer and comedy writer Hal Block. [...] At various times, a regular panelist might take a vacation or be absent from an episode to due outside commitments; on these occasions, a guest panelist would take their spot. The most frequent guest panelist was Arlene Francis's husband Martin Gabel, who appeared 112 times over the years.|$|E

[...] In July 1968 he and Walter Reuther, {{president}} of the United Auto Workers formed a new national trade union center, the Alliance for Labor Action, to organize unorganized workers and pursue leftist political and social projects. Fitzsimmons and Reuther offered the AFL-CIO a no-raid pact {{as a first step}} toward building a working relationship between the competing trade union centers, but the offer was rejected. [...] The Alliance's <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> was ambitious, but Reuther's death in a plane crash on May 9, 1970, near Black Lake, Michigan, dealt a serious blow to the Alliance. The group collapsed in January 1972 after the Auto Workers were unable to continue to fund its operations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{soldiers}} of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males aged between 16 and 28. The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861. In early 1862, the Confederate Army was allowed to disintegrate for two months following expiration of short-term enlistments. A majority of those in uniform would not re-enlist following their one-year commitment, so on April 16, 1862, the Confederate Congress enacted the first mass conscription on the North American continent. (The U.S. Congress followed a year later on March 3, 1863, with the Enrollment Act.) Rather than a universal draft, the <b>initial</b> <b>program</b> was a selective service with physical, religious, professional and industrial exemptions. These were narrowed as the war progressed. Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed. In September 1862 the age limit was increased from 35 to 45 and by February 1864, all men under 18 and over 45 were conscripted to form a reserve for state defense inside state borders. By March 1864, the Superintendent of Conscription reported that all across the Confederacy, every officer in constituted authority, man and woman, [...] "engaged in opposing the enrolling officer in the execution of his duties". Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.|$|E
