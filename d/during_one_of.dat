5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este.

40|$|The {{rise and}} fall <b>during</b> <b>one</b> cycle <b>of</b> sewing operation, in the {{equilibrium}} needle temperature was discussed. At a constant sewing velocity, the higher the needle temperature was, the bigger the amount of {{rise and fall}} <b>during</b> <b>one</b> cycle in an equilibrium needle temperature was. As the sewing velocity rose, the needle temperature increased, but the amount of rise and fall <b>during</b> <b>one</b> cycle <b>of</b> sewing operation in the equilibrium needle temperature decreased. The reason was that the fall time decreased with high sewing velocity, and before the needle is cooled enough, the next sewing operation cycle began. In this experiment, {{it is estimated that}} at a sewing velocity above about 500 rpm, the rise and fall <b>during</b> <b>one</b> cycle <b>of</b> sewing operation in the equilibrium needle temperature is not observed...|$|R

5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.|$|E

5|$|During certain {{situations}} the player {{will be put}} in a perilous situation, where they will be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E
