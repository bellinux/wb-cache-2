The definitive version is available at: [URL] the continuing development of Rapid Prototyping technologies, there has been a move into areas of Rapid Tooling. This takes advantage of the shorter lead times and lower costs associated with the production of tooling, particularly for injection moulding. This paper analyses the effectiveness of using direct metal laser sintering to produce <b>injection-moulding</b> <b>tools,</b> in terms of the force required to eject a part from a tool. Different levels of finishing were applied to test tools, and the results show that in some cases the forces required to eject parts from direct metal laser sintered tools were comparable with those from machined tools...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} work, {{attempts have been}} made to design, develop and evaluate the performance of mould inserts for injection moulding by using a powdersintering process. Maraging steel powder, sintering aid and binder are materials used in this proposed development process. Attempts have been made to perform in-depth studies and to apply the powder-sintering process, to eventually produce the final sintered components. In addition, an analysis of the dimensional accuracy of the respective stereolithography master models and an analysis of the sintered specimens during various stages of powder-sintering process have been carried out. The intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) test part with minor modifications has been used in the evaluation of dimensional accuracy, tolerances, distortion and volumetric variations. The main reason for using this unique geometry is the suitability of its design for <b>injection-moulding</b> processes and <b>tooling...</b>|$|R
