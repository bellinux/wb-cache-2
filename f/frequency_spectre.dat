40|$|AbstractVibrational {{behaviour}} {{of fluid}} power systems {{is a very}} important aspect regarding lifetime of the components and especially noise problems within hydraulic circuits. Vibration emitting and noise generating elements of primary evidence especially in hydraulic systems are pumps. In completed hydraulic circuits it is often seen that even vibration and noise-optimised pumps show noise problems due to the inter-activeness of all system components built in. Noise problems can be investigated with several vibration and noise measurement methods, which are mostly based on the analysis of the noise relevant <b>frequency</b> <b>spectre</b> of the vibration emitting source and the evaluation of frequencies which are of maximum influence. A precise analysis of the phenomena gives the basis to eliminate {{one or more of the}} dominant noise frequencies with the help of hydraulic silencers...|$|E

The work {{is aimed at}} studying the dependence of the response reactions thresholds on {{the frequency of the}} sinusoidal current of the nonelectric fishes on the different stages of the ontogenesis. For the first time, the age dynamics of sensitivity and fishes resistance to the electric field has been traced in detailes. The <b>frequency</b> <b>spectres</b> of the fishes electroperception have been investigated; its variations in the process of the ontogenesis have been detected. The obtained data of the response reactions thresholds can be used for standartization of the tolerable electromagnetic effects on the reservoirs, for the evaluation of the fishes physiological state and its behaviour control.

40|$|Music {{and beat}} {{perception}} are strongly connected to movement, a {{phenomenon known as}} sensorimotor synchronisation. Neurophysiologically, simple metronome-like beat sounds entrain neural oscillations, so that the brain oscillates with the same frequency as the beat frequency. The usefulness of being entrained to a beat lies in the increased accuracy of predicting crucial future events (e. g. the next beat). However, in our everyday environment beats rarely occur without being embedded in rhythmical and metrical structures (e. g. music). The present work seeks to examine how more complex rhythmical sounds are creating temporal expectancies and how multiple explicit metrical structures are represented in the brain. Electroencephalogram recordings were obtained while participants listened to beat-sounds varying in metrical complexity (low vs. high) and tempo (fast vs. slow). Their task was to synchronise finger movements to the lowest metrical level beat. We found that high metrical complexity facilitates synchronisation to slower beats. Looking at the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectres</b> of the obtained EEG data, entrained oscillations not only emerged at the lowest metrical level beat frequencies that occurred in every experimental condition, but also at higher metrical level beat frequencies in the high complexity conditions. Being entrained to multiple metrical structures could provide additional temporal information {{which can be used}} to improve synchronisation performance. Taken together, results highlight the dynamic, proactive and predictive character of brain functions...|$|R

40|$|Silicon Germanium (Si 1 -xGex) is {{considered}} the choice for analog/mixed-signal RF and optoelectronic systems due to its high speed, low noise and compatibility with standard CMOS processes. The goal of this thesis is to investigate photo-detection in SiGe and optical receiver circuits in the commercially available IBM 5 HP SiGe BiCMOS process. The study of photodetectors based on SiGe is of interest because of its high absorption capability at wavelengths between 1. 1 - 1. 5 um. In this thesis several designs of receiver circuits and front-end transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) were designed and fabricated in the IBM 5 HP (0. 5 µm) SiGe technology exhibiting high transit (fT) and maximum oscillation <b>frequency</b> (fMAX). <b>Spectre</b> simulations for both the transimpedance amplifiers and the complete receiver circuits are conducted at the single supply voltage of 3. 3 V in the Cadence Analog Affirma design environment. The analog mixed signal design tools NeoCircuit/NeoCell from Neolinear Inc. and Analog Affirma from Cadence Inc. are used for the optimization of the complete receiver circuits consisting of a transimpedance amplifier, a cascaded multi-stage differential amplifier and a decision circuit...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simulation-before-test (SBT) fault {{diagnosis}} methodology {{based on the}} use of afault dictionary approach. This technique allows the detection and localization of the most likely defects ofopen-circuit type occurring in Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (CMOS) analog integratedcircuits (ICs) interconnects. The fault dictionary is built by simulating the most likely defects causing thefaults to be detected at the layout level. Then, for each injected fault, the <b>spectre’s</b> <b>frequency</b> responses andthe power consumption obtained by simulation are stored in a table which constitutes the fault dictionary. In fact, each line in the fault dictionary constitutes a fault signature used to identify and locate aconsidered defect. When testing, the circuit under test is excited with the same stimulus, and the responsesobtained are compared to the stored ones. To prove the efficiency of the proposed technique, a full customCMOS operational amplifier is implemented in 0. 25 μm technology and the most likely faults of opencircuittype are deliberately injected and simulated at the layout level...|$|R

The purpose of the work: to receive apicture full enough of the genotoxic influence of the formaldehyde with its inhalation effect in the concentrations, near to MPC in the air of the working zone, and to compare the frequency of the cytogenetic disturbances, arising in vitro and in vivo, depending on the stgae of the cellular cycle. A significant cytostatic effect of the formaldehyde in the experiment on the man's peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, confirmed on the same system of cells in vivo, has been revealed. The increase of the chromosome aberrations frequency has also been revealed. The identity in <b>frequency</b> and the <b>spectre</b> of the chromosome damage has been shown at the comparison of the cytogenetic activity of the formaldehyde in vitro and in vivo. The profitability of use of the micronuclear test of the people, contacting with formaldehyde, has been shown. The importance of the protein ration in the regulation of the mutagenous activity of the formaldehyde of the animals with the acute effect has been revealed. For the first time, it has been shown, that the inhalation effect of the formaldehyde on the females brings to the cytopathetic effect on {{the early stages of the}} embryos fractioning.

40|$|The seismic forward {{modeling}} is {{a useful}} tool to predict the seismic response from a knowngeological model. A seismic forward modeling process contains two main steps, a modelbuilding step and a seismic forward realization part. The geological model may be builtfrom scratch or an interpretation of some real seismic might {{be used as an}} input to theforward seismic realization algorithm. In this work both the steps in a seismic forward modeling process are done. The firststep is to build the geological model, which is based on an outcrop study from Storvola. Storvola is located alongside Van Keulenfjorden in the Central Basin on Svalbard. Thesediments are from late Paleocene and Eocene time and are deposited from west to east. The Deltaic section exposed at Storvola has been buried and undergone high pressure,deformation and faulting. The {{purpose of this study was}} to reverse this deformation byflattening the model so it represents a newly deposited delta. An outcrop study has been performed by Johansen et al. (2007) in this area, where theexposed layers have been mapped and the properties have been measured. The mappedgeology was digitized by using the software Petrel. The model building was based onthe digitized data which the property models could be built out of. The three propertymodels were the P-velocity, S-velocity and density. These properties were exported to theECLIPSE file format which again was converted to the RSF format. The second step in the seismic forward modeling process is the seismic realization. The open source software Madagascar is used to simulate a seismic survey, which predictsthe responses from the subsurface by solving the center finite difference discretization ofthe elastodynamic equations. These equations use the property models as input. As asource a Ricker wavelet with a maximum <b>spectre</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100 Hz was used. The resulting synthetic seismic gets re-sampled to reduce the amount of data and tospeed up the processing, but carefully to not remove important data. Unwanted signalsare removed or muted from the re-sampled data like the direct arrival. Common midpointgathers are generated to simplify the generation of pictures of the subsurface before thedata becomes migrated. The migration algorithm used is the 2 -D prestack Kirchhoff timemigration, which moves the reflectors to their correct position. The migrated data is interpreted and compared to the original geological model. Almostall the thick layers with a high velocity contrast could be recognized, but some visualization problems were detected in areas with many thin layers. </p...|$|R
