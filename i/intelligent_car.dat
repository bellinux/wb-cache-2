2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an <b>intelligent</b> <b>car</b> built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E

40|$|Recently, many {{companies}} have been studying <b>intelligent</b> <b>cars,</b> and improvements in sensor technology and computing are required. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>cars</b> use GPS {{to know where they}} are. The cars use sensors to detect objects in all directions, including people, vehicles and animals. Based on what the sensors detect, the software processes the information to help the cars predict what all the objects around the cars might do. Based on the prediction, the cars choose a safe speed and trajectory for themselves. Therefore, the current research on <b>intelligent</b> <b>cars</b> is mainly focused on collision avoidance because of safety. Every year, there are over two million traffic-related deaths worldwide. This number could be dramatically reduced, especially since 94 % of accidents in the U. S. involve human error. In this work, we show the design, development, and testing of an autonomous ground vehicle for testing energy-efficient of Q-learning in robotics. The vehicle platform is based on the Boe-Bot chassis, which is an education shield for Arduino. The Boe-Bot is a common research testbed that encourages the use of low-cost hardware and open-source software. The research platform uses Raspberry pi 2 Model B as its on-board computer for handling Q-Table collision avoidance like processing sensor data and computing deciding actions. The robot is then tested by using a modified Q-Learning algorithm to avoid collisions. We design hardware-friendly software, and the robot can use the same Q-Table as the software. The robot runs in several maps to find relationships between reward function and time and energy consumption. One target of this work is to find a relationship between reward function and time and energy consumption. This study will help us to understand feasibility of saving time and energy for <b>intelligent</b> <b>cars.</b> The aim of this master?s thesis is to investigate energy-efficient Q-learning collision avoidance in robotics. Unlike, the existing research, we consider saving energy for collision avoidance.

40|$|Abstract — Recognition of driver’s {{intention}} from elec-troencephalogram (EEG) can {{be helpful}} in developing an in-car brain computer interface (BCI) systems for <b>intelligent</b> <b>cars.</b> This could be beneficial in enhancing the quality of interaction between the driver and the car to provide the response of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>cars</b> in line with driver’s intention.

An experimental protocol is designed for recording EEG from 6 subjects while driving the virtual reality driving simulator. The experimental protocol is a variant of the contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with Go and No-go conditions in driving framework. The results presented in this study support the presence of the slow cortical anticipatory potentials in EEG grand averages and also confirm the discriminability of these potentials in offline single trial classification with the average of 0. 76 ± 0. 12 in area under the curve (AUC).

A well-established and widely known 'intelligent' device would be the anti-lock braking system ABS, which prevents the wheels from locking while braking and thus enables the driver keeping the car under control. An example for a more recent system would be the electronic brake assistance which helps the driver brake effectively, or even brakes the car on its own if a collision is imminent and there is no driver reaction at all.|$|E

The fastest car to complete the track without derailing wins the competition. According to the sensors used, teams were divided into three categories: Optical Group, Electro-magnetic Group and Camera Balance Group. Teams from the Optical Group were required to identify the track by processing analog data obtained from linear CCD's, while those from the Camera Balance Group relied on image processing through a camera with an extra requirement - standing up and racing with only two wheels. Finally, teams from the Electro-Magnetic Group used wireless sensors to detect the location of a signal wire located underneath the racetrack.|$|E
