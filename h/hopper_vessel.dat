40|$|Physical model {{disposal}} {{tests at}} a 1 : 50 scale {{have been conducted}} to provide guidance on numerical model developments and to provide data sets for numerical model verification. These tests have been conducted with a model split-hull barge and a multibin <b>hopper</b> <b>vessel.</b> Both stationary and moving disposals have been monitored. Results imply that the bulk behavior of the disposal material in both the descent and bottom surge phases can be approximately scaled to the prototype. Visual observations have resulted in modifications to an existing numerical model such that the disposal is represented {{by a series of}} downward convecting clouds from which material can be stripped...|$|E
40|$|Teignmouth {{is a small}} {{coastal town}} {{situated}} {{on the north side}} of the Teign Estuary, located in south Devon, UK. The estuary itself contains a busy commercial port, a renowned local fishing fleet and an extremely popular area for watersport users. Following a year of economic downturn, negative impacts have been felt throughout the port. Tonnage activity for the previous year was 525, 000 tonnes compared with the 631, 000 tonnes in 2008, with both exports and imports showing reductions. Revenue from harbour activities dropped to £ 417, 000 from £ 445, 000 the previous year due to the fall off in tonnage. The potential dredging of the inner part of the estuary would create greater space to manoeuvre for larger commercial ships and more room for moorings increasing the productivity of the harbour. This study focuses upon the feasibility of dredging the area known as ‘the salty’ and aims to outline the potential effects both physically and economically. Sediment samples were taken from the area in order to identify local characteristics. By performing particle size analysis, and using the combined data of that from the Coast 3 D project, a sediment transport model was utilised in order to select a suitable disposal site. The area was identified as highly depositional and sediment was dominantly coarse sand and gravel, caused by the propagation of high tidal velocities in excess of 1. 5 m/s. A disposal site approximately 1 km offshore at Teignmouth using a large dredging <b>hopper</b> <b>vessel</b> is the proposed method. With such a highly dynamic area, a system essentially of a closed nature, erosion is not thought to be a post dredge issue, but instead focus should be made upon the rate of deposition after the initial work. This project outlines a number of positive aspects but further collection of data and analysis is required in order to quantify the occurrence of maintenance dredging, and to be able to deem this project economically feasible.

50|$|Daunian pottery {{was mainly}} {{produced}} in the regional production centers of Ordona and Canosa di Puglia, beginning around 700 BC. The early paintings on the pottery show the vessels with geometric patterns. The ceramics were hand-formed, rather than thrown on a potter's wheel. They consisted of red, brown or black earth color applied with the decor. Diamonds, triangles, circles, crosses, squares, arcs, swastika {{and other forms of}} art were painted on them. The development of Daunian pottery forms is independent of the first Greek ceramics. Typical Daunian pottery include the Askos, <b>hopper</b> <b>vessels</b> and bowls with loop handles. Striking are often manual, or anthropomorphic Protomen to the sides and handles of the ceramics attached to or reproduced graphically.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Extraction of marine {{aggregates}} in UK waters can exceed 20 million tonnes each year, with dredging activity {{taking place at}} any given point in time within the licensed areas. There is concern that the noise generated during the extraction of this aggregate {{has the potential to}} negatively impact marine species in or around the dredging area. For aggregate extraction, the type of vessel used is a trailing suction hopper dredger, which lowers a drag head and suction pipe to the sea floor to extract the sand or gravel, depositing it in a <b>hopper</b> on the <b>vessel,</b> whilst returning unwanted material and water {{over the side of the}} vessel. The potential sound sources during this type of dredging activity are numerous and this paper considers some initial results of a series of systematic noise measurements performed in shallow UK coastal waters of a large dredging vessel, under different operating configurations. The measurements are performed in such a way as to allow propagation loss and the source level to be estimated. The provisional results are compared to background noise measurements performed in the area in the absence of the dredging operations and will ultimately be used to assess the impact of the radiated noise on marine life...|$|R
40|$|The total marine {{aggregate}} {{extracted from the}} seabed in UK waters can exceed 20 million tonnes each year, {{and there is a}} need to understand the noise generated during the extraction process in order to evaluate any potential impact on the marine environment.

There are a number of potential noise generation mechanisms during this type of dredging activity. This paper presents the results of underwater noise measurements for six different dredgers measured in three locations around the UK, with aggregate type varying from sand to coarse gravel. One vessel was measured in two different areas with different aggregate types. The methodology used to derive the source level for the dredgers is described, and the results of an investigation into the origin of the radiated noise are given. Measurements were made at frequencies up to 100 kHz. Noise levels are shown for the same dredger under different operational modes, illustrating that the noise output is partially dependent upon the mode of operation and the aggregate type being extracted...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} the Engineering profession, and {{especially}} the structural field of that profession, has been {{very interested in the}} application of welding to the fabrication of structures. Arc welding has come more and more into use as time has passed, and as confidence in its results increased. Even now, however, large factors of safety are employed due to certain unknown conditions which arise in arc welding. The first of these unknowns is the personal element, the fact that no two welders using the same materials and equipment will obtain exactly the same results. The importance of this factor has greatly decreased with the development of proper welding rod for various types of weld, and with the increased availability of expert welders. The second unknown is the magnitude and importance of stresses developed in the parent metal by welding, due to local heating and to shrinkage on cooling. These stresses are what is known as residual or locked-up stresses, and while they may be practically eliminated in small articles by heat treating, larger articles may be too heavy to support their own weight under sufficient heat treating to reduce the stresses, and of course, such structures as buildings, large <b>hoppers</b> and pressure <b>vessels</b> are too large to be heat treated at all. [ [...] . ] The present work is the first attempt at McGill to evaluate stresses in three directions, that is, longitudinally, transversely, and through the thickness of the plate. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology [© Springer]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] of 2009, there were 75 licensed areas within UK waters for marine aggregate extraction, with dredging activity taking place at any given point in time. In 2008, the dredged area totaled 137. 9 km 2, extracting 21. 24 million tons of sand and gravel for the building and construction industry. There is concern that the extraction of marine aggregate has the potential to generate noise levels that could {{have a negative impact on}} marine species in or around the dredging area. Although this paper deals only with the underwater noise generated and the potential impact it might have, there are many ways in which dredging can have an impact on marine life. For marine aggregate extraction, the type of dredger used is a trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD). This type of dredger lowers a drag head and suction pipe to the sea floor, in water depths of up to 50 m, to extract the sand or gravel, depositing it in a <b>hopper</b> on the <b>vessel.</b> The vessel will often screen the dredged material for granular size and return the unwanted material and water over the side of the vessel. Such an operation can take from as little as 3 h to up to 12 h, concentrated in a relatively small area. The vessels usually dredge in tight lanes, usually less than 2 km in length and up to 100 m in width...|$|R
