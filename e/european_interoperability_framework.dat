40|$|International audienceWithin the Aerospace and Defense industry, {{enterprises}} {{are facing}} a growing complexity of digitalbusiness ecosystem {{that is to be}} implied in new products development. Competitiveness requires notonly delivering the product, but also delivering the best associated services for operation, maintenanceand support. In parallel, the products and their environments are more and more complex, requiringsystematic usage of digital means in order to model and to simulate the product, within multi-disciplinesteams distributed in several companies all along the lifecycle of the product. In addition, achievingcontinuous interoperability of enterprise applications supporting the collaborative processes within anevolutionary environment is an important challenge. This paper will present a federative <b>interoperability</b> <b>framework</b> for technical enterprise applications,and more particularly its usage in combination with Dynamic Network Management within theframework of the IMAGINE <b>European</b> project.

40|$|The recent {{publication}} of the <b>European</b> and Spanish <b>interoperability</b> <b>frameworks</b> implies that public organizations should start a change management process in order to adapt their technologies and procedures to the new standard {{as a way to}} guarantee information interoperability across e-government services. The main justification for this research is to disseminate the interoperability standards among Spanish public organizations and to provide methodological and technical guidelines to facilitate the adaptation process, and to foster the usage of new techniques and procedures for information integration and management. The aim of the research consists of identifying the essential aspects to take into consideration to guarantee the information and knowledge interoperability in e-government services. In this context good practices in information interoperability are taken into account and three basic approaches are identified: (1) Information and knowledge management: mark-up languages, open software and formats, and electronic document processing; (2) Metadata for knowledge representation in electronic resources; and (3) Web accessibility to improve access for all. ...|$|R

50|$|Many {{organizations}} {{are dedicated to}} interoperability. All have in common {{that they want to}} push the development of the World Wide Web towards the semantic web. Some concentrate on eGovernment, eBusiness or data exchange in general. Internationally, Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium facilitates global interoperability across borders, language and technical barriers. In Europe, for instance, the European Commission and its IDABC programme issue the <b>European</b> <b>Interoperability</b> <b>Framework.</b> IDABC was succeeded by the ISA programme. They also initiated the Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe (SEMIC.EU). A European Land Information Service (EULIS) was established in 2006, as a consortium of European National Land Registers. The aim of the service is to establish a single portal through which customers are provided with access to information about individual properties, about land and property registration services, and about the associated legal environment. In the United States, the government's CORE.gov service provides a collaboration environment for component development, sharing, registration, and reuse and related to this is the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) work and component repository. The National Institute of Standards and Technology serves as an agency for measurement standards.|$|E

In order to establish cooperation on a Pan European level, interoperability has to be provided on local and national levels. In this case we use principles defined in the <b>European</b> <b>Interoperability</b> <b>framework</b> as objectives, which provide further improvements for forming user-centric e-government services on local and national level. The article presents the experience of Riga city creating interoperability solutions between different municipal and governmental structures. On the basis of accumulated experience conclusions are made about the possible applicability of the recommendations of the <b>European</b> <b>Interoperability</b> <b>framework.</b> Also, prognosis of the most credible system development scenarios and problems are made. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Interoperability {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major issue to be addressed by every e-government agency. An <b>interoperability</b> <b>framework</b> aims to provide the basic standards that every department which is relevant for the e-government strategy implementation should adopt. Criteria for selection and inclusion of standards in an <b>interoperability</b> <b>framework</b> are crucial, since they influence the utility that the framework delivers to the e-government agencies. This paper identifies and compares the policies of the main e-government agencies in the definition of these criteria and it checks the policies against the practice that they exhibit in the actual <b>interoperability</b> <b>frameworks.</b> ...|$|R

The main objective of the project is oriented to diffuse the information interoperability standards in public organizations and to foster the usage of new techniques and procedures for information integration and management. The method used to carry out the research consists of three main phases: the analysis of information interoperability related technologies, the design of a model to evaluate information interoperability in public web sites, and the empirical analysis of key factors affecting information interoperability. The project main result is an electronic tutorial to facilitate the information and knowledge evaluation process in public organizations and to plan the conversion from non-interoperable technologies and formats to interoperable ones...|$|E
