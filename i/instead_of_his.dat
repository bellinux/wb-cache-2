5|$|First edition printings {{had several}} errors, which were fixed in {{subsequent}} reprints. Initially Dumbledore said that Voldemort {{was the last}} remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> descendant.

5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} {{of his own}} in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick {{to draw attention to}} Smith's outstanding defensive play <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind. Yogesh sees {{all of the}} girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says {{there is no need for}} Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{made his}} debut for the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League (NRL) in 2004 and played every game that season, winning the Dally M Rookie of the Year award. Pimarily a fullback, {{he played for}} Brisbane until 2009 and {{was part of the}} Broncos team which won the Grand Final in 2006. In a {{controversial}} move, Hunt chose to play for Australia <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> native New Zealand, citing a lifelong dream of playing for Queensland in the State of Origin. Hunt's performance in the 2006 NRL season resulted in his selection for Queensland and Australia (the Kangaroos) in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011, it was {{reported}} that Vijay and AR Murugadoss would collaborate to make an action film, after completing their then-respective ongoing projects, Velayudham and 7aum Arivu. Vijay's father S. A. Chandrasekhar was initially going to produce the film, but S. Thanu eventually took over, producing it under his banner V Creations. Although the film was initially titled Maalai Nerathu Mazhaithuli, in December 2011, the new title was revealed: Thuppakki. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> regular editor Anthony and art director Rajeevan, Murugadoss chose A. Sreekar Prasad and Thotta Tharani for those positions, respectively. Santosh Sivan was hired as cinematographer.|$|E

Shortly afterward, Jimsy goes to Mahesh's {{house with the}} magazine containing her photo. Although she rebukes him for photographing her without permission, she also praises the photo. They become interested in each other, and soon fall in love. Jimsy realises this first, and calls Mahesh {{to talk about their}} future. She tells him that she is Jimson's younger sister, but his agitation is overshadowed by love and he decides to continue their relationship.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the first story ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945. Vandersteen though was disappointed to see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> suggestion Suske en Wiske, and also felt that Rikki too closely resembled Tintin.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2004, Cotto faced Kelson Pinto from Brazil, for {{the vacant}} World Boxing Organization junior welterweight title. This {{represented}} the third fight between them, with Pinto being victorious in their two previous encounters, {{both of which}} took place {{while they were still}} amateurs. The fight was televised by HBO from San Juan, Puerto Rico. During this card Cotto utilized a defensive stance with his hands in a high position <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> usual aggressive orthodox stance. Over the course of the fight Cotto scored three knockdowns and won the World Boxing Organization Junior Welterweight Championship by knockout in the sixth round.|$|E
5|$|VOC forces {{landed on}} 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya {{did not expect}} an attack on this flank, and {{consequently}} it was only lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting desultory negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works forward until their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the VOC troops were limited to brackish water, and diseases soon spread.|$|E
5|$|After al-Adil I {{seized the}} throne in Cairo {{and with it}} the sultanate of the Ayyubid oligarchy, the period of rivalry between Damascus and Cairo to become capital of the Ayyubid empire commenced. Under al-Adil and al-Kamil, Damascus {{continued}} as an autonomous province whose ruler reserved the right to designate his own heir, but during as-Salih Ayyub's rule, military campaigns against Syria reduced Damascus to a vassal of Cairo. In addition, Ayyub established new rules both in administration and government in order to centralize his regime; he conferred the most prominent positions of the state to his close confidants, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Ayyubid relatives. His wife Shajar al-Durr, for example, managed the affairs of Egypt while he was in Syria. Ayyub officially delegated his authority to his dead son Khalil and made al-Durr act formally on Khalil's behalf.|$|E

5|$|During the summer, he {{experimented with}} various {{different}} racquets {{and played the}} German Open with a blacked-out 98-inch Wilson racquet, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> regular Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX racquet with the smaller 90-inch hitting area. He returned to his regular racquet {{for the second half}} of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, and indicated it was a mistake to have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1335, {{the delegates}} of John of Bohemia {{and the new}} King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into {{negotiations}} in Trencsén {{to put an end}} to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles's mediation, a compromise was reached on 24August: John of Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia's suzerainty in Silesia. On 3September, Charles signed an alliance with John of Bohemia in Visegrád, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles's invitation, John of Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November. During the Congress of Visegrád, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencsén. CasimirIII also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to John of Bohemia, but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.|$|E
5|$|In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Abra makes a cameo as {{the stolen}} Pokémon of the Pokémon Fan Club President. Later when Red frees the Pokémon kidnapped by Lt.

After Red's {{aptitude}} test to be the Gym Leader of Viridian City, a swarm of wild Pokémon suddenly appear outside the Gym after being attracted by Pokémon March music, {{one of which is}} an Alakazam. Blue captures all of them with his Scizor. Alakazam is seen again as part of Blue's team for the Gym Leader faceoff, and again as one of the Pokémon in Viridian Gym. It defeated Yellow's Pikachu easily using a combination of Role Play and ThunderPunch. Green is seen to have an Abra, using its Teleport move to transport Silver away to a safer location.|$|E

5|$|Kearsley's {{version was}} a marked popular success. Over {{the next few}} years, the {{publishing}} house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed {{into the body of}} stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
5|$|Smythe's {{first home}} was 51 McMillan Street, {{now known as}} Mutual Street, {{not far from the}} future site of Maple Leaf Gardens. He was the second of two {{children}} born to Mary and Albert. Conn had a sister, Mary, five years older, who died due to illness in 1903. The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe's youth, the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe's wages at the time. At one point, Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Mary and Polly stayed on North Street. Conn's mother Mary died in 1906, and Smythe attributes his mother's drinking with making him a lifelong abstainer from alcohol. At age eleven Conn was christened {{and that was the first}} time that he insisted on Conn <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> given name of Constantine. Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter Moira.|$|E
