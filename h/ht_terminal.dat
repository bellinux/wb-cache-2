40|$|The serotonergic (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 -HT) {{dysfunction}} {{found in}} depression may affect not only brain function (mood) but also cerebrovascular control. Similar, but possibly occult, disturbances {{may also be}} induced by 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity (MDMA, or "ecstasy"). Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) is widely used to identify vulnerability to depression, and we hypothesized that repeated MDMA administration would increase the sensitivity of rats to this acute serotonergic challenge. In this study, male Wistar rats were injected with MDMA (20 mg kg(- 1), twice daily for 4 days) and challenged 3 weeks later with ATD, induced by intragastric administration of a nutritional mixture with tryptophan (TRP) removed. Cerebral metabolism (CMRG) and blood flow (CBF) were measured in parallel groups of animals following ATD by using quantitative [(14) C] 2 -deoxyglucose and [(14) C]iodoantipyrine autoradiographic techniques, respectively. A significant reduction in paroxetine binding to 5 -HT transporter sites in MDMA-treated rats indicated 5 <b>HT</b> <b>terminal</b> depletion, whereas the plasma TRP/sum large neutral amino acids ratio was reduced by 40 % following ATD. Under all experimental conditions, the normal close correlation between CBF and metabolic demand was maintained. However, a global analysis of all brain regions revealed {{a significant decrease in}} the overall ratio of CBF to CMRG after ATD in control animals, whereas a higher ratio was observed after ATD in the MDMA-treated group. This increase in blood flow relative to cerebral metabolism suggests an ATD-induced loss of cerebrovascular tone in MDMA-treated animals that could have pathophysiological consequences and might conceivably contribute to the behavioral dysfunction of depression...|$|E
40|$|The {{substituted}} amphetamine 3, 4 -methylenedioxymetham-phetamine (MDMA) {{has been}} shown to be neurotoxic to sero-tonin (5 <b>HT)</b> <b>terminals</b> in the rat, and rat body temperature (TEMP) {{has been shown}} to affect this neurotoxicity. This study looked at the effect on CORE TEMP of three drugs that protect against MDMA neurotoxicity in the rat. Male Holtzmann rats were injected with a control saline (SAL) injection or with ket-anserin (KET; 6 mg/kg), a-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT; 75 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (FLUOX; 1 0 mg/kg) before a 40 -mg/kg MDMA or SAL injection. CORE TEMP was recorded throughout the study using a noninvasive pentoneally implanted temperature probe. Rats pretreated with KET had no change in CORE TEMP until MDMA was injected, at which time an immediate hypothermia was seen that continued for 1 80 minutes, with a peak low o...|$|R
40|$|Recognition {{sites for}} [3 H]imipramine and [3 H]mianserin {{are located in}} {{different}} structures and regulate different neuronal functions. Recognition sites for [3 H]imipramine are located on serotonergic terminals, {{are part of the}} supramolecular organization of the uptake mechanisms and can be down-regulated by prolonged administration of the drug. When the number of recognition sites for imipramine is down-regulated, uptake of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) in rat brain hippocampal slices is increased. The presence of the binding sites for imipramine in 5 <b>HT</b> <b>terminals</b> is essential to mediate the down-regulation of recognition sites for norepinephrine (NE) and NE-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Mianserin binds on a site that is modulated by 5 HT, the number of its binding sites is not down-regulated by repeated treatment and, like imipramine, decreases the NE-dependent cyclase but not the number of beta-adrenergic receptor recognition sites. Repeated treatment with imipramine and mianserin down-regulated the number of 5 HT 2 recognition sites. Several lines of evidence indicate that binding site for mianserin is related but not identical to the 5 HT 2 receptor binding site...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. (+_) - 3 - 4 -Methylenedioxy{{amphetamine}} (MDA), an amphetamine analogue with hallucinogenic activity, produced selective long-lasting {{reductions in}} the level of rat brain serotonin (5 HT), the number of 5 HT uptake sites and the concentration of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (SHIAA). Morphological studies suggested that these neurochemical deficits were due to 5 <b>HT</b> nerve <b>terminal</b> degeneration. These results show that MDA possesses brain 5 HT neurotoxic activity and raise the question of I whether exposure to MDA and related hallucinogenic amphetamines can produce brain 5 HT neurotoxicity in humans...|$|R
40|$|In rats {{receiving}} (-) -deprenyl (1 mumol/kg, s. c.) {{twice daily}} for 3 weeks, the Bmax of imipramine binding sites located in crude synaptic membranes prepared from frontal cortex increases while the NE stimulation of cAMP accumulation in minces prepared from frontal cortex is attenuated. The presence of intact 5 <b>HT</b> axon <b>terminals</b> {{is an absolute}} requirement for the down-regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor function by repeated injections of (-) -deprenyl.

40|$|During brain development, {{serotonin}} (5 HT) provides essential neurotrophic signals, and {{in earlier}} work, {{we found that}} developmental exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF) elicits short-term changes in 5 HT systems. In the present study, we evaluated the effects in adulthood after CPF exposures from the neural tube stage [gestational days (GD) 9 – 12] and the late gestational period (GD 17 – 20) through postnatal neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis [postnatal days (PN) 1 – 4 and 11 – 14], using treatments below the threshold for systemic toxicity. With exposure on GD 9 – 12, CPF elicited global elevations in 5 HT 1 A and 5 HT 2 receptors and in the 5 HT presynaptic transporter. The GD 17 – 20 treatment elicited larger effects that displayed selectivity for regions with 5 <b>HT</b> nerve <b>terminals</b> and that were preferential for males. Although similar receptor up-regulation was seen after PN 1 – 4 exposure, the effects were larger in regions with 5 HT cell bodies; in addition, the presynaptic transporter was down-regulated in the nerve terminal zones of females. The PN 11 – 14 exposure had much smaller effects on receptors but still elicited transporter suppression with the same regional and sex selectivity. Although CPF exposure on GD 17 – 20, PN 1 – 4, or PN 11 – 14 altered the ability of 5 HT to modulate adenylyl cyclase, this change did not correspond with the effects on 5 HT receptors, suggesting an additional set of effects on proteins that transduce the 5 HT signal.

However, to address the implementation-specific requirements of MU-MIMO WLANs, such as fairness in client access and throughput of the network, we propose a fairness and a throughput-aware ZF precoding in our design at the physical layer (PHY). This precoding scheme not only solves the HT problem but also meets the fairness and the throughput requirements of MU-MIMO WLANs. Besides, we design a MAC layer protocol, supportive to PHY, which decides transmission opportunities (TXOPs) among access points (APs) based on the available degrees of freedom (DoF). We make a mandatory provision in our design that APs should have a sufficient DoF. This can ensure collision-free transmission whenever APs/transmitters transmit in the HT scenario. Additionally, we design an improved channel sounding process for MU-MIMO WLANs with a less signaling overhead than IEEE 802.11 ac.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Based on {{plenty of}} sensors on {{smartphones}} and tablets, their location information becomes more accurate {{and easy to}} access. Many position-based applications have thus been developed. As these mobile devices have become the main access approach of 802. 11 -based wireless local area networks (WLAN), location information also provides opportunities to improve the performance of underlying wireless communication. This paper presents CO-MAP (Co-Occurrence MAP), which leverages loca-tion information to handle exposed and hidden terminal prob-lems, which are still {{a major cause of}} throughput degradation in mobile WLANs. With the positions of nodes, CO-MAP rapidly builds a co-occurrence map showing which two links can occur concurrently. Meanwhile, to avoid potential collisions, it selects the best settings of frame transmissions based on a novel an-alytic network model when hidden terminals are distinguished. CO-MAP improves the goodputs of both downlinks and uplinks in an instant and distributed manner. Our implementation on a hardware testbed demonstrates that CO-MAP can accurately de-tect potential interferers, and provide significant gain of goodput for both exposed and hidden terminal scenarios. The simulation results also suggest that imperfect position hints can still bring substantial improvement on the multiple access efficiency.

30|$|Although several MAC designs {{have been}} {{proposed}} for WLANs using IBFD, they do not consider all possible types of IBFD transmissions. In addition, some were proposed for distributed wireless networks or ad hoc networks, where all the clients were treated as FDNs [12, 13]. An FD multi-channel MAC (FD-MMAC) was proposed to mitigate multi-channel hidden <b>terminal</b> (<b>HT)</b> problems, which targeted for eliminating controlling signals [12]. During data transmission between two nodes, the receiver transmits a beacon packet back-to-back until the data transmission is complete. This beacon packet does not contain any user data. Hence, in terms of user data communications, the FD capability is not fully utilized in FD-MMAC. In addition, TNFD communication is not possible because PR always needs to transmit beacon packets while receiving data from PT. Another MAC protocol was proposed by [13] for IBFD ad-hoc networks, where all the clients were considered as FDNs. The inter-user interference is not considered during TNFD communications, and thus, TNFD communications will be affected greatly by inter-user interference problems. The MAC design proposed by [14] {{can be used in}} both ad hoc and infrastructure-based WLANs. In this design, all the nodes are considered to be FD capable. Moreover, in the case of source-based TNFD transmissions, collisions will occur if more than two clients select the same sub-carrier and AP also selects that sub-carrier. Furthermore, this MAC does not include a procedure to allow the network allocation vector (NAV) to update the timing in different nodes.|$|R
40|$|Performance of CSMA/CA (carrier sense {{multiple}} access/collision avoidance) wireless ad hoc {{network is}} severely affected by hidden <b>terminal</b> (<b>HT)</b> problem {{that results in}} the failure of carrier sense and causes the packet error due to collision. This thesis proposes a method of improving the performance of multi-hop ad hoc network by 4 steps which can be summarized as follows. First, the thesis analyzes HT effect on CSMA/CA unicast communication taking into account actual radio environments including both fading and capture effect. Based on the analysis results, it is predicted that multi-hop transmission is vulnerable to HT problem because of intra-flow interference (IFI). Regarding to this issue, as the second step, a CINR (carrier to interference and noise ratio) -based analysis method is proposed that can precisely estimate the packet delivery probability for CSMA/CA multi-hop transmission suffering from HT-caused IFI under fading environment. The results prove that conventional CSMA/CA media access control cannot achieve efficient multi-hop transmission. Therefore, as the third step, this thesis further proposes IFI-canceling multi-hop transmission (IFIC-MHT) scheme that enables efficient relaying with the highest traffic load for half-duplex multi-hop networks. The interference cancellation (IC) technique employs adaptive signal processing with a normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm for channel estimation and has good BER (bit error rate) and PER (packet error rate) performance under {{a wide range of}} SNR (signal to noise ratio) and SIR (signal to interference ratio) conditions. A multi-hop packet transmission frame format dedicated to the IFIC is designed. Finally, this thesis studies the effect of IFIC on large-scale ad hoc network where both intra-flow interference and inter-flow interference take place and together affect the multi-hop transmission. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
30|$|Today {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLANs) are very popular, and {{this trend is}} growing in an ubiquitous fashion. The penetration of WLANs is recorded as almost more than 70 % in household and business enterprises and about 30 % in public sectors such as transport, leisure, events, and streets, ([URL] Meanwhile, the growing use of multimedia services with heterogeneous hardware such as iPhones, laptops, HDTV, tablets, and the dependency of enterprises on WLANs for mission-critical networks have made WLANs dynamic in topologies, complex in irregular traffic patterns, and challenging from an architectural view point. Measurements from production LANs [1] show that collisions of frames in WLANs are bound to happen, where transmission loss due to interference among 50 % of sender receiver pairs suffer a 2.5 % probability of transmission loss. While IEEE 802.11 carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with ready to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) has become a de-facto mechanism to avoid collisions, there exist inherent limitations as to how it treats interference at the receiver related to the carrier sensing at the transmitter. However, {{the fact is that}} successful transmissions mostly depend on an interference-free condition at the receiver. Theoretical and experimental work on CSMA/CA [2, 3] show that the CSMA/CA mechanism degrades performance due to poor spatial reuse. Besides, it also fails to address the hidden <b>terminal</b> (<b>HT)</b> problem [4] and capture effect [5] issues. Nonetheless, HT nodes (that do not sense each other’s transmission though they interfere with each other at the intended receiver causing decoding failure) are an inevitable phenomenon in WLANs and their impact on network throughput cannot be overlooked. The study in [6] reveals that HTs lead to about 40 – 42 % of collision loss.|$|R

We demonstrate the feasibility of our PHY in a USRP 2 /GNU Radio testbed prototype in the lab settings. It is found that our PHY improves the SNR and effective SNR of the received signal from about 5 to 11 dB in the HT scenario. The performance of our MAC design is checked with simulation studies in a typical six-antenna AP and clients scenario. We observe that our MAC protocol has a slightly higher signaling overhead than traditional ready to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) due to design constraints; however, the signaling time overheads are reduced by 98. 67 μs compared to IEEE 802. 11 ac. Another interesting aspect to highlight is the constant Throughput gain of four to five times that of the traditional RTS/CTS. Our MAC protocol obtains this gain as early as 98. 67 μs compared to IEEE 802. 11 ac. 25 page(s...|$|R
