The band played their first gig in 1990 at a club called the Spray. In 1992, the band {{released}} an 8-song EP called [...] "Into Everything" [...] and moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Three {{and a half years}} later in 1995, Grundig broke up and Ward moved back to Jacksonville, where he, McCandless, <b>Kelly</b> <b>Hayes,</b> and Pat Lally formed the band Diablo. Diablo would only last about 3 months. At the end of that three-month period, Grundig reformed under the name Cold and signed a 6-album record deal with A&M Records. Ward would remain in Cold until February 2006 when, after several line-up changes and battles with record labels, the band decided to break up. Scooter Ward and McCandless promptly began working on their new project The Witch, which McCandless has since left. The project has been renamed twice, When November Falls and now The Killer and the Star. The debut album was released in July 2009. In early 2009, Cold reformed for a reunion tour.

40|$|In February 2011, Architect Barbie® was {{launched}} in New York, her appearance endorsed by the American Institute of Architects and advised upon by architectural historian Despina Stratigakos and architect <b>Kelly</b> <b>Hayes</b> McAlonie. The Institute also ran a Barbie Dream House competition for its architect members. Both Architect Barbie and the Dream House winning entry feature pink used in rather non-architectural but absolutely Barbie ways. Dolls have always been used as part of fantasy play for children and there are multiple stories that might be fabricated for Barbie’s architectural career. If, as Judith Butler argues in Undoing Gender, “Fantasy {{is part of the}} articulation of the possible, it moves us beyond what is merely actual and present into a realm of possibility,” what becomes possible when Architect Barbie exists? This paper seeks to investigate responses mainly from the profession to Architect Barbie® to question whether the fabulations created by the doll might effect change for women in architecture. Stratigakos argues strongly for Barbie’s relevance and importance as an agent for change. However, each online publication announcing her architect incarnation has generated lines of comments and arguments which suggest other possibilities. Drawing on Butler’s work on fantasy, this paper asks whether Architect Barbie might fulfil “the critical promise of fantasy… to challenge the contingent limits of what will and will not be called reality. ...|$|R

40|$|Infants born very prematurely have {{a greatly}} {{increased}} risk of suffering permanent neurologic sequelae such as cerebral palsy (CP), {{a leading cause of}} physical disability in childhood (Doyle, Crowther, Middleton, Marrett, and Rouse, 2010; Stanley and Crowther, 2008). The risk of developing CP increases exponentially as gestational age at birth decreases (Ancel, Livinec, Larroque, et al., 2006). Observational studies conducted during the 1980 s and 1990 s found pre-term infants exposed in utero to magnesium sulfate (MgSo 4) had decreased incidence of CP (Cahill, Stout, and Caughey, 2010). This paper compares data from several randomized trials as well as meta-analyses to determine whether a relationship exists between antenatal MgSo 4 exposure and decreased incidence of CP. Defining the Problem CP is defined by O'Shea (2008, pg 35), as "a disorder in posture and movement due to a defect in or lesion of the immature brain. " This disorder results in permanent, non-progressive symptoms ranging from mild tremor to quadriplegia (<b>Hayes,</b> <b>2010).</b> Sensation of the hands is impaired in about half of all cases and chronic pain is reported by more than 25 % of adults.
