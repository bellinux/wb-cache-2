5|$|Cameroon's {{population}} is almost <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> between {{urban and rural}} dwellers. Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain. Douala, Yaoundé, and Garoua are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, {{and most of the}} South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, {{but the overall}} population is fairly <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called Kirdi ("pagan") by the Fulani). The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{the problem}} [...] "given two numbers x and y, does x <b>evenly</b> <b>divide</b> y?" [...] is a {{decision}} problem. The answer can be either 'yes' or 'no', and depends upon the values of x and y. A method for solving a decision problem, given {{in the form of}} an algorithm, is called a decision procedure for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem [...] "given two numbers x and y, does x <b>evenly</b> <b>divide</b> y?" [...] would give the steps for determining whether x <b>evenly</b> <b>divides</b> y, given x and y. One such algorithm is long division, taught to many school children. If the remainder is zero the answer produced is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm, such as this example, is called decidable.|$|R
5|$|The eleven electors were {{relatively}} <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> between the factions of Colonna and Orsini, two powerful Roman families, led by Giacomo Colonna and Matteo Orsini, respectively. The three Orsini cardinals were pro-French and pro-Angevin, {{while the two}} Colonna cardinals supported competing Aragonese claims in Sicily. James II of Aragon had bankrolled the Colonna faction with gold, but it is unknown whether simony actually transpired.|$|E

Another poll conducted in mid-August by the Pew Research Center found Johnson supported by about 10% of registered voters. Of Johnson supporters, more than 60% identified as independent and more than 70% were younger than fifty years old. Johnson's supporters were <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> between men and women.|$|E

McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby's division, but with no success. Union casualties were 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> across the three corps. Confederate casualties were not reported directly, but {{are estimated to be}} under 500. Grant blamed McClernand's misleading dispatches for part of the poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2011 census there were 817 people living in the parish. 13.2% were {{children}} up the age of 15 years. 52.3% were between 16 and 64 with 34.5 being 65 and older. This is an older population than in the rest of Somerset and England and Wales in general. In line with the rest of Somerset {{the majority of the population}} (95%) describes themselves as White British. 69.7% of the population live in property which they own, with 14.3% living in social rented accommodation and 12.9% privately rented. There is a higher proportion of people living alone than in other areas. The housing is fairly <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> between detached, semi-detached and terraced house, with 5.7% living in flats.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate All-Stars {{contains}} 26playable {{characters from}} Capcom video game franchises like Street Fighter, Mega Man, and Viewtiful Joe and Tatsunoko Production anime franchises such as Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, Yatterman, and Neo-Human Casshern. The original arcade version of Cross Generation of Heroes features 18characters, which was increased to 22for its Wii release. The rosters of both Ultimate All-Stars and Cross Generation of Heroes are <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> between Tatsunoko and Capcom characters. The game's two {{largest and most}} powerful characters, Tatsunoko's Gold Lightan and Capcom's PTX-40A, cannot have partners; by extension, they cannot perform universal techniques that require a partner. Non-playable characters, derived from Capcom and Tatsunoko intellectual properties, make cameo appearances during certain attacks; for example, Casshan is assisted by his robotic dog, Friender, while Doronjo is accompanied by her lackeys Boyacky and Tonzura.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.|$|E
5|$|The {{restrictions}} against royalist {{candidates and}} voters were widely ignored, and the elections {{resulted in a}} House of Commons that was fairly <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The new so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year, and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|When all {{the ballots}} were counted, fewer than 2,000 votes {{separated}} Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since. The voters showed {{their interest in}} the election by turning out in record numbers; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history. Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 3 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 0.1 and 0.01 percent, respectively. The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote, as the Republicans won the House by a twelve-seat margin and the Senate was <b>evenly</b> <b>divided.</b> Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast there. Other states were much closer; Hancock’s margin of victory in California was only 144 votes.|$|E

5|$|Contagion premiered on September 3, 2011 at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, and a wider release {{followed}} on September 9. In the United States and Canada, Contagion {{was shown}} in 3,222 theaters, of which 254 screenings occurred at IMAX venues. Various American commercial analysts anticipated that the film would have ticket sales of between $20million and $25million during its opening weekend, which it did, grossing $8million on its first day, and $23.1M for the entire weekend. Of that total, ten percent ($2.3M) of the gross came from IMAX screenings. By outgrossing competitor The Help ($8.7M), Contagion became the highest-grossing film of the week. Demographically, the opening audience was <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> among gender, according to Warner Bros., while eighty percent of spectators were {{of the age of}} 25 and over. Contagion did well the following weekend, generating a $14.5M box office, but came in second to the re-release of The Lion King (1994). The third week saw the box office drop by forty percent, for a total gross of $8.7M. By the fourth week, Contagion had dropped to ninth place at the box office with $5M, and the number of theaters narrowed to 2,744. The film completed its theatrical run on December 15, 2011, at which point its total domestic gross was $75.6M.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then <b>evenly</b> <b>divided</b> across the meals.|$|E
