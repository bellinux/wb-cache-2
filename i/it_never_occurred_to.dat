They skirmished with {{elements of a}} Zulu force which Chelmsford {{believed to be the}} vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 2,500 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Chelmsford that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.|$|E

500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll just do it here.

Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, [...] "I suspect that <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her that her action was in any way special.

500|$|A failed early promotional attempt for {{the single}} took place after the Beatles' all-night {{recording}} session on 7–8 August 1968. With Apple Boutique having closed a week before, McCartney and his girlfriend, Francie Schwartz, painted Hey Jude/Revolution across its large, whitewashed shop windows. The words were mistaken for anti-Semitic graffiti (since Jude means [...] "Jew" [...] in German), leading to complaints from the local Jewish community, and the windows being smashed by passers-by. Discussing the episode in The Beatles Anthology, McCartney explained {{that he had been}} motivated by the location – [...] "Great opportunity. Baker Street, millions of buses going around…" [...] – and added: [...] "I had no idea it meant 'Jew', {{but if you look at}} footage of Nazi Germany, Juden Raus was written in whitewashed windows with a Star of David. I swear <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] According to Barry Miles, McCartney caused further controversy in his comments to Alan Smith of the NME that month when he said: [...] "Starvation in India doesn't worry me one bit, not one iota … And it doesn't worry you, if you're honest. You just pose." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me {{that it was going to}} become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E

The reputation of the arriving troops of the 9th and 10th Brigades was bad, because of [...] "criminal and uncontrolled" [...] elements within. According to ICTY, the evidence showed that members of both brigades not only demonstrated a lack of discipline, but also committed different forms of misappropriation (thefts etc.) The Trial Chamber noted in this respect the testimony of the 1st Corps Commander, Vahid Karavelić, who, while knowing of breaches of discipline and previous behaviour of members of these brigades, said that <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that they might commit atrocities against civilians in Grabovica.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{usually the}} aspect of {{financing}} of a military force is seen as [...] "derivative," [...] {{in the case of}} the States Army it played an important formative role, and influenced the peculiarities of the organisation also. Though 16th-century armies were usually preponderantly mercenary armies, there often were elements of feudal levies and volunteers also. These were lacking in the States Army (the civic militia or Schutterij was not part of the army). Apparently <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the authorities in the Republic to organize a volunteer or conscript army; mercenaries were the only feasible option. This had already been the case under the Habsburg rulers, when the States of the several provinces were asked to pay for the raising of the Habsburg armies, and played a role in their financial administration, like mustering. The authorities of the rebel provinces continued where they left of in this respect. They were, however, content to limit their role to financial administration and the raising of the necessary money via the financing of a Fiscal-military state (see Financial history of the Dutch Republic).. The latter formed already a considerable burden on the public finances of the provinces in the time of Charles V, and contributed to the formation of early-modern institutions for the management of the public debt in which the Dutch had a pioneering role (see Financial history of the Dutch Republic).|$|E
