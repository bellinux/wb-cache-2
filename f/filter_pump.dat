25|$|On June 20, 2009, a <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> on Bahari River malfunctioned, sending twenty-four {{guests and}} {{employees}} to the hospital. At 6:25 pm, the pump, which {{was turned off}} at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of liquid bleach and hydrochloric acid into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and nausea. They were given oxygen at the park before being transported to Jasper Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening. It was later determined that an interlock system designed to prevent chemical feeders from pumping chemicals into the water when the pump was turned off had malfunctioned.|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

50|$|Cartridge filter {{technology}} {{was invented in}} the mid-1960s, cartridge filters have a large surface areas enabling them to operate for long periods. Cartridge filter systems also permit better water flow - thus, placing less strain on the <b>filter</b> <b>pump.</b> These types of filters are also easiest to clean by using a flow of high-pressure water from a hose. The filters are made of polyester or other material that can provide a superfine filtering surface. The pleats {{are the key to}} the filter's operation. The tight pleats, or folds, allow for a large amount of material to be used in a small container. The more material used, the larger the surface area available to capture dirt or debris from the water. The fabric catches and holds the impurities until the filter can be cleaned or replaced. There 3 parts to a cartridge filter construction,end caps (made of plastic) core structure to provide strength (most often PVC) and the pleated media (most often polyester with a continuously graded fixed pore structure, these cartridges provide pre- and final filtration within the same cartridge resulting in lower overall filtration and disposal cost.|$|E

50|$|Conventional {{micromachining}} {{techniques such}} as wet etching, dry etching, deep reactive ion etching, sputtering, anodic bonding, and fusion bonding {{have been used in}} bio-MEMS to make flow channels, flow sensors, chemical detectors, separation capillaries, mixers, <b>filters,</b> <b>pumps</b> and valves. However, there are some drawbacks to using silicon-based devices in biomedical applications such as their high cost and bioincompatibility. Due to being single-use only, larger than their MEMS counterparts, and the requirement of clean room facilities, high material and processing costs make silicon-based bio-MEMS less economically attractive. In vivo, silicon-based bio-MEMS can be readily functionalized to minimize protein adsorption, but the brittleness of silicon remains a major issue.|$|R
40|$|Rock {{grouting}} is {{a commonly}} used process for sealing rocks in tunnels to reduce water ingress. In {{order to achieve}} sufficient sealing level the grout must effectively penetrate into rock fractures while the limiting factor is filtration of cement based grout. Many devices and measuring methods {{have been developed to}} study filtration and to measure the penetrability. The <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> and the penetrability meter are two of the most commonly used instruments for measuring filtration tendency in the field and in the lab, while short slot is used mainly in the lab. The results obtained from these devices have relatively different estimations of the penetrability partly due to the weaknesses in measuring methods and test procedures. Furthermore, there are no clear criteria to find out which of the results are closer to the reality or how much the results differ among these instruments. The aim of this study is comparing, and evaluating the results of these devices in relatively similar conditions while using more accurate methods of weight-time and pressure-time compared to the less reliable total volume method. The <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> and the penetrability meter were modified In order to fulfill the requirement of testing in similar conditions and to improve their accuracy and versatility. The results show that increasing the pressure improves the penetrability significantly. The modification of the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> results in reducing many uncertainties related to the testing procedure. Probably the modified <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> has higher accuracy in measuring the penetrability compared to regular <b>filter</b> <b>pump.</b> The short slot has the highest accuracy in estimating penetrability of cement based grout especially at higher pressures, furthermore, the short slot provides a more flexible way to measure penetrability with different pressures in the range of 1 - 15 bars...|$|E
40|$|An Oil filter is {{a filter}} to remove {{contaminants}} from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Oil filters {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an oil filter. Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, require the use of oil filters. And oil production, transport, and recycling facilities employ filters. Parts of the hydraulic oil filter in our project are piston housing, shaft housing, top plate, crankshaft, and piston. The aim of the project is to model and design casting tool for piston housing which is used in a hydraulic oil <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> having pressure 50 kg/cm 2, and temperature rating 300 deg C.

40|$|The {{personal}} dust monitor (PDM) is {{a sampling}} device developed for measuring the personal exposure to coal mine dust of mine workers. The device is based on proprietary technology known as the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) originally developed as a fixed- site environmental particulate mass monitor by Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc., Albany, NY. Currently, the monitoring of exposure to coal mine dust relies on periodic samples taken by traditional coal mine dust sampling units that use a cyclone, <b>filter,</b> <b>pump,</b> and laboratory measurement of the filter mass. Better measurement of mine dust levels has been the goal of industry and labor for nearly two decades. PDM technology offers accurate, end-of-shift and near real time assessment of worker dust exposure. Laboratory and underground tests compared measurements taken by a prototype PDM- 2 (a two-piece TEOM) to the average of multiple personal dust samplers monitoring the same space. In the range of mass loadings P between 0. 5 and 4. 0 mg/m the PDM met a 25 % accuracy criterion 95 % of the time with 95 % confidence. However, some questions still exist about potential bias between types of coal. The prototype two-piece device {{is in the process}} of being combined into a single unit that also contains the miners' cap lamp creating a more ergonomic dust sampling system...|$|E

40|$|Forty-seven {{single pass}} sand filters were {{monitored}} during winter, spring, and summer. Effluent {{samples were collected}} from both the septic tank and sand <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> chamber. Media samples from the sand filter and soil cover samples and cover depths were also collected or measured. Water meters were installed for each site and the meters were recorded {{on a monthly basis}} by the homeowner. All but one of the sand filters had a programmable timer to control dosing. The median hydraulic loading rate was 1. 8 cm/day (0. 44 gpd/ft 2), which was lower than the design hydraulic loading rate of 5. 1 cm/day (1. 25 gpd/ft 2). The median dose volume was 78 L/dose (21 gal/dose), which is higher than the recommended dose volume of 57 to 60 L/dose (15 to 16 gal/dose) for a 33. 4 m 2 (360 ft 2) filter. The median orifice loading rate (1. 3 L/dose/orifice, 0. 34 gal/dose/orifice) was also found to be greater than the recommended rate of 0. 95 L/dose/orifice (0. 25 gal/dose/orifice), indicating that the dose times need to be adjusted. The sand filters were found to reduce the concentration of TSS, BOD, and total nitrogen by 96 %, 98 %, and 37 % from the septic tank based on the median values. The fecal coliforms showed a 4 -log reduction from the septic tank, with 76 % of the samples having a fecal count of 200 col. / 100 mL or less. Recommended soil cover types and depths were followed only 18 % of the time. The sand media was found to match the recommended effective diameter 59 % of the time.

40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal cutting manufacturing on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central precoat filter systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the precoat filter with the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The precoat filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central precoat filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The filter pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central precoat filter system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using filter pumps which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|E
