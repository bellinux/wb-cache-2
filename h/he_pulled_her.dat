60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> fingers clear {{and passed out}} with her upon the trail.|$|E
60|$|Rachel went unhesitatingly. When {{she reached}} him <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> {{down on his}} knee, and she liked it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see she's {{sitting on}} it"--Tishy felt, it was plain, the {{responsibility}} of explanation. [...] "So that unless <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> off--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tion! Have no fear. I'll come back, {{covered with}} mud and medals. Mind {{you have that}} cup of tea waiting for me.' He is {{listening}} for the whistle. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> on to his knee.|$|R
50|$|James Garner accidentally broke Day's rib {{during the}} massage scene when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> off of Bergen. He wasn't {{aware of what}} had {{happened}} until the next day, when he felt the bandage while putting his arms around Day.|$|R
60|$|He had got her hand, and he {{was drawing}} her toward him. She {{struggled}} to free herself, but <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> closer.|$|E

60|$|Horscroft took a {{run forward}} and caught {{her by the}} wrist. She gave a little squeal {{at the sight of}} his face, but <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> towards where I was standing.|$|E
50|$|After {{getting an}} {{ultrasound}} at the hospital, Boom {{shows up at}} the restaurant where Prathan's daughter is celebrating her birthday and informs him that the sum of money he had given her was not enough. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> outside and hits her, tossing a wad of cash at her and warning her not to come near his family again.|$|R
50|$|Kay and {{her aunt}} go to a dance hall, where Danny O'Brien mistakenly {{believes}} she {{is there for}} a dance contest. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> into it and they take second prize. Danny also pays Kay's bill when she takes a room at a hotel where {{he works as a}} busboy, rescuing her when she has no money.|$|R
5000|$|Jay {{goes to her}} {{apartment}} to apologize. Dressed in a more fashionable and confident style, she is outspokenly skeptical about his behavior, but submits when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> to the floor for another round of uncomfortable sex. When it is over, Jay expresses that he has burgeoning feelings of commitment to Claire, but she asks him to leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] said Leonard, [...] "they {{are going}} to open fire. Under the earthwork, every man of you!" [...] And seizing Juanna who was {{standing}} near, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> down into cover.|$|E
60|$|With a bound Bensiabel {{opened his}} door and flung himself against the witch. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> back {{with such force that}} she stumbled, and falling headlong, dropped down dead {{at the foot of the}} stairs.|$|E
60|$|Case {{gathered}} up his goods, and, tucking {{it under his}} arm, grasped Helen's arm.

His disgusting touch and revolting face had revived her sensibilities.|$|E
50|$|Learning of his assistant’s fate, Angel {{searches}} for her. He is blinded by rage at the time, and when an Infinite guard {{calls out to}} him, he shoots the guard with his gun.

50|$|Connor {{heads to}} the banquet hall, where Jasmine is chatting with some of her {{followers}} who {{have no idea that}} they’re about to be eaten. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> aside and asks where she took Cordelia.

50|$|Eiji's {{mother is}} {{frequently}} visited by his father. Eventually, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> open <b>her</b> abdomen (which was cut open previously by Rika) and climbs inside.|$|R
60|$|Lucy's {{resistance}} {{was her only}} salvation, because it kept him on the track of his old threat.

6000|$|... "The Lord has {{delivered}} you into my hands," [...] {{he said in}} a low voice, with some awe in it. Then <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> to the ground, and, sitting down beside her, rocked himself backward and forward, his hands round his knees. She would have bartered the world for power to speak to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Strange," [...] {{said the}} man in Jill's ear, as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> along. [...] "This way. Stick to me. Strange how the drama anticipates life!

5000|$|The song is a {{moderately}} up-tempo number, with Sparboe telling {{her mother that}} she will be meeting two friends (Arne and Kjell) for a ride on a merry-go-round. She tries to decide which of them she should ride with first, with Arne being described as [...] "the biggest" [...] and also being capable of beating Kjell up if <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> ponytail (ironically, footage of Sparboe performing the song at the Contest shows her to have short hair).|$|R
6000|$|... "How can {{you make}} such a noise?" [...] said Eleanor, {{stopping}} her ears, by which she provoked Walter to go on roaring into them, while <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> down <b>her</b> hand - ...|$|R
6000|$|A ragged {{little boy}} overheard her remark, and came running after her. [...] "Buy {{a box of}} cigar-lights, Miss!" [...] <b>he</b> pleaded, <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> shawl to attract her attention. Clara stopped to explain.|$|R

60|$|It {{was about}} noon {{when they arrived}} at this place. The sun was {{becoming}} blurred and a storm appeared brewing. Fresno dismounted, dropping the halter of the mustang. Then he let go his own bridle. The eyes he bent on Allie made her turn hers away as from something that could scorch and stain. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> off the saddle, rudely, with coarse and meaning violence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] said he. [...] "Yonder! A shed," [...] {{and they}} ran together. She ran laughing, and yet swiftly and lightly. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> through the hedge by both hands, and {{released}} her skirt from an amorous bramble, {{and so they}} came into a little black shed in which a rusty harrow of gigantic proportions sheltered. He noted how she still kept her breath after that run.|$|E
50|$|Alex {{holds the}} knife close in defense {{as she sees}} {{a man in a}} mask walking out from the {{darkness}} to <b>her.</b> <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> off the mask to <b>her.</b> Then <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> in and begins to romantically make out with her. As their lips part, Alex smiles. It is now revealed that Skye's little sister is the mastermind behind the horrors; Nathan is her accomplice. Later Nico, who is upstairs, jumps out of an opened window with a knife in hand. When he falls he is wounded by his own knife as Nathan comes out and kills him.|$|R

She is very skilled at escapes and burglary. In some ways, she is complementary to Hiccup, in that since she does not think very carefully about situation, and just rushes in without thinking, so <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> back, and she, in return pushes him forward, convincing Hiccup to go with his gut.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, come, Violet, this won't do,' he continued, {{putting his}} arm round her, and turning her towards him, while <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> down <b>her</b> hands. 'This is pretty usage. You can't help it {{now if you}} would.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Help me!" [...] he gasped; [...] "the {{current is}} against us." [...] And, sitting {{opposite}} to him, {{she placed her}} hands upon his hands, pressing forward as <b>he</b> <b>pulled.</b> <b>Her</b> slight strength made a difference, and the boat forged ahead--thirty, forty, seventy yards--till they reached a rock to which, exhausted, he grappled with a hook, bidding her {{hold on to the}} floating seaweed. Thus they rested for thirty seconds, perhaps, when she spoke for the first time: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know me {{and that}} the money is safe," [...] {{he said to the}} auctioneer. [...] "It shall be paid to you to-morrow; I have enough to carry without lading myself up with so much gold.

60|$|When he arrived, he beheld a {{cloud of}} dust, a pile of bricks among the lilies, and the feet of his child {{sticking}} out of a large hole in the wall, while her head and shoulders were on the other side. Much amused, yet fearful that the stone coping might come down on her, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> back with the assurance that he would listen and help her now immediately, if there was such need of haste.|$|E
500|$|In April 2015 a {{waitress}} claimed and Key acknowledged that <b>he</b> had <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> ponytail multiple times over several months; when Key learnt {{she had taken}} offence, he apologised. International media have reported the incident as [...] "ponytail-gate".|$|R

He discovers from the bite mark on her neck that she {{was made into a}} vampire.

Jack dives into the water to help, discovering a dead man and a young woman, Sally (Allen), still alive, trapped inside the submerged car. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> to safety and accompanies her to a local hospital.|$|R
