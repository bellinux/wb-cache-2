40|$|International audienceThermomechanical {{performance}} of metallic alloys {{is directly related}} to the metal cleanliness that has always been a challenge for metallurgists. During liquid metal processing, particles can grow or decrease in size either by mass transfer with the liquid phase or by agglomeration/fragmentation mechanisms. As a function of numerical density of inclusions and of the hydrodynamics of the reactor, different numerical modeling approaches are proposed; in the case of an isolated particle, the Lagrangian technique coupled with a dissolution model is applied, whereas in the opposite case of large inclusion phase concentration, the population balance equation must be solved. Three examples of numerical modeling studies achieved at Institut Jean Lamour are discussed. They illustrate the application of the Lagrangian technique (for isolated <b>exogenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> in titanium bath) and the Eulerian technique without or with the aggregation process: for precipitation and growing of inclusions at the solidification front of a Maraging steel, and for endogenous inclusions in the molten steel bath of a gas-stirred ladle, respectively...|$|E

They {{are the product of}} chemical reactions, physical effects, and contamination that occurs during the melting and pouring process. These inclusions are categorized by origin as either endogenous or <b>exogenous.</b> Endogenous <b>inclusions,</b> also known as indigenous, occur within the metal and are the result of chemical reactions. These products precipitate during cooling and are typically very small. <b>Exogenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> are caused by the entrapment of nonmetals.

Secondly, the resulting defects in continuous cast steel products are reviewed, such as flange cracked cans, slag spots, and line defects {{on the surface of}} rolled sheet.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 <b>Exogenous</b> and {{indigenous}} <b>inclusions</b> are defined and described {{with respect to}} their origins and effects in cast steel. Means of minimizing <b>exogenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> thru prevention of their formation as well as entrapment in the mold filling system are discussed. Indigenous inclusions arise from elements normally present in steel, principally oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, and to control these inclusions it is necessary to limit the concentration of the forming elements. Conventional steelmaking techniques for controlling the oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur levels are described. Absolute elimination of indigenous inclusions has not been attained, so it is necessary to treat the residual inclusions {{in such a way that}} their deleterious effects are minimized. This involves selection of the appropriate final deoxidizer. The various deoxidizer choices are discussed {{with respect to their}} primary effect upon sulfide and nitride inclusions as well as precautions to be taken involving side effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of ultrasound in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and ultrasonography (US) usually relies on ultrasonic transducers {{in contact with}} the biological tissue. This is a major drawback for important potential applications such as surgery and small animal imaging. Here we report the use of remote optical detection, as used in industrial laser-ultrasonics, to detect ultrasound in biological tissues. This strategy enables non-contact implementation of PAT and US without exceeding laser exposure safety limits. The method uses suitably shaped laser pulses and a confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer in differential configuration to reach quantum-limited sensitivity.

40|$|The {{detection}} of ultrasound in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) usually relies on ultrasonic transducers {{in contact with}} the biological tissue through a coupling medium. This is a major drawback for important potential applications such as surgery. Here we report the use of a remote optical method, derived from industrial laserultrasonics, to detect ultrasound in tissues. This approach enables non-contact PAT (NCPAT) without exceeding laser exposure safety limits. The sensitivity of the method is based on the use of suitably shaped detection laser pulses and a confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer in differential configuration. Reliable image reconstruction is obtained by measuring remotely the surface profile of the tissue with an optical coherence tomography system. The proposed method also allows non-contact ultrasound imaging (US) by applying a second reconstruction algorithm to the data acquired for NCPAT. Endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> exhibiting optical and acoustic contrasts were detected ex vivo in chicken breast and calf brain specimens. Inclusions down to 0. 3 mm in size were detected at depths exceeding 1 cm. The method could expand the scope of photoacoustic and US to in-vivo biomedical applications where contact is impractical.

40|$|Most often, {{product quality}} {{is based on}} purity and homogeneity. To meet these {{conditions}} secondary metallurgy was developed including different methods for steel refining, but {{more important is the}} choice method of casting and its components. Casting metal melts {{is one of the key}} points that can ensure the desired product quality. Depending on the castings complexity, to obtain a high quality material several methods of casting have been developed. One of the most common methods of pouring large ingots is vacuum casting because the metal bath is protected from reoxidation. Another advantage of vacuum casting of steel ingots is achieving wide stream by injecting inert gas (Ar), this stimulates the floating of inclusions and prevents convection currents forming in the metal bath. This wide jet creates particularly advantageous conditions in the degassing process by increasing surface contact between vacuum and molten metal, managing to achieve maximum efficiency of removing gas and lowering the inclusion content. Like other methods of casting metals, besides the benefits of obtaining a quality material some disadvantages may influence the future products. One of the great disadvantages that can lead to scrap is the formation of a crown on the spray limiter during casting. Crowns get formed from non-metallic inclusions obtained from the "washing " the spray limiter. During ingot vacuum pouring because of the contact between steel and spray limiter pieces fall from the formed crown representing a powerful source of <b>exogenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> which can reject the finished product in non-destructive checks. Experimental research presents interesting information on the causes of crown formation and the solutions applied to avoid its formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow pattern}} has widely been {{recognized}} {{to have an}} impact on the <b>exogenous</b> non-metallic <b>inclusion</b> generation in the gating system and mold flux entrapment in the uphill teeming process. Thus, a well-controlled flow pattern during the teeming process can improve the quality of ingots and further increase the yield during steel production. The current study focused on investigating and optimizing the flow pattern of steel in the gating system and molds to improve steel cleanliness during the initial filling moment. A mathematical model considering a trumpet was initially compared to a reduced model only considering part of the runner channel. Thereafter, the influence of swirl blades implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling conditions in the molds was investigated in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The effects of a swirl blade orientation on a swirling flow were further discussed. The simulation results, when utilizing swirl blades, were also verified by plant trials performed at Scana Steel. In addition, a new novel swirling flow generation component, TurboSwirl, was studied in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The model was based on modifications of the refractory geometry at the elbow of the runners near the mold without the usage of an inserted flow control device in the gating system. Owing to its great potential for improving the flow pattern of steel during the initial filling moment, the effect of TurboSwirl on steel cleanliness was also studied. The results showed that the initial filling conditions during the uphill teeming process can be improved by using a swirl blade or a TurboSwirl in the gating system. This makes it possible to further decrease the initial position of mold powder bags. In addition, it reduces the possibilities of <b>exogenous</b> non-metallic <b>inclusion</b> generation in the gating system as well as mold flux entrapment in the mold during the uphill teeming process. However, the utilization of swirl blades created a considerable amount of droplets when steel entered the molds during the first couple of seconds, which also was verified by the plant trials. The introduction of TurboSwirl showed a greater potential than a swirl blade due to a more evenly distributed swirling flow. The DPM model adopted in the simulations revealed that the TurboSwirl can improve steel cleanliness by increasing the non-metallic inclusion collision rate both with respect to Stokes and turbulent collisions.

Typical examples are the particles of refractory material which detach from their parent material during ladle treatment, teeming and casting operations, remaining entrained in the steel. In the present work, {{the interactions between}} Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 refractories and steel during casting of ingots has been deeply investigated, permitting to explain the occurrence of ghelenite- and grossite-types inclusions into special grade steels. The experimental analyses were carried out on non-metallic inclusions and ex-service refractory materials by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ray Microdiffraction (.

40|$|The {{simplified}} and half-simplified diets are a {{new technology}} that combines economy and welfare intestinal. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of simplified and half-simplified diets, with and without exogenous enzymes, on the productive performance of growing rabbits. A Reference diet, two simplified diets and eight half-simplified diets had been utilized. The main fibrous sources used were the alfalfa hay (ALH), hay from the upper third of the cassava foliage (HUTCF) and cassava leaf meal (CLM), using a completely randomized design with 11 treatments and eight repetitions. The enzymes used were the carbohydrases (alpha-galactosidase, galactomanase, xylanase and beta-glucanase) and phytase. The consumption of animals fed with diets with high inclusion of CLM was lower than the other. The daily weight gain was higher in animals fed with the reference diet, half-simplified diet based on HUTCF and half-simplified diets based on the mix of ALH and CLM. A positive effect of <b>exogenous</b> enzymes <b>inclusion,</b> on the performance parameters, was not observed. Based on these results we conclude that the simplified and half-simplified diets provide decrease in productive performance. Considering the proportionate economy in the cost of feed, the half simplified based on HUTCF may be an interesting alternative...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} some aspects {{concerning}} secondary metallurgy of steel {{where there is}} little or very inconsistent information in the literature. More specifically, it is devoted to the studies on high temperature phase equilibria in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system, the formation of ladle glaze and the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron. First, the solidification of different slags on MgO based refractories was studied in order to reveal the mechanism behind the formation of “ladle glaze”. The formation of the slag glaze layer was studied by dipping MgO rods, dense or porous, into liquid slags at 1873 K. The rods were thereafter cooled at a predetermined rate. From a later SEM-EDS microscopy, {{it was found that the}} initial slag composition had the most profound effect on the phases found in the solidified slag layer. It was found that the type of MgO rod used and cooling speed had a minor impact on the morphology on the solidified samples. In addition, the slags used in the study were equilibrated at 1773 K, 1673 K and 1573 K in order to get an understanding of the equilibrium phases and their relationship during cooling. On the basis of the experimental results, the mechanism regarding entrainment of <b>exogenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> from the refractory lining was also discussed. Secondly, phase diagram studies in the high basicity region of the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system were performed using the quench technique followed by EPMA analysis. The main focus in the study was to find the liquidus surfaces for MgO and CaO saturation at 1773 and 1873 K. Based on the experimental data, phase diagrams for the 25, 30 and 35 mass percent alumina sections were constructed for silica contents generally less than 20 mass percent [...] The results generally agreed very well with previous, well established phase diagrams. In addition, the activities of MgO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 were estimated using the phase diagram information. At last, the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron at 1823 K were studied. In a pre-study, the thermodynamics of Ag-Mg solutions were studied, necessary for the Fe-Mg system. For the Ag-Mg system, two different experimental techniques were used; the vapor pressure method and the gas equilibration technique. The temperature range of the Ag-Mg study was 1573 to 1823 K. It was found that the excess Gibbs energy of this system can be described quite well with a sub-regular solution model. In the Fe-Mg study, the partition of Mg between liquid iron and liquid silver were studied at 1823 K. Using the results from the pre-study, the activity coefficient of Mg in liquid iron and the self-interaction parameter were determined at 1823 K. QC 2011031...|$|R
30|$|Research {{studies in}} Cluster 1 utilise {{endogenous}} spatiotemporal FSE more often – {{the most popular}} approach is based on cross-correlation functions. In addition, dimension reduction methods are widely used in this cluster (PCA is the most popular). Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 are homogeneous in terms of selected spatiotemporal FSE methods and are mainly based on <b>exogenous</b> filtering (e.g. <b>inclusion</b> of directly connected upstream points). Taking into account that Cluster 1 studies are newer (median year of publication is 2015), we can conclude that conventional exogenous spatiotemporal FSE worked well for sequential spatial settings (freeways and arterial roads) with {{a small number of}} analysed locations. Recently the focus of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting has shifted to complex road networks, where endogenous and other spatiotemporal FSE methods are more beneficial.|$|R
40|$|In vitro transcription/translation of HLA-DR 1 cDNAs in the {{presence}} of microsomal membranes was used to study the association of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules with peptide and invariant chain (Ii) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HLA-DR alpha and HLA-DR beta subunits assembled into SDS-unstable heterodimers in the absence of <b>exogenous</b> peptide. The <b>inclusion</b> of synthetic peptides during the alpha/beta assembly process promoted their conversion to SDS-resistant heterodimers. Addition of Ii RNA during the translation of HLA-DR alpha and HLA-DR beta RNAs resulted in the formation of alpha/beta/Ii complexes. Peptide binding by class II molecules was detected even when excess Ii was present during alpha/beta assembly. These findings indicate that peptides can bind alpha/beta heterodimers in the ER microenvironment and suggest that peptides derived from cytosolic proteins that are presented by class II molecules at the cell surface may have bound to HLA-DR in the ER...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrative}} {{approach was}} used to obtain pure cultures of previously uncultivated members of the divisions Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia from agricultural soil and from the guts of wood-feeding termites. Some elements of the cultivation procedure included the following: the use of agar media {{with little or no}} added nutrients; relatively long periods of incubation (more than 30 days); protection of cells from <b>exogenous</b> peroxides; and <b>inclusion</b> of humic acids or a humic acid analogue (anthraquinone disulfonate) and quorum-signaling compounds (acyl homoserine lactones) in growth media. The bacteria were incubated in the presence of air and in hypoxic (1 to 2 % O 2 [vol/vol]) and anoxic atmospheres. Some bacteria were incubated with elevated concentrations of CO 2 (5 % [vol/vol]). Significantly more Acidobacteria were found on isolation plates that had been incubated with 5 % CO 2. A simple, high-throughput, PCR-based surveillance method (plate wash PCR) was developed. This method greatly facilitated detection and ultimate isolation of target bacteria from as many as 1, 000 colonies of nontarget microbes growing on the same agar plates. Results illustrate the power of integrating culture methods with molecular techniques to isolate bacteria from phylogenetic groups underrepresented in culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of grain sorghum in diets for broiler chickens is quite common; however, under Australian conditions, the utilisation of starch/energy by birds offered sorghum-based diets appears inadequate. Various factors inherent in sorghum, including kafirin, phenolic compounds and phytate, may limit energy utilisation. The recent quantification of kafirin, the dominant protein fraction in sorghum, has allowed its nutritional significance to be assessed. This is important as indirect {{evidence suggests that}} kafirin concentrations in local sorghums are increasing as an unintended consequence of breeding programs. Presently, Australian sorghums do not contain condensed tannin but, from analyses and assessments of other polyphenolic compounds and phenolic acids, "non-tannin" phenols appear to be negative influences. Anecdotally, white sorghums {{are considered to be}} superior to red varieties thus the fact that polyphenolic pigments are responsible for the "redness" of sorghum assumes relevance. Inclusions of sulphite reducing agents in broiler diets have generated promising responses but seem dependent on sorghum properties. Preliminary studies have shown the possibilities of using rapid visco-analyser (RVA) starch pasting profiles, promatest protein solubilities and grain textures to indicate sorghum quality and further studies are required to confirm these hypotheses. These assessments may indicate which sorghums will best respond to reducing agents such as sodium metabisulphite. Finally, the usually modest responses of broilers to <b>exogenous</b> feed enzyme <b>inclusions</b> in sorghum-based are considered in this review. 28 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} program {{was designed to}} evaluate the impact of various dietary and ingredient nutrient profiles and <b>exogenous</b> enzyme <b>inclusion</b> on growth performance and energy utilization in broilers. Experiment one was designed to observe increasing levels of distillers? dried grains with Solubles (DDGS) and a non-starch polysaccharide degrading enzyme (NSPase) on energy digestibility. Experiment two evaluated the influence nutrient variation in corn and xylanase supplementation on growth performance and nutrient utilization. In experiment one, DDGS concentration was increased from 0 to 15 % in 5 % increments and included the addition of an NSPase enzyme. Early broiler body weight and FCR was negatively affected with increasing DDGS concentration up to 15 %. The decreased growth performance {{was associated with a}} decrease in energy and nitrogen utilization as a linear decrease was observed in IDE, INDC, and AMEn. Addition of the NSPase negated many of the negative effects on nutrient utilization as improvements in all digestibility measurements were observed. Interactions were observed with DDGS concentration and NSPase inclusion as the benefit of enzyme inclusion was augmented as DDGS level increase. Experiment two evaluated different corn crops from six geographical locations in the US in an effort {{to determine the effects of}} xylanase inclusion and corn nutrient variation on growth performance and nutrient utilization. Significant differences were observed in growth performance, IDE, and AMEn in broilers when fed corn. Corn source impacted early body weights, and FCR throughout the experiment. Energy utilization was also impacted on all measured parameters, following the starter phase (day 17) and at the conclusion of the trial (day 41) by corn source. Xylanase inclusion improved FCR during the finisher phase as well as the cumulative FCR (day 1 - 41). Digestibility data indicates that corn source impacts the xylanase effectiveness in young broilers, as improvements were not observed in all corn types. Xylanase inclusion, however, did increase IDE and AMEn in all corn sources on day 41 of age. Data from this research program confirm that ingredient nutrient content, through the presence of ingredients with anti-nutritive properties or the incidence of varying nutrient profiles, does impact observed growth performance as related to reduced nutrient digestibility. Additionally, the inclusion of a dietary exogenous enzyme does improve energy and nitrogen digestibility in broilers, ultimately improving growth performance of broilers and improving efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{systematic}} review {{was conducted to}} assess the cost-effectiveness of routine varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination in high-income countries estimated by modelling studies. Methods: A PubMed search was performed to identify relevant studies published before October 2013. Studies {{were included in the}} review if they (i) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of routine childhood or adolescent varicella vaccination and/or HZ vaccination targeting the elderly, and if they (ii) reported results for high-income countries. Results: A total of 38 model-based studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Routine childhood or adolescent varicella vaccination was cost-effective or cost-saving from a payer perspective and always cost-saving from a societal perspective when ignoring its potential impact on HZ incidence due to reduced or absent <b>exogenous</b> boosting. The <b>inclusion</b> of the potential impact of childhood varicella vaccination on HZ led to net quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses or incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding commonly accepted thresholds. Additional HZ vaccination could partially mitigate this effect. Studies focusing only on the evaluation of HZ vaccination reported a wide range of results depending on the selected target age-group and the vaccine price, but most found HZ vaccination to be a cost-effective or marginally cost-effective intervention. Cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination was strongly dependent on the age at vaccination, the price of the vaccine, the assumed duration of protection and the applied cost per QALY threshold. Conclusions: While HZ vaccination is mostly considered cost-effective, cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination primarily depends on the in- or exclusion of exogenous boosting in the model. As a consequence, clarification on the role of exogenous boosting is crucial for decision-making regarding varicella vaccination...|$|R
