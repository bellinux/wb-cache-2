40|$|The {{flight path}} of locusts is under {{permanent}} visual and mechanoreceptive control (the latter evaluates changes in wind direction). Involuntary course deviations are compensated immediately by a neuronal feedback system or 'autopilot', which induces corrective steering {{movements of the}} wings, abdomen and legs and which are generally accompanied by compensatory head movements (Taylor, 1981; Hensler and Robert, 1990). During apparently straight flight the flight path is not perfectly straight, but instead the insect oscillates slightly along a mean course (Robert, 1988; Hensler and Robert, 1990). The principal neural events underlying corrective steering have been un-ravelled: sensory information on course deviations (coming from the eyes, ocelli and wind-sensitive hairs on the head) and proprioceptive information caused by head movements are coded {{in a class of}} descending <b>deviation</b> <b>detector</b> neurones (DDNs). 15 DDNs have already been identified. Most of them are multimodal and respond in a direction-specific manner to deviations from course (e. g. Rowell and Reichert, 1986; Hensler, 1988, 1992).

40|$|Neural {{control of}} optomotor {{responses}} in Locusta migratoria was studied using a newly developed preparation of intact, tethered, flying locusts. The preparation could perform normal flight behaviour and head movements while neurones {{in the neck}} connectives were recorded and stimulated intracellularly. Course deviations simulated by an artificial horizon caused optomotor reac-tions, e. g. steering by the wings (monitored as steering reactions in M 97 and M 127, first basalar muscles of fore- and hindwings, respectively) and compensa-tory head movements. Intracellular recordings were made from two identified descending <b>deviation</b> <b>detector</b> neurones, PI(2) 5 and DNC. Both neurones coded direction specifically for course deviations. Electrical activation of either neurone in tethered flight at frequencies of up to 230 Hz elicited steering in M 97 and M 127 and head rolling with latencies of less than 20 ms. These reactions were of the same quality and strength as compensatory head rolling and steering in M 97 and M 127 following horizon rolling of about 40 °. This demonstrates directly a role of PI(2) 5 and DNC in course control...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that, following adaptation, cells adjust their sensitivity to reflect the global stimulus conditions. Two recent studies in guinea pig inferior colliculus (IC, Dean, Harper & McAlpine 2005) and rat barrel cortex (Garcia-Lazaro, Ho, Nair & Schnupp 2007) found that neural stimulus-response functions were displaced laterally {{in a manner that}} was dependent on the mean adapting stimulus. However, the direction of gain change, following adaptation to variance, was in contradiction to Information Theory, which predicts a decrease in gain with increased stimulus variance. On further analysis of the experimental data, presented within this thesis, it was revealed that the adaptive gain changes to global stimulus variance were, in fact, in the direction predicted by Information Theory. However, following adaptation to global mean amplitude, neural threshold was displaced to centre the SRF on inputs that were located {{on the edge of the}} stimulus distribution. It was found that adaptation scaled neural output such that the relationship between firing rate and local, as opposed to global, differences in stimulus amplitude was maintained; with the majority of cells responding to large differences in stimulus amplitude, on the 40 ms scale. A small majority of cells responded to step-size differences, in amplitude, of either direction and were classed as novelty preferring. Adaptation to global mean was replicated in model neuron with spike-rate adaptation and tonic inhibition, which increased with stimulus mean. Adaptation to stimulus variance was replicated in three models 1 : By increasing, in proportion to stimulus variance, background, excitatory and inhibitory firing rates in a balanced manner (Chance, Abbott & Reyes 2002), 2 : A model of asymmetric synaptic depression (Chelaru & Dragoi 2008) and 3 : a model combining non-linear input with synaptic depression. The results presented, within this thesis, demonstrate that neurons change their coding strategies depending upon the global levels of mean and variance within the sensory input. Under low noise conditions, neurons act as <b>deviation</b> <b>detectors,</b> i. e. are primed to respond to large changes in the stimulus on the tens of millisecond; however, under conditions of increased noise switch their encoding strategy in order to compute the full range of the stimulus distribution through adjusting neural gain.

40|$|The pars intercerebralis neurone PI(2) 5 of Locusta migratoria is a {{descending}} large-field <b>deviation</b> <b>detector</b> (DN), {{projecting from}} the brain to the fused abdominal ganglia. It responds with bursts of action potentials (1) to specific movements of an artificial horizon, simulating deviations from course (preferred deviations are roll and yaw {{to the side of}} the axon, and pitch-up), and (2) to proprioceptive input from neck receptors signalling head movements in either direction. During compensatory head movements both inputs act together so that the deficit in visual information is balanced by proprioceptive input. The number of spikes elicited by roll deviations depends on the sector of the visual vield initially covered by the horizon (sector specificity), increasing the more the horizon is oriented in the visually preferred direction. Hence, sector specificity involves information about the absolute orientation with respect to the horizon. The number of spikes depends further on the roll position of the head with respect to the prothorax. The response is amplified when the head is oriented in the visually preferred direction, and is attenuated when the head is oriented in the visually antipreferred direction. Visual and proprioceptive modulatory effects balance each other so that sector specificity relates to the body (i. e. the aerodynamic organs) even when head and body are rotated against each other. During flight, the excitability of PI(2) 5 is further influenced by tonic inhibition from frontal wind (no directionality), which is overriden by tonic excitation of central origin...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation {{of solar}} heat gain and {{daylight}} distribution through complex window and shading systems requires {{the determination of the}} bi-directional transmission distribution function (BTDF). Measurement of BTDF can be time-consuming, and inaccuracies are likely because of physical constraints and experimental adjustments. A general calculation methodology, based on more easily measurable component properties, would be preferable and would allow much more flexibility. In this paper, measurements and calculations are compared for the specific case of prismatic daylight-redirecting panels. Measurements were performed in a photogoniometer equipped with a digital-imaging detection system. A virtual copy of the photogoniometer was then constructed with commercial ray-tracing software. For the first time, an attempt is made to validate detailed bi-directional properties for a complex system by comparing an extensive set of experimental BTDF data with ray-tracing calculations. The results generally agree under a range of input and output angles to a degree adequate for evaluation of glazing systems. An analysis is presented to show that the simultaneously measured diffuse and direct components of light transmitted by the panel are properly represented. Calculations were also performed using a more realistic model of the source and ideal model of the <b>detector.</b> <b>Deviations</b> from the photogoniometer model were small and the results were similar in form.

40|$|In {{the present}} review, signal-processing {{capabilities}} of the canal lateral line organ imposed by its peripheral architecture are quantified {{in terms of a}} limited set of measurable physical parameters. It is demonstrated that cupulae in the lateral line canal organ can only partly be described as canal fluid velocity <b>detectors.</b> <b>Deviation</b> from velocity detection may result from resonance, and can be characterized by {{the extent to which a}} single dimensionless resonance number, N (r), exceeds 1. This number depends on four physical parameters: it is proportional to cupular size, cupular sliding stiffness and canal fluid density, and inversely proportional to the square of fluid viscosity. Situated in a canal, a cupula may benefit from its resonance by compensating for the limited frequency range of water motion that is efficiently transferred into the lateral line canal. The peripheral transfer of hydrodynamic signals, via canal and cupula, leads to a nearly constant sensitivity to outside water acceleration in a bandwidth that ranges from d. c. to a cut-off frequency of up to several hundreds of Hertz, significantly exceeding the cut-off frequency of the lateral line canal. Threshold values of hydrodynamic detection by the canal lateral line organ are derived in terms of water displacement, water velocity, water acceleration and water pressure gradients and are shown to be close to the detection limits imposed by hair cell mechano-transduction in combination with the physical constraints of peripheral lateral line signal transfer. The notion that the combination of canal- and cupular hydrodynamics effectively provides the lateral line canal organ with a constant sensitivity to water acceleration at low frequencies so that it consequently functions as a low-pass detector of pressure gradients, supports the appropriateness of describing it as a sense organ that "feels at a distance" (Dijkgraaf in Biol Rev 38 : 51 - 105, 1963) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the dosimetric properties of a synthetic single crystal diamond Schottky diode for accurate relative dose measurements in {{large and small}} field high-energy clinical proton beams. Methods: The dosimetric properties of a synthetic single crystal diamond detector were assessed by comparison with a reference Markus parallel plate ionization chamber, an Exradin A 16 microionization chamber, and Exradin T 1 a ion chamber. The diamond detector was operated at zero bias voltage at all times. Comparative dose distribution measurements were performed by means of Fractional depth dose curves and lateral beam profiles in clinical proton beams of energies 155 and 250 MeV for a 14 cm square cerrobend aperture and 126 MeV for 3, 2, and 1 cm diameter circular brass collimators. ICRU Report No. 78 recommended beam parameters were used to compare fractional depth dose curves and beam profiles obtained using the diamond detector and the reference ionization chamber. Warm-up/stability of the detector response and linearity with dose were evaluated in a 250 MeV proton beam and dose rate dependence was evaluated in a 126 MeV proton beam. Stem effect and the azimuthal angle dependence of the diode response were also evaluated. Results: A maximum <b>deviation</b> in diamond <b>detector</b> signal from the average reading of less than 0. 5 % was found during the warm-up irradiation procedure. The detector response showed a good linear behavior {{as a function of}} dose with observed deviations below 0. 5 % over a dose range from 50 to 500 cGy. The detector response was dose rate independent, with deviations below 0. 5 % in the investigated dose rates ranging from 85 to 300 cGy/min. Stem effect and azimuthal angle dependence of the diode signal were within 0. 5 %. Fractional depth dose curves and lateral beam profiles obtained with the diamond detector were in good agreement with those measured using reference dosimeters. Conclusions: The observed dosimetric properties of the synthetic single crystal diamond detector indicate that its behavior is proton energy independent and dose rate independent in the investigated energy and dose rate range and it is suitable for accurate relative dosimetric measurements in large as well as in small field high energy clinical proton beams. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
