5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result}} of the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|One major {{effect of}} the {{recommendations}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> of November 2008, it is mandatory that all vehicle operators who intend to use their vehicles to transport students between extracurricular activities be covered by a Third Party Liability and Accident Benefit policy. These policies {{must be in the}} amount of no less than CAD$1 million for vehicles with a capacity of fewer than 10 passengers, and no less than CAD$5 million for vehicles with a capacity of 10 or more. This also applies to parents driving others' children to school related extracurricular activities.|$|E

5|$|Such {{publications}} {{were followed}} by multilingual collections, of which the most ambitious was Alessandro Torri’s L'elegia di Tommaso Gray sopra un cimitero di campagna tradotta dall'inglese in più lingue con varie cose finora inedite (Verona 1819). This included four translations into Latin, of which one was Christopher Anstey’s and another was Costa’s; eight into Italian, where versions in prose and terza rima accompanied those already mentioned by Torelli and Cesarotti; two in French, two in German and one each in Greek and Hebrew. Even more translations were eventually added in the new edition of 1843. By that time, too, John Martin’s illustrated edition of 1839 had appeared with translations into Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French, of which only the Torelli version had appeared in previous collections. What we learn from all this activity <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> the centenary of its first publication approached, interest in Gray’s Elegy continued unabated in Europe and new translations of it continued to be made.|$|E
25|$|Theories {{of aging}} are {{numerous}} {{and no one}} theory has been accepted.

25|$|The {{beauty of}} the oil-drop {{experiment}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> well as allowing quite accurate determination of the fundamental unit of charge, Millikan's apparatus also provided a 'hands on' demonstration that charge is actually quantized. The General Electric Company's Charles Steinmetz, who had previously thought that charge is a continuous variable, became convinced otherwise after working with Millikan's apparatus.|$|E

25|$|The coiled {{condenser}} tubes inside will provide more surface area for cooling {{and for this}} reason it is most favorable to use but the drawback of this condenser <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> the vapors get condensed, it tends to move them up in the tube to evaporate which will also lead to the flooding of solution mixture.|$|E
25|$|These {{are similar}} to the {{well-known}} licences, in that they're defined before their use and can be applied to many instances of licensing. Their difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> they're not well known, it's also necessary to explain what each of them entails, as the user is always likely to be encountering each of them for the first time. A REL provides the means to do this.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large number of}} options <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> noted previously, {{rotations}} in three dimensions (and higher) do not commute. If we reverse a given sequence of rotations, we get a different outcome. This also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles. Thus Euler angles are not vectors, despite a similarity in appearance as a triplet of numbers.|$|E

50|$|Raytheon {{proposed}} a sixth option, whereby they would offer {{a combination of}} sensors, communications systems, and other mission-related systems as a package, and then choose an airframe at a later date.

25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets {{are even more}} exciting. We were interested in making the technology very visible, but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} being able to see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
25|$|This {{represents}} {{the flexibility to}} implement 16 functions, leaving the physical design untouched. Additional serial lines and parallel inputs would obviously {{increase the number of}} realizable functions. However, a significant drawback of such devices <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> the number of realizable functions increases, an increasing number of clocking regions is required. As a consequence, a device exploiting this method of function implementation may perform significantly slower than its traditional counterpart.|$|E
25|$|A common folk tale {{surrounding}} {{the death of}} King Dutugemunu <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> he was dying {{he was told that}} Ruwanweliseya was completed in order to keep him happy. The well-intentioned plan went awry, however, when Dutugemunu asked to be shown the finished building. His brother Tissa had the entire building draped in white cloth to present the illusion of whitewash, and due to his failing eyesight Dutugemunu did not spot the difference, dying convinced that the building was finished.|$|E

25|$|A {{main problem}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> with {{other types of}} phylogenetic inferences, the actual {{evolutionary}} history cannot be established with certainty. As a result, it is difficult to obtain a representative test set of HGT events. Furthermore, HGT inference methods vary considerably in the information they consider and often identify inconsistent groups of HGT candidates: it is not clear to what extent taking the intersection, the union, or some other combination of the individual methods affects the false positive and false negative rates.|$|E
25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E
25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> web crawlers have {{a limit to how}} many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages, and (2) the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E

25|$|The main {{suspension}} cables {{in older}} bridges were often made from chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables {{are made from}} multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because {{the failure of a}} few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or eyebar can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River.) Another reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{for such}} wide {{recovery}} {{has been made}} in several areas. The first <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> is common in tort law, policy reasons should allow those injured to have means of compensation. Employers generally have larger assets, and greater means with which to offset any losses (deep pocket compensation) Secondly, it is under the instruction of an employer by which a tort is committed; the employer can be seen to gain from the duties of their employees, and thus must bear the consequences of any wrongdoings committed by them. Lastly, it has been justified as a way to reduce the taking of risks by employers, and to ensure adequate precautions are taken in conducting business.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Coast League {{plays by}} the same rules listed in the Official Baseball Rules {{published}} by Major League Baseball. One exception {{is the use of}} Designated hitter (DH). Whereas the application of the DH rule in Major League Baseball is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams, PCL pitchers hit when both clubs are National League affiliates and they have agreed to have their pitchers hit. Two National League affiliated clubs may agree to use the DH instead. The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> players move up and get closer to reaching the majors, teams prefer to have the rules follow (as closely as possible) those of the major leagues. The DH is always used when one or both teams are American League affiliates.|$|E
