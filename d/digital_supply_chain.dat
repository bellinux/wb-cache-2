40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> of {{the book}} publishing industry is changing {{in terms of the}} digital revolution in the industry. The first impact was printing plate manufacturers withdrawn from the supply chain; further, the e-commerce techniques improved the logistic system and customer relationship management. Technology did accelerate the effectiveness of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> but did not change too much the sequences and supply-demand relationships between members in it. For instance, with the publishing products become “virtualized,” the roles of authors, publishers, distributors, resellers, and customers are transforming as a contingent system. A reader can easily perform as an author, and publisher via online bookstores, even blogs or facebook. Therefore, the roles in the publishing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> as well as their future practices in producing digital content are the main purposes of this study. Since the past few years, due to the proliferation of sophisticated publishing technologies, the threshold of publishing has been lowered. Everyone has a chance to self-publish his/her own work and become an author. These authors come into contact with their audiences directly, sell books, and become best-selling writers. However, as the new types of publishing are developing, the sales of physical paper books are declining. It causes the supply-demand imbalance in the publishing market. In order to cope with this new publishing wave, how the structure of the publishing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> will change? how the suppliers will reposition their roles? This study selects five of the U. S. leading self-publishers (AuthorHouse, BookSurge, iUniverse, LuLu, and Xlibris) as its main research subjects, and constructs a model of <b>digital</b> content <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> in the publishing industry by applying the grounded theory methodology. The researchers make data analysis and connection of the 13 categories, build self <b>digital</b> publishing <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> obtain proposition from the original data by grounded method, and secondly, compares the theoretical framework with the original data and adds <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> components and literature dialogue, verifies the theoretical framework, to propose a contingency self <b>digital</b> publishing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> model...|$|R

5000|$|A broader {{definition}} of the term [...] "digital supply chain" [...] is given in a book chapter by Tony Hines where the term was coined in 2001 to explain a transformation from what he called analogue supply chains to his new conception - the <b>digital</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> This contribution recognised that digital supply chains were configured to distribute goods or services that had previously been supplied in physical form. Examples given included books, music and film. However, Hines also expanded the definition to include business to business services and he gives the example of fashion design and product development conducted digitally. This digitalisation of hitherto physical form (which he called analogue supply chains) removed time, distance and cost from the supply chain. Hines gives a number of examples. Hines gives further examples of how information has replaced inventory by designing digital supply chains you can read more in his Supply Chain Strategies book published by Routledge.|$|E

40|$|As a discipline, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> {{management}} (SCM) {{has traditionally}} been primarily concerned with the procurement, processing, movement and sale of physical goods. However an important class of products has emerged - digital products - which cannot be described as physical as they do not obey commonly understood physical laws. They do not possess mass or volume, and they require no energy in their manufacture or distribution. With the Internet, they can be distributed at speeds unimaginable in the physical world, and every copy produced is a 100 % perfect duplicate of the original version. Furthermore, {{the ease with which}} digital products can be replicated has few analogues in the physical world. This paper assesses the effect of non-physicality on one such product – software – in relation to the practice of SCM. It explores the challenges that arise when managing the software <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and how practitioners are addressing these challenges. Using a two-pronged exploratory approach that examines the literature around software management as well as direct interviews with software distribution practitioners, a number of key challenges associated with software <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are uncovered, along with responses to these challenges. This paper proposes a new model for software <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> that takes into account the non-physicality of the product being delivered. Central to this model is the replacement of physical flows with flows of intellectual property, the growing importance of innovation over duplication and the increased centrality of the customer in the entire process. Hybrid physical / <b>digital</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are discussed and a framework for practitioners concerned with software <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of forecast accuracy is increasing in {{the semiconductor industry}} due to two compounding factors. The complexity of the manufacturing process is increasing which causes manufacturing cycle times to increase as well. Further, the lifecycle of products is decreasing. Thus manufacturers have to increasingly build ahead of demand while anticipating customer preference with increasing accuracy. This thesis investigates the origins of demand forecast inaccuracies at Digital Semiconductor as well as · characterizes the main <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> costs of forecast inaccuracy. The forecasting cycle is a complicated chain spanning several functional groups each with their own incentives and interests. For Digital Semiconductor, the process is complicated by having one manufacturing site servicing five product lines which each have very different customers, competitors and product specifications. A successful process results in having the right type and number of parts available to customers at the right time. An over-optimistic forecast results in excess inventory and obsolescence, whereas a forecast that is too conservative will result in stock-outs and loss of customers. The thesis starts with {{a detailed analysis of}} Digital Semiconductor's forecasting process. We then describe the analysis and methodology we used to develop a model of <b>Digital</b> Semiconductor's <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> This model allowed us to characterize the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> costs of historical forecast errors.
