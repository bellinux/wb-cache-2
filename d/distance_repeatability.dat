40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of a noncontact surface profilometry system based on the time-correlated single-photon-counting technique are described. This system has a robust optomechanical design and uses an eye-safe laser that makes it particularly suitable for operation in an uncontrolled industrial environment. The sensitivity of the photon-counting technique permits its use {{on a variety of}} target materials, and its mode of operation does not require the continual presence of an operator. The system described has been optimized for a 1 – 25 -m standoff, has a <b>distance</b> <b>repeatability</b> of < 30 μm, and has a transverse spatial resolution of ~ 60 μm at a 2 -m standoff and ~ 400 μm at a 13 -m standoff...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a compact}} W-band radar module will be presented, design aspects will be {{discussed}} and some measurement results of the finally realized module will be shown. The module features an integrated signal generation, full signal processing and power distribution. The signal generation {{is based on a}} phase-locked loop, optimized for linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave operation. A digital signal processor also works as internal controller and pro-vides the digital interfaces. Due to the integrated power distribution, a single 7 to 15 V power supply is necessary. In contrast to most state-of-the-art W-band systems using waveguides, a liquid crystal polymer based printed circuit board with integrated antenna and dielectric lens is used to realize a very compact module size of 42 mm x 80 mm x 27 mm and low weight of 160 g. The total power consumption is 5 W, the radio frequency output power is 3 dBm and the linear frequency modulated contimuous-wave radar bandwidth is 14 GHz. The evaluated <b>distance</b> measurement <b>repeatability</b> of the module is 5 ppm (5 µm deviation per meter target distance) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{miniaturized}} D-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) {{radar sensor}} with 48 -GHz bandwidth (32. 8 %, 122 - 170 GHz) {{and a high}} measurement rate of > 1 kHz for multi-target vibration measurements is presented. The sensor {{is based on a}} SiGe transceiver monolithic microwave integrated circuit manufactured via Infineon's B 7 HF 200 bipolar production technology with an fT of 170 GHz and fmax of 250 GHz. Gilbert cell, push-pull, and varactor-based doubler concepts on manufactured chips are compared, and the most promising signal source is embedded into a transceiver chip, which forms the main component of the presented radar sensor. The maximum output power of the system is ≈ - 10 dBm and a phase noise of ≈ - 80 dBc/Hz is achieved. Measurements are provided to demonstrate the sensor characteristics and show the promising results of FMCW radar in highest precision distance and multi-target vibration measurement applications. Due to the covered wide bandwidth, a range resolution of 5. 88 mm is achieved (- 6 -dB width, Tukey window). The sensor's <b>distance</b> measurement <b>repeatability</b> is 290 nm (65 nm with 10 × averaging and 0. 5 -m target distance), and the distance measurement accuracy is m for a target in 65 -cm distance moving 1 cm.

40|$|For {{three months}} in 1970, two Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) laser {{tracking}} systems were {{used to try to}} detect the motion of the pole of rotation of the earth. More than two hundred passes of the Beacon Explorer C spacecraft were observed as it passed between the two stations, and these data were used to determine the orbital inclination of the spacecraft. The analysis required the accurate determination of the relative positions of the two tracking stations and the identification of the perturbations to the spacecraft orbit, in particular, those due to the gravitational fields of the earth, sun, and moon and those caused by the solid-earth tides. The results to date indicate that the GSFC laser systems can determine interstation <b>distances</b> with a <b>repeatability</b> of about 25 cm and that a new value of the Love number k that represents the distortion of the earth's gravity field caused by the tidal deformation of the earth is 0. 35 plus or minus 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} genetic and genomic {{resources}} available makes the mouse a powerful {{model for the}} genetic dissection of complex traits. Because accurate, high-throughput phenotypic characterisation {{is crucial to the}} success of such endeavours, we recently developed an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system with extended depth range scanning capability for measuring ocular component dimensions in mice. In order to test whether the accuracy and reproducibility of our OCT system was sufficient for gene mapping studies, we carried out an experiment designed to estimate the heritability of mouse ocular component dimensions. High-resolution, two dimensional tomograms were obtained for both eyes of 11 pairs of 8  week-old outbred MF 1 mice. Subsequently, images were obtained when their offspring were aged 8  weeks. Biometric data were extracted after image segmentation, reconstruction of the geometric shape of each surface, and calculation of intraocular <b>distances.</b> The <b>repeatability</b> of measurements was evaluated for 12 mice scanned on consecutive days. Heritability estimates were calculated using variance components analysis. Sets of tomograms took ∼ 2  s to acquire. Biometric data could be obtained for 98 % of the 130 eyes scanned. The 95 % limits of repeatability ranged from ± 6 to ± 16  μm for the axial ocular component dimensions. The heritability of the axial ocular components was 0. 6 - 0. 8, except for corneal thickness, which had a heritability not significantly different from zero. In conclusion, axial ocular component dimensions are highly heritable in mice, as they are in humans. OCT with extended depth range scanning can be used to rapidly phenotype individual mice with sufficient accuracy and precision to permit gene mapping studies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The University of Newcastle (UoN) {{conducted}} {{field trials}} in July 2014 {{to measure the}} peak incident pressure (Pi), impulse (Ii) and time of positive phase duration (td) following the detonation of different masses of the Plastic Explosive No # 4 (PE 4). A novel aspect of these field trials was the repeatability of tests. A variety of spherical masses of PE 4 were detonated (in free air) with the following variables: Explosive mass (M) of PE 4 ranged between 0. 02 kg and 1. 8 kg. There were fifteen different masses in total.; There were four blasts of each similar mass; thus, 60 blasts were fired in total; The distance (R) between each explosive's centre and any blast-gauge was constant, such that R = 0. 882 m; The variety of Mass (M) and Range (R) resulted in different Scaled Distances (Z), from 0. 65 m/kg 1 / 3 to 3. 07 m/kg 1 / 3. There were fifteen different scaled distances, for both pressure and impulse. Eight pressure gauges collected data during each blast, and at each scaled <b>distance.</b> Consequently, this <b>repeatability</b> of testing allowed the mean and variance of blast load parameters to be quantified, {{with a view to}} better characterise the variability of a blast itself, and other parameters, such as model error variability.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{describe}} {{the performance of}} a non-fluoroscopic fixed-flexion PA radiographic protocol with a new positioning device, developed for the assessment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health Musculoskeletal Study (ELSA-Brasil MSK). Material and methods: A test–retest design including 19 adults (38 knee images) was conducted. Feasibility of the radiographic protocol was assessed by image quality parameters and presence of radioanatomic alignment according to intermargin <b>distance</b> (IMD) values. <b>Repeatability</b> was assessed for IMD and joint space width (JSW) measured at three different locations. Results: Approximately 90 % of knee images presented excellent quality. Frequencies of nearly perfect radioanatomic alignment (IMD ≤ 1 mm) ranged from 29 % to 50 %, and satisfactory alignment was found in up to 71 % and 76 % of the images (IMD ≤ 1. 5 mm and ≤ 1. 7 mm, respectively). Repeatability analyses yielded the following results: IMD [SD of mean difference = 1. 08; coefficient of variation (%CV) = 54. 68 %; intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (95 %CI) = 0. 59 (0. 34 – 0. 77) ]; JSW [SD of mean difference = 0. 34 – 0. 61; %CV = 4. 48 %– 9. 80 %; ICC (95 %CI) = 0. 74 (0. 55 – 0. 85) – 0. 94 (0. 87 – 0. 97) ]. Adequately reproducible measurements of IMD and JSW were found in 68 % and 87 % of the images, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the difficulty in achieving consistent radioanatomic alignment between subsequent radiographs in terms of IMD, the protocol produced highly repeatable JSW measurements when these were taken at midpoint and 10 mm from the medial extremity of the medial tibial plateau. Therefore, measurements of JSW at these locations can be considered adequate for the assessment of knee OA in ELSA-Brasil MSK...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Anthropometry is {{the science}} {{responsible}} {{for measuring the}} weight, size, and proportions of the human body, providing valuable and objective insights into how to characterize phenotypic variation and dysmorphology. Among the newer methods for facial analysis, the stereophotogrammetry technique has shown excellent results given its use {{of a group of}} fast cameras that photograph subjects from multiple angles. Objective: The aims of the present study were: (1) to analyze the facial profile of a group of healthy young Brazilian adults, between 18 and 30 years of age, (2) to define common facial values among the subjects, (3) to create a database of facial measurements of a portion of this young healthy Brazilian population to be used in future works, and (4) to test the precision and repeatability of the Vectra M 3 ® equipment. Material and method: Sixty healthy young Brazilian adults participated in the study, 30 males and 30 females. Temporary craniometrical landmarks were performed in soft tissue, and those subjects underwent image capturing by the stereophotogrammetry technique. Thirty landmarks were used to take the measurements (in mm) of 35 <b>distances.</b> The equipment <b>repeatability</b> was tested in 20 % of the sample (i. e., 12 subjects). Result: The values {{between the first and second}} acquisitions were statistically (p< 0. 05) similar for all 35 distances analyzed. The findings allowed the creation of a reliable database containing facial distances of a portion of the young healthy Brazilian population. In addition, the distances Tr-N, N-Sn, Ls-Sto, Sto-Li, En[r]-En[l] and Prn-Sn were not statistically different for the group of men (GM) and the group of women (GW), while the other 29 distances were significantly greater in GM.
