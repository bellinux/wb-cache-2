50|$|Careful daily washing of the eyelids {{seems to}} prevent blepharitis. A simple routine is to wash each eyelid for 30 seconds twice a day, using a clean <b>face</b> <b>flannel</b> {{with a single}} drop of nonirritant soap (e.g. baby shampoo) and ample water.|$|E
50|$|Examples include Roger Moore visiting David Bowie at Christmas {{in order}} to give him a <b>face</b> <b>flannel</b> as a present. A game of Monopoly between the celebs. Michael Caine trying to {{instruct}} Dean the builder on how to build him a kidney shaped swimming pool, and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards running the local corner shop.|$|E
5000|$|A towel, it says, {{is about}} the most massively useful thing an {{interstellar}} hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid {{the gaze of the}} Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, <b>face</b> <b>flannel,</b> soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have [...] "lost." [...] What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.Hence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in [...] "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." [...] (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) Douglas Adams ...|$|E
50|$|The Wombles were merchandised in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. Stuffed toys, {{along with}} stationery, stickers, small figurines, bath soap, night lights, lamp shades, {{chocolate}} bars, gelatin pudding kits, posters, games, shirts, badges (buttons), cloth patches, and other items. The {{revival of the}} series in the late 1990s brought with it another wave of merchandise which included lunch boxes, umbrellas, <b>flannels</b> (<b>face</b> cloths), hot water bottle covers, slippers, a Steiff doll, {{and a set of}} postage stamps for Alderney, a Channel Island that served as the name for one of the Wombles and the home of Beresford until her death. More recently, the Wombles were part of a set of UK postage stamps honouring classic British children's TV programs.|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} of unrobing had been simultaneous. Marmaduke {{appeared in a}} suit of plain, neat black; Monsieur Le Quoi in a coat of snuff- color, covering a vest of embroidery, with breeches, and silk stockings, and buckles—that were commonly thought to be of paste. Major Hartmann wore a coat of sky-blue, with large brass buttons, a club wig, and boots; and Mr. Richard Jones had set off his dapper little form in a frock of bottle-green, with bullet-buttons, by one of which the sides were united over his well-rounded waist, opening above, so as to show a jacket of red cloth, with an undervest of <b>flannel,</b> <b>faced</b> with green velvet, and below, so as to exhibit a pair of buckskin breeches, with long, soiled, white top-boots, and spurs; one of the latter a little bent, from its recent attacks on the stool.|$|R

60|$|It was a {{damp and}} dark December night, {{six years after}} the {{departure}} of the brig Joanna. The wind was from the sea, and brought up a fishy mist which mopped the <b>face</b> like moist <b>flannel.</b> Joanna had prayed her usual prayer for the absent ones with more fervour and confidence than she had felt for months, and had fallen asleep about eleven. It must have been between one and two when she suddenly started up. She had certainly heard steps in the street, and the voices of Shadrach and her sons calling {{at the door of the}} grocery shop. She sprang out of bed, and, hardly knowing what clothing she dragged on herself; hastened down Emily's large and carpeted staircase, put the candle on the hall-table, unfastened the bolts and chain, and stepped into the street. The mist, blowing up the street from the Quay, hindered her seeing the shop, although it was so near; but she had crossed to it in a moment. How was it? Nobody stood there. The wretched woman walked wildly up and down with her bare feet--there was not a soul. She returned and knocked with all her might at the door which had once been her own--they might have been admitted for the night, unwilling to disturb her till the morning.|$|R
