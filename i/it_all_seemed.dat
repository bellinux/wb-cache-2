[...] "I was only 21 at the time, and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> like a dream," [...] Laucke recalled. He founded Trio3 with Sayyd Abdul Al-Khabyyr and Pauline Vaillancourt in 1977, and the D'Addario strings-manufacturing company became his sponsor.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{criticized the}} episode in his review, writing, [...] "It's just {{not all that}} satisfying. After endless weeks of stick-beating and the events of last week, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> a little too tidy," [...] and {{additionally}} called Arya's story [...] "anticlimactic." [...] However, Egner also praised the episode's continuation with the King's Landing story, {{as well as the}} follow up with Sandor Clegane and the Brotherhood Without Banners. TV Guides Damian Holbrook criticized as implausible the fact that Arya, after being stabbed multiple times in the previous episode by the Waif, was able to outrun and kill her faster, stronger nemesis in this episode. Hanh Nguyen of Indiewire also felt the Riverrun sequence ended in an anticlimactic fashion as well.|$|E
500|$|During {{his speeches}} to the crowds, he {{emphasized}} the theme [...] "A New Birth of Freedom" [...] using phrases associated with Lincoln such as [...] "better angels" [...] and [...] "a new declaration of independence". Obama referred to patriotic forebearers {{in his speech}} when he reminded the crowds that [...] "we should never forget {{that we are the}} heirs of that first band of patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew." [...] Thousands of well‑wishers gathered at various points along the train route taking pictures, cheering and waving American flags and homemade signs, with Obama reciting his trademark rejoinder [...] "Iloveyou back" [...] to the enthusiastic crowds. The one-day train tour concluded at Union Station in Washington,D.C.|$|E

500|$|Titled Return to the Planet of the Apes, {{the project}} was put on fast track and almost entered pre-production. Rick Baker was hired to design the {{prosthetic}} makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score. Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role. [...] "I can't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt knowing that I, Adam Rifkin, {{was going to be}} resurrecting the Planet of the Apes. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> too good to be true. I soon found out it was." [...] Days before the film was to commence pre-production, new studio executives arrived at Fox, which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio. Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts. The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a Renaissance. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci-type character they had written for him. However, the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall's involvement in the series, and Jackson turned his attention back to Heavenly Creatures.|$|E
500|$|The first {{televised}} {{advertisement for}} Captain America: The Winter Soldier aired during Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney paid over $4 million per 30-second spot. The Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The clip promoting the April 4 release had a recognizably melancholy tone as Chris Evans' patriotic hero grapples with the moral ambiguities {{of the modern}} age." [...] Also in February, Gameloft announced that a mobile video game, titled Captain America: The Winter Soldier – The Official Game, would be released {{in conjunction with the}} release of the film in late March 2014 for iOS and Android platforms. A few days later General Motors announced that Chevrolet partnered with Marvel Entertainment and provided a specially designed Corvette Stingray C7 for use by the Black Widow in the film. The vehicle debuted at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show, where fans received limited-edition Captain America comic books. Evans was named the grand marshal of the 2014 Daytona 500 to promote the film's release. Later in the month, a 30-second television spot received [...] "a lot of attention on social media" [...] for a line featured in the clip. The line, which was said by Captain America, suggests that Nick Fury would die in the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> [...] "a bit too obvious", noting the fact that Jackson, who plays Fury, is reprising the role in , although pointing out that it could be in a postmortem flashback appearance.|$|E
500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E
