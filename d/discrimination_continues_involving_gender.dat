When the newly elected Peruvian members of parliament Hilaria Supa Huamán and María Sumire swore their oath of office in Quechua—for {{the first time in the}} history of Peru in an indigenous language—the Peruvian parliamentary president Martha Hildebrandt and {{the parliamentary}} officer Carlos Torres Caro refused their acceptance.|$|R

500|$|Although racial <b>discrimination</b> <b>continued</b> in England, {{this case}} {{was the first to}} {{challenge}} such practices in court. Critics regard it as a milestone in British racial equality in demonstrating that black people had legal recourse against some forms of racism. According to Mason, it [...] "was one of the key milestones along the road {{to the creation of the}} Race Relations Act of 1965." ...|$|R
50|$|White <b>discrimination</b> <b>continued</b> {{for more}} than five years after racially {{segregated}} schools became illegal under Brown v. Board of Education. Southern states had done nothing to integrate schools, and Negro schools were even being closed down. After a poll taken in 1959, 78% of white parents voted to continue segregated schools, and the Orleans Parish School Board declared it would only consider the opinions of the whites.|$|R
5000|$|When the King of Hawaii {{visited the}} CBT trading floor on January 14, 1875, the traders in the pits {{began to sing}} a song titled [...] "The King of Cannibal Island".

To this day brokers and trading bits remain as venues where racism and <b>discrimination</b> <b>continue</b> to exist - regardless of management attempts to stop this behavior.|$|R
50|$|<b>Discrimination</b> <b>continued</b> {{well into}} the newly formed Turkish Republic. In the {{aftermath}} of the Sheikh Said rebellion, the Assyrian Orthodox church was subjected to harassment by Turkish authorities, on the grounds that some Assyrians allegedly collaborated with the rebelling Kurds. Consequently, mass deportations took place and Patriarch Mar Ignatius Elias III was expelled from Mor Hananyo Monastery which was turned into a Turkish barrack. The patriarchal seat was then transferred to Homs temporarily.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, the {{neighbouring}} community of Westdale was built. As only white, Protestant people {{were allowed to}} buy property in Westdale, Jews, Catholics, Slavs and people of colour who {{wanted to live in}} West Hamilton had no choice but Ainslie Wood. Westdale’s restrictive title covenants held sway until the 1950s, with accusations of <b>discrimination</b> <b>continuing</b> for decades afterwards. In Ainslie Wood, minorities were welcome; today, Ainslie Wood is still a diverse community.|$|R
50|$|Societal <b>discrimination</b> <b>continues</b> against Tuareg servile caste members (éklan / Ikelan in Tamasheq, Bouzou in Hausa, Bella in Songhai). Often these castes formed {{distinct}} settled communities traditionally {{bonded to}} semi-nomadic Tuareg aristocratic castes. Hereditary servitude relationships between certain ethnic groups continue {{in some places}} to the present day. Members of hereditary Tuareg servile communities reported {{that they have not}} benefited from equal education opportunities and were deprived of civil liberties by other groups and castes.|$|R
5|$|Africans who did {{not have}} the right to vote after the South African War protested racial {{discrimination}} on 16 December 1910. Other protests against the government dealing with racial <b>discrimination</b> <b>continued</b> to be held on 16 December. In 1929, 1930 and 1934, anti-pass demonstrations were held by the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) on that day.

25|$|Religious antisemitism, {{also known}} as anti-Judaism, is {{antipathy}} towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by conversion to the official or right religion. However, in some cases <b>discrimination</b> <b>continues</b> after conversion, {{as in the case}} of Christianized Marranos or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.|$|R
50|$|Elisabeth Kelan is {{a leading}} scholar on gender, generations and {{leadership}} in organizations. The Times described her as an up-and-coming management thinker.

40|$|Sex <b>discrimination</b> <b>continues</b> {{to operate}} in the working {{environment}} of college athletics. Female coaches experience bias both because of their sex and the intersections of gender stereotypes with stereotypes about women of color, lesbians, and aging. The law continues to be a leverage to challenge barriers to women’s leadership in college sports. This Article provides an overview of the relevant legal protections in three cases brought by coaches Beth Burns, Tracey Griesbaum, and Shannon Miller. Their cases expose discrimination and the double standard related to the value of female coaches’ success...|$|R
40|$|By {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, the Dutch Jews enjoyed {{complete}} freedom of religion, but economic discrimination left the majority of them penniless. Moreover, a bitter conflict broke out between the enlightened and the orthodox Jews, leading to a fierce controversy and the foundation of a separate congegration. In spite of the emancipation decree of 2 September 1796, <b>discrimination</b> <b>continued</b> and only slowly declined in the course of the next century. This book offers a new and original analysis of both the political, economical, religious and literary aspects of this fascinating and tumultuous era...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} age {{discrimination}} in the workforce has acquired extra salience because {{of the growth of}} policies designed to prolong labour force participation beyond the conventional retirement age at around 60.

This article reports on a current project on age discrimination, discussing in particular the research ethics issues and bureaucratic controls encountered in the research process.

50|$|Marriage was {{restricted}} to households of equal social standing (分限), which made selection a crucial, painstaking process. Although Confucian ethics encouraged people to marry outside their own group, limiting the search to a local community remained {{the easiest way to}} ensure an honorable match. Approximately one-in-five marriages in pre-modern Japan occurred between households that were already related. Outcast communities such as the Burakumin could not marry outside of their caste, and marriage <b>discrimination</b> <b>continued</b> even after an 1871 edict abolished the caste system, well into the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 {{in order}} to discuss the {{admission}} of Jews into England. Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish synagogues and burial grounds was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for Jews in England improved in that they could no longer be prosecuted if caught worshipping, yet <b>discrimination</b> <b>continued.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Dalits of India were on {{the bottom}} of the Indian caste system for millennia. In Hinduism, there are four varnas (classes) and in that system, the Dalits are below the lowest of them.

Untouchability was outlawed in 1950, but despite the laws, <b>discrimination</b> <b>continues</b> today.|$|R

40|$|LGBTQ <b>discrimination</b> <b>continues</b> to {{be common}} on college campuses. While {{a number of}} studies have {{examined}} blatant victimization among students, little attention has been given to LGBTQ microaggressions. In this study, we examine both blatant victimization and microaggressions and their association with psychological distress among LGBTQ college students (N= 497) and look at whether gender identity moderates these relationships. Both forms of discrimination are associated with lower self-esteem and greater stress and anxiety. Victimization is more negatively associated with self-esteem among trans* students. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing both blatant and subtle forms of discrimination targeting LGBTQ college students...|$|R
