5|$|John Cage and Marcel Duchamp were {{significant}} influences on Ono's art. She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence and met {{him through his}} student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research: She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand and <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Tracy left Ripon, {{and began}} classes at AADA in April 1922. He was deemed fit to {{progress}} {{to the senior}} class, allowing him to join the academy stock company. Tracy made <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> debut in October 1922, in a play called The Wedding Guests, and then his Broadway debut three months later playing a wordless robot in R.U.R. He graduated from AADA in March 1923.|$|E
5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description of <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E

5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social irony. <b>His</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} was in {{development}} and discussions were taking place as early as September 2012, the recording did not start until the Spring of 2013, being delayed by Gaga's hip surgery and cancellation of her Born This Way Ball tour. The recording took place over a year in New York City, and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. Along with Evans, jazz trumpeter Brian Newman, a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album with <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City based jazz quintet. Tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and flautist Paul Horn were also enlisted as musicians.|$|E
5|$|Despite the polls, Douglas was {{confident}} that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory, {{so much so that}} she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59percent to 41. Of California's 58counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> district.|$|E

5|$|During the {{interviews}} and in later correspondence, Josephine and Wyatt {{went to great}} lengths to keep her name out of Lake's book. Lake wrote Earp that he planned to send portions of the book to <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> agent, but Earp objected because he wanted to read it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein {{appeared}} as himself in several television series, contributed mixes to and portrayed a playable {{character in the}} video game DJ Hero, and filmed a cameo appearance for Iron Man 2. Goldstein hosted the 2009 MTV drug intervention series Gone Too Far, and {{he appeared to be}} struggling with his addiction during filming. On August 28, 2009, he was found dead in <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City apartment from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory by his sister, and Iron Man 2, which was released in 2010, was dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|Hazelwood's driver's license {{had been}} {{suspended}} or revoked three {{times by the}} state of New York for alcohol violations since 1984. At the time of the Exxon Valdez incident, <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> state driving privileges were suspended {{as a result of a}} driving under the influence arrest on September 13, 1988. He entered a rehabilitation program in 1985 at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, New York. Following rehabilitation he received 90 days of leave to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, but it is not clear if he attended during that leave.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January 2016, {{two days}} after his 69th {{birthday}} {{and the release of}} the album Blackstar, Bowie died from liver cancer in <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City apartment. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but had not made the news of his illness public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with the singer on his Off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that Bowie was unable to attend rehearsals due to the progression of the disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E
5|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{tracked the}} final mixes {{of the songs}} at Caribbean Sound Basin. Its main studio used a 64-channel SSL 4064 G mixing console, the {{secondary}} studio used a 48-track Neve console with flying faders, and its third studio used an Amek BC2 console. The group mostly used the older Neve console. In tracking the songs, they started with a drum machine groove as a basic track and recorded it. The parts recorded with live instrumentation were then added to the mix. Live drums and horn sections were included to attain the sound of performing live. Sons of Soul was subsequently mastered by engineer Herb Powers at <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City studio P.M. Entertainment.|$|E

5|$|In 2002–03, off-ice {{problems}} {{dominated the}} headlines. The Senators {{filed for bankruptcy}} on January 9, 2003, after {{a long history of}} debt. They continued regular season play after getting some emergency financing from the NHL. Despite the off-ice problems, Ottawa won the Presidents' Trophy, finishing with a franchise-record 113 points, making them the first Canadian team to win it since the Calgary Flames in 1989. This was also the highest finish by an Ottawa team in 77 years (since the original Senators finished first overall in 1926). In the 2003 playoffs, they defeated Yashin and <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers before coming within one game of making it into the Finals, falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils.|$|E
5|$|In the 1670s, part of Donck's land {{passed to}} Frederick Philipse, who {{was rewarded with}} , {{including}} the lower river, for declaring his loyalty to the new British rulers of New Netherlands. Philipse named the manor Philipsborough and ran it as a quasi-feudal farm, hiring tenants to work the land. Around 1682, he built Philipse Manor Hall, a mansion along the Saw Mill River that is today a National Historic Landmark. When Philipse died around 1702, the manor was divided between his son Adolph and grandson Frederick II. In 1750, his great-grandson Frederick III inherited the whole property and moved from <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City townhouse to the manor hall, previously used as the family's summer home. Frederick sat in the Colonial Assembly, {{where he was a}} strong supporter of the British government that had given his family everything it owned, but he was primarily interested in managing the land. He improved the manor hall and worked to attract tenant farmers to the land. The family was known for its relaxed approach to its tenants, and the farm was very profitable.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{returned}} to San Francisco {{with his wife}} to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and {{taking part in a}} family business. He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and took part in the social activity of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage stood up for law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against <b>his</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> publisher regarding unpaid royalties.|$|E
