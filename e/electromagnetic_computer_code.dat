A conceptually novel design comprising a helical thread of the same pitch and inner diameter in a cylindrical waveguide also were calculated using the MAFIA code. The helical-groove structure exhibits a smaller bandwidth but {{at a much higher}} frequency range than the traditional helical structure for similar physical dimensions.

40|$|A Damped Detuned Structure (DDS) for CLIC main linac {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} the present baseline design which is based on heavy damping. A first prototype, CLIC_DDS_A, for high power tests has been already designed and is under construction. It is also foreseen to design a further prototype, CLIC_DDS_B, to test both the wakefield suppression and high power performances. Wakefield calculations for DDS are, in the early design stage, based on single infinitely periodic cells. Though cell-to-cell interaction is taken into account to calculate the wakefields, it is important to study full structure properties using computational tools. In particular this is fundamental for defining the input parameters for the HOM coupler that is crucial for the performances of DDS. In the following a full analysis of wakefields and impedances based on simulations conducted with finite difference based <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>computer</b> <b>code</b> GdfidL will be presented.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} simulation code MAFIA {{was used}} to compute the cold-test parameters - frequency-phase dispersion, beam on-axis interaction impedance, and attenuation - for two types of traveling-wave tube (TWT) slow-wave circuits. The potential for this <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>computer</b> modeling <b>code</b> to reduce the time and cost of TWT development is demonstrated by {{the high degree of}} accuracy achieved in calculating these parameters. Generalized input files were developed for ferruled coupled-cavity and TunneLadder slow-wave circuits. These files make it easy to model circuits of arbitrary dimensions.

40|$|Data {{obtained}} from UHF radar observation of direct-lightning strikes to the NASA F- 106 B aircraft {{have indicated that}} most of the 690 strikes acquired during direct-strike lightning tests were triggered by the aircraft. As an aid in understanding the triggered lightning process, a wide bandwidth electric field measuring system was designed for the F- 106 B by implementing a clamped-detection signal processing concept originated at the Air Force Cambridge Research Lab in 1953. The detection scheme combines the signals from complementary stator pairs clamped to zero bolts at the exact moment when each stator pair is maximally shielded by the rotor, a process that restores the dc level lost by the charge amplifier. The system was implemented with four shutter-type field mills located at strategic points on the aircraft. The bandwidth of the system was determined in the laboratory to be from dc to over 100 Hz, whereas past designs had upper limits of 10 to 100 Hz. To obtain the undisturbed electric field vector and total aircraft charge, the airborne field mill system is calibrated by using techniques involving results from ground and flight calibrations of the F- 106 B, laboratory tests of a metallized model, and a finite difference time-domain <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>computer</b> <b>code...</b>|$|E
40|$|Enhancing the {{confinement}} {{of primary}} electrons within the plasma in a discharge chamber of an ion thruster improves plasma ionization and consequently the thruster 2 ̆ 7 s performance. This work computationally calculates the location, position, and {{orientation of the}} permanent magnets that provide a ring-cusp magnetic field that maximizes electron confinement in an axi-symmetric cylindrical aluminum-wall discharge chamber. Small samarium cobalt magnets are circumferentially arranged in a ring around the front, side, or {{back wall of the}} chamber. The generated ring-cusp magnetic field for any specified magnet configuration is calculated using MAXWELL 2 D, a two dimensional <b>electromagnetic</b> field simulation <b>computer</b> <b>code.</b> For various magnet configurations, PRIMA, a particle-in-cell <b>computer</b> <b>code</b> modified by Mahalingam and Menart, is used to model the trajectory of the primary electrons in the magnetic field. The confinement length, the length of time an electron is retained within the chamber, is output by PRIMA, and it is the parameter used to determine the performance of the magnet configurations surveyed. The performance of various magnet ring pairs are studied and guidelines on the location, position, and orientation of the magnet rings are obtained. These guidelines are then combined to give complex ring-cusp magnet ring arrangements on a fixed size discharge chamber. For three complex arrangements having three magnet rings, a decrease in the chambers confinement ability is seen when the applied guidelines are slightly violated. This observed decrease validates the guidelines deduced in this work...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop <b>computer</b> <b>code</b> for airfoil aerodynamics analysis. The flow assumed to be incompressible and pass through a streamline body at relatively high Reynolds number. As result the flow domain around the airfoil can be divided into two regions, namely the flow region closed to the airfoil surface and the flow region relatively far away from the surface which the viscosity effects can be ignored. The first flow region is known as Boundary layer region while the second flow region is called as inviscid flow domain. The inviscid flow problem can be solved by use a Panel Method. While the boundary layer region can be solved by two approaches depended on the governing equation had been used to represent the flow behavior inside the boundary layer. For boundary layer analysis, the present work used the combined Thwaites - Head's method and Keller Box Method. As result two <b>computer</b> <b>codes</b> had been developed.
