The TriPort speakers leave more space inside the <b>ear</b> <b>cups</b> for passive attenuation and allows for reduced headband force. This is mainly since the porting technology diminished the need for more passive noise reducing techniques such as clamping force and extra padding. But these headphones do have more passive noise reduction than the QC2’s giving them better noise reducing abilities with the same active noise reduction technology.|$|E

Virtual surround headsets tend to have higher-end driver components which experts and consumers believe to be more durable, as well as have larger speakers which deliver more powerful and dynamic sound quality. Virtual surround headset achieves surround sound by using external or internal pre-amplifier or mix-amplifier modules, {{as well as several}} different algorithms, to convert stereo or surround sound signals into surround sound.

40|$|Personnel {{who work}} on the flight deck of an {{aircraft}} carrier are exposed to extreme levels of jet engine noise often in excess of 140 decibels (dB). The current circumaural hearing protective devices (CAHPD) employed by flight deck crewmen are inadequate for the level of protection required for these extreme levels of noise. Fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer composite (FRPC) materials such as aramid fibers used in body armor, have high theoretical values of acoustic impedance due to a fundamentally high modulus of elasticity and may offer a superior level of hearing protection over original equipment (OE) thermoplastic CAHPDs. The objective of this project was to measure and evaluate the attenuation of CAHPD’s constructed from FRPC materials.

50|$|Acoustic {{earmuffs}}, {{also known}} as <b>ear</b> defenders: <b>cups</b> lined with sound-deadening material, like thermal earmuffs and headphones in appearance, which are worn as hearing protection. These may be carried on a head-band or clipped onto the sides of a hard hat, for use on construction sites.

40|$|Headsets for speech {{communication}} {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications. The basic idea is to allow hands-free speech communication, leaving both hands available for other tasks. One typical headset application is aircraft pilot communication. The pilot must be able to communicate with personnel on the ground and at the same time use both hands to control the aircraft. Communication headsets usually consist of a pair of headphones and a microphone attached with an adjustable boom. Headphone design varies widely between different manufacturers and models. In its simplest form, the headphone has an open construction providing little or no attenuation of the environmental noise. In headsets designed for noisy environments, the headphones are mounted in <b>ear</b> <b>cups</b> with cushions that provide some attenuation. The microphone is primarily designed to pick up the speech signal, but if the headset is used in a noisy environment, the background noise will also be picked up and transmitted together with the speech. As a consequence, speech intelligibility at the receive end will be reduced, possibly to zero. To increase the speech-to-noise ratio, it is common to use a directional microphone that has a lower sensitivity to sound incident from other directions than the frontal direction. In addition to this, the microphone electronics are usually equipped with a gate function that completely shuts off the microphone signal if its level drops below a threshold value. The purpose of the gate is to open the channel for transmission only when a speech signal is present. Headsets are frequently used in noisy environments where they suffer from problems of speech intelligibility. Even if an ear-cup type headset is used, the attenuation is relatively poor for low frequencies. Low frequency noise has a masking effect on speech, which significantly reduces the speech intelligibility. Several cases have been reported in which the sound level of the communication signal was increased to hazardous levels by the user to overcome this low frequency masking effect [1, 2]. Ear exposure to the communication system resulted in hearing damage, such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis...|$|E

The study, Ear Molding in Newborn Infants with Auricular Deformities (2010), reported the efficacy of the EarWell device in correcting deformities of the antihelix, the triangular fossa, the helical rim, and an over-prominent conchal-mastoid angle, in 831 ear deformities, in 488 newborn infants who featured: (i) prominent <b>ear,</b> (<b>cup</b> ear): 373 <b>ears</b> (45%); (ii) lop ear: 224 ears (27%); mixed-type ear deformities: 83 ears (10%) all with associated conchal crus; Stahl’s ear: 66 ears (8.0%); helical rim deformity: 58 ears (7.0%); conchal crus: 25 ears (3.0%); and cryptotia: 2 ears (0.2%). Bilateral deformities (both ears) occurred in 340 patients (70%); unilateral deformities occurred in 148 patients (30%); and 58 infant ears (34 patients) were corrected with the EarWell system, with a 90 per cent rate of successful correction. Application of the tissue-molding device at 1-week after the child’s birth proved most efficacious in achieving a successful correction, because, when the correction was initiated at 3-weeks from birth, the lessened malleability of the cartilage and tissues of the ear reduced the successful deformity correction rate to 50 per cent.|$|R

40|$|Earing and {{thinning}} {{are often}} the major manufacturing problems occur during deep drawing processes. Thinning occurs when a section of a part undergoes localised deformation, and earing is the formation of wavy edges at the open end of a drawn part that must be trimmed at final stage leading to higher manufacturing costs. The anisotropic mechanical behavior of the initial sheet metal is the predominant source of thinning and earing problems. This work aims to establish {{a relationship between the}} properties of a sheet blank and thinning and earing issues during deep drawing by studying the evolution of crystallographic texture throughout the sheet forming process using crystal plasticity simulation modelling and experimental measurements. Firstly, to understand the impact of individual texture components on the mechanical properties of the material, Lankford coefficients for FCC crystal structure during uni-axial tensile loading were analysed using Visco-Plastic Self Consistent (VPSC) model. Subsequently, Finite Element (FE) analyses were carried out to study the effect of initial state of the material on earing and thinning issues occurred during deep drawing. It was observed that the existing Cube and Goss texture components evolved during annealing heat treatments were responsible for the generation of troughs along 45 ° to the rolling direction (RD) and peaks along the transverse direction (TD), respectively. Optical 3 D scanning of a manufactured part confirmed that earing is less prominent in the case of as-rolled and shear-formed condition due to weakening of Cube and Goss texture components. Furthermore, a combination of FE simulation and the VPSC model has been used to simulate texture evolution during a standard <b>earing</b> <b>cupping</b> test at various points of interest. The results of texture evolution simulations were compared to those measured experimentally by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and a good qualitative agreement is achieved...|$|R

40|$|During deep-drawing, {{two issues}} {{manifest}} themselves that {{are due to}} normal and planar anisotropy in the sheet. These are a dependence of the Limiting Draw Ratio (LDR) on the average thinning ratio (R-value), and a dependence of ear formation and thinning around the circumference on the variation of R-value in {{the plane of the}} sheet. The quadratic (1948 Hill) yield surface has been applied to these issues and it has been demonstrated that there are numerous higher exponent yield criteria that may more closely duplicate experimental trends. These predict varying degrees of R-value dependencies of uniaxial yields and strength ratios in multiaxial loading paths. The result of this is that there are sometimes subtle and sometimes substantial differences in the predictions of the various yield surfaces on deep drawing regarding LDR and earing. Additional differences arise due to the way the shear term (45 -degree yield) and the 0 -degree vs. 90 -degree strengths are treated in each criterion. These dependencies (in-plane strengths generated by the yield surfaces) are shown to affect the results of both LDR and <b>earing</b> during <b>cupping.</b> In particular, the 1979 Hosford and 1989 Barlat (Tricomponent) criteria, although identical for the normal anisotropy (planar isotropy) case, are strikingly different for cases where there are differences at 45 degrees and 90 degrees from the rolling direction...|$|R
