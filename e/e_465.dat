40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying {{sensitivity to}} alcohol are incompletely understood. Recent research has highlighted {{the involvement of}} two presynaptic proteins, Munc 18 and Rab 3. We have previously characterised biochemically a number of specific Munc 18 point mutations including an E 466 K mutation that augments a direct Rab 3 interaction. Here the phenotypes of this and other Munc 18 mutations were assessed in alcohol sensitivity and exocytosis using Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that expressing the orthologous E 466 K mutation (unc- 18 <b>E</b> <b>465</b> K) enhanced alcohol sensitivity. This enhancement in sensitivity was surprisingly independent of rab- 3. In contrast unc- 18 R 39 C, which decreases syntaxin binding, enhanced sensitivity to alcohol in a manner requiring rab- 3. Finally, overexpression of R 39 C could suppress partially the reduction in neurotransmitter release in rab- 3 mutant worms, whereas wild-type or <b>E</b> <b>465</b> K mutants showed no rescue. These data indicate that the epistatic interactions between unc- 18 and rab- 3 in modulating sensitivity to alcohol are distinct from interactions affecting neurotransmitter release...|$|E

40|$|The bleomycins (BLMs), tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycin, and zorbamycin (ZBM) {{are members}} of the BLM family of glycopeptide-derived {{antitumor}} antibiotics. The BLM-producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC 15003 and the TLM-producing Streptoalloteichus hindustanus <b>E</b> <b>465</b> - 94 ATCC 31158 both possess at least two self-resistance elements, an N-acetyltransferase and a binding protein. The N-acetyltransferase provides resistance by disrupting the metal-binding domain of the antibiotic that is required for activity, while the binding protein confers resistance by sequestering the metal-bound antibiotic and preventing drug activation via molecular oxygen. We recently established that the ZBM producer, Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC 21892, lacks the N-acetyltransferase resistance gene and that the ZBM-binding protein, ZbmA, is sufficient to confer resistance in the producing strain. To investigate the resistance mechanism attributed to ZbmA, we determined the crystal structures of apo and Cu(II) -ZBM-bound ZbmA at high resolutions of 1. 90 and 1. 65 Å, respectively. A comparison and contrast with other structurally characterized members of the BLM-binding protein family revealed key differences in the protein–ligand binding environment that fine-tunes the ability of ZbmA to sequester metal-bound ZBM and supports drug sequestration as the primary resistance mechanism in the producing organisms of the BLM family of antitumor antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{cell death}} {{programmes}} are counteracted by survival signals during development {{in order to}} maintain the tissue homeostasis. Neuronal differentiation is a mechanism generating functionally integrated neuronal cells from their progenitors. These processes appear to be mediated via activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK and the PI 3 K/PDK 1 /PKB signaling pathways and are associated with a selective increase in protein translation. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is a serine/threonine protein kinase which is claimed to be the critical transducer for several extracellular signals provided by different neurotransmitters, growth factors and hormones that promote phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) activation. PI 3 K is a lipid kinase characterized by its ability to phosphorylate the 3 -OH group in the inositol ring of phospholipids at the inner side of the plasma membrane to generate phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 or PIP 3), which is a potent second messenger. PKB regulation by its activator PDK 1 precisely relies on a PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 binding domain, named Pleckstrin Homology domain (PH-domain). Both PDK 1 and PKB are protein kinases of the AGC family containing PH-domains which mediate their recruitment to the plasma membrane, where PKB is activated by phosphorylation at two regulatory residues, namely Thr 308 at the T-loop by PDK 1, and Ser 473 at the hydrophobic motif by mTORC 2. In fact, PDK 1 was shown to be a master kinase also playing an essential role in the activation of a number of AGC family members by phosphorylating their T-loops by means of a PH domain-independent mechanism. Activated PKB modulates the function of numerous substrates involved in the regulation of cell metabolism, survival, proliferation and growth, which deregulation has consequences in pathologies such as diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration. The crystal structure high resolution of the PDK 1 PH domain revealed that the positivelycharged lateral chain of Lysine at position 465 within the PH domain crystal establishes fundamental interactions with the negatively-charged phosphate groups of PIP 3. Targeted mutagenesis of Lysine 465 to the negatively-charged aminoacid Glutamic acid abolished binding of PDK 1 to PIP 3 by disrupting the phosphoinositide binding pocket. Therefore, it was thought that this mutation could be instrumental in ablating this part of the PDK 1 signaling pathway. In order to analyze the role of the PDK 1 -PIP 3 interaction in vivo, PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> knock-in mice were generated which physiologically express from the endogenous locus a mutant form of PDK 1 incapable of phosphoinositide binding. This knock-in mice model was shown to be a good tool to analyse the contributory role of the PKB signaling pathway to glucose metabolism. The PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> mice were shown to be viable but smaller, with a modest reduction in PKB activity compared with the wild type littermates, and prone to diabetes. The importance of this pathway in tumourogenesis has been highlighted by introducing the PDK 1 PH domain knock-in mutation into cancer-prone PTEN+/- mice, which resulted in the delayed tumour onset, suggesting that even moderate reduction of PKB activity can significantly delay tumour initiation and development. This makes the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> mutant mouse model an excellent tool to explore the contribution of PKB to different human pathologies and to identify downstream substrates that could provide targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, I aimed to use this genetic model to unravel the role of PKB on different aspects of brain development and function. Stereological analysis of embryonic brain sections showed that the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> mice displayed reduced brain size due to a reduction in neuronal cell size rather than cell number, since the number of cortical and hippocampal neuronal populations between PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> and PDK 1 +/+ mice was not significantly different, whereas the volume of the mutant neuronal soma was approximately 80 % of the volume of the wild type neuronal soma. Stimulation of cortical neurons with BDNF induced a robust phosphorylation of Trk receptors followed by the phosphorylation of PKB at Thr 308 in the PDK 1 +/+ cells, which is blunted in the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> neurons, whereas PKB phosphorylation at the mTORC 2 site (Ser 473) proceeded normally in both type of cells. The moderate reduction of PKB activation was not rate-limiting for the phosphorylation of those PKB substrates governing neuronal survival and apoptosis such as FOXO and GSK 3. Then, it was questioned whether such mutation could affect survival responses in primary neuronal cultures. The findings from this study illustrate that the integrity of the PDK 1 PH domain is not essential to support the survival of different embryonic neuronal populations analyzed. Cell viability is compromised after trophic factor deprivation, whilst BDNF treatment rescues cells from death to the same extent in both PDK 1 +/+ and PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> neurons. In contrast, the moderate reduction of PKB activity in the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> neurons markedly reduced phosphorylation of the PRAS 40 and TSC 2 substrates, leading to decreased mTORC 1 /S 6 K activation and also reduced BRSK protein synthesis. The PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> neurons in culture showed reduced neurite outgrowth, delayed polarization and deficient axonogenesis. To establish the possible causal relation between the PKB pathway defects and axon formation, the impact of specific pharmacological treatments with PKB and mTORC 1 inhibitors on neuronal differentiation were assessed, which provided strong evidence that the differentiation defects were due to reduced PKB activity and inefficient activation of the mTORC 1 signaling. Moreover, the overexpression of BRSK isoforms rescued the axonogenesis defects of the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> hippocampal cells. Altogether, these findings illustrate how the binding of PDK 1 to PIP 3 creates a PKB signaling threshold which is sufficient to support survival, but not differentiation of neuronal cells. In this regard, there is increasing evidence that PI 3 K/PDK 1 dependent, PKB independent pathways might be responsible for the control of essential cellular processes, for example cell survival, which rely on other members of the AGC family activated by PDK 1. These other PDK 1 -regulated members of the AGC family include SGK 1, S 6 K and RSK. The activation of these kinases is not dependent on PDK 1 binding to PIP 3 and therefore they should be normally phosphorylated in the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> knock-in mice neurons. However, I observed decreased phosphorylation of the SGK substrate NDRG 1. This study clearly states for the first time, that NDRG 1 is regulated by PKB, at least in neurons. Activation of S 6 K was found also incomplete in the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> E/K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> neurons due to reduced mTORC 1 PKBdependent activation, which could be overcome by nutrients. In fact, the only PDK 1 substrate analyzed that appears to not to be affected by the PDK 1 K <b>465</b> <b>E</b> mutation is RSK, which serves as a control of the specificity of this knock-in mutation. In summary, the data allow to conclude that full activation of PKB is not essential in controlling neuronal survival. In marked contrast, reduced PKB-mediated, mTORC 1 - dependent, BRSK expression resulting from lack of PDK 1 -phosphoinositide binding prevents neuronal differentiation...|$|R

However, the estimation and mechanism of SOC sequestration by P. pubescens forests remain unclear. In this study, the effect of P. pubescens forest distribution with elevation was investigated at two altitude sites in Jian-ou City, Southeast China. SOC storage was estimated and its chemical composition was obtained via 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), chemical classification, and spectral analysis. Results showed that the SOC contents and stocks were significantly higher at the high-altitude site than at the low-altitude site in the entire soil profile (0 - 60 cm). The C contents of the three combined humus forms exhibited similar responses to the elevation change, and all of these forms were higher at the high-altitude site than at the low-altitude site regardless of soil layer. However, the proportions of the three combined humus C showed no significant differences between the two altitudes.

We previously proposed, on the basis of bioinformatics analysis of the tlm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus <b>E</b> <b>465</b> - 94 ATCC 31158, that the tlmK gene is responsible for the attachment of this sugar moiety. We now report that inactivation of tlmK in S. hindustanus abolished TLM A and TLM B production, the resultant ΔtlmK mutant instead accumulated five new metabolites, and introduction of a functional copy of tlmK to the ΔtlmK mutant restored TLM A and TLM B production. Two major metabolites, TLM K- 1 and TLM K- 2, together with three minor metabolites, TLM K- 3, TLM K- 4, and TLM K- 5, were isolated from the ΔtlmK mutant, and their structures were elucidated. These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the previous functional assignment of tlmK to encode a glycosyltransferase and unveil two carbinolamide pseudoaglycones as key intermediates in the TLM biosynthetic pathway. TlmK stabilizes the carbinolamide intermediates by glycosylating their hemiaminal hydroxyl groups, thereby protecting them from hydrolysis during TLM biosynthesis.

There have been continued efforts to develop new BLM analogues in the search for anticancer drugs with better clinical efficacy and lower lung toxicity.

Little information about sequence motifs involved in FV capsid assembly and release is available. The recent analysis of candidate L-domain motifs in PFV Gag identified an evolutionarily conserved YXXL sequence motif {{with a potential}} function in capsid assembly. Here we provide support for the hypothesis that this motif does not function like a conventional L domain, by demonstrating that, unlike the PFV Gag PSAP L-domain motif, it cannot be functionally replaced by heterologous L-domain sequences. Furthermore, mutation of individual amino acids Y 464, I 466, L 467, and L 469, but not <b>E</b> <b>465,</b> to alanine led to reduced particle release and production of noninfectious, aberrant capsid structures, although relative structural protein incorporation and processing were not affected.

Despite similar relative RNA genome incorporation for all mutants, analysis and quantification of particle-associated viral nucleic acids demonstrated defects in genomic reverse transcription for all the noninfectious mutants, a process that, unlike that of orthoretroviruses, {{in the case of}} FVs takes place in the virus-producing cell. In correlation with the reduced infectivity, the G 468 A mutant displayed an intermediate level of genomic reverse transcription.

It was found that HAs pyrograms displayed a more or less marked lignin pattern (i. e., characteristic pyrolytic methoxyphenols assemblages), which was also associated to typical infrared pattern for lignin. These two analysis were used as molecular-level surrogates to establish the balance between complementary mechanisms of soil C sequestration; one group of HAs typically produced major yields of methoxyl-lacking aromatics and a poor yield of alkyl compounds, which suggest efficient cleavage of biomacromolecules and active microbial synthesis and condensation processes, whereas other HAs group yielded upon pyrolysis conspicuous series of methoxyphenols, in some cases accompanied by well-defined alkyl series. The former HAs displayed broadband IR spectra, and showed high optical density and polynuclear quinoid chromophors considered of fungal origin. The IR spectra of the second group displayed lignin and amide intense bands, intense 2920 cm- 1 alkyl stretching band, a low optical density and high <b>E</b> <b>465</b> /E 665 extinction ratio, all indicative of a marked aliphatic character and low macromolecular sizes.

40|$|Imidazole {{glycerol}} phosphate (IGP) synthase is a glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) {{that incorporates}} ammonia derived from glutamine into the unusual nucleotide, PRFAR to form AICAR and IGP.

A refined assay system was developed to establish that Saccharomyces cerevisiae IGP synthase shows a 4, 900 -fold stimulation of glutaminase {{in the presence of}} PRFAR. Competitive inhibitors in the PRFAR active site were shown to upregulate the glutaminase active site over 30 Å away. One of the key structural features of IGP synthase is the transfer of ammonia from the glutaminase site through the (β/α) 8 core of the protein. A quartet of charged residues (R 239, E 293, K 360 and <b>E</b> <b>465)</b> {{at the base of the}} (β/α) 8 barrel functions to exclude water while allowing ammonia to pass. MD simulations of R 239 mutations demonstrated that the core of the barrel becomes flooded with water occluding the passage of ammonia. Simulations of wild-type IGP synthase demonstrated that K 360 undergoes a slight conformational change when ammonia passes the charged quartet then returns to its original conformation. Mutation at K 360 allowed ammonia retrograde motion through the plane of the electrostatic quartet. Kinetic investigations of site-directed mutants revealed that a conserved K 258 residue is key to productive binding and the overall stoichiometry of the reaction. The binding of the ribulosyl phosphate portion of the substrate PRFAR appears to be transduced through reorientation of K 258. We have determined that an interdomain salt bridge between D 359 and K 196 that is 16 Å from the PRFAR active site is a key interaction between the two active sites. Loss of the aspartate abolished the glutaminase activity. Loss of the lysine resulted in a faster turnover of glutamine and an uncoupling of the two half reactions. In other triad GATs, a similar interdomain contact is seen in the same area; a charged residue from the acceptor domain interacts with residues adjacent to the catalytic triad. Thus, the key interaction we have illustrated in IGP synthase may be a common mechanism of reaction coupling in the triad GATs. ...|$|E

Three levels of inulin batter were tested: an unaltered control (515 g brownie mix: 0 g inulin), a first experimental formulation (E 1) (515 g brownie mix: 50 g inulin), and a second experimental formulation (<b>E</b> 2) (<b>465</b> g brownie mix: 50 g inulin). Analysis of extended triangle tests indicated that sensory judges distinguished significant differences between the control brownies and E 1 (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and between the control and E 2 (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). The preference test showed that E 1 was preferred over E 2. The chewiness intensity test revealed no significant differences among the brownie formulations. Hydration brownie properties were investigated by analyzing the moisture content. The control brownies had a significantly higher moisture content than E 2 (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Textural properties of brownies were studied by penetration, compression, and retraction force.

Costs of RVGE were estimated in several studies and were classified into direct and indirect costs, that should be further divided into Health care and social perspective. This study aims to evaluate RVGE hospitalization costs in Sicily, before and after universal mass RV (UMRV) introduction. Methods Cases of RVGE were defined as all hospitalizations with an ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis code of 008. 61 on any diagnosis position among children aged 0 to 59 months. Data were obtained from Hospital discharge records (HDR) of the Health Regional Office from 2009 to 2014. Direct and indirect costs of RVGE hospitalization for health care and social perspective were calculated on data reported in the REVEAL study. RV costs was extrapolated from a budget impact analysis published in 2013 by Vitale et al.

Since it seemed likely that such a hypothetical metabolic form of interaction would be mediated by the maintenance of a high ATP level in the stroma, direct tests for the ATP content in the stroma before and after removal of the epithelium were carried out. ATP determinations were carried out in intact excised corneas obtained from 2 - to 5 -day-old chicks after intraperitoneal injection of 0. 25 ml of Equithesin which caused the death of the animal after 2 to 5 minutes.

The sum of the mean values obtained separately for the stroma and epithelium is thus much lower than the values for the intact tissue. These results did not indicate whether this deficit was due to the loss of ATP fi'om the epithelium, the stroma, or both. Therefore, attempts were made to carry out determinations of ATP in the separated components without loss of ATP.

However, measurements on BC and OC emission factors (EFBC and EFOC) are still scarce, which result in large uncertainties in emission estimates. In this study, a detailed data set of EFBC and EFOC for household coal burning was presented {{on the basis of}} 38 coal/stove combination experiments. These experiments included 13 coals with a wide coverage of geological maturity which were tested in honeycomb-coal-briquette and raw-coal-chunk forms in three typical coal stoves. Averaged values of EFBC are 0. 004 and 0. 007 g/kg for anthracite in briquette and chunk forms and 0. 09 and 3. 05 g/kg for bituminous coal, respectively; EFOC are 0. 06 and 0. 10 g/kg for anthracite and 3. 74 and 5. 50 g/kg for bituminous coal in both forms, respectively. Coal maturity was found {{to be the most important}} influencing factor relative to coal's burning forms and the stove's burning efficiency, and when medium-volatile bituminous coals (MVB) are excluded from use, averaged EFBC and EFOC for bituminous coal decrease by 50 % and 30 %, respectively.

This dense sampling is often expensive and time consuming. One technique {{to reduce the number of}} samples is to define management zones based on information that is collected in the field. Some researchers have demonstrated the importance of the electrical properties of soil in defining management zones. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the apparent soil electrical conductivity and soil properties in mountainous areas of coffee production. The electrical conductivity of soil was evaluated at soil depths ranging from 0. 00 - 0. 20 m (EC 20) and 0. 00 - 0. 40 m (EC 40) using a portable meter. The mean values of EC 20 and EC 40 were 1. 80 mS m- 1 and 1. 22 mS m- 1, respectively. Both EC 20 and EC 40 exhibited comparatively low correlations with the soil properties, whereas higher correlations were obtained for measurements of remaining phosphorus, wherein values of 0. 427 and 0. 465, respectively, were obtained. A agricultura de precisão baseada nas propriedades físicas e químicas do solo exige uma amostragem densa para se determinar a variabilidade espacial no campo.

The studied area has cool and semi-arid climate. Some of the soils formed in the studied area are Histosols. Five soil profiles were described down to depth of 2 m and soil samples were collected from their different horizons. Chemical fractionation of organic matter to fulvic acid, humic acid and humin was done and the content of each of these three components and the amounts of E 4 and E 6 were measured. In all of the soil profiles, variations of the fulvic acid, humic acid and humin contents are similar to variations of organic matter contents. More than 94 percent of the soil organic matter has changed to humus. Increase of HA/FA with increase of soil depth indicates high degree of polymerization and humification (stability) of organic matter in underlying layers and higher rate of humic material decomposition (unstability) in surface layers. Lower rate of humic material decomposition in underlying layers is due to increase of clay content with increase of soil depth and adsorption of humin by clay particles. E 4 /E 6 of the whole soil also decreased regularly from soil surface towards soil depth. This decrease is another evidence for increase of organic matter stability. Highest organic matter unstability was observed in the profile 5. This profile contains hemic but the others have sapric organic material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genes of the Raf family encode kinases {{that are}} {{regulated}} by Ras and mediate cellular responses to growth signals. Recently, {{it was shown}} that activating mutations of BRaf are found with high frequency in human melanomas. The Ras family member most often mutated in melanoma is NRas. Methods The constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway suggests {{an impact on the}} clinical course of the tumor. To address this notion, we analyzed tumor DNA from 114 primary cutaneous melanomas and of 86 metastatic lesions obtained from 174 patients for mutations in BRaf (exons 15 and 11) and NRas (exons 1 and 2) by direct sequencing of PCR products and correlated these results with the clinical course. Results In 57. 5 % of the tumors either BRaf or NRas were mutated with a higher incidence in metastatic (66. 3 %) than in primary lesions (50. 9 %). Although the majority of BRaf mutations affected codon 599, almost 15 % of mutations at this position were different from the well-described exchange from valine to glutamic acid. These mutations (V 599 R and V 599 K) also displayed increased kinase and transforming activity. Surprisingly, the additional BRaf variants D 593 V, G 465 R and G <b>465</b> <b>E</b> showed a complete loss of activity in the in vitro kinase assay; however, cells overexpressing these mutants displayed increased Erk phosphorylation. The correlation of mutational status and clinical course revealed that the presence of BRaf/NRas mutations in primary tumors did not negatively impact progression free or overall survival. In contrast, however, for metastatic lesions the presence of BRAF/NRAS mutations was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis, i. e. a shortened survival. Conclusion We demonstrate a high – albeit lower than initially anticipated – frequency of activating BRaf mutations in melanoma in the largest series of directly analyzed tumors reported to date. Notably, the clinical course of patients harboring activating BRaf mutations in metastatic melanoma was significantly affected by the presence of a constitutive BRaf activation in these. </p...|$|R
40|$|Urea is {{the most}} {{consumed}} nitrogen fertilizer in the world. However, its agronomic and economic efficiency is reduced by the volatilization of NH 3, which can reach 78 % of the applied nitrogen. The coating of urea granules with acidic compounds obtained by charcoal oxidation {{has the potential to}} reduce the volatilization, due to the acidic character, the high buffering capacity and CEC. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of HNO 3 -oxidized carbon on the control of NH 3 volatilization. These compounds were obtained by oxidation of Eucalyptus grandis charcoal, produced at charring temperatures of 350 and 450 ºC, with 4. 5 mol L- 1 HNO 3. The charcoal was oxidized by solubilization in acidic or alkaline medium, similar to the procedure of soil organic matter fractionation (CHox 350 and CHox 450). CHox was characterized by C, H, O, N contents and their respective atomic relations, by the ratio <b>E</b> 4 (absorbance <b>465</b> nm) by <b>E</b> 6 (absorbance 665 nm), and by active acidity and total acidity (CEC). The inhibitory effect of CHox on the urease activity of Canavalia ensiformis was assessed in vitro. The NH 3 volatilization from urea was evaluated with and without coating of oxidized charcoal (U-CHox 350 or U-CHox 450) in a closed system with continuous air flow. The pH of both CHox was near 2. 0, but the total acidity of CHox 350 was higher, 72 % of which was attributed to carboxylic groups. The variation in the ionization constants of CHox 350 was also greater. The low E 4 /E 6 ratios characterize the high stability of the compounds in CHox. CHox did not inhibit the urease activity in vitro, although the maximum volatilization peak from U-CHox 450 and U-CHox 350 occurred 24 h after that observed for uncoated urea. The lowest volatilization rate was observed for U-CHox 350 as well as a 43 % lower total amount of NH 3 volatilized than from uncoated urea...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine in details the microstructural and chemical changes in concrete extracted form the affected areas in an attempt to determine the cause of this premature deterioration. ^ The investigation started with a detailed inventory of selected areas of affected pavements in order to identify and classify the existing types of distresses and select locations for collection of the cores. The cores have been collected from the following four locations: NB lines of I- 65 near downtown Indianapolis, SR 933 near South Bend, Intersection of 86 th Street and Payne Rd. in Indianapolis and a ramp from US 67 to I- <b>465</b> <b>E,</b> also in Indianapolis.

These deposits were most likely the result of the repetitive saturation of air voids with water and substantially reduced the effectiveness of the air voids system with respect to providing an adequate level of freeze-thaw protection. In addition, the affected concrete often developed an extensive network of microcracks, showed higher rates of absorption and reduced ability to resist chloride ions penetration. ...|$|R

The potential was based on the Born model of ionic solids using the Buckingham potential (Ø(r) = Ae⁻r/p - C/r⁶) to describe the short-range energy contribution. Empirical fitting was used to establish reliable interatomic energy parameters. The reliability of the interatomic potentials was assessed by calculating crystal structures and lattice energies (which {{were not included in the}} fitting). The particular reactions selected for modelling were the decompositions of the alkaline-earth metal (Ca, Sr, Ba) peroxides and carbonates: M 0 ₂(s) [...] -> MO(s) + ¹/₂ 0 ₂(g) MC 0 ₃(s) [...] -> MO(s) + CO₂(g) The lattice energies calculated for the known structures were in good agreement with reported values, (except for Ba 0 ₂ and BaC 0 ₃) which provided support for the adequacy of the potential model used.

Bacterial cells were trapped with optical tweezers in microfluidic devices, enabling the first direct observation of single-cell behaviour upon hypo-osmotic shock. Phase-contrast microscopy revealed intra-population diversity in the cells response: Different features of lysis included cells bursting rapidly and leakage of ribosomes, DNA and protein from the cytoplasm. Fluorescence microscopy of hypo-osmotically-shocked GFP-expressing MJF 465 cells showed either bursting of cells, which was a rare event, or fast leakage of GFP, indicating cell membrane ruptures. Data were analysed {{in terms of their}} kinetic behaviour and showed that lysis occurs on a timescale of milliseconds to seconds. The implications of these findings for the bacterial cell wall and cell membranes are discussed. Enzymes involved in homologous recombination and repair of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks are essential for maintaining genomic integrity in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. RecBCD of E. coli and AddAB, found widely in bacteria, are involved in these processes, carrying out the same function. Both enzymes were studied kinetically with single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). Surface-tethered, hydrodynamically stretched lambda-DNA molecules, stained with YOYO- 1, were imaged with TIRFM in a microfluidic flowcell. The RecBCD enzyme is a well characterised DNA helicase and was introduced to this system for method validation purposes. The AddAB enzyme of Bacteroides fragilis was then characterised as a helicase acting on lambda-DNA. It was found that AddAB helicase unwinds dsDNA with high processivity of on average 14, 000 bp and up to 40, 000 bp for individual enzyme complexes at an ATP-dependent rate ranging from 50 - 250 bp s− 1 (for Mg 2 +-ATP concentrations larger or equal than 0. 1 mM). This activity was detected by DNA binding dye (YOYO- 1) displacement from the dsDNA and studied for different Mg 2 +-ATP concentrations, flow (shear) rates and different YOYO- 1 staining ratios of DNA. Aspects of this last experimental setup were investigated. A kinetic analysis of intercalation of YOYO- 1 into lambda-DNA is presented, occurring on a timescale of minutes. Different flow rates and staining ratios that influence the apparent (stretched) DNA molecule length were also examined. Several image analysis techniques were employed to enhance the data quality in images showing stretched lambda-DNA molecules. The Singular Value Decomposition was found to be the most effective technique which strongly reduces the noise in the obtained kymograph images.

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the flow of {{multiple}} fluids in a reservoir, and update the reservoir in a timely efficient manner is the dream of every reservoir engineer, and has been the bane of much research in {{the oil and gas}} industry. This is highly sought after because it enables efficient reservoir monitoring, management and planning. However this requires some level of skill and precision as well as the ability to interpret and input data from different sources into the model. In order {{to predict the}} flow of multiple fluids in a reservoir, the relative permeability of these fluids has to be determined. In this thesis, 4 D seismic data is used to estimate some endpoints of the relative permeability curve (1 ̆d 4461 ̆d 4541 ̆d 450 and 1 ̆d 4461 ̆d 4541 ̆d 45 a 1 ̆d 44 <b>e</b> 1 ̆d <b>465),</b> whereby multiple seismic surveys are employed in association with the production history, depletion mechanism, geological and structural effects as well as reservoir simulation predictions. The multiple survey 4 D seismic data is interpreted so as to decipher instances of critical gas saturation as well as maximum gas saturation effects, these are then quantitatively analysed, and a relationship between the ratio of their amplitudes and gas saturation are used to estimate the values. In addition, integrating 4 D seismic data with production data in a quantitative manner in a reservoir model improves the model’s capability and reduces the uncertainty, however doing this is quite a challenging problem. This thesis addresses this challenge by utilising a binary approach which circumvents the full rock physics modelling approach. The binary approach is developed and tested where gas and water saturation from 4 D seismic data and the reservoir simulation model are converted to binary indicators. Different metrics for quantifying the binary misfit in terms of their strengths and short comings are analysed, and the Current measurement metric and Hamming distance exhibit better capabilities than the Hausdorff distance and Mutual Information measurements. The binary approach is then tested on a synthetic model in order to validate its use, as well as show its functionality in a practical setting. In the synthetic study, three different scenarios are analysed – the gas exsolution scenarios, the water evolution scenarios, and a combination of gas exsolution and water evolution, and the results show that the binary approach provides a quick and efficient method of assessing reservoir parameters. The binary approach is then implemented on a real field data from the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS), where 104 uncertain reservoir parameters are initially assessed. An initial ensemble of fluid flow simulation models is created where the full range of uncertain parameters are acknowledged using experimental design methods, and an evolutionary algorithm is used for optimization in the history matching process. It is found that the primary control parameters for the binary seismic gas match are the permeability and critical gas saturation, while the volumetric parameters are important for the binary seismic water match in this particular reservoir. This binary approach is then compared to a conventional seismic modeling approximation approach, where the results show that the binary approach gives a good match to gas saturation distribution and water saturation distribution, and the reservoir parameters converge towards a solution. The conventional approach captures some signals of hardening and softening in the seismic data, however most parameters do not fully converge towards a solution, and hence in summary, the binary approach seems more suitable as a quick look reservoir management tool...|$|R
40|$|Foram avaliadas as características da carcaça de vacas de descarte mestiças e da segunda (G 2 - 3 / 4 Charolês (C) 1 / 4 Nelore (N) e 3 / 4 NC) e terceira gerações (G 3 - 5 / 8 CN e 5 / 8 NC) do cruzamento rotativo Charolês - Nelore, terminadas em confinamento <b>e</b> abatidas com <b>465,</b> 507 ou 566 kg. Os animais apresentaram, no início do confinamento, em média, 8, 5 anos de idade, 388, 6 kg e 2, 35 pontos de escore de condição corporal. A dieta, com relação volumoso:concentrado de 48 : 52, continha 12, 5 % de proteína bruta e 2, 99 Mcal de energia digestível por kg de matéria seca. Vacas abatidas com 566 kg de peso vivo produziram carcaças mais pesadas (318, 5 kg), com maior rendimento (56, 24 %) e espessura de gordura subcutânea (7, 54 mm) que aquelas abatidas com 465 kg (245, 0 kg, 52, 71 % e 4, 72 mm, respectivamente) e 507 kg (264, 6 kg, 52, 12 % e 4, 4 mm, respectivamente). O aumento do peso de abate (<b>465,</b> 507 <b>e</b> 566 kg) não alterou o percentual do corte serrote (51, 17, 50, 64 e 50, 63 %), mas reduziu o dianteiro (36, 93, 37, 26 e 35, 23 %) e aumentou o costilhar (11, 90, 12, 09 e 14, 14 %). Para as medidas relacionadas à expressão muscular da carcaça, a conformação melhorou com o aumento do peso de abate (8, 13, 9, 47 e 10, 9 pontos). A espessura de coxão teve aumento significativo quando o peso de abate passou de 465 para 507 kg, enquanto a área do músculo Longissimus dorsi aumentou apenas nas vacas abatidas com peso mais elevado. Vacas 3 / 4 CN apresentaram maior participação de costilhar na carcaça e menor de dianteiro que as 3 / 4 NC. The {{objective}} of the experiment was to evaluate the carcass characteristics of crossbred cull cows, from the second (G 2 - 3 / 4 Charolais (C) Nellore (N) and 3 / 4 NC) and third (G 3 - 5 / 8 CN and 5 / 8 NC) generations of Charolais - Nellore rotational crossbreeding, feedlot finished and slaughtered with 465, 507 and 566 kg. At {{the beginning of the}} experiment the average age, weight and body condition were, respectively, 8. 5 years, 388. 6 kg and 2. 35 points. The diet, with 48 : 52 roughage:concentrate ratio, contained 12. 5 % crude protein and 2. 99 Mcal of digestible energy per kg of dry matter. Cows slaughtered with 566 kg produced heavier carcasses (318. 5 kg), higher dressing percentage (56. 24 %) and subcutaneous fat thickness (7. 54 mm) than cows slaughtered with 465 kg (245. 0 kg, 52. 71 % and 4. 72 mm, respectively) or 507 kg (264. 6 kg, 52. 12 % and 4. 4 mm, respectively). The increase of slaughter weight (465, 507 and 566 kg) did not alter the sawcut percentage (51. 17, 50. 64 and 50. 63 %), reduced the forequarter (36. 93, 37. 26 and 35. 23 %) and increased the sidecut percentage (11. 9, 12. 09 and 14. 14 %), respectively. For the measurements related to the carcass muscular expression, conformation was improved by slaughter weight increase (8. 13, 9. 47 and 10. 9 points), respectively. Cushion thickness increased significantly when slaughter weight raised from 465 to 507 kg and Longissimus dorsi muscle area increased only in cows with the highest slaughter weight. The 3 / 4 CN cows showed higher sidecut and lower forequarter percentages in relative to 3 / 4 NC cows...|$|R
