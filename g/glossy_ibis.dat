5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> which probably had a similar history.|$|E
5|$|Other British Birds rarities {{that have}} been sighted (single records unless {{otherwise}} indicated) are: Little bittern, <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> gyrfalcon (3 records), little and Baillon's crakes, collared pratincole, semipalmated (5 records), least (2 records), white-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's phalarope, laughing gull, bridled tern, Pallas's sandgrouse, great spotted, black-billed and yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European roller, olive-backed pipit, citrine wagtail, Alpine accentor, thrush nightingale, red-flanked bluetail, black-eared (2 records) and desert wheatears, White's, Swainson's (3 records), and grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and lesser grey shrikes, red-eyed vireo (7 records), two-barred crossbill, yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers, yellow-breasted (2 records) and black-headed (3 records) buntings, rose-breasted grosbeak (2 records), bobolink and Baltimore oriole (2 records).|$|E
50|$|This large, <b>glossy,</b> blue-black <b>ibis</b> has an unfeathered red {{face and}} head, and a long, decurved red bill. It breeds colonially on and amongst rocks and on cliffs, laying {{two or three}} eggs which are {{incubated}} for 21 days before hatching. It is a large bird that feeds and roosts in substantial groups. It feeds on insects, small reptiles, rodents and small birds. They do little vocalizing other than occasional gobbling sounds.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} bald ibis, hermit ibis, or waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is a {{migratory bird}} found in barren, semi-desert or rocky habitats, often close to running water. This 70 - 80 cm <b>glossy</b> black <b>ibis,</b> which, unlike {{other members of}} the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals.|$|R

Hundreds of garganey teals, northern pintail and northern shoveller {{can also be}} seen in the lake. The best time to visit Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary is from November to March.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{ecosystem}} is {{noted for its}} variety and large population of birds, some of them very rare. The most important are the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), greylag goose (Anser anser), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), great white egret (Egretta alba), little egret (Egretta garzetta), eurasian spoonbill(Platalea leucorodia), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), mute swan (Cygnus olor), and <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> (Plegadis falcinellus). A recent and welcomed newcomer is the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus).|$|E
25|$|The {{heterogeneous}} ecosystem of the marshland supports about 337 {{species of}} floras and faunas. Of the faunal groups, birds, fishes and reptiles {{are the most}} prominent. Pallikaranai marsh is home to 115 species of birds, 10 species of mammals, 21 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibians, 46 species of fishes, 9 species of molluscans, 5 species of crustaceans, and 7 species of butterflies. About 114 species of plants {{are found in the}} wetland including 29 species of grass. These plant species include some exotic floating vegetation such as water hyacinth and water lettuce, which are less extensive now and highly localised. The region has a bird bio-diversity about 4 times that of Vedanthangal. It is also home {{to some of the most}} endangered reptiles such as the Russell's viper and birds such as the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> grey-headed lapwings and pheasant-tailed jacana. Cormorants, darters, herons, egrets, open-billed storks, spoonbills, white ibis, little grebe, Indian moorhen, black-winged stilts, purple moorhens, warblers, coots and dabchicks have been spotted in large numbers in the marshland. The marsh has also had the distinction of new records of reptiles and plants being described, on a rather regular basis since 2002.|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} in mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks with the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> (Plegadis falcinellus) in flooded fields, and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for crabs and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain. The wood stork {{is also found in}} the same habitat in Florida, but hunts larger prey and a higher percentage of fish, so there is little overlap. In the Llanos, where American white ibis coexist with the scarlet ibis, their diets differ, the former consuming more bugs, fish and crustaceans, while the latter eat a much higher proportion of beetles. The willet (Tringa semipalmata) has been observed trailing American white ibis and catching prey disturbed by them, and even kleptoparasitizing (stealing) from them, in J. N. [...] "Ding" [...] Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island in Florida. An isolated event of [...] predation in juvenile American white ibis has been observed, where a juvenile attacked and consumed a chick from another nest.|$|E
2500|$|Otteri lake {{situated}} on the north-western side within the park premises acts as a roosting ground for {{a wide array of}} aquatic migratory birds such as the open-bill stork, painted stork, white ibis, grey heron, night heron, cormorants, darters, egrets, dabchicks, pelicans, great pelicans, <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> and moorhen, making it a bird watchers' paradise. The [...] lake, surrounded by a variety of trees, receives the run-off water from nearly half the area of the park and attracts a large number of migratory birds in October, November, and December. Both terrestrial and aquatic birds of about 70 species congregate here during the season. On average, around 10,000 migratory birds visit the lake each year. About 230 saplings of Barringtonia, a species native to mangrove habitats, have been planted inside the lake to attract more birds.|$|E
2500|$|Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge holds {{hundreds}} of species of animals including birds, fish, plants, and mammals. [...] The wetlands of Pelican Island {{are a major}} ecological system supporting the huge biological diversity. [...] Fifteen federally listed threatened and endangered species live in Pelican Island NWR and around Indian River Lagoon. [...] Of the endangered species, West Indian manatees and sea turtles occupy parts of the lagoon. [...] Around the lagoon in the refuge are two wood stork refuges. [...] These birds along with other wading birds that nest on the island thrive on the tremendous fish population. [...] Pelican Island is home to many nesting birds including brown pelicans, great egrets, snowy egrets, reddish egrets, great blue heron, little blue heron, tricolored heron, black-crowned night heron, American white ibis, <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> double-crested cormorant, anhinga, and American oystercatcher.|$|E
6000|$|When out riding I went oftenest in the {{direction}} of Los Alamos, which was west of us, or as the gauchos would say, [...] "on the side where the sun sets." [...] For just behind the plantation, enclosed in its rows of tall old poplars, was that bird-haunted stream which was an irresistible attraction. The sight of running water, too, was a never- failing joy, also the odours which greeted me in that moist green place--odours earthy, herby, fishy, flowery, and even birdy, particularly that peculiar musky odour given out on hot days by large flocks of the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Animal {{life was}} not wanting in this paradise. Frequently did our seaman give vent to [...] "Hallo!" [...] "There they go!" [...] "Look out for the little 'un wi' the long tail!" [...] and similar expressions, {{referring}} of course to his favourite monkeys, which ever and anon peered out upon the strangers with looks of intensity, for whatever their expression might be-- sadness, grief, interrogation, wrath, surprise--it {{was always in the}} superlative degree. There were birds also, innumerable. One, styled the [...] "king-hunter," [...] sang wild exultant airs, as if it found king-hunting to be an extremely exhilarating occupation, though what sort of kings it hunted we cannot tell. Perhaps it was the king of beasts, perhaps the kingfisher, a bright specimen of which was frequently seen to dart out from the banks, but we profess ignorance on this point. There were fish-hawks also, magnificent fellows, which sat in regal dignity on the tops of the mangrove trees, and the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> with others of the feathered tribe too numerous to mention.|$|E
60|$|Two {{miles from}} my home there stood an old mud-built house, {{thatched}} with rushes, and shaded by a few ancient half-dead trees. Here lived a very old woman with her two unmarried daughters, both withered and grey as their mother; indeed, in appearance, they were three amiable sister witches, all very very old. The high ground on which the house stood sloped down to an extensive reed- and rush-grown marsh, the source of an important stream; it was a paradise of wild fowl, swan, roseate spoonbill, herons white and herons grey, ducks {{of half a dozen}} species, snipe and painted snipe, and stilt, plover and godwit; the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> and the great crested blue ibis with a powerful voice. All these interested, I might say fascinated, me less than the tame geese that spent most of their time in or on the borders of the marsh in the company of the wild birds. The three old women were so fond of their geese that they would not part with one for love or money; the most they would ever do would be to present an egg, in the laying season, to some visitor as a special mark of esteem.|$|E
50|$|This {{species can}} be {{confused}} with the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> when seen at a distance but the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> is smaller, more gregarious, associated with wetlands and lacks the white on the wing and has a fully feathered head.|$|E
50|$|The {{white-faced ibis}} bears a strong {{resemblance}} to the related <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> {{and in the past}} was sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis.</b> Another theory was that upon coming to the New World, a small isolated <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> population evolved to become its own separate species. However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies show that the white-faced ibis may actually be paraphyletic. In fact, members of the white-faced ibis populations in the United States appear to be more closely related to glossy ibises than to members of white-faced ibis populations in Southern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{bald ibis}} is readily distinguished from its close relative, the southern bald ibis of Southern Africa, by the southern species' whitish face. The northern bald can also {{be confused with the}} similarly dark-plumaged <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis,</b> and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{common name}} black curlew {{may be a}} {{reference}} to the <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> and this name appears in Anglo-Saxon literature, indicating that it may have bred in early medieval England, but Yalden and Albarella do not mention this species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> (Plegadis falcinellus) is a {{wading bird}} in the ibis family Threskiornithidae. The {{scientific}} name derives from Ancient Greek plegados and Latin, falcis, both meaning [...] "sickle" [...] and referring to the distinctive shape of the bill.|$|E
50|$|Lac de Guiers is {{designated}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International; the key {{species are}} lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> (Plegadis falcinellus), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), African spoonbill (Platalea alba), white-winged tern (Chlidonias leucopterus) and river prinia (Prinia fluviatilis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>glossy</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is one of}} {{the species}} to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.
