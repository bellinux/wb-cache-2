40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> compliance contributes to irregular drug delivery during vertical displacement of syringe pumps. DESIGN: Five different commercially available infusion lines were studied at infusion rates of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 ml/h. Zero drug delivery time was measured after acute line loop formation (70 cm) using an electronic balance. Compliance of each <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> was calculated using a pressure transducer and {{measurement of the}} occlusion release bolus at 300 mmHg occlusion pressure. Finally, the influence of <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> compliance on drug delivery during acute lowering of the syringe pump was studied using low- and high-compliance infusion lines. RESULTS: Acute line loop formation resulted in zero drug delivery time from 5. 1 +/- 1. 5 to 44. 0 +/- 6. 8 s at flow rates of 0. 5 ml/h. Increased flow rates significantly reduced loop-induced flow variability. A close correlation was found between zero drug delivery time and calculated <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> compliance at 0. 5 ml/h (linear regression R 2 = 0. 79). Lowering of the syringe pump 50 cm prolonged zero drug delivery time from 295. 8 +/- 20. 7 s with the low-compliance tube to 463. 3 +/- 24. 0 s with the high-compliance <b>infusion</b> <b>line.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Infusion</b> <b>line</b> compliance contributes to irregular drug delivery associated with vertical displacement of syringe pumps. Siphoning of the <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> during patient care should be avoided, and flow rates of 1 ml/h or higher are recommended. Low-compliance infusion lines are indicated whenever highly short-acting vasoactive drugs at low delivery rates are administered...|$|E

30|$|This {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} to the retrospective study in a medical ICU published by Maury et al. in which authors compared two insulin infusion lines. The use of a dedicated line was linked to {{a significant decrease in}} the incidence of hypoglycaemic events. An important result of this study was confirmation of a trend towards {{a significant difference in the}} time spent in hypoglycaemia during 1000  h of IIT. The authors explained that their results were based on minimising insulin mass flow rate disturbances caused by multiple intravenous medications infused on the same <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> as that of insulin. They showed that another drug had been administered through the insulin <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> during the hour preceding the hypoglycaemic event in more than 8 of 10 events. In our study, more than two-thirds of hypoglycaemic events were correlated with the start of another drug administration on the <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> in the 3 h preceding the event. This concords with our hypothesis at the beginning of this study based on in vitro works that showed the impact of common space volumes on mass flow rate disturbances when several medications are on the same <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> [8, 11, 12].|$|E

In-line microfilters with small enough pores may even retain certain microorganisms, such as large bacteria and fungal spores, endotoxins and air [12]. In 807 critically ill children, use of in-line microfilters {{was associated with a}} reduction in the overall complication rate and incidence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [13].

30|$|Mechanisms of particle-induced organ {{dysfunction}} {{have generally been}} investigated in animals [8]. Particles may induce occlusive micro-thrombi, activation of platelets and neutrophil granulocytes, {{and the formation of}} granulomas. It has been reported in experimental studies that particles can induce deleterious clinical effects such as thrombogenesis [9] and microcirculation impairment [10]. In critically ill patients, drug incompatibilities frequently occur {{because of the number of}} drugs to be administered through an inadequate number of <b>infusion</b> <b>lines</b> [11]. These are among the main causes of particulate contamination. A particulate load induces clinical consequences which have been well described in a previous systematic review [1], indicating how the lungs are particularly affected. The authors demonstrated that around one third of injected particles are trapped in the lungs or tend to locate there primarily [12]. These microparticles caused by drug incompatibility may lead to micro-emboli and granuloma in the pulmonary vessels, particularly during total parenteral nutrition.|$|R

30|$|In {{the above}} works, {{the issue of}} insulin {{administration}} methods was not addressed. Yet, many parameters can affect the drug delivery of narrow therapeutics where multiple infusions are involved, as in ICUs. The main parameter to be considered {{seems to be the}} common space volume within the <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> between drugs simultaneously infused, as shown by Lovich et al. [7, 8]. The time to reach a steady state after initiating or ceasing drug infusion is considerably reduced with a low common volume manifold compared to a high volume design [9]. Several studies have shown the benefits of a reduction in <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> common volume in predicting drug delivery and so avoiding incidents such as unexpected drug bolus [7 – 16].|$|E
30|$|Our {{study was}} divided into two parts. In the first, we revalidated the two {{infusion}} conditions, following the same methods.

40|$|During {{clinical}} trials, researchers rarely question nominal doses specified on labels of investigational products, {{overlooking the}} potential for inaccuracies that may result when calculating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. This study evaluated the disparity between nominal doses and the doses actually administered in two Phase I trials of a biosimilar drug. In Trial A, 12 healthy volunteers received various doses of an interferon β- 1 a biosimilar via either subcutaneous or intravenous injection, prepared by partially emptying 0. 53  ml syringes supplied by the manufacturer. In Trial B, 12 volunteers received three different formulations of the drug via intravenous injection (biosimilar with and without albumin and a comparator), followed by multiple subcutaneous injections. In both trials, the dose administered was calculated as D[*]=[*]C[*]×[*]V[*]-[*]losses, where C is the drug concentration assessed using ELISA, V is the volume administered calculated using syringe weighing and losses are deduced from in-vitro experiments. Interferon binding to added albumin and <b>infusion</b> <b>lines</b> was evaluated using a (125) I-interferon tracer with gel-filtration chromatography. In Trial A, measured concentrations were close to the nominal strength indicated by the manufacturer (median bias: - 6  %), whereas in Trial B they differed significantly for all three formulations (median biases: + 67  %, + 73  % and + 31  % for the biosimilar with albumin, the biosimilar without albumin and the comparator, respectively). In Trial A, the doses actually administered showed large variability and biases, especially at the lowest doses. Indeed, actually injected volumes differed {{by as much as}} 74  % from theoretical volumes - a phenomenon mainly attributed to unnoticed fluid re-aspiration through the syringe needle. This was corrected in Trial B. Interferon was not significantly adsorbed on the <b>infusion</b> <b>lines</b> used for intravenous administration. Its binding to albumin was slow, reaching 50  % after a 16  h incubation. These examples illustrate the importance of assessing the actual doses administered in clinical trials, to ensure accuracy in the determination of clearance, distribution volume, bioavailability and dose-response relationships.

A glucose control monitoring system indicated a trend towards differences in the duration of hypoglycaemia (blood glucose level below 70  mg dl− 1 (3.9  mmol l− 1) over 1000  h of insulin infusion (9.7  ±  25.0 h in the standard group versus 4.4  ±  14.8  h in the optimised group, p =  0.059) and in the number of patients experiencing at least one hypoglycaemia incident (25.7 vs. 12.9 %, p =  0.052).

30|$|It can {{therefore}} {{be noted that the}} optimised <b>infusion</b> <b>line</b> is responsible for fewer hypoglycaemic events.

30|$|Initially, {{choices of}} a {{particular}} crystalloid solution were determined by availability and cost. For example, NS originally was {{less than half the}} cost of the other crystalloids and came in varying degrees of dilution (0.9, 0.45, and 0.225  N NaCl). It was also available alone or with 5 % dextrose. Importantly, NS solutions are compatible with co-infusion of blood products. LR and other balanced salt solutions containing Ca+ 2 not only were more expensive, but also carried the risk of clotting <b>infusion</b> <b>lines</b> when blood transfusions were given. For all these reasons, the default crystalloid solution for resuscitation was NS except when hemostasis was needed, as often occurring in trauma or intraoperative resuscitation, wherein LR was usually prescribed [28]. These early concerns have now been minimized since all crystalloid solutions cost the same and multi-lumen infusion catheters simplify infusion compatibility concerns. Similarly, the choice of colloid solution remains influenced by cost and shelf life. The cost of albumin continues to vary considerably across countries and continents, and it has a limited shelf life, whereas starches and gelatins are cheaper and have a longer shelf life. Thus, economic considerations {{play an important role in}} determining which colloids are available regionally, but less so in the choice of crystalloids.|$|R

Five ruminally cannulated steers were fitted with abomasal <b>infusion</b> <b>lines</b> that were inserted through their ruminal cannulas. There were 5 treatments, a control (CON) of only water, a single pulse dose of 1 g/kg of oligofructose (OL 1) or starch (ST 1) or 4 staggered doses of 0. 25 g/kg of oligofructose (OL 4) or starch (ST 4) administered every 6 h. Fecal samples were collected to measure fecal score, pH, dry matter (DM), VFA, endotoxin and apparent total tract nutrient digestibility. The results showed that a decrease in fecal pH from 7 to 6 occurred {{as a result of}} the OL 1 and ST 1 treatments and a decrease from 7 to 6. 5 in the staggered doses. Fecal score also decreased from OL 1 most severely but OL 4 also caused a decline. An increase in total VFA and endotoxin concentrations in feces was seen across all treatments compared to CON. Both the pulse dose and staggered dose of oligofructose induced conditions similar to those seen in post-ruminal acidosis.

Methods: Prepubertal rabbits received lipid emulsion through central IV lines continuously for 3 weeks either via PVC or polyethylene (PE) infusion systems.

Results: By light microscopy, hydropic degeneration, single-cell necrosis, fibrosis, and bile duct proliferation were observed more in the PVC group. Electron microscopy revealed multiple nuclear changes, clusters and atypical forms of peroxisomes, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, increased deposition of lipofuscin, and a mild perisinusoidal fibrosis only in the PVC group. These changes, which are generally regarded as reaction upon a toxic stimulus, could be exclusively attributed to DEHP. Conclusions: This investigation proved that DEHP produces toxin-like changes in livers of young rabbits in the same dose, duration, and method of administration as in newborn infants.
