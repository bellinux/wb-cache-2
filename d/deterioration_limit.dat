40|$|The proper {{prediction}} of concrete deterioration {{is important for}} estimating and evaluating　the service life of concrete structures and for maintaining and managing them. It is necessary to establish the limit of deterioration in management (the <b>deterioration</b> <b>limit)</b> and understand the probability of exceeding that limit. In this study， the introduction of reliability theory to predict and evaluate concrete deterioration was tried {{in order to determine}} if it could be used for these purposes, predicting surface scaling, which is a typical form of surface deterioration of concrete structures located in cold regions and an important factor in the maintenance of the beauty of value-added concrete structures， and the deterioration of cover concrete of steel...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{deterioration}} mechanisms that affect the required performance (specifications critical to the operability) of concrete structures. A technique based on deterioration prediction is introduced which should prove useful in the maintenance and management of structures. Neutralization and chemical attack were selected as two exampｌe mechanisms. 　Neutralization　was examined in terms of its effect on reinforcement corrosion and bearing strength，while the effects of chemical attack on strength， esthetic appearance， and bearing strength were studied. A <b>deterioration</b> <b>limit</b> was established for the ultimate state of structures with a safety factor of 1. 15. Deterioration was predicted about flexural strength. In this way， a prediction method of neutralization and chemical attack was defined by arranged factor of deterioration.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} fasting, subfeeding, and refeeding on plasma biochemistry was carried out on 22 captive yellow-legged gulls Larus cachinnans Pallas. These birds showed the same fasting endurance model described in other species, but with an important decrease in glucose plasma concentration and very great differences between individuals when reaching the <b>deterioration</b> <b>limit,</b> suggesting a moderate physiological adaptation to long periods of fasting. A different model was proposed in subfed gulls in relation to fasted gulls, based on lipid and protein use, which could be reflected by changes in nitrogen wastes and triglyceride levels in this experiment. Thus, the subfed gulls might use protein directly from the diet as an energy source, thereby reducing the use of fat stores. The gulls quickly recovered body mass during the refeeding period, but while some plasma substances quickly reached their initial values, others showed many changes {{before the end of the}} experiment, which could reflect a process of metabolic restabilization. These results contribute to a better knowledge of fasting, subfeeding, and refeeding processes in birds and can be added to a recent study about fasting in gulls. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

30|$|Our {{paper is}} related to the {{literature}} that analyzes the deterioration of bank capital during the years prior to crisis. The literature generally accepts that capital should deter banks from taking bad risks, and instead it should enhance good governance to minimize the exposure of shareholders to risk (Rochet 1992; Morrison and White 2005). Indeed, there is evidence that well capitalized banks could better cope with the severe losses incurred during the crisis (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2013; Beltratti and Stulz 2012; Berger and Bouwman 2013). However, recent papers provide evidence of a deterioration in bank capital prior to and during the crisis that hurt capital’s capacity to act as a corporate governance mechanism (Acharya et al. 2009; Mehran et al. 2011). Furthermore, this <b>deterioration</b> <b>limited</b> the capacity of banks to raise new funds during the crisis (Acharya et al. 2011). Our paper analyzes the determinants of this deterioration in capital.|$|R
40|$|Predictions of {{the service}} life of {{concrete}} structures {{are an important part}} of maintenance，management，and durability design. One essential aspect of this is deterioration prediction. The purpose of this study is to theoretically examine the question of deterioration prediction using reliability theory. As an example， reliability theory is applied to the problem of scaling using survey data taken from exposure tests in a cold marine environment. The exposed specimens have a concrete cover of 80 mm， and the scaling <b>deterioration</b> <b>limit</b> is assumed to be 20 mm. 　Hazard levels are set up at 1 / 10 and 1 / 20 of this limit，corresponding to 2 mm and 1 mm， respectively. 　　From this examination, we conclude that the Weibull distribution gives the best fit to the frequency distribution of scaling that exceeds the hazard level in depth. Covariate variables of the reliability function were extracted, and water-cement ratio and Fe_ 2 O_ 3 were selected for study since their significance level was within 1 ％. The coefficient for water-cement ratio was found to be negative， while that for Fe_ 2 O_ 3 was positive. The time taken for scaling to reach the hazard level was found to be approximately the same as required to reach the 50 ％reliability level， thus confirming the validity of this method of reliability analysi...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{deterioration}} of commercial Frytol oil in controlled frying conditions using the anisidine index (AI) as standard evaluation method. The effect of temperature and time was studied at 170 °C for up to 10 hours and at 200 °C for up to 6 hours {{in the presence of}} factors which speeded up oil deterioration: 1 % and 8 % water based on the mass of oil and non-lipid material, 1 % and 6 % based on the mass of oil. Air flow rate was kept constant at 25 L h - 1. The relationship between AI, colour and viscosity was studied to evaluate the technical viability of measuring these variables as a function of time {{to be used as a}} method for rating oil deterioration by small and medium sized enterprises (SME). Oil deterioration was higher and faster at maximum study interval values for each experimental factor, although only the effect of temperature was significant (p 2 = 0. 558 and R 2 = 0. 526, respectively), colour depending on frying temperature. Viscosity measured at 30 °C had the highest coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 809) and was independent of frying temperature. Viscosity is thus a variable which can be used for determining frying oil deterioration in SME as a consequence of a significant change from 10 cP to 45 cP which is closer to frying oil <b>deterioration</b> <b>limit</b> (AI 156). It can facilitate determination and lower associated costs, thereby improving product quality and customer confidence in them.   </p...|$|E
40|$|Peach being {{climacteric}} fruit ripe {{quickly after}} harvest and exhibit fast ripening at ambient conditions. Rapid postharvest fruit softening and quality <b>deterioration</b> <b>limit</b> its postharvest storage life. Therefore, this integrated study {{was carried out}} to understand the role of various factors, such as cultivars, harvest locations and application of pre-storage chemicals including salicylic acid (SA), oxalic acid (OA), putrescine (PUT) and CaCl 2 to manage postharvest fruit softening and quality of peach. The degree of fruit softening was measured by determining the activities of fruit softening enzymes including pectin esterase (PE), endo- 1 - 4 -Ã¢ glucanase (EGase), endopolygalacturonase(endo-PG) and exo-polygalacturonase (exo-PG). Fruit quality parameters including activities of antioxidative enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) ], total phenolic contents (TPC) and antioxidants scavenging activity (ASA), soluble solid contents (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), SSCTA ratio and ascorbic acid contents were also determined during ripening and cold storage periods (35 -days with 7 -days interval). In the first study, the effects of cultivars and harvest locations on postharvest fruit softening and quality were evaluated. It was found that peach cv. â€˜Flordakingâ€™ exhibited reduced fruit softening and better fruit quality, as compared to cv. â€˜Early Grandâ€™ during cold storage (0 Â± 1 Â°C and 80 - 85 % RH) and under ambient conditions (25 Â± 2 Â°C and 60 - 65 % RH). Moreover, {{it was found that}} peach fruit harvested from Soan Valley, district Khushab revealed reduced fruit softening and activities of fruit softening enzymes with better fruit quality than fruit from Sillanwali, district Sargodha. Irrespective to peach cultivars and harvest locations, peach fruit exhibited full ripening (eating soft stage) on day- 4 at ambient conditions. From this study, peach cv. â€˜Flordakingâ€™ harvested from Soan Valley were screened and selected for further trials. Among applications of different prestorage chemicals, 1 st trial was conducted regarding effects of SA (0, 2, 4 or 6 mM) on fruit softening and quality of â€˜Flordakingâ€™ peach fruit during ripening, under cold storage and at ripening following cold storage. Application of 6 mM SA significantly reduced the ethylene production and maintained higher fruit firmness during ripening and under cold storage conditions. Activities of fruit softening enzymes viz. PE, EGase, endo-PG and exo-PG were significantly reduced by application of SA in a concentration dependent manner. Peach fruit treated with higher concentrations of SA (6 mM) revealed relatively higher TPC, ASA, activities of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, POD and CAT) than untreated fruit. Moreover, peach fruit treated with 6 mM SA exhibited lower SSC: TA ratio, as compared to untreated fruit. The 2 nd trial was carried out to check the effects of different concentrations of OA (0, 1, 2 or 3 mM) on fruit softening and quality of â€˜Flordakingâ€™ peach during ripening, under cold storage and at ripening followed by cold storage. Peach fruit treated with 3 mM OA showed reduced ethylene production, respiration rate and fruit softening. Reduction in fruit softening was associated with reduced activities of fruit softening enzymes (PE, EGase, endo-PG and exo-PG) in OA-treated fruit. Application of 3 mM OA significantly enhanced the TPC, ASA and activities of antioxidative enzymes viz. SOD, POD, CAT. During 3 rd trial, effects of postharvest application of PUT (0, 0. 5, 1 or 2 mM) were investigated on fruit softening and quality of â€˜Flordakingâ€™ peach during ripening, under cold storage and at ripening followed by cold storage. Application of 2 mM PUT significantly delayed ethylene production, reduced respiration rate and retained firm fruit, as compared to untreated fruit. PUT-treated (2 mM) fruit exhibited reduced activities of fruit softening enzymes (PE, EGase, endo- PG and exo-PG). Moreover, low SSC: TA ratio, higher ascorbic acid contents, enhanced TPC, ASA and activities of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, POD and CAT) were exhibited by 2 mM PUtreated fruit. The 4 th trial was carried out to study the effects of postharvest application of different concentrations of CaCl 2 (0, 2, 4 or 6 %) on fruit softening and quality of â€˜Flordakingâ€™ peach during ripening, under cold storage and at ripening followed by cold storage. CaCl 2 -treated fruit, at higher concentration (6 % CaCl 2) revealed reduced ethylene production and respiration rate. Application of 6 % CaCl 2 reduced fruit softening and activities of fruit softening enzymes including PE, EGase, endo-PG and exo-PG, in peach fruit. Higher TPC, ASA and activities of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, POD and CAT) were exhibited by 6 % CaCl 2 -treated fruit. Although, the higher dose of CaCl 2 (6 %) was most effective in reducing fruit softening and improving quality of peach fruit but it caused toxicity symptoms on peach fruit. From above pre-storage trials best doses of different chemicals (6 mM SA, 3 mM OA, 2 mM PUT and 4 % CaCl 2) were screened and these were confirmed in another study. In confirmatory trial, it was found that among all tested anti-ripening chemicals, application of 2 mM PUT was more effective in reducing ethylene production, respiration rate and retaining higher fruit firmness. However, the activities of fruit softening enzymes were significantly suppressed by 4 % CaCl 2 treatment. In conclusion, application of 6 mM SA, 3 mM OA, 2 mM PUT or 4 % CaCl 2 were found beneficial to reduce fruit softening and activities of fruit softening enzymes, enhance antioxidative enzymes and retain better fruit quality of â€˜Flordakingâ€™ peach fruit upto 35 -days of cold storage...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} zirconia in acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) representing acidic environments and fluoride treatments was studied. Material and Methods Zirconia rods were immersed in 1. 23 % and 0. 123 % APF solutions and maintained at 37 °C for determined periods of time. Surfaces of all specimens were imaged using digital microscopy and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Sample mass and dimensions were measured for mass loss determination. Samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) to detect changes in crystallinity. A biosensor based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to detect ion dissolution of material into the immersion media. Results Digital microscopy revealed diminishing luster of the materials and SEM showed increased superficial corrosion of zirconia submerged in 1. 23 % APF. Although no structural change was found, the absorption of salts (sodium phosphate) {{onto the surface of}} the materials bathed in 0. 123 % APF was significant. EIS indicated a greater change of impedance for the immersion solutions with increasing bathing time.

In the second rework stage, some of the defective items of the same batch are reworked. Each reworked item has the required good quality. During waiting for rework, defective items deteriorate.

Due to the public concern of the environmental <b>deterioration,</b> <b>limited</b> fossil fuel resources, and energy price volatility, biofuel as a clean, safe and sustainable energy needs to be developed in response to this growing concern. Sorghum, an important dryland crop, represents a renewable resource currently grown on 8 million acres throughout the United States. Due to climate variability and the continuous decline of water resources, utilization of dryland to grow sorghum and forage sorghum is critically important in order to ensure available energy resources and sustainable economic development. The objectives of this research were 1) to study the impact of deficit irrigation strategies on sorghum grain attributes and bioethanol production, and 2) to evaluate the potential fermentable sugar yield of pedigreed sorghum mutants. Results showed that average kernel weight and test weight of grain sorghum increased as irrigation capacity increased, whereas kernel hardness index decreased as irrigation capacity increased. Starch content increased as irrigation level increased and protein contents decreased as irrigation level increased.

To avoid failure of brain death confirmation and possible loss of organ donation another approach to apneic test is needed. We present two cases of patients with clinical symptoms of brain death, with lung pathology (acute lung injury, ARDS, lung embolism and lung infection), in whom apneic tests for recognizing brain death were difficult to perform. During typical performance of apneic test involving the use of oxygen catheter for apneic oxygenation we observed severe desaturation with growing hypotension and hemodynamic destabilization. But {{with the use of}} Boussignac CPAP system all necessary tests were successfully completed, confirming the patient’s brain death, which gave us the opportunity to perform procedures for organ donation. The main reason of apneic test difficulties was severe gas exchange disturbances secondary to ARDS. Thus lack of positive end expiratory pressure during classical performance of apneic test leads to quick desaturation and rapid hemodynamic <b>deterioration,</b> <b>limiting</b> the observation period below dedicated at least 10 -minute interval.   Conclusion: The Boussignac CPAP system may be an effective tool for performing transparent apneic test in case of serious respiratory disturbances, especially in the form of acute lung injury or ARDS.

40|$|Machinery {{condition}} monitoring (MCM) {{is the process}} of measuring, trending and assessing key parameters that indicate the health of a machine. Wear debris analysis is a common element of MCM programs and can involve the assessment of size, quantity, morphology and composition of debris shed from dynamic components such as gears and bearings as they deteriorate. Traditionally, wear debris has been detected by the laboratory analysis of routine oil samples, visual inspection of magnetic chip detectors or other off-line techniques which all have significant technical or logistic limitations. The Inductive Wear Debris Sensor (IWDS) is a relatively recent development in this field and commercial examples have demonstrated some significant advantages over traditional techniques. These sensors are installed in the return line of a lubrication system so that wear debris liberated from deteriorating components can be detected in real time. Applications for these sensors currently include aviation machinery, wind-turbine generators, marine propulsion systems and some aspects of general industry. One aspect that has received virtually no attention in the literature is a validated methodology for determining a suitable limit (or suite of limits) for a particular application. Limits are a critically important aspect of MCM programs {{that can be used to}} trigger further detailed interrogation of the machine or maintenance action.

It provides livelihoods for local fishermen, as well as habitat for rare flora and fauna, is of key importance to the local climate and provided recreational opportunities for the inhabitants of Cape Coast. In recent years, increased human activities have led to deterioration of both fresh and coastal waters in many regions of the world. The Environmental Protection Agency of Ghana have rated the Fosu Lagoon as one such lagoon and is considered the third most polluted lagoon in Ghana after the Korle and Chemu lagoons. Climate change variability has been associated with declining water resources among other factors. Climate change studies in Ghana have shown that major basins in the country are already experiencing water stress and with increasing environmental <b>deterioration,</b> <b>limited</b> water availability and pollution would have tremendous negative impact on aquatic ecosystems including coastal waters such as lagoons. The study revealed that the Fosu Lagoon is covered with mats of mixed vegetation (with Paspalum vaginatum and Typha domingensis dominating) which grow around the banks and over shallow sections of the Lagoon and parts of the landing sites. The weeds contribute to health problems by providing suitable habitats, refuge and food for vectors of water-borne and water related diseases (snails Biomphalaria sp. and Bulinus sp. for intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis and mosquitoes for malaria). Other macrophytes present include: Pistia stratiotes, Nymphaea sp., Eleocharis, Ipomoea aquatica, and the duckweeds. The death and decay of the plant matter is leading to the rapid silting up of the Lagoon and therefore a reduction in the volume of water to be stored as well as the quality thereby decreasing the oxygen content and inadvertently affecting the fauna through oxygen demand reduction. It is therefore being recommended that stringent control of anthropogenic pressures through integrated catchment management will ensure the restoration of the Fosu Lagoon.

No significant change was seen in large joint radiographs in sulphasalazine treated patients over two years, but this probably represents the poor sensitivity of the method of assessment. No significant correlation was seen between changes in inflammatory indices and slowing of radiological deterioration in erosion score. Thus sulphasalazine appears to slow the progression of radiological disease of the hands over the second year of treatment in a representative sample of patients who continue to receive treatment for two years...|$|R

Inequality within the forest community has also {{had a tendency to}} increase. The purposes of this chapter are (1) to review relevant literature on JFM, (2) to develop a multi-purpose model {{that could be used to}} identify conditions that can influence the likelihood of success of JFM in improving the welfare of those living and working in forest communities as well as making forest use more sustainable, and (3) to highlight the role of forest externalities and institutional conditions in analyzing the effects of JFM, and (4) to suggest applications and extensions that could provide valid policy implications tailored to specific circumstances. Although highly simplified, the model is designed so as to b...|$|R
25|$|Timber dams {{were widely}} used {{in the early part}} of the {{industrial}} revolution and in frontier areas due to ease and speed of construction. Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and <b>limit</b> <b>deterioration</b> by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head diversion dam is required or longevity is not an issue. Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures. Two common variations of timber dams were the crib and the plank.|$|R
40|$|The state-of-the-practice in seismic network {{reliability}} assessment of highway bridges often ignores bridge failure correlations imposed by {{factors such as}} the network topology, construction methods, and present-day condition of bridges, amongst others. Additionally, aging bridge seismic fragilities are typically determined using historical estimates of deterioration parameters. This research presents a methodology to estimate bridge fragilities using spatially interpolated and updated <b>deterioration</b> parameters from <b>limited</b> instrumented bridges in the network, while incorporating the impacts of overlooked correlation factors in bridge fragility estimates. Simulated samples of correlated bridge failures are used in an enhanced Monte Carlo method to assess bridge network reliability, and the impact of different correlation structures on the network reliability is discussed. The presented methodology aims to provide more realistic estimates of seismic reliability of aging transportation networks and potentially helps network stakeholders to more accurately identify critical bridges for maintenance and retrofit prioritization...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Age-related {{bone loss}} is {{associated}} with significant changes in bone remodelling characterized by decreased trabecular and periosteal bone formation relative to bone resorption, resulting in bone fragility and increased risk of fractures. Prevention or reversal of age-related decreased bone mass and increased bone fragility {{has been based on}} inhibition of bone resportion using anticatabolic drugs. The current challenge is to promote osteoblastogenesis and bone formation to prevent age-related bone <b>deterioration.</b> Methods: A <b>limited</b> number of approved therapeutic molecules is available to activate bone formation. There is therefore a need for anabolic drugs that promote bone matrix apposition at the endosteal, endocortical and periosteal envelopes through increasing the number of osteoblast precursor cells and/or the function of mature osteoblasts. Here, we review current therapeutics promoting bone formation, and anabolic molecules targeting signalling pathways involved in osteoblastogenesis, based on selected full-text articles searched on Medline search from 1990 to 2010. Results and discussion: We present current therapeutic approaches focused on intermitten...|$|R
40|$|Makapuno is a high-value {{commercial}} coconut with distinct sensory attributes, {{however the}} postharvest conditions {{required to maintain}} quality are unknown. To address this, partially de-husked mature Makapuno coconut fruit were stored at 2, 5 or 30 °C and were then evaluated after transferring to 30 °C for 3 days to simulate conditions in retail markets. During storage at 30 °C, the fruit showed a moderate respiration rate of 40 - 60 mgCO 2 kg - 1 h - 1, a low ethylene production rate of 0. 6 - 0. 8 μLC 2 H 4 kg - 1 h - 1 and storage life was 3 days. In contrast, storage at 2 °C or 5 °C markedly reduced respiration rates to 4 and 20 mgCO 2 kg - 1 h - 1, respectively, and storage-life increased dramatically from 3 days to 6 weeks. Generally, cold storage delayed fruit <b>deterioration</b> by <b>limiting</b> weight loss, kernel browning and malondialdehyde content, however, after the fruits were transferred to 30 °C, those previously held at 2 °C showed signs of chilling injury, while those held at 5 °C did not. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) using high oxygen transmission rate (OTR) bags in combination with 5 °C storage extended fruit storage-life 20 -fold, from 3 days at ambient conditions to 10 weeks. The combination of MAP and 5 °C storage reduced weight loss (4 -fold), the incidence of surface mold and the quality parameters measured were comparable to values in freshly harvested fruit. © 2014 Elsevier B.
