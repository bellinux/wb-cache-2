We find this substance in very great abundance in a multitude of cases where you would least expect it. All limestones contain a great deal of this gas which issues from the candle, and which we call carbonic acid. All chalks, all shells, all corals contain a great quantity of this curious air. We find it fixed in these stones; for which reason Dr. Black called it [...] "fixed air"--finding it in these fixed things like marble and chalk. He called it fixed air, because it lost its quality of air, and assumed the condition of a solid body. We can easily get this air from marble. Here is a jar containing a little muriatic acid, and here is a taper which, if I put it into that jar, will shew only the presence of common air. There is, you see, pure air down to the bottom; the jar is full of it Here is a substance--marble[17], a very beautiful and superior marble--and if I put these pieces of marble into the jar, a great boiling apparently goes on. That, however, is not steam--it is a gas that is rising up; and if I now search the jar by a candle, I shall have exactly the same effect produced upon the taper as I had from the air which issued {{from the end of the}} chimney over the burning candle. It is exactly the same action, and caused by the very same substance that issued from the candle; and in this way we can get carbonic acid in great abundance--{{we have a}}lready nearly filled the jar. We also find that this gas is not merely contained in marble. Here is a vessel in which I have put some common whitening--chalk, which has been washed in water and deprived of its coarser particles, and so supplied to the plasterer as whitening. Here is a large jar containing this whitening and water, and I have here some strong sulphuric acid, which is the acid you might have to use if you were to make these experiments (only, in using this acid with limestone, the body that is produced is an <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance,</b> whereas the muriatic acid produces a soluble substance that does not so much thicken the water). And you will seek out a reason why I take this kind of apparatus for the purpose of shewing this experiment. I do it because you may repeat in a small way what I am about to do in a large one. You will have here just the same kind of action; and I am evolving in this large jar carbonic acid, exactly the same in its nature and properties as the gas which we obtained from the combustion of the candle in the atmosphere. And no matter how different the two methods by which we prepare this carbonic acid, you will see, when we get to the end of our subject, that it is all exactly the same, whether prepared in the one way or in the other.|$|E

40|$|Aerosols affect {{precipitation}} by modifying cloud properties such as {{cloud droplet}} number concentration (CDNQ. Aerosol effects on CDNC depend on aerosol properties such as number concentration, size spectrum, and chemical composition. This study {{focuses on the}} effects of aerosol chemical composition on CDNC and, thereby, precipitation in a mesoscale cloud ensemble (MCE) driven by deep convective clouds. The NICE was observed during the 1997 department of energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) summer experiment. Double-moment microphysics with explicit nucleation parameterization, able to take into account those three properties of aerosols, is used to investigate the effects of aerosol chemical composition on CDNC and precipitation. The effects of aerosol chemical compositions are investigated for both soluble and insoluble substances in aerosol particles. The effects of soluble substances are examined by varying mass fractions of two representative soluble components of aerosols in the continental air mass: sulfate and organics. The increase in organics with decreasing sulfate lowers critical supersaturation (S,) and leads to higher CDNC. Higher CDNC results in smaller autoconversion of cloud liquid to rain. This provides more abundant cloud liquid as a source of evaporative cooling, leading to more intense downdrafts, low-level convergence, and updrafts. The resultant stronger updrafts produce more condensation and thus precipitation, as compared to the case of 100 % sulfate aerosols. The conventional assumption of sulfate aerosol as a surrogate for the whole aerosol mass can be inapplicable for the case with the strong sources of organics. The less precipitation is simulated when an <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> replaces organics as compared to when it replaces sulfate. When the effects of organics on the surface tension of droplet and solution term in the Kohler curve are deactivated by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance,</b> S, is raised more than when the effects of sulfate on the solution term are deactivated by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance.</b> This leads to lower CDNC and, thus, larger autoconversion of cloud liquid to rain, providing less abundant cloud liquid as a source of evaporative cooling. The resultant less evaporative cooling produces less intense downdrafts, weaker low-level convergence, updrafts, condensation and, thereby, less precipitation in the case where organics is replaced by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> than in the case where sulfate is replaced by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance.</b> The variation of precipitation caused by the change in the mass fraction between the soluble and insoluble substances is larger than that caused by the change in the mass fraction between the soluble substances.

Polyamide fibres with two different types of finishing are investigated by mean of several methods: optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Langmuir balance for monolayer study. Classical methods of observation and analysis (microscopy, XPS and ToF-SIMS) applied directly to the fibres do not show any difference in the two types of finishing.

For ionic strengths 10. 15, the dependence of qeq on pH exhibits a broad titration curve with a midpoint near pH 7. qeq was < 1. 2 in methanol, dimethylformamide, dimeth-ylsulfoxide, and chloroform. The ir absorbance from vinyl groups in the black pigment was only one-eighth that of unconjugated bilirubin, the primary chemical building block of PS; this implicates vinyl groups in the formation of a polymer network. The rise in qeq with in-creasing pH suggests that the carboxyl groups are free to ionize and are therefore not involved in the covalent bonds that make the crosslinked polymer.

Here we have assessed the cytotoxic effects of nonfractionated gruel and insoluble (ceroidlike) material derived from advanced human atheroma. Methods and Results: The insoluble material within advanced atherosclerotic plaque was isolated following protease K digestion and extensive extraction with aqueous and organic solvents. FTIR, Raman, and atomic absorption spectroscopy {{suggested that}}, despite its fluorescent nature, this material closely resembled hydroxyapatite and dentin, but also contained {{a significant amount of}} iron and calcium. When added to J 774 cells and human macrophages in culture, this <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> was phagocytosed, and progressive cell death followed. However, an even more cytotoxic activity was found in the atheromatous “gruel ” that contains abundant carbonyls/aldehydes. Cell death caused by both crude gruel and ceroid could be blocked by preincubating cells with the lipophilic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone, apoferritin, BAPTA/AM, or sodium borohydride, indicating that cellular iron, calcium, and reactive aldehyde(s) are responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. Conclusions: Toxic materials within atheromatous lesions include both ceroid and even more cytotoxic lipidaceous materials. The cytotoxic effects of these plaque components may help explain the persistence of atherosclerotic lesions. —Li...|$|E
40|$|Wheat straw is an {{abundant}} agricultural residue {{which can be}} used as a raw material for bioethanol production. Due to the high xylan content in wheat straw, fermentation of both xylose and glucose is crucial to meet desired overall yields of ethanol. In the present work a recombinant xylose fermenting strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TMB 3400, cultivated aerobically on wheat straw hydrolysate, was used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of steam pretreated wheat straw. The influence of fermentation strategy and temperature was studied in relation to xylose consumption, ethanol formation and by-product formation. In addition, model SSF experiments were made to further investigate the influence of temperature on xylose fermentation and by-product formation. In particular for SSF at the highest value of fibre content tested (9 % water <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance,</b> WIS), it was found that a fed-batch strategy was clearly superior to the batch process in terms of ethanol yield, where the fed-batch gave 71 % of the theoretical yield (based on all available sugars) in comparison to merely 59 % for the batch. Higher ethanol yields, close to 80 %, were obtained at a WIS-content of 7 %. Xylose fermentation significantly contributed to the overall ethanol yields. The choice of temperature in the range 30 - 37 degrees C was found to be important, especially at higher contents of water insoluble solids (WIS). The optimum temperature was found to be 34 degrees C for the raw material and yeast strain studied.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} meet the need of {{separating}} oil from water in the settling tank of the oilfield, ClO 2 treatment for oil-water transition layer in settling tank is introduced. The field test displayed that the technique was achieved by a good performance. For understanding the oxidation and mechanism, compositions of oil-water transition layer were comparatively studied for before/after ClO 2 -treatment in this paper. The experimental results show that the compositions before and after ClO 2 -treatment, including physical structure and chemical composition, were varied in the great extension. The physical structure, consisting of water, oil and solid phase, was reduced to less than 5 % of water and 0. 5 % of solid particle and increased to 95 % of oil in layer compared with before-treatment, easily leading to clearly separating water from oil. The chemical composition of iron sulfide and acid <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> in solid phase was decreased to more than 90 % while the carbonate was reduced more than 70 %. After the treatment, the viscosity reduction of the water phase in the layer was reached to 50 % after oxidation demulsification with ClO 2. The chemistry was discussed based on the principles and experiments. Due to ClO 2 destroying (oxidizing) the rigid interface membrane structure which is supported by natural surfactant, polymer and solid particles with interface-active materials, the action accelerates the separating of water and oil and sedimentation of insoluble residue of acid in the layer. By demonstrating the experimental data and discussion, we can effectively control the oxidation performance of chlorine dioxide, which is very meaningful for oilfield on the aspect of stable production of petroleum...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} cathode rays on the {{proteins}} of serum {{appear to be}} (1) denaturation of {{a large proportion of}} the albumin and globulin with the formation of products that are soluble at the pH of the serum; (2) the production of a tough and exceedingly <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> on the window of the cell where most of the absorption of electrons occurs; (3) a slight hydrolytic cleavage of the protein molecule producing a small quantity of products having properties so near to those of the protein that they are precipitated by trichloracetic acid but are not removed by coagulation at the isoelectric point; (4) the production of a small amount of hydrolytic products not precipitated by trichloracetic acid; and (5) the formation of a small amount of ammonia, part of which at least is derived from the urea in the serum. It is interesting to note that these changes are such as would bring about exactly those effects on fibroblasts which were observed when cultures were grown in serum which had been subjected to cathode ray irradiation. The proteins of serum have a retarding effect on the growth of fibroblasts. We might, therefore, expect their removal by denaturation and coagulation to result in the slightly larger growth which was observed. The production of SH groups in the denatured protein molecule would also tend to have a beneficial effect, as has been observed in experiments with denatured albumin. A concentration of protein split products equal to that in the irradiated sera has been observed to produce cells of characteristic appearance, full of cytoplasmic granulations and possessing long, active pseudopods, such as those noted in colonies cultivated in serum which had been subjected to cathode rays...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Douglas fir bark fines which {{contained}} 74. 8 percent of Klason lignin and 70. 2 percent {{of one percent}} sodium hydroxide solubility and decayed Douglas fir wood {{which contained}} 53. 9 percent of Klason lignin were subjected to ethanolysis. A slight modification of the Hibbert's ethanolysis procedure was used. The monomeric compounds present in the reaction products were then examined. Two fractions of ethyl ether soluble oil were obtained from both bark and wood samples, which were mixtures of monomeric compounds produced by the ethanolysis reaction. One, which was designated "PE" fraction, was obtained by an ether extraction of a tar-like water <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> of the ethanolysis products, {{and the other one}} designated "LE" fraction was obtained by the ether extraction of a water solution of the water soluble ethanolysis product. Two dimensional paper partition chromatography of these ether soluble oils demonstrated the presence of 12 compounds in the bark "PE" fraction, four compounds in the bark "LE" fraction and nine compounds in the wood "LE" fraction. The wood "PE" fraction gave the same chromatogram as the wood "LE". In the wood "LE", the typical Hibbert's monomers, 1 -ethoxy- 1 -guaiacyl- 2 -propanone, 2 -ethoxy- 1 -guaiacyl-lpropanone, guaiacyl-acetone, vanilloyl-acetyle, vanillin, and vanillic acid were identified. Ethyl ferulate was isolated from the bark "PE", which was the only C₆-C₃, phenyl propane type compound obtained from the ethanolysis of the bark fines sample. Ethyl protocatechuate, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid were isolated from the bark "PE" and "LE". Ethyl vanillate was isolated from the bark "LE". Identification of the esters was confirmed by comparison with authentic samples prepared by synthesis. From these results, it was concluded that the major monomeric compounds which were produced by the ethanolysis reaction of the bark fines were ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Controlled release {{formulations}} {{deliver an}} active ingredient {{over an extended}} period of time. It is an ideal dosage form for an active ingredient with a short elimination half-life. An active ingredient with a short elimination half-life would be released in small portions {{over an extended period}} of time and thus less frequent administration is necessary and this improve patient compliance. Other advantages of these formulations include: decreased side effects, constant drug levels in the blood, improvement in treatment efficiency and reduction in cost of administration. Controlled release beads are formulated in such a way that the active ingredient is embedded in a matrix of <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> like chitosan; the dissolving drug then has to find its way through the pores of the matrix into the surrounding medium. The chitosan matrix swells to form a gel, the drug then has to first dissolve in the matrix and diffuse through the outer surface into the surrounding medium. Chitosan is a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer of natural origin. It has mucoadhesive properties as well as the ability to manipulate the tight junctions in the epithelium membrane and these properties have qualified chitosan as an effective drug carrier in controlled release dosage forms. The effect of a modern controlled release polymer namely Kollidon® SR in combination with chitosan on drug release was investigated. Ketoprofen was chosen as model drug. Ketoprofen is an anti-inflammatory drug that causes gastrointestinal side effects in conventional dosage forms. Ketoprofen has a short elimination half-life of 2. 05 ± 0. 58 h and this characteristic makes it an ideal candidate for use in a controlled release formulation. The aim of this study was to achieve controlled release and minimize gastrointestinal effects of ketoprofen with chitosan particles. Kollidon® SR was used as polymer because it exhibits pH independent release characteristics and previous studies have shown potential for this combination. Chitosan beads and chitosan-Kollidon® SR beads, as well as chitosan granules and chitosan-Kollidon® SR granules, were prepared and investigated as potential controlled release formulations. Chitosan beads were prepared through the inotropic gelation method using tripolyphosphate as a cross linking agent. Granules were prepared through wet granulation using 2 % v/v acetic acid as the granulating fluid or by dissolving ketoprofen in ethanol and Kollidon® SR in 2 -pyrrolidinone and using the solution as granulating fluid. Kollidon® SR was added in concentrations of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 % (w/v) in the bead formulations and concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 % (w/w) in the granule formulations. The beads and granules were characterised by evaluating the following properties: morphology, drug loading and drug release. Additionally swelling and friability tests were also conducted on the bead formulations. The cross linking times of the bead formulations were varied to investigate the effect of cross linking time on the characteristics of the beads. Chitosan-Kollidon® SR beads showed promising results for controlled release formulations and ketoprofen were released {{over an extended period of}} time. Drug loading of the plain chitosan beads was 74. 65 ± 0. 71 % and it was noted that the inclusion of Kollidon® SR in the beads resulted in an increase in drug loading and the formulation containing 1 % (w/v) Kollidon® SR, cross linked for 30 minutes had a drug loading of 77. 38 ± 0. 01 %. Drug loading of the beads that were cross linked for a longer time were slightly lower which is an indication that some of the drug might have leached out during cross linking. The degree of swelling was promising with some beads swelling to a degree of 2. 5 in phosphate buffer solution pH 5. 6. Granules had a drug loading between 81. 73 ± 1. 53 % and 93. 30 ± 0. 50 %. Ketoprofen release from the beads and the granules in PBS pH 7. 40 at 37 °C over a period of 6 hours were investigated. The bead formulations were more effective in achieving controlled release and it was noted that the bead formulations that was cross linked for a longer period was more efficient in achieving controlled release. The granules did not form a matrix and were not effective in achieving controlled release. Controlled release of ketoprofen were achieved and the results show potential for chitosan-Kollidon® SR formulations in the future. Master...|$|E

These changes include whey protein denaturation, protein-protein interaction, lactose-protein interaction, isomerisation of lactose, Maillard browning, sulphydryl compound formation, formation {{of a range of}} carbonyl and other flavoursome compounds, and formation of <b>insoluble</b> <b>substances.</b> They ultimately reduce the quality and limit the shelf life of UHT milk through development of off-flavours, fat separation, age gelation and sedimentation. The extent of these changes depends on many factors, a major one being the type of UHT heating. This review compares the effect heating milk by direct and indirect modes on various aspects of processing and quality of UHT milk...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Egg white {{contains}} four high-quantity proteins {{which have}} numerous applications. In this research, {{a simple and}} efficient method for the purification of those proteins was designed and performed based on ion exchange chromatography. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study egg white was initially separated from <b>insoluble</b> <b>substances</b> by acidic pH. The resulting extract was isolated after two steps of ion exchange chromatography using CM-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose columns, respectively. Purification degree and yield of each fraction were analyzed by electrophoresis densitometry. Results: The results showed that purification degrees of ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, ovomucoid and lysozyme were 97, 98, 85 and 99 percent and their yields were 98, 98 95 and 99 percent, respectively. Conclusion: High yields, reproducibility and feasibility on low or high scales are considered as the strengths of this method...|$|R
