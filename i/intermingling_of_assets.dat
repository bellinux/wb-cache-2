40|$|Abstract Clonal growth, {{which allows}} the {{multiplication}} of flowering shoots of the same genet, {{can lead to a}} large floral display and may thus increase the rate of selfing through geitonogamy as a consequence of {{an increase in the number}} of successively visited flowers. The aim of the present research was to analyse the combined effect of the diversity and <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> clones on the rate of selfing in Vaccinium myrtillus. Four mother plants were selected within patches characterised by contrasting clonal structure (low versus high number and <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> clones). The selfing rate was significantly lower for plants situated within patches characterised by a high number <b>of</b> <b>intermingled</b> clones (3 %) than for plants situated in patches with a low number of clones (50 %). Therefore, for this species suffering from inbreeding depression, an increase in the number or the <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> the clones could reduce the rate and the cost of geitonogamy and allow a large floral display to attract pollinators. We also found that the main pollinators, bumblebee queens, presented a foraging behaviour favouring geitonogamy, as their successive visits to flowers were quite short (89 % of flights were 40 cm or less) ...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{variables}} on an uncongested Internet wire exhibit a pervasive nonstationarity. As {{the rate of}} new TCP connections increases, arrival processes (packet and connection) tend locally toward Poisson, and time series variables (packet sizes, transferred file sizes, and connection round-trip times) tend locally toward independent. The cause of the nonstationarity is superposition: the <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> sequences of connections between different source-destination pairs, and the <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> sequences of packets from different connections. We show this empirically by extensive study of packet traces for nine links coming from four packet header databases. We show it theoretically by invoking the mathematical theory of point processes and time series. If the connection rate on a link gets sufficiently high, the variables can be quite close to Poisson and independent; if major congestion occurs on the wire before the rate gets sufficiently high, then the progression toward Poisson and independent can be arrested for some variables...|$|R

The alternative situation to invasion, one characteristic of most coherent tissues, is segregation, with identifiable boundaries existing between contiguous tissues.

Thus, invasion and tissue segregatio...|$|R

This study set out to examine how the <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> cultures has affected the use of symbols in appearance management in Mutare, Zimbabwe. The study was guided by three research questions: 1) what meanings do the different cultures in Chisamba area assign to their adornment symbols? 2) How have the meanings been affected by the <b>intermingling</b> <b>of</b> cultures? 3) Do these meanings still portray their cultural beliefs? In-depth interviews of 40 participants and non-participant observations were used for data collection. For some participants meanings of symbols attached to dress and appearance management have changed while some have been completely lost. The erosion of cultural meanings was attributed to contact between cultures and globilisation...|$|R
