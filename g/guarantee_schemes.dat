5000|$|Agreeing on {{a common}} European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS): A new common deposit {{insurance}} would be less vulnerable than the current national deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes,</b> towards eruption of local shocks (in particular when both the sovereign and its national banking sector is perceived by the market {{to be in a}} fragile situation). It would also carry less risk for needing injection of additional public money to service its payment of deposit guarantees in the event of severe crisis, as failing risks would be spread more widely across all member states while its private sector funds would be raised over a much larger pool of financial institutions. EDIS would just like the national deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> be privately funded through ex ante risk-based fees paid by all the participating banks in the Member States, and be devised {{in a way that would}} prevent moral hazard. Establishment of a fully-fledged EDIS will take time.

5000|$|Access {{to finance}} {{remains one of}} the key {{problems}} for enterprises operating in Syria particularly for small and medium enterprises (SME's). In spite of the reforms initiated by the government and the Central Bank of Syria, the legal and regulatory environment remained relatively underdeveloped and the ranges of banking and financial services for the enterprise sector were limited. Syria ranked 181st out of 183 economies worldwide in the ease of getting credit, putting the country in the bottom three. As of 2009, credit information services and credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> or credit bureau registry that could supported access to credit by reducing collateral requirements were not available in Syria. Few microfinance facilities exist and most of these operate as pilot projects. Although the Commercial Bank of Syria (its largest state-owned bank) was officially charged in February 2009 with increasing loans for small business startups, a climate of corruption may deter many would-be entrepreneurs.|$|E

The bill would make it possible for Britain and the Netherlands to recoup the €4bn of minimum deposit guarantees, which they had paid on behalf of the money drained Icelandic minimum deposit guarantee fund to the British and UK Icesave customers who had lost all their savings with the bankruptcy of Landsbanki in October 2008. The two governments would receive payments over the next 14 years after compensating the losses of more than 320,000 of the bank's customers. In the UK, deposits of up to £50,000 per account holder had been guaranteed by the British government under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

40|$|Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are {{considered}} as {{backbone of the}} national economies, whether developing, or developed nations, due to their contribution to economic growth and capital accumulation. In Malaysia, therefore, the government has formulated various strategies to encourage development of the SMEs with the objectives of economic growth, capital accumulation and creating employment opportunities. One of such strategies resulted {{in the formation of}} Credit Guarantee Corporation, as a guarantor for the SMEs. The booming phenomenon of Islamic finance especially in Malaysia has influenced the CGC to come up with Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme,</b> parallel with the demand of Islamic financing products in the country. However, since the scheme was introduced by the Corporation, in general, the performance of the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> has not performed as expected and has not been as competitive as the conventional <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme,</b> even though the scheme has recorded positive growth for its products since the inception. This study, therefore, aims to explore the various demand conditions for the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> with the objective of finding possible solutions for the gaps exist in the scheme. A survey schedule was conducted through e-mail questionnaires directed to the SME entrepreneurs. The data was analyzed by using SPSS version 15. The findings indicate that there are some gaps in the scheme's operations pertaining to promotional aspects, product development, staff competency, and government involvement. Hence, the effectiveness of the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> can be questioned, although, undeniably there are some who have benefited from the services. It should also be stated {{that the majority of the}} entrepreneurs, due to such reasons, are excluded benefiting the positive side of the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> due to the glitches in the system. This study, therefore, concludes that improvements related to various aspects of the CGC are needed in order to ensure that the Islamic <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> is continuously expanding in the future...|$|R

We investigate stock insurers’ risk-shifting behavior for insurance <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> under the two different financing alternatives: a flat-rate premium assessment versus a risk-based premium assessment. We identify which guarantee scheme maximizes policyholders ’ welfare, measured by their expected utility. We find that the risk-based insurance guarantee scheme can only mitigate the insurer’s risk-shifting behavior if a substantial premium loading is present. Furthermore, the risk-based guarantee scheme is superior for improving policyholders ’ welfare compared to the flat-rate scheme when the mitigating effect occurs...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} in the MENA region have established partial credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> to facilitate SME access to finance. These schemes {{can play an important}} role, especially in a period where MENA governments are making efforts to improve the effectiveness of credit registries and bureaus and strengthen creditor rights. This paper reviews the design of partial credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA, and assesses their preliminary outcomes. The paper is based on a survey conducted in 10 MENA {{countries in}} early 2010. The authors find that the average size of <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA (measured by the total value of outstanding guarantees) is in line with the international average, although there are wide differences across countries, and some schemes seem too small to make any significant impact. Most importantly, the number of guarantees looks generally small while their average value looks large. This suggests that <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> are not yet reaching the smaller firms. <b>Guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA look financially sound and most schemes have room to grow. However, this growth should be accompanied by an improvement of some key design and management features, as well as the introduction of systematic impact evaluation reviews.
