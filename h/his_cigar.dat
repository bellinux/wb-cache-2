5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on <b>his</b> <b>cigar,</b> attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan {{what his}} {{intentions}} are, {{and does not}} like what she hears. A defeated Jody finds his father alone in their barn. Jody bolts the entrance and sets the barn on fire, but he cannot {{go through with it}} and releases Will. The incident leads to a reconciliation between father and son. Men from town assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him, but Will claims he accidentally started the fire by dropping <b>his</b> <b>cigar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on <b>his</b> <b>cigar</b> while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E

25|$|Known for <b>his</b> <b>cigar</b> smoking, {{he usually}} wears European clothes, {{and he likes}} American colloquialisms and American history. In Washington, he earned a {{reputation}} for partying and drinking. He may have recently abandoned alcohol after a death scare in the family. In the mid-1990s, he suffered his first depression. His health problems {{were reported to have}} continued into the 2010s, often being treated abroad.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} hastily built wooden {{factories}} constructed by Ybor and Haya, {{some of the}} first structures in Ybor City were 50 small houses (‘’casitas’’) for prospective employees. These narrow shotgun-style homes (so called because a shot fired through the front door would theoretically exit harmlessly out of the aligned back door) were small wooden structures, but they were well-built and relatively comfortable. Ybor offered them for sale at a price just above his cost to build them (initially $400), payable in small deductions from the workers’ salary in <b>his</b> <b>cigar</b> factory.|$|E
25|$|Hightower {{claimed that}} the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they {{threatened}} that the idol would curse him. On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower {{held a press conference}} about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out <b>his</b> <b>cigar.</b> Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life.|$|E
60|$|Difficult {{to believe}} it was so long ago; he felt young still! Of all his thoughts, as he stood there {{counting}} <b>his</b> <b>cigars,</b> this was the most poignant, the most bitter. With his white head and his loneliness he had remained young and green at heart. And those Sunday afternoons on Hampstead Heath, when young Jolyon and he went for a stretch along the Spaniard's Road to Highgate, to Child's Hill, and back over the Heath again to dine at Jack Straw's Castle--how delicious <b>his</b> <b>cigars</b> were then! And such weather! There was no weather now.|$|R

[...] Nemo prevents the two others from fighting and takes control of their forms—he stretches and squashes them with the raising and lowering of his arms. [...] Nemo then draws the Princess and brings her to animated life. [...] He gives her a rose which has suddenly grown nearby, just as a gigantic dragon appears. [...] The pair seat themselves on a throne in the dragon's mouth and wave to the audience as the dragon carries them away.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being caught}} {{unprepared}} by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout. Finding Grant {{at the end}} of the day sitting under an oak tree in the darkness and smoking a cigar, Sherman felt, in his words, [...] "some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat". In what would become one of the most notable conversations of the war, Sherman said simply: [...] "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" [...] After a puff of <b>his</b> <b>cigar,</b> Grant replied calmly: [...] "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though." [...] Sherman proved instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of April 7, 1862. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, and he was promoted to major general of volunteers, effective May 1, 1862.|$|E

In the later books, Sandecker is always confused as to how Giordino can have identical custom cigars, yet none of the Admiral's cigars are ever missing.

500|$|By late 1910, McCay {{had made}} the 4000 rice-paper {{drawings}} for the animated portion of the film. [...] Each was assigned a serial number, and marks {{were made in the}} top corners for registration. [...] They were mounted on sheets of cardboard to make them easier to handle and photograph. [...] Before he had them photographed, he tested them on a hand-cranked [...] Mutoscope-like machine to ensure the animation was fluid. [...] Photography was done at the Vitagraph Studios under the supervision of Blackton. [...] The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length. [...] In only one sequence did McCay use an animation loop for a repeated action: he re-used a series of seven drawings six times (three forward, three back) to have Flip move <b>his</b> <b>cigar</b> up and down in his mouth three times. [...] McCay made more extensive use of this technique in his later films.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{much of his}} career, McCain {{was known}} for his short and thin stature, salty character, and {{trademark}} cigar. [...] One superior wrote that: [...] "There is only one Jack McCain! Vice Admiral McCain, by his enthusiasm, honesty and delightful personality makes many friends, not only officially but socially.... The 'little man with the big cigar' is known to everyone." [...] McCain liked to confer with enlisted men and get their opinions. [...] He swore so much he earned the sobriquet [...] "Good Goddamn McCain"; his regular greeting to begin the day was [...] "Good goddamn morning." [...] He was often asked how he told his wife Roberta and her identical twin sister Rowena apart, to which he famously responded by puffing <b>his</b> <b>cigar,</b> flashing a grin, and saying, [...] "That's their problem." [...] He jumped rope 200 times a day as part of keeping fit. [...] He developed a problem with alcoholism during his career, and cut back on his drinking so that it did not interfere with his ability to command or show up on fitness reports, although he occasionally suffered lapses.|$|E
500|$|The Grandmother's Sitting Room is {{situated}} {{at the front of}} the eastern wing. It is noted for its deep blue hand-painted frescoes and formal furniture, and was the favourite room of Charles and Diana's grandmother, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer. Nearby was the Muniment Room in which the Spencer family records were kept, described as a [...] "musty apartment" [...] which contained over 500 years of history, from medieval household accounts to letters from Jacobeans and accounts of Victorian house parties. The room was a favourite haunt of Spencer's grandfather, Albert Spencer, who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history. So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722), Albert immediately doused out <b>his</b> <b>cigar</b> in fear of creating a fire. The records were sold to the British Library in the 1980s, leaving the room empty, before it was converted to what is known as the [...] "Steward's Room Flat". This part of the house once had an extensive collection of 1830s bull paintings by Richard Ansdell.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} several {{male and female}} models dressed up as {{soldiers}} on a fashion runway, wearing military garb and gas masks with one male model sports a shirt that reads [...] "Fashion Victim" [...] while it is inter-cut with scenes of Madonna singing {{in front of a}} black background. In the second chorus, middle-eastern children are seen walking on the runway, and being bullied by the soldier models. During the bridge, Madonna and her group prepare to enter the runway in a restroom, while she carves [...] "Protect Me" [...] on the partition of a stall and dances angrily with them to the song. The women also are seen dancing in front of surveillance cameras. When the rap section starts, Madonna is seen crashing into the show driving a Mini Cooper and pummel the photographers with an industrial-strength water hose, while rapping and dancing on top of the car with her gang. In the end of the video, Madonna frantically drives out of the runway into the amused audience, and pull a hand grenade with her teeth and then throws it to George W. Bush, and the video ends with him using it to light up <b>his</b> <b>cigar.</b>|$|E
500|$|In Washington, D.C., both Blaine and Sherman were {{disappointed}} by their first-ballot vote totals. Blaine {{had been told}} that he should expect around 300 first-ballot votes, but his actual total fell sixteen short, and it was also one vote fewer than the total he received on the first ballot at the 1876 Convention. Sherman was told to expect 110 votes, which was significantly lower than the expected totals for Blaine and Grant. However, Sherman felt his chance would come later, when the Grant vote split apart. After Sherman heard his first-ballot vote totals, he grew visibly angry that [...] "some of them [...] were taken away from him before the ballot began." [...] He was upset that nine Ohio delegates bolted from Sherman and voted instead for his opponent, James G. Blaine. Sherman blamed Blaine for causing the delegates to bolt from Ohio [...] "by [...] falsehood, ridicule and treachery." [...] In Galena, Illinois, Grant did not express any emotions after being told about the first-ballot vote totals. As one newsman reported, [...] "he silent soldier was smoking <b>his</b> <b>cigar</b> with all his usual serenity." [...] Grant's wife, Julia, expected a deadlock, and suggested to her husband that he surprise the delegates in Chicago with a visit. Grant thought this was unwise because it gave an appearance of bad luck and bad manners. Despite his wife's attempts to change his mind, Grant remained adamant.|$|E
