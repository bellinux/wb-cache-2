50|$|The Framework Decision prescribes {{time limits}} for {{the making of}} a final {{decision}} to a surrender request. Where a requested person consents to his or her surrender, the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> should make a final decision within ten days of such a consent. Where a requested person refuses to consent to his or her surrender, the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> should make a final decision within 60 days of the arrest. In 2011 the European Commission reported that the average time for the surrender of persons who consented was 16 days while the average time for those who did not consent was 48.6 days.|$|E

40|$|The {{political}} {{integration in}} the EU, made {{the rules of the}} mutual legal assistance insufficient. The old model of mutual assistance was replaced approaching the judicial cooperation within the EU to the cooperation between judges from the same State. For this purpose it was necessary to find a balance between unification and diversity. The selective interoperability between the diverse legal systems of the Member States was the {{solution to the problem of}} the fragmentation of the criminal Justice in the European Union. Not all the judicial decisions are interoperable, but only those that were defined as equivalent resolutions in the European common rules. In this system the recognition is widely guaranteed by establishing a compulsory distribution of the competences between <b>executing</b> and issuing <b>judicial</b> <b>authorities,</b> preventing the examination of the internal aspects and basis of the issued resolution by the judge of the executing State, and establishing a strong limitation of the grounds for refusal and of the elements that can be considered by the executing judge. All this together with some limited possibilities offered to the States to reduce the impact of the mutual recognition to protect the national legal identity...|$|R

50|$|A state {{wishing to}} prosecute a {{surrendered}} person for offences committed before {{his or her}} surrender, or extradite a surrendered person to a third state, must, subject to certain exception, obtain {{the permission of the}} <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority.</b> Such a request is made in the same form as a European Arrest Warrant, and granted or refused using the same rules which determine whether surrender would be granted or refused.|$|E
40|$|In this case, the CJEU {{answers the}} {{question}} whether Article 1 (3) of the Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant must be interpreted as meaning that when there are strong indications that detention conditions in the issuing Member State infringe Article 4 of the Charter, the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> must refuse surrender of the person against whom a European arrest warrant is issued. The CJEU rules that if, after a two-stage assessment, the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> finds {{that there is a}} real risk of an Article 4 violation for the requested person once surrendered, the execution of the arrest warrant must initially be deferred and, where such a risk cannot be discounted, the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> must {{decide whether or not to}} terminate the surrender procedure.

40|$|This case-note {{provides}} a critical overview of Joined Cases C- 404 / 15 and C- 659 / 15 PPU, Aranyosi and Căldăraru. The CJEU tries {{to reconcile the}} principles of mutual trust and recognition with {{the protection of the}} fundamental rights of the requested person. Instead of introducing a new ground of refusal for a European Arrest Warrant based on the breach of fundamental rights, the CJEU opted for a ground of postponement. Furthermore, it brings its two-tier ‘systemic deficiencies’ test closer to the standards used by the ECtHR and encourages dialogue between the issuing and executing judicial authorities. Nevertheless, the scope of application of the new ground of postponement is not entirely clear and it is not yet sure what happens after the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> postpones its decision due to evidence of a real risk that the requested person will be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the issuing Member State...|$|E

40|$|The year 2016 offered two {{additional}} opportunities to the ECJ to pronounce {{itself on the}} crucial and tricky tension between {{the preservation of the}} criminal policy’s effectiveness {{on the one hand and}} the concrete protection of Human Rights on the other. In its first judgment Aranyosi and Căldăraru 2, rendered in April and already widely discussed 3, the Court had to rule on the protection of the principle of human dignity and the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatments in the field of EU criminal cooperation. The question submitted to the ECJ was whether solid evidence, showing that the detention conditions in a Member State issuing a European arrest warrant (hereafter: EAW) were incompatible with fundamental rights, could allow or oblige the <b>executing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> of a requested Member State to refuse the execution of that arrest warrant. A few months later, a similar question was raised but this time in the field of International cooperation. More specifically the ECJ was asked under which conditions in terms of protection of fundamental rights Mr. Petruhhin, an Estonian citizen who had made use of his right to move freely within the EU, could be surrendered upon an extradition request by Latvia to a third country, Russia...|$|E
