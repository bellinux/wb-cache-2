5|$|Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. He says {{there will be no}} more attacks, as they need peace to assemble men <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> attack. The three agree that they should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E
5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the field. After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball with a first down at its 30-yard line. The Hokie drive fizzled, as had most of the offense in the third quarter, after DeShazo was sacked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> loss on third down. Indiana returned the Tech punt to its 43-yard line, and Indiana brought in its backup quarterback, Chris Dittoe, to lead the offense. After being sacked on his first play, Dittoe completed a pass to near midfield, making up the yardage that had been lost on the sack. Despite that gain, Indiana couldn't make up the yardage lost to the sack {{and appeared to be}} ready to punt the ball. Instead, the Hoosiers faked the punt and threw a pass to an undefended Indiana player who dropped the ball. Following the turnover, Virginia Tech's offense started work at the Indiana 49-yard line. After being stopped short on two rushes, DeShazo completed a 42-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, who raced down the field and into the end zone. The extra point was good, and with 9:37 remaining in the game, Tech took a 3513 lead.|$|E
