5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds.

Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need <b>for</b> <b>increased</b> coordination between agencies.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that subjects can exhibit a preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> payments. Smith (2009 a) [Smith, J. (2009 a). Imperfect Memory and the Preference <b>for</b> <b>Increasing</b> Payments. Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics, 165 (4), 684 - 700. ] makes a related prediction {{that the difference}} between the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> wage payments and the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> non-wage payments will be largest for intermediate payments. We find evidence consistent with this prediction. Consistent with previous experiments, we find that the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> payments is increasing {{in the size of the}} payments. Also consistent with the literature, we find that the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> wage payments is stronger than the preference for non-wage payments. Our results contribute to the understanding of the optimal sequencing of wage payments over time...|$|R

5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons <b>for</b> <b>increased</b> {{competition}} within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>increased</b> income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} found that {{subjects}} prefer an improving sequence of income over a constant sequence, even if the constant sequence offers a larger present-discounted value. However, little is known about how these preferences vary with the size of the wage payments. In each of four studies, we find a positive relationship between the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> payments {{and the size of the}} payments. We find no evidence that our measure of the decreasing marginal utility of money is associated with this relationship. Additionally, we find weak evidence in support of a theoretical prediction that the difference between the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> wage payments and the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> nonwage payments will be largest for intermediate amounts. We do not find a relationship between the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> payments and the preference for improving nonmonetary sequences. Finally, the relationship between the preference <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> payments and the size of the payments does not appear to be sensitive to the precise specification of the increases...|$|R
