40|$|This article {{describes}} {{research on the}} associations between self-concept structure and sense of personal identity. Particular emphasis {{was given to the}} feature of self-concept differentiation (SCD). Notably, it was examined whether the effects of SCD on such aspects of self-experience as sense of having inner contents, sense of uniqueness, sense of one’s own boundaries, sense of coherence, sense of continuity in time, and sense of self-worth depend on individuals’ epistemic motivation, and more specifically their joint need for cognition, reflection, and integrative self-knowledge scores. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles of epistemic motivation: disengaged, engaged and struggling, and engaged and <b>integrating</b> <b>group.</b> Subsequent analysis showed, first, that the three groups differed in SCD and sense of identity, with the epistemically disengaged group having the highest levels of SCD, and the epistemically engaged and <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> having consistently the strongest sense of identity. Second, and more importantly, it showed that SCD was negatively related to overall sense of identity, and, in particular, senses of having inner contents, coherence and continuity in time, but only among individuals in the epistemically engaged and struggling group...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although bipolar {{disorder}} {{and substance use}} disorder frequently co-occur, there is little information {{on the effectiveness of}} behavioral treatment for this population. <b>Integrated</b> <b>group</b> therapy, which addresses the two disorders simultaneously, was compared with group drug counseling, which focuses on substance use. The authors hypothesized that patients receiving <b>integrated</b> <b>group</b> therapy would have fewer days of substance use and fewer weeks ill with {{bipolar disorder}}. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial compared 20 weeks of <b>integrated</b> <b>group</b> therapy or group drug counseling with 3 months of posttreatment follow-up. Sixty-two patients with bipolar disorder and current substance dependence, treated with mood stabilizers for 3 ̆eor= 2 weeks, were randomly assigned to <b>integrated</b> <b>group</b> therapy (N= 31) or group drug counseling (N= 31). The primary outcome measure was the number of days of substance use. The primary mood outcome was the number of weeks ill with a mood episode. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly fewer days of substance use for <b>integrated</b> <b>group</b> therapy patients during treatment and follow-up. Groups were similar in the number of weeks ill with bipolar disorder during treatment and follow-up, although <b>integrated</b> <b>group</b> therapy patients had more depressive and manic symptoms.

40|$|Averaging {{estimates}} is {{an effective}} way to improve accuracy when combining expert judgments, <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> members ’ judgments, or using advice to modify personal judgments. If the estimates of two judges ever fall on different sides of the truth, which we term bracketing, averaging must outperform the average judge for convex loss functions, such as Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). We hypothesized that people often hold incorrect beliefs about averaging, falsely concluding that the average of two judges ’ estimates would be no more accurate than the average judge. The experiments confirmed that this misconception was common across a range of tasks that involved reasoning from summary data (Experiment 1), from specific instances (Experiment 2), and conceptually (Experiment 3). However, this misconception decreased as observed or assumed bracketing rate increased (all three studies) and when bracketing was made more transparent (Experiment 2). Experiment 4 showed that flawed inferential rules and poor extensional reasoning abilities contributed to the misconception. We conclude by describing how people may face few opportunities to learn the benefits of averaging and how misappreciating averaging contributes to poor intuitive strategies for combining estimates...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory of}} {{leadership}} effectiveness in small discussion/decision-making groups is developed to facilitate discussion and goal efficacy. Based upon two task dimensions specified by Shaw (1973), a fourfold typology of group motivation is developed. Four leadership styles (coordinator, inventor, enthusiast, and director) are developed focusing on two critical {{questions that the}} group leader must address. Specific behavioral examples are explicated for the four leadership styles. Implications of the model for leadership training and group intervention are discussed. Without a doubt, the leadership role {{is one of the}} most important positions within any small group in its direct influence on group process and outcome(s). Various theories <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> leadership and group behavior have been proposed, and each of these theories specifically hypothesizes that the effectiveness of a group is in large part a function of the individual occupying the designated leadership role. Thus, individuals engaging in the role of leader are responsible for undertaking certain actions intended to facilitate the movement of the group toward its goals. Yet, although group tasks are often idiosyncratic to a particular organization, certain group processes are common to all organizations.

40|$|Previous {{cognitive}} {{models of}} memory have not comprehensively {{taken into account}} the internal cognitive load of chunking isolated information and have emphasized the external cognitive load of visual presentation only. Under the Virk Long Term Working Memory Multimedia Model of cognitive load, drawing from the Cowan model, students presented with integrated animations of the key neural signal transmission subcomponents where the interrelationships between subcomponents are visually and verbally explicit, were hypothesized to perform significantly better on free response and diagram labeling questions, than students presented with isolated animations of these subcomponents. This is because the internal attentional cognitive load of chunking these concepts is greatly reduced and hence the overall cognitive load is less for the <b>integrated</b> visuals <b>group</b> than the isolated group, despite the higher external load for the <b>integrated</b> <b>group</b> of having the interrelationships between subcomponents presented explicitly. Experiment 1 demonstrated that integrating the subcomponents of the neuron significantly enhanced comprehension of the interconnections between cellular subcomponents and approached significance for enhancing recall of the layered molecular correlates of the cellular structures and their interconnections.

40|$|Abstract—Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly used for studying functional integration of the brain. However, large inter-subject variability in functional connectivity, particularly in disease populations, renders detection of representative group networks challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, “group replicator dynamics ” (GRD), for detecting sparse functional brain networks that are common across a group of subjects. We extend the replicator dynamics (RD) approach, which we show to be a solution of the nonnegative sparse principal component analysis problem, by <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> information into each subject’s RD process. Our proposed strategy effectively coaxes all subjects ’ networks to evolve towards the common network of the group. This results in sparse networks comprising the same brain regions across subjects yet with subject-specific weightings of the identified brain regions. Thus, in contrast to traditional averaging approaches, GRD enables inter-subject variability to be modeled, which facilitates statistical group inference. Quantitative validation of GRD on synthetic data demonstrated superior network detection performance over standard methods. When applied to real fMRI data, GRD detected task-specific networks that conform well to prior neuroscience knowledge.

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} a central premise {{concerning}} grouping for learning in classrooms, follows with two challenges and concludes by identifying how the study of social pedagogy of classrooms is developing. The central premise is that children are always found seated or working {{in some form of}} grouping in their classrooms, but that many of these groupings actually inhibit learning and the motivation to learn. Thus, the first challenge is to understand how pupil groups are currently used in schools – and how this may inhibit learning. To understand why pupil groups may not be effective in promoting learning, and how they may be changed to support learning, the chapter will consider the use of pupil groups within their natural classroom context. The paper will focus, in the main, on research related to primary schools and will provide a review of current grouping practices in classrooms, particularly in England. The second challenge asks how group working can be made more effective. We draw upon recently completed large scale research in the UK. The SPRinG project is distinctive in <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> work across the curriculum and over the school year. It was developed through extensive collaboration with teachers. It stresses a relational approach that integrates communication skills with trust and respect, and helps pupils plan, organise and evaluate their group work...|$|E
40|$|Members in a {{household}} {{interact with each other}} when allocating their limited time resources to various activities, reflecting role specification and power structure within the household. For each member, some of activities are competitive in time allocation. In addition, each member might show different interest in or attach different importance to different activities. To reflect such complicated behavioral mechanisms, we developed two types of household time allocation models by <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> decision-making theory and Becker’s time allocation theory. One assumes a multi-linear household utility function and another adopts an iso-elastic function. These two types of utilities explicitly reflect relative influence of each member in household decision and inter-member (or intra-household) interaction. In representing intra-household interaction, these two types of utility functions overlap functionally. Each member’s utility is further defined to incorporate relative importance of each activity and inter-activity interaction based on the multi-linear function. Using a large-scale national time use data collected in Japan, the effectiveness of the two models was first empirically confirmed. It is found that there is no significant difference in model accuracy between the two models on one hand, but different intra-household interactions are estimated on the other. This might suggest that to reach the same decision outcomes (refer to the allocated time patterns, here), several types of household decision-making rules might be applicable. In addition, to examine the applicability of the models to policy analysis, some scenarios related to infrastructure improvement were assumed and their impacts on quality of life from the perspective of time use were quantitatively evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The entomopathogenic {{anamorphic}} fungus Beauveria bassiana {{is currently}} {{used as a}} biocontrol agent (BCA) of insects. Fifty-seven Beauveria bassiana isolates - 53 from Spain- were characterized, <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> I intron insertion patterns at the 3 '-end of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal gene (LSU rDNA) and elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF 1 -α) phylogenetic information, {{in order to assess}} the genetic structure and diversity of this Spanish collection of B. bassiana. Results Group I intron genotype analysis was based on the four highly conserved insertion sites of the LSU (Ec 2653, Ec 2449, Ec 2066, Ec 1921). Of the 16 possible combinations/genotypes, only four were detected, two of which were predominant, containing 44 and 9 members out of 57 isolates, respectively. Interestingly, the members of the latter two genotypes showed unique differences in their growth temperatures. In follow, EF 1 -α phylogeny served to classify most of the strains in the B. bassiana s. s. (sensu stricto) group and separate them into 5 molecular subgroups, all of which contained a group I intron belonging to the IC 1 subtype at the Ec 1921 position. A number of parameters such as thermal growth or origin (host, geographic location and climatic conditions) were also examined but in general no association could be found. Conclusion Most Spanish B. bassiana isolates (77. 2 %) are grouped into a major phylogenetic subgroup with word-wide distribution. However, high phylogenetic diversity was also detected among Spanish isolates from close geographic zones with low climatic variation. In general, no correlation was observed between the molecular distribution and geographic origin or climatic characteristics where the Spanish B. bassiana isolates were sampled. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Advanced {{heart failure}} is {{receiving}} increasing attention from clinicians {{and policy makers}} as a major chronic condition associated with poor {{quality of life in}} an ageing population. Aim: To explore how we could tailor health interventions to individual patients with advanced heart failure at the end of life. Design: (1) A systematic review of national and international chronic heart failure guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool and a data extraction framework based on the holistic needs assessment of the Gold Standards Framework (GSF). (2) A longitudinal qualitative study of 15 patients with New York Heart Association grade 3 or 4 heart failure recruited through two community based heart failure services. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients at 3 monthly intervals for 1 year (n= 52 interviews). A refined ‘case-based’ method as described by Griffiths et al. was adopted to identify the ideal type categories of adjustment and adaptation and assess how these categories change over time for each patient. This involved understanding individuals as complex systems, subject to internal and external influences, with the potential for transformation. The analysis drew on the theoretical concept of the emergent present - as developed by Adam - the current period of time when all domains of life have expression. Results: (1) A total of 19 guidelines were included in the review. Across all guidelines the lowest scoring domains were applicability and stakeholder involvement. Qualitative assessment showed that most guidelines adopt a disease-orientated approach to addressing need. In particular, domains on continuity of care and out of hours care were poorly covered. (2) Four distinct patterns of adjustment and adaptation were identified. The largest group was the Stuck and struggling category, which was characterised by participants wanting to move on but being unable to do so. Participants in the <b>integrating</b> <b>group</b> were able to accommodate the problems that they faced from moment to moment despite anticipating an uncertain future. Those in the submerged group were completely immersed in their illness and any expectation of a meaningful future had completely disappeared. The Past reminder group was characterised by a narrative based in the emergent present that was dominated by their experience of previous events. It was shown that some participants transformed from one category to another {{as a result of the}} care they received. For others, there was no change over the course of the study. Conclusion: This thesis identifies important differences between the ‘objective’ patient represented in clinical guidelines and the ‘subjective’ experience of the individual. The illness experiences of people living with advanced heart failure are diverse and do not lend themselves to standardised care. This raises important questions for the way knowledge is currently translated into clinical practice. Attending to the emergent present may be a clinically useful approach for supporting health care professionals to tailor care to needs of patients at the end of life...|$|E
