50|$|The Irish Mental Hospital Workers' Union (Known {{at first}} as the Irish Asylum Workers' Union) {{was founded in}} 1917 in Dublin. Its peak years of {{activity}} were between 1917-1921.

Under this agreement asylum workers' hours were reduced to 56 hours a week (in some cases staff had been working up to 90 hours a week)and a minimum wage of £60 for men and £46 for women was introduced. Ultimately the union began to fracture from 1922 with onset of the post War slump.
