40|$|Background There is a {{worldwide}} upscale in mass drug administration (MDA) programs {{to control the}} morbidity caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) : Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris tri-chiura and hookworm. Although anthelminthic drugs which are used for MDA are supplied by two pharmaceutical companies through donation, {{there is a wide}} range of brands avail-able on local markets for which the efficacy <b>against</b> <b>STHs</b> and quality remain poorly explored. In the present study, we evaluated the drug efficacy and quality of two albenda-zole brands (Bendex and Ovis) available on the local market in Ethiopia. Methodology/Principal Findings A randomized clinical trial was conducted according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to assess drug efficacy, by means of egg reduction rate (ERR), of Bendex and Ovis <b>against</b> <b>STH</b> infections in school children in Jimma, Ethiopia. In addition, the chemical and physicochemical quality of the drugs was assessed according to the United States and European Pharmacopoeia, encompassing mass uniformity of the tablets...|$|R

60|$|But in {{the middle}} of the night the Goblin awoke, hearing a great noise and <b>knocking</b> <b>against</b> the shutters--people {{hammering}} from outside. The watchman was blowing his horn: a great fire had broken out; the whole town was in flames.|$|R

However, they are urgently needed to ensure detection of reduced efficacies that are predicted to occur due to growing drug pressure. Here, using a standardized methodology, we assessed the FECR rate of a single oral dose of mebendazole (MEB; 500 mg) <b>against</b> <b>STHs</b> in six trials in school children in different locations around the world. Our results are compared with those previously obtained for similarly conducted trials of a single oral dose of albendazole (ALB; 400 mg) ...|$|R

60|$|The {{next moment}} a timid <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> {{the front door}} caused {{everyone}} to start.

60|$|The dog {{was delighted}} at the sudden {{excitement}} {{caused by the}} cat, and ran barking and dancing along the bank, so that he presently <b>knocked</b> <b>against</b> the dish, and behold! it slid down the bank, carrying the spoon with it, and fell with a splash into {{the water of the}} brook.|$|R
60|$|Paul saw {{drops of}} sweat fall from his father's brow.

40|$|Abstract. Recently {{there have}} been calls for the {{eradication}} of malaria {{and the elimination of}} soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). Malaria and STHs overlap in distribution, and STH infections are associated with increased risk for malaria. Indeed, there is evidence that suggests that STH infection may facilitate malaria transmission. Malaria and STH coinfection may exacerbate anemia, especially in pregnant women, leading to worsened child development and more adverse pregnancy outcomes than these diseases would cause on their own. Ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) to humans for malaria parasite transmission suppression is being investigated as a potential malaria elimination tool. Adding albendazole to ivermectin MDAs would maximize effects <b>against</b> <b>STHs.</b> A proactive, integrated control platform that targets malaria and STHs would be extremely cost-effective and simultaneously reduce human suffering caused by multiple diseases. This paper outlines the benefits of adding albendazole to ivermectin MDAs for malaria parasite transmission suppression...|$|R
