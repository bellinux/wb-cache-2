As Explorers attend without their leaders, Project is ideal to fulfil the requirements of the residential section of their Queen’s Scout or Duke of Edinburgh’s Gold Awards. The next event is due to take place between Saturday 17th and Saturday 24 August 2014.|$|E

40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{reporting}} of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{has played a}} major role in detection of previously unobserved ADRs. In spite of setting up ADR monitoring centres, only 6 - 10 % of all ADRs are reported which has been contributed to the lack of knowledge among healthcare professionals. This study was planned to address this aspect. To evaluate and compare the effect of educational intervention in enhancing the knowledge of MBBS internee's regarding pharmacovigilance. Methods: A cross sectional, educational interventional observational study was conducted using two copies of a pretested validated questionnaire (pre and post CME) with 17 questions among 130 MBBS internees. They were subjected to a Continuous Medical Education <b>on</b> pharmacovigilance. A <b>hand's</b> <b>on</b> <b>training</b> <b>on</b> ADR reporting was also conducted in which they were divided into 10 batches and asked to fill a Central Drugs Standard Control Organization Adverse Drug Reporting form on the case scenario given to them and forms were analyzed. Results: Out of 130 internees, 114 (87. 69 %) and 98 (75. 38 %) had completely filled them. The overall awareness about pharmacovigilance increased from 62. 50 % to 82. 25 % (p< 0. 0001). There was a statistically significant increase in mean value from 14. 38 +/- 0. 3020 to 18. 92 +/- 0. 2860 (p< 0. 0001) on analyzing the knowledge scores. 90 % of ADR forms revealed substantial errors, which were explained to the participants. Conclusions: This study clearly shows that early sensitization through educational interventions at internship phase of M. B. B. S. will increase the number of ADRs being reported in our country.

40|$|Employing a {{randomized}} control group design, this study compared {{the efficacy of}} staff training using theory <b>training,</b> <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision and a self - instructional teaching man ual. Participants were 12 undergraduate, health or social - work students. Initially, participants were given a three - hour lecture, and as a result, staff - participants increased their use of correct teaching procedures, but not to mastery. Participants in bo th groups continued to increase their teaching skills after intervention with either <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> <b>training</b> or the self - instructional manual, though best effect was achieved with <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision. This effect was maintained at a two - month follow - up. At {{the end of the}} experiment, participants in the treatment manual group received <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision. As a result, their performances increased to the same levels as the participants in the <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision group. Hence, <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision was superior in increasing teaching performances. Participants receiving <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision reported that they were comfortable receiving this type of supervision, that the <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision {{was the best way to}} learn correct teaching procedures and that they would p refer <b>hands</b> - <b>on</b> supervision in a future job situation.

30|$|The {{minimally}} invasive nature of TEE poses significant {{challenges for the}} widespread dissemination of the modality. Traditional methods of instructing point-of-care ultrasound that rely heavily {{on the use of}} human volunteers during initial coursework and acquisition training are not possible with TEE. The advent of high-fidelity TEE simulators has now enabled new methods of training to be considered while also providing access to <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> acquisition <b>training</b> for those providers, such as EPs in our study, without routine access to patient care environments where TEE and its training are carried out. The value of simulators extends beyond providing training opportunities for those who are TEE-naïve and has recently been the subject of study by cardiologists and cardiac anesthesiologists. In two separate studies, educators from both disciplines found that adding simulation to traditional clinical training improved learner outcomes [23, 24].|$|R
