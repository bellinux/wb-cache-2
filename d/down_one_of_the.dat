5|$|During a {{subsequent}} confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December, Armidale {{was struck by}} two torpedoes and a bomb, and began to sink; the order to abandon ship was given. After helping to free a life-raft, Sheean was wounded by two bullets. He {{made his way to}} the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese bombers, but was killed when Armidale sank. Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches. In 1999, the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour, and efforts have been made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts {{had been made to}} tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of}} a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E

5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved {{equal to the}} {{situation}} and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of the}} 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven, for which he and the other aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{arrived in}} Ulithi on 20 March, and was {{assigned}} to Task Force 54 the next day. She put to sea {{to take part in}} the invasion of Okinawa. The ship was placed in Task Unit 54.2.3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March. On the afternoon of the following day, Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on the island, from 13:50 to 16:30. Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning; Wichitas gunners shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. Later that day, the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion. She continued to shell the island through 28 March. The next day, she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition. The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover underwater demolition teams as they cleared beach obstacles. Wichita continued to support the demolition teams the next day, as well as shelling targets ashore. On 31 March, Wichita bombarded the sea wall to create a breach in preparation for the landings.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July, the 1st Division escorted {{a convoy}} to Italian Libya, {{arriving}} back in Augusta on 1 August. Gunnery training off Naples followed on 16 August, and on 29 August the ships left Naples for Taranto, arriving the next day. On the 31st, the 1st Division sortied to intercept the British convoys in Operation Hats, though the Italian fleet broke off the attack without encountering the merchant ships. On 79 September, Gorizia patrolled off Sicily {{but failed to}} locate any British vessels, and she thereafter docked in Palermo. She returned to Taranto on the 11th and took part in gunnery training on 23 and 24 September and again on 6 November. She was present in the harbor {{on the night of}} 1112 November during the British attack on Taranto, but was undamaged in the air raid. Her anti-aircraft batteries shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking British aircraft. The ship was transferred to Naples on the 12th. She took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, where she engaged British cruisers and shot down a British aircraft. British bombing of the port four days later forced the Italians to again relocate the cruisers, sending them temporarily to La Maddalena in Sardinia on 15 December.|$|E
50|$|At 21:12, she again {{came under}} attack. Two bombers {{launched}} torpedoes on the beam and broad {{on the bow}} to port but both missed the still-turning ship. Despite the increasing list, her guns <b>downed</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planes as it {{turned away from the}} ship.|$|R

5|$|The main Japanese air {{offensive}} against the Mariana Islands began in early November 1944. On November1, a B-29 flying from the Marianas overflew the Tokyo region {{for the first}} time. The next day, nine or ten IJN G4Ms belonging to the IJN Attack Hik≈çtai 703 struck Isley Field and the adjacent Kobler Field on Saipan. The raiders arrived over Saipan shortly after 1:30am and dropped their bombs from low altitude. Only five bombs struck Isley Field, and these caused little damage. A Black Widow from the 6th Night Fighter Squadron shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G4Ms and another two were lost to other causes. On November3 the Imperial General Headquarters issued a statement which falsely claimed that Japanese aircraft had bombed and destroyed fifteen locations in Saipan and Tinian. A further attack by either five or ten G4Ms with fighter escorts took place at 1:30am on November7, but also caused little damage. The USAAF official history states that three G4Ms were downed in this raid while another source states there were no Japanese losses. Imperial General Headquarters claimed that 20 B-29s out of 40 located were destroyed in the November7 raid. These and all subsequent Japanese air attacks on the Marianas were overseen by the Air Training Army.|$|E
5|$|Togusa tracks <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing children, now {{assigned}} to {{an elderly man}} in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left {{with him as he}} had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before his}} feat of espionage derring-do, Windisch had scored his first aerial victory.

25|$|U-1065s first patrol {{took her}} from her home port of Kiel in {{northern}} Germany towards occupied Norway. However, while en route to Norway in company with another of the Flotilla's boats, , the two submarines were detected and attacked in the Skagerrak strait by 34 de Havilland Mosquito aircraft from three separate Royal Air Force squadrons. During the attack, U-1065 was able to shoot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mosquitos with her anti-aircraft guns. However, she was then hit by several rockets from 10 separate Mosquitos from 143 and 235 Squadron; she exploded and sank {{with the loss of}} her entire crew of 45 men.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{of the air force}} led to EEF aircraft dominating the air war, which became quieter when photography patrols were able to cover larger areas around Beersheba. Newly arrived Bristol Fighters, of No. 111 Squadron, demonstrated their increased power, beginning on 8 October, when several were sent out to wait for the usual two Albatros scouts, which conducted German reconnaissances. One of the scouts was caught by the new, quicker British aircraft, and was shot and forced to land. On 15 October, three more Albatroses were fired on by British anti‚Äìaircraft guns, followed by an attack by a Bristol Fighter, which shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albatros scouts.|$|E
25|$|As {{he himself}} {{described}} it {{in a magazine}} article he penned for Nel Cielo, his airfield was attacked by ten enemy bombers. He shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bombers in flames at 9AM. He then dueled with another for twenty minutes before it crashed. The observer leapt from the wreckage and lit it on fire to deny its capture. Unfortunately, the observer managed to catch his own clothing on fire in the process. Still more unfortunately, the pilot was still pinned under the debris and burned to death. Meanwhile, Scaroni's squadron-mates shot down six more of the raiders. Scaroni capped off the day by downing another, even larger, bomber at 12:35. He thus ended the year with nine wins.|$|E

25|$|Gladych {{had claimed}} a further 10 air kills and 5 ground kills {{by the end}} of September 1944.

Low on fuel, he attempted to disengage after shooting <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fw 190s, but the other two fighters boxed him in and tried to force him to land. As he approached a German airfield configured for landing, Gladych suddenly opened fire on the airfield with his remaining ammunition. German flak gunners responded, but missed Gladych and shot down the two following Fw 190s. When he crossed the English coast his P-47 ran out of fuel, forcing Gladych to bail out.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April, {{he assumed}} command of Prussian Jasta 12 based at Epinoy upon {{the death of}} its commander. One of the pilots there was future Jasta 52 {{commanding}} officer and ace Paul Billik. His appointment was unusual in that although a Prussian raised Jasta, von Tutschek was a Bavarian. On 30 April Von Tutschek allayed any Prussian suspicion of Bavarians by sprinting to his airplane through falling bombs during a raid on their home airfield; he led a flight into the air into a night pursuit of the bombers. He shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raiders, a FE-2b of 57 Squadron, thus scoring a victory on his first flight with his new command.|$|E
25|$|On 22 July 1974, {{during the}} Turkish {{invasion}} of Cyprus, {{a pair of}} Greek F-5Œës intercepted a pair of Turkish F-102 near Agios Efstratios.

Skampardonis managed to evade the missile and then the other Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two AIM-9B missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot <b>down</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but run out of fuel. This forced him to ditch his aircraft, suffering fatal injuries.|$|E
