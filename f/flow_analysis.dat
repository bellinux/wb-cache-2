This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material <b>flow</b> <b>analysis</b> at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of Flow, a fast and precise type checker for JavaScript {{that is used by}} thousands of developers on millions of lines of code at Facebook every day. Flow uses sophisticated type inference to understand common JavaScript idioms precisely. This helps it find non-trivial bugs in code and provide code intelligence to editors without requiring significant rewriting or annotations from the developer. We formalize an important fragment of <b>Flow's</b> <b>analysis</b> and prove its soundness. Furthermore, Flow uses aggressive parallelization and incrementalization to deliver near-instantaneous response times. This helps it avoid introducing any latency in the usual edit-refresh cycle of rapid JavaScript development.

25|$|When the {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find shortest paths, the existence of negative cycles is a problem, preventing {{the algorithm}} from finding a correct answer.

25|$|Two of {{the major}} {{disadvantages}} of this process are the high cost and long development time. An automotive part can take four years to develop; {{two years in the}} prototype stage and two years to reach production. Not all products take this long, for instance a two-way valve produced by Johnson Controls only took 18 months. The initial cost can be as much as US$8 million to produce a four-cylinder engine manifold. However, computer <b>flow</b> <b>analysis</b> has helped reduce lead time and costs.|$|E
500|$|The Cahuilla Basin, {{also known}} as the Salton Sink, is part of the through that is {{occupied}} by the Gulf of California. The basin structure is surrounded by various crystalline rocks that were formed from the Precambrian era forwards to the Tertiary period. About [...] of sediment fill the basin from the Miocene, testifying to rapid tectonic subsidence. Four million years ago, the Colorado River started to enter into the area. The formation of the Colorado River Delta separated the Salton Trough during the Pleistocene from the Gulf of California; during the Pliocene the connection still existed. Another basin in the region is formed by the Laguna Salada, with yet smaller basins such as the Mesquite Basin also reported. Approximately [...] of sediment have accumulated in the Salton Trough, burying the underlying crust. Heat <b>flow</b> <b>analysis</b> suggests that active extension is underway in the trough.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{aerodynamics}} of the Quad-Wing Vehicle, a Micro Air Vehicle {{designed to}} hover with four flapping wings in a dragonfly-like configuration, is investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), potential <b>flows</b> <b>analysis,</b> and experimental testing. The CFD analysis investigates the kinematics-parameters design space and identifies values of kinematics parameters that maximize the vertical force production in hovering mode while minimizing the aerodynamic power requirement. It also investigates other important considerations, {{such as the}} effect of scaling, multi-wing interactions, and comparison with other flapping configurations. In the potential <b>flows</b> <b>analysis,</b> an unsteady 2 D panel code is developed and compared with CFD for {{a broad range of}} hovering-flight simulations. The results show that, with further development, panel codes may be useful to designers of hovering flapping MAVs because of their time-saving potential compared to CFD. The experimental testing focuses on isolating the aerodynamic forces from other measured forces on a benchtop flapping device, and the findings of the experimental study will be useful for later researchers using experimental methods to study flapping MAV aerodynamics...|$|R
