5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience.

A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby.

5|$|Four {{passenger}} airliners {{operated by}} two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines) — {{all of which}} departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for California — were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed, with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially steered toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. 9/11 was the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers {{in the history of}} the United States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNew {{developments}} and significant changes {{are under way}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. We are witnessing a revival of trading nations’ interest in international trade agenda and trade talks, which have taken a backseat since the economic downturn following the global crisis. The improved outlook for global trade growth, but also the acute need for adjusting <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system to <b>the</b> ongoing structural changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spheres {{of international trade and}} industrial organization are, essentially, behind this policy shift. This paper takes stock of recent developments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system and highlights the prospects for global trade governance. It focuses on three issues: (1) the significance of the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013 for resuming global trade cooperation; (2) the recent drive towards plurilateral sector-specific trade deals; and (3) the outstanding pace and scale of negotiations on new preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The paper concludes with a discussion of the future direction of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. It argues that despite improved prospects for multilateral <b>trade</b> liberalization, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system is becoming more fragmented and less coherent, and also more uncertain, being increasingly driven by PTAs and a variable geometry approach to WTO trade agreements...|$|R
