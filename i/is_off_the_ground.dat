Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a most unusual aircraft, called the Tiltrotor XV- 15, which combines the versatility of the helicopter with {{the characteristics of a}} conventional aircraft. Two large, three-bladed propellers are mounted at the tips of the wings. For takeoff, the propellers and their engines are rotated 90 degrees, and the XV- 15 can climb vertically into the air as a helicopter. When the vehicle <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> propellers and engines rotate forward, and the lift is transferred from the propellers to the wings. As a conventional aircraft, the Tiltrotor can cruise for more than two hours. Operating as a vertical-takeoff aircraft, the XV- 15 can fly twice as fast as a helicopter and deliver payloads on half the fuel when traveling distances greater than 185 kilometers. The results of {{the first three years of}} flight-testing are discussed, taking into account the relationship of rotor vibrations and/or air turbulence to resonance of a section of the Tiltrotor's wing...|$|E
40|$|Barley is a cool season grain crop {{used for}} feed, malting and seed. Malting barley {{has a higher}} {{economic}} value than barley grown for feed. Between 80 - 85 % of the barley grown in Colorado is grown in south-central Colorado, in the San Luis Valley. Cropping System Barley should be planted {{as soon as the}} frost <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to permit crop development prior to aphid flights, and to avoid other insects and diseases. In the San Luis Valley, the last frost is usually in June and precipitation starts in April. Barley is planted in the fall from Sept. 1 to Oct. 15 and in the spring from Mar. 15 to Apr. 30. Optimal seed germination temperatures are 55 - 70 F. Barley requires a minimum soil temperature of 40 F, with optimal growth rates occurring at 70 F. Temperatures above 90 F impede barley growth. Barley is planted into a firm seed bed (for consistent drill depths) 0. 5 - 1. 5 " deep with 6 - 10 " row widths. Planting depth for cold, spring soils is 0. 5 - 0. 75 ".

40|$|While the {{positional}} {{relationships of}} the mammalian carpal bones were fully discussed by palaeontologists around 1900, the dynamic {{role of the}} carpus has been almost ignored. The roles of the forelimb in locomotion and of the carpus within the forelimb are briefly considered. There is a tendency for the wrist to be rigid during retraction, {{in contrast to the}} activity of the tarsus, and it acts as a hinge only when the limb <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> folding the limb during protraction. The position close under the mid-line in which the feet are placed is emphasised, since this means that the lower limb segments must swing out sideways to pass the contralateral limb. Some ulnar deviation must accompany flexion at the carpus to achieve this. The form and function of the carpus in various groups of mammals is examined. Function is determined largely by manipulative studies, and described as degrees of flexion and deviation at the two main carpal joints. Thus in Carnivora, the proximal joint is both the main flexion hinge and a deviational joint, while the mid-carpal joint is solely a flexion hinge. In these and many other quadrupedal mammals with proximal joints of similar function, the scaphoid and lunar bones of the primitive carpus are fused. In ungulates, both joints are solely flexion hinges, and the bones of the proximal row must remain separate to provide the twisting movement which gives the deviational component. In primates both joints give moderate flexion and deviation. The isolated position of the Monotremes is emphasised. <p...|$|E
