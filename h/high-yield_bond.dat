40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} default {{behavior}} of original issue rated non-convertible <b>high-yield</b> <b>bonds.</b> The hazard model simultaneously estimates {{the impact of}} bond age, firm- and issue-specific characteristics, and changing economic conditions. The specification used models {{the impact of the}} time since issuance semi-parametrically, corrects for unobserved heterogeneity and allows for the possibility that outstanding bonds may default in the future. Our findings, based on a sample of 579 individual <b>high-yield</b> <b>bonds</b> issued between 1977 and 1989, suggest that, after controlling for annual changes in economic conditions, default rates increase with age. Bond characteristics at the time of issuance also impact the default behavior. BB rated bonds tend to have significantly lower default rates compared to CCC rated bonds; bonds with higher coupon rates have significantly higher default rates. In addition, <b>high-yield</b> <b>bonds</b> issued prior to 1980 experienced significantly lowerd default rates. Default; Risk; Bonds;...|$|R

[...] Despite the firm's name, Burnham was the nominal survivor; the Drexel name only came {{first at the}} insistence of the more {{powerful}} investment banks, whose blessing was necessary for the merged firm to inherit Drexel's position as a [...] "major" [...] firm. [...] Milken {{was one of the few}} prominent holdovers from the Drexel side of the merger, and became the merged firm's head of convertibles.

2500|$|Only a day later, however, Drexel lawyers {{discovered}} suspicious {{activity in}} one of the limited partnerships Milken set up to allow members of his department to make their own investments. [...] That entity, MacPherson Partners, had acquired several warrants for the stock of Storer Broadcasting in 1985. [...] At the time, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts {{was in the midst of}} a leveraged buyout of Storer, and Drexel was lead underwriter for the bonds being issued. [...] One of Drexel's other clients bought several Storer warrants and sold them back to the <b>high-yield</b> <b>bond</b> department. [...] The department in turn sold them to MacPherson. [...] This partnership included Milken, other Drexel executives, and a few Drexel customers. [...] However, it also included several managers of money market funds who had worked with Milken in the past. [...] It appeared that the money managers bought the warrants for themselves and didn't offer the same opportunity to the funds they managed. [...] Some of Milken's children also got warrants, according to Stewart, raising the appearance of Milken self-dealing.|$|E
