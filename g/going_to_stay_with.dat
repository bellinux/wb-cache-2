5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E
500|$|While {{he played}} for the Porto Rico Stars, Alejandro Pompéz called him and made him an offer {{to play with the}} New York Cubans, which at the time he owned. Pompéz became {{interested}} in Coimbre after hearing several reviews of his work, but he was skeptical of these claims and therefore he was hesitant to contract him at first and didn't do so until a group of players recommended him. He debuted in a game against a team named Buschwick, in a game that took place in Brooklyn, New York. In his first two games with the team he connected four hits, three singles and a double. Following this performance Pompéz informed him that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> the team. After the season concluded he was instantly offered a second contract with the Cubans, which by this time where playing in the National League of the Negro League. He also participated with Ponce during the 19401941 season of the winter league and concluded the season with a batting average of [...]401 and no strikeouts. During his second season with the Cubans he had an average of [...]409, and was included in the league's All-star Game {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
2500|$|Nkrumah {{called himself}} [...] "a {{scientific}} socialist and a Marxist" [...] {{and is considered}} relatively orthodox in his Marxism–Leninism. [...] He generally took a non-aligned Marxist perspective on economics, and believed capitalism had malignant effects that were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> Africa for a long time. Although he was clear on distancing himself from the African socialism {{of many of his}} contemporaries, Nkrumah argued that socialism was the system that would best accommodate the changes that capitalism had brought, while still respecting African values. He specifically addresses these issues and his politics in a 1967 essay entitled [...] "African Socialism Revisited": ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is it lunch, Mrs O'Kelly, pray don't {{think of}} troubling {{yourself}} {{to have lunch}} on the table. Maybe we'll be a deal nearer Creamstown than Kelly's Court at lunch time.

6000|$|... "You're a good sort, Inspector, but you've {{picked the}} wrong girl. I've run along {{on my own}} hook ever since I was born, I guess, and I can't switch my ideas over to this married stuff. You'd better {{get a move on}} and get Craig back to New York before he slips us again. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here <b>with</b> the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is not an}} old gentleman, Ralph," [...] Mrs. Conway said almost angrily. [...] "I {{told you}} we were young people together.

There's something cruel about the man; getting fired out of his profession must have warped his nature. Then there was another point that struck me; why's he <b>going</b> so far <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> those Indians?" ...|$|R
