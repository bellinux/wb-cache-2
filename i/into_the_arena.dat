Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the fourth century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} bouts on the undercard saw the WWE United States Champion Eddie Guerrero defending the championship against the Big Show. The {{events leading up}} to this match began on the October 9 episode of SmackDown, when it was announced that Guerrero would face the Big Show at No Mercy for the title. Later in the night, Chavo Guerrero (Salvador Guerrero IV) brought the Big Show out to the ring, followed by Eddie Guerrero bringing a sewage truck <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> and spraying the Big Show with raw sewage. The next week on SmackDown, Guerrero defeated Rhyno (Terry Gerin) in a non-title match. Afterwards, the Big Show attacked Guerrero by using his signature lowrider as a weapon.|$|E

He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it, killing for mere amusement, deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation, and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship. Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the audience <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts {{because there were no}} prisoners to be used and he was bored.|$|E

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a tag team match, in which the WWF Tag Team Champions Kane and X-Pac defended against Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown. During the match, Henry lifted X-Pac and rammed {{his back against the}} steel ring post at ringside. Afterward, Brown and Henry simultaneously attacked X-Pac, which led Kane to launch himself from the top turnbuckle onto Brown and Henry. After the competitors reentered the ring, Kane performed a chokeslam on Henry, lifting him by the throat and slamming him down. Kane then pinned Henry to retain the WWF Tag Team Title. Next was the hardcore singles bout—a match allowing no disqualifications or countouts. WWF Hardcore Champion Al Snow defended against Hardcore Holly. Holly and Snow began their bout in the ring but were scripted to move their brawl <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> stands. From there, they proceeded to the backstage area, and into the concession stands before returning to the ring. The fight was decided when Snow lifted Holly onto his shoulders and threw him through a wooden table. Successfully covering and pinning Holly, Snow retained the WWF Hardcore Title.|$|E
5|$|Coming into series six as reigning champion, Razer {{started its}} title defence by {{qualifying}} from a four-way melee. It then defeated the pyramid-shaped robot Cyrax on a judges' decision {{to set up}} a heat final against Raging Reality. It pushed its opponent towards Matildas flywheel, which ripped off an entire side panel and caused Raging Reality to break down. This saw Razer reach the semi-finals for a second consecutive series. Against Wild Thing, Razer damaged one of its opponent's exposed drive wheels, hampering its movement. Subsequently, Razer grasped it with the arm and dropped Wild Thing into the pit. Razer next fought Dantomkia, which was armed with a pneumatic flipping arm. Although Razer was the early aggressor, Dantomkia retaliated by pushing Razer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> wall. The rest of the battle was similarly even, with Razer's more potent attacks being matched by Dantomkia's pushing power. The judges decided that Razer should move on to a second series final.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} a court {{descending}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> and depriving a party {{of the right to}} a fair trial was also distinguished from that of prejudgment, as in Roseli bin Amat v.

However, when he descends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena,</b> he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference may lie in how actively the judge pursues this position and how he comes to be persuaded.|$|E

25|$|The {{pronouncement}} in Wong Kok Chin {{was followed}} in Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2008), where Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside the}} conviction of the trial judge as he had descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> of the trial and joined the fray. Although the trial judge was entitled to seek clarifications, he had gone beyond that by encroaching into the Public Prosecutor's duty to bring out evidence to prove its case when he had asked the sole witness almost as many questions as the Public Prosecutor. Conversely, in Mohammed Ali bin Johari {{where one of the}} grounds of appeal against the appellant's conviction for murder was that the trial judge had engaged in excessive judicial interference, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had not descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> as he had not interrupted (let alone cross-examined) counsel or the parties in such a manner as to give rise to prejudice or the appearance of prejudice to either party. Neither had it been suggested that the judge was guilty of any of these proscribed actions.|$|E

He stressed {{that it was the}} totality of the circumstances, and not any particular fact, that had led him to this conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Shankar also appealed on {{the ground}} that the Disciplinary Committee, by virtue of its {{excessive}} intervention in the case, had descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> and adopted an inquisitorial role, which had impaired its judgment and ability to properly evaluate and weigh the evidence. In addressing this submission, Judicial Commissioner Menon noted that this was a wholly separate ground of appeal, although it often overlaps with the issue of apparent bias and courts do not always distinguish the two.|$|E

25|$|Excessive {{intervention}} by a tribunal is {{a breach of}} the fair hearing requirement. The principle behind this rule was elucidated succinctly by Justice Yong Pung How. He stated that since Singapore's justice system is adversarial and not inquisitorial, when hearing evidence a tribunal may seek clarification on points in the evidence which are not clear, but must at all times avoid descending <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> and joining in the fray. The tribunal is there to judge as best it can and is not there to supplement the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in Mohammed Ali bin Johari v. Public Prosecutor (2008) the Court of Appeal {{found that}} the {{questions}} by the judge were asked to keep a tight rein on proceedings and procedure, {{and there was no}} denial of justice. Therefore, it was held that the trial judge had not descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena.</b> Writing for the Court, Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang reiterated that what is of fundamental importance is the judge does not conduct the proceedings in a manner which suggests that there has been the possibility of a denial of justice to a particular party.|$|E
