5000|$|A {{draw-works}} is {{the primary}} hoisting machinery that is a component of a rotary drilling rig. Its main function {{is to provide a}} means of raising and lowering the traveling blocks. The wire-rope <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> winds on the drawworks drum and extends to the crown block and traveling blocks, allowing the drill string to be moved up and down as the drum turns. The segment of <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> from the draw-works to the crown block is called the [...] "fast line". The <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> then enters the sheaves of the crown block and it makes several passes between the crown block and traveling block pulleys for mechanical advantage. The line then exits the last sheave on the crown block and is fastened to a derrick leg {{on the other side of}} the rig floor. This section of <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> is called the [...] "dead line".|$|E

The building-up time of braking torque has been substantiated. The methodology of dynamic design of assemblies has been developed. The variables which determine the level of dynamic loading have been brought out. The regulation of operating conditions of descent-lift system allows to decrease substantially the excitation level of elastic vibrations, the offered principle of operation of vibratory screen allows to rise the cleaning degree of mud. The developed design procedures have been brought in the design practice of drilling rigs. The service life of <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> has been increased by 26 %, the vibration level of equipment is decreased 4 - 8 times, the cleaning degree of drilling mud is risen 1, 5 timesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty (HRA) is a {{treatment}} {{option for the}} patients with the advanced hip disease; it is considered as the most technically difficult techniques of all procedures recommended for osteonecrosis of the hip. Technically, the currently applied HRA surgeries lead to unstable and inconsistent results. Surgeons rely {{a lot on the}} manual technique and conventional tools as well as their skills to determine the right drilling angle for locating the implant system. Although the robotic and surgical planning systems are available for HRA, the <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> is still defined geometrically and intra-operatively, not fully considering about the biomechanics aspects of the implant and bone structure. In this paper, an optimal surgical aid system for HRA is proposed. With the integration {{of the state of the}} art biomedical modelling, pre-operative planning and personalised surgical tools, knowledge based and expert system, as well as biomechanics modelling and analysis, the precision, safety and speed of surgery are improved, the complexity of surgery is reduced, and therefore the survival rate of the implant is increased. Especially, the proposed system provides a cheap and practically feasible solution with the integration of expertise from both engineering and medicine for improving the treatment quality of the patients...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn {{the recent}} years, {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} and production are being carried out in extremely harsh and challenging environmental conditions. Hence, accurate prediction of the hook load is essential in order to minimise the Non- Productive Time (NPT) during the drilling operation stages. With accurate prediction of hook load, undesirable drilling problems such as buckling, stuck pipe, tensile failure can be minimised if not completely eradicated. There are numerous factors affecting the hook load prediction such as, the weight per unit length (W/l) of the drill pipe used, the density of the drilling mud used, the friction in the well, the weight per unit length (W/l) of the <b>drilling</b> <b>line</b> used, just to mention but a few. These above factors will not be discussed in-depth in this thesis but rather this thesis aims at developing a mathematical model to incorporate into the existing models, the effect of acceleration on hook load prediction. There are numerous hook load prediction models in {{the oil and gas industry}} such as the industry accepted hook load prediction model, the Luke and Juvkam-Wold hook load prediction model and the Cayeux et al hook load prediction model. The rationale behind this thesis is to understand these existing hook load prediction models and further develop them by incorporating the effect of acceleration. These existing models gives a good prediction of the hook load measurements but the accuracy can be improved by taking into account that the efficiency of each sheave might not be same and also taking into consideration the effect of acceleration. The extended models will be analysed using hypothetical data. After analysing the extended models using the hypothetical data, it was discovered that during non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment the sum of the tensions in the supporting lines are not the same as the hook load (W). Hence, the position for the load cell placement is very essential to ensure accurate hook load measurement. 	During hoisting with non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment, the sum of the tensions in the supporting lines always exceeds the hook load (W) value with the discrepancy between them being influenced by the acceleration (a) of the travelling equipment. 	Hence, the minimum expected hook load (W) value during hoisting is during non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment with high a/g ratio and vice-versa. 	During lowering with non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment, the hook load (W) measurement always exceeds the sum of the tensions in the supporting lines with the disparity between them also influenced by the acceleration (a) of the travelling equipment. 	Hence, the maximum hook load (W) measurement during lowering occurs when the travelling equipment is undergoing non-uniform movement with high a/g ratio and vice-versa. 	Finally, it was observed that even though the dead line is non-rotating, its efficiency is not perfect(e_dl≠ 1). The efficiency of each sheave from the extended Cayeux et al hook load prediction model was used as an input for the extended Luke and Juvkam model. It was observed that the extended Cayeux et al hook load prediction model (which served as the experimental data) produces approximately the same results as the rotating (Active) dead line sheave hook load prediction model but deviates from the non-rotating (inactive) dead line sheave counterpart. The degree of the deviation depends on the coefficient of friction (the efficiency of each sheave). Hence, it can be inferred that the dead line sheave is not perfect. This can be confirmed with experimental data...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringAs {{more oil}} blocks get {{explored}} for, {{the search and}} drilling for oil has become more daunting today, than ever before. Explorers and drillers have {{had to deal with}} harsh conditions of temperature, pressure, and more complex reservoir structures. Drilling wells, whether exploration or production, have also faced more challenges due to the daunting task of newer locations for oil and gas resources. The cost of wells, the time to drill, etc. have all seen an upward spiral in recent times. One of the key parameters that greatly influences drilling efficiency, which directly impacts time and cost, is the hook load. The hook load is measured using weight indicators which could be placed at various locations on the drilling rig. The accurate measurements of these hook load readings have been intensely researched, with the work of Luke and Juvkam being central to most of these research works. The main pre-occupation of this thesis work was to investigate the effect of other factors on the hook load. Factors such as the weight per unit length of the <b>drill</b> <b>line,</b> dolly retraction, and mud hose and top-drive umbilicals have been modelled, and experiments carried out. These experiments have rightly confirmed that these factors have some effect on the overall hook load that is measured by the sensor at the dead line. It has thus become obvious that the hook load that is measured is not only dependent on the weight of the drill string in the well being drilled, but other often neglected systems of the drilling rig have effect on it, somewhat. In order to validate the model that was arrived at as a correction to the already existing model, experiments were carried out on a highly accurate basis. These experiments have confirmed what was arrived at with the model...|$|R
40|$|In rig constructions two nev designs {{have been}} {{introduced}} apart from the conventional hoisting system. The first one is the Maritime Hydraulics A. S RamRig© drilling concept, based on hydraulic cylinders as actuators powered by up to 3. 4 MW of hydraulic power in a closed loop hydraulic system. This synthesis of the well-known technology allows {{for the use of}} integrated active and passive heave compensation, as well as the storing and reuse of energy from the lowering phase of an operation. The RamRig concept makes mechanical brakes and clutches obsolete, since hoisting and lowering of the load is controlled solely by the closed loop hydraulics. This decreases the number of critical mechanical components in the hoisting system to a minimum. Safe handling and emergency shut down of extreme amounts of hydraulic power is taking care of by cartridge valves, which make rerouting of hydraulic power possible with minor losses of transferred effect. The second is a new land rig concept based on a patented rack & pinion drive system with a new generation of rigs which can instantly switch between the workover, drilling and the snubbing operations. The new rig concept has a direct drive, thus no <b>drill</b> <b>line.</b> The mobilization time is reduced as the rig has fewer truck loads, a faster rig up and a higher automation level. One land rig currently under construction will be the world’s first single operator unit, with a full pipe handling capability and a fully automated control system. The rig is fully equipped with the 250 T top drive which can be used for the rotation and snubbing, the purpose designed snubbing slips and other features supporting the multifunctional well operations.
