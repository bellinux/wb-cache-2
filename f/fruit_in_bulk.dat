40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Washington and Oregon became {{important}} {{states in}} the production of apples and pears in the early 1900 's. During these beginning stages, wooden boxes were used for shipping both apples and pears. Apple containerization has progressed through several stages. Today, the most common container for shipment of apples out of the Northwest is the tray-packed corrugated carton. Pear containerization, on the other hand, has changed only slightly. Presently, the container most commonly used for shipment of pears is a wooden box of approximately the same dimensions as its early predecessor. Improvements on the wooden box have been made, but basically the container has remained unchanged. In this study, the tray-packed apple carton and the wooden pear box are referred to as standard containers. These two standard containers will be compared to a five bushel, corrugated container, which will be referred to as a bulk bin. In evaluating the expenses which arise when packing <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and standard containers, only the cost differentials were discussed. The major cost categories that were analyzed were: labor, materials, packing house commissions and overhead, and miscellaneous. Due {{to the nature of the}} packing house operations, only labor and material expenses gave rise to cost differentials. The cost differential in favor of bulk containers over standard containers was l. 4784 per 100 pounds of packed apples and 1. 2995 per 100 pounds of packed pears. In order to determine the shipping quality of bulk containers, three shipments of fruit packed in bulk containers were inspected. Two shipments of Anjou pears packed in standard and bulk containers were sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The third shipment was sent to Los Angeles, California and consisted of Red Delicious apples packed in bulk containers. In the pear shipments, three types of damage were recorded. These were: bruising, discoloration, and punctures or skin tears, In the apple shipment, only bruising and puncture damage were recorded. After the containers were inspected and the damages recorded, comparisons between containers were made. Using statistical methods, it was shown that there was no difference in total damage between the bulk and standard containers. In order to determine where the damage was occurring, the bulk containers were divided by height into three equal layers. Using this procedure, the damages occurring in the top, middle, and bottom layers could be identified and compared. Bruising was found to be most severe in the bottom layer. Discoloration and puncture damage was not affected by the layer treatment. From the information gathered in this study, it appears that two important observations can be made. First, the cost associated with 100 pounds of fruit can be substantially reduced by using bulk bins and second, the arrival condition of apples and pears packed in bulk containers will be about the same as fruit packed in standard containers...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} properties of guna <b>fruits,</b> relevant <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> handling and mechanical processing, were determined {{and the effect}} of variety, post harvest history and moisture content investigated. Two varieties of the crop, namely Citrullus colocynthis and Citrullus lanatus, three post harvest storage durations of eight weeks, four weeks and fresh state that gave three moisture levels in the ranges of 87. 21 - 92. 45 % (w. b.) and 85. 07 - 89. 74 % (w. b.) for the Citrullus colocynthis and Citrullus lanatus fruits, respectively, were used. Fruit moisture content was found to decrease with increase in storage period. In the above moisture ranges, the major and minor semi-axial dimensions varied from 5. 27 to 5. 71 cm and 5. 18 to 5. 61 cm, respectively, for the Colocynthis variety and from 4. 53 to 4. 96 cm and 4. 25 to 4. 66 cm, respectively, for the lanatus. The thickness of the epicarp and mesocarp and fruit volume, the fruit, pod and pulp masses, as well as the pod-fruit and pulp-fruit mass ratios increased with increase in moisture content for each fruit variety, while the average seed mass remained virtually constant and the seed-fruit mass ratio decreased with increase in moisture. The true and bulk densities of the fruits also increased with increase in moisture content and ranged from 0. 767 to 0. 803 g cm- 3 and 0. 664 to 0. 698 g cm- 3, respectively, for the colocynthis fruit, and from 0. 637 to 0. 765 g cm- 3 and 0. 554 to 0. 665 g cm- 3, respectively, for the lanatus. Regression equations {{that could be used to}} adequately express the relationship existing between the above properties and fruit moisture were established. The impact strength, bioyield, yield and rupture points and the bioyield, compressive and rupture strengths, as well as the modulus of stiffness and modulus of elasticity of the fruits were higher at the longitudinal loading orientation than at the lateral. At a similar storage condition, all the properties investigated were higher for the Citrullus colocynthis fruits than those of Citrullus lanatus...|$|R

40|$|Polymer gel {{has been}} widely used to control {{excessive}} water production in many mature oilfields; however, there still exist some problems concerning the differences between gelation behavior <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and porous media. In this paper, the gelation time and micro-structures of chromium gel and phenolic resin gel <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and porous media were studied. Results showed that for chromium gel, the initial gelation time in porous media was about 2. 5 – 3. 5 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and final gelation time in porous media was about 6. 0 – 7. 0 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> While for phenolic resin gel, the initial gelation time in porous media was about 1. 0 – 1. 5 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> and final gelation time in porous media was about 1. 5 – 2. 0 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> The morphology of chromium gel and phenolic resin gel <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> were dendritic shape structure and 3 D network structure, respectively. However, the morphology of chromium gel and phenolic resin gel in porous media were both dense gel membranes at low magnification. While at higher magnification, compared with the branchlike cluster structure of chromium gel in porous media, the network of phenolic resin gel was more developed. The experimental results can {{provide the basis for}} determining well shut off time and reveal the differences of gel microstructures between the chromium gel and phenolic gel <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and porous media.

40|$|Skin {{color and}} juice {{constituents}} in large(L), medium(M), nad small(S) fruits of four peach cultivars, Hashiba-hakuho(early maturing), were analyzed to elucidate {{the effect of}} fruit size on the quality. The fruits containing higher soluble solids than 12 °Brix were samled at a commercial packing-house located in southen Okayama. They were stored at 25 ℃ until fully ripened. The skin color on the cheeks (yellowish) was dark <b>in</b> S <b>fruits</b> of Hashiba-hakuto and Hakurei, respectively, compared to the fruits of other sizes. The sucrose + fructose content in juice, {{the major source of}} the sweetness, was higher in S and M <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hakuho, Shimisu-hakuto, and Hakurei, while the malic+citric acid content, the major sour constituent, was lower <b>in</b> L <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> those cultivars, although no significant difference was found in Hashiba-hakuho. Asparagine, the biggest amino acid fraction and thought to deteriorate the fruit taste at high levels, was higher <b>in</b> L <b>fruits</b> tahn <b>in</b> S <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hashiba-hakuho and Hakuho. The content in Shimizu-hakuto and Hakurei fruits was generally low and not affected by fruit size. The content of γ-decalactone, the major peachy aromatic substance, was higher <b>in</b> L <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hashiba-hakuto, <b>in</b> M <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hakuho and Shimizu-hakuto, and <b>in</b> S <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hakurei, than in those of other sizes. Sensory tests revealed that the L fruits of Hakuho and S fruits of Hakurei were poor in flavor. These results suggest that the larger fruits of Hakuho, Shimizu-kakuto, and Hakurei, the representative white peach <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Okayama, have rather falatter tastes than medium size fruits because of their lower sweetness and sourness and weaker aroma, as well as poorer texture. 岡山市一宮のモモの選果場に出荷された有袋栽培の‘橋場白鳳’（早生），‘白鳳’（早中生），‘清水白桃’（中生）および‘白麗’（晩生）から，３段階のサイズ（Ｌ，Ｍ，Ｓ）の果実を入手し，完熟状態（手で皮が剥ける）に達するまで 25 ℃の室温においた．それらの果実について，果皮色と果汁成分の分析と果肉の食味テストを行い，果実のサイズによる品質の相違を検討した．‘橋場白鳳’では，Ｓ果実は地色が暗く，‘清水白桃’のＬ果実は着色が濃いが色調が暗く，‘白麗’のＬ果実は着色が薄くて黄色が強く，いずれも外観が劣った．果汁中の主要な甘味成分であるスクロース＋フルクトース含量は，‘白鳳’，‘清水白桃’および‘白麗’ではＳまたはＬ果実で高く，酸味成分のリンゴ酸＋クエン酸含量は，それら３品種のＬ果実で最も低かった．‘橋場白鳳’では果実サイズによる糖・酸含量の有意な差がなかった．果実に苦みを与えるアスパラギン含量は，‘橋場白鳳’と‘白鳳’ではＬ果実で高かったが，‘清水白桃’と‘白麗’ではどのサイズでも含量が低かった．モモ香の主成分であるγ-decalactoneは，‘橋場白鳳’ではＬ果実で高かったが，‘白鳳’と‘清水白桃’ではＭ果実で，‘白麗’ではＳ果実で高かった．官能テストの結果，‘白鳳’のＬ果実と‘白麗’のＳ果実は食味が劣った．これらの結果から，岡山の「白桃」を代表する‘白鳳’，‘清水白桃’，‘白麗’の大果は，中程度の大きさの果実より甘味と酸味が低く，アロマが弱いなど，食味が薄く，肉質も劣ると考えられる...|$|R
