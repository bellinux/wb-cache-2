25|$|Cryptosporidiosis, {{also known}} as crypto, is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Cryptosporidium, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunocompromised individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that {{it can also be}} transmitted via fomites in respiratory secretions.|$|E
25|$|Large {{strongyle}} worms, {{most commonly}} Strongylus vulgaris, are implicated in colic secondary to non-strangulating infarction of the cranial mesenteric artery supplying the intestines, most {{likely due to}} vasospasm. Usually the <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and the large colon are affected, but any segment supplied by this artery can be compromised. This type of colic has become relatively rare {{with the advent of}} modern anthelminthics. Clinical signs vary based on the degree of vascular compromise and the length of intestine that is affected, and include acute and severe colic seen with other forms of strangulating obstruction, so diagnosis is usually made based on anthelminthic administration history although may be definitively diagnosed during surgical exploratoration. Treatment includes typical management of colic signs and endotoxemia, and the administration of aspirin {{to reduce the risk of}} thrombosis, but surgery is usually not helpful since lesions are often patchy and may be located in areas not easily resected.|$|E

40|$|Age-specific {{changes in}} {{glycosylation}} of rat intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase {{were analyzed using}} enzyme immunoprecipitated from microvillus membranes of suckling, weaning, and adult rats, and carbohydrate moieties were examined by lectin affinity binding, metabolic labeling, and neuraminidase treatment. Lectin binding indicated the presence of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide chains containing mannose and galactose throughout development. An age-dependent shift in sialic acid and fucose was seen {{during the period of}} weaning; no fucose was detectable in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase until after the rats were 20 days of age, whereas sialic acid was reduced in adult lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. The presence of sialic acid in suckling intestines and fucose in adult was confirmed by metabolic labeling with appropriate radioactive precursors. Sodium dodecyl phosphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of immunoprecipitated lactase-phlorizin hydrolase from the proximal and mid <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> showed two bands of approximately 220 and 130 kilodaltons in all age groups. In the distal part of the adult <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> lactase-phlorizin hydrolase appeared as two bands of similar size to those found in the proximal and mid portions. In contrast, during the suckling and weaning periods, these distal bands were approximately 225 and 135 kilodaltons. [35 S]-methionine labeling and fluorography of neonatal intestines confirmed these observations. The size difference between proximal and <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> was virtually eliminated by neuraminidase treatment. These data indicate that the core structure of microvillus membrane lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, consisting of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, remains constant during development, although terminal sugars shift from predominantly sialic acid during the suckling period to fucose in adulthood. This alteration in glycosylation of the protein occurs in a different pattern from the postweaning decline in lactase specific activity. Consequently, age-dependent changes in glycosylation cannot account for the decrease in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase-specific activity observed during developmen...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes was induced in rats by {{administration}} {{of a single}} intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body wt). After 7 days, one group of diabetic animals was treated with insulin for an additional 5 days. Control, diabetic and diabetic + insulin rats were then killed, their <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> were removed and the epithelial cells were examined and compared with respect to polyphosphoinositide turnover, total protein kinase C activity and cellular distribution, and 1, 2 -diacylglycerol mass and production. The results of these experiments demonstrated that, compared with their control counterparts, the intestines from diabetic rats had a decreased turnover of polyphosphoinositides, but an increase in 1, 2 -diacylglycerol mass which was a result, at least in part, {{of an increase in}} the synthesis of this lipid de novo. Total protein kinase C activity was decreased in the diabetic rats due to a decrease in cytosolic activity, with no significant change in particulate activity. Moreover, insulin administration for 5 days to diabetic animals did not affect their lowered intestinal polyphosphoinositide turnover, but did further accentuate their increased 1, 2 -diacylglycerol mass and synthesis de novo; this treatment also corrected total protein kinase C activity by increasing the cytosolic activity of this enzyme. These results indicate that signalling mechanisms involving polyphosphoinositides, 1, 2 -diacylglycerol and protein kinase C are abnormal in the intestines of diabetic rats and that some of these biochemical parameters can be modulated by insulin administration in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: Capsule {{endoscopy}} {{is a novel}} {{non-invasive method}} for visualization of the entire small bowel. The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy depends {{on the quality of}} visualization of the small bowel mucosa and its complete passage through the small bowel. To date, there is no standardized protocol for bowel preparation before capsule endoscopy. The addition of simethicone in the bowel preparation for the purpose of reducing air bubbles in the intestinal lumen had only been studied by a few investigators. Methods: Sixty-four participants were randomly divided into two groups to receive a bowel preparation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (Group 1) and both PEG solution and simethicone (Group 2). The PEG solution and simethicone were taken the night before and 20 min prior to capsule endoscopy, respectively. Frames taken in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> were examined and scored for luminal bubbles by two professional capsule endoscopists. Gastric emptying time and small bowel transit time were also recorded. Results: Simethicone significantly reduced luminal bubbles both in the proximal and <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines.</b> The mean time proportions with slight bubbles in the proximal and distal intestines in Group 2 were 97. 1 % and 99. 0 %, respectively, compared with 67. 2 % (P< 0. 001) and 68. 8 % (P< 0. 001) in Group 1. Simethicone had no effect on mean gastric emptying time, 32. 08 min in Group 2 compared with 30. 88 min in Group 1 (P= 0. 868), but it did increase mean small intestinal transit time from 227. 28 to 281. 84 min (P= 0. 003). Conclusion: Bowel preparation with both PEG and simethicone significantly reduced bubbles in the intestinal lumen and improved the visualization of the small bowel by capsule endoscopy without any side effects observed...|$|R

Animal model with APC gene mutation is an effective tool for study of preventive approaches against intestinal carcinomas. We aimed to evaluate the effect of Riccardin D, a macrocyclic bisbibenzyl compound, as a chemopreventive agent against intestinal adenoma formation in APC Min/+ mice. Methods: APC Min/+ mice were given Riccardin D by p. o. gavage for 7 weeks. Mice were sacrificed, and the number, size and histopathology of intestinal polyps were examined under a microscope. We performed immunohistochemical staining, western blotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in intestinal polyps to investigate the mechanism of chemopreventive effect of Riccardin D. Results: Riccardin D treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of intestinal adenoma formation, showing a reduction of polyp number by 41. 7 %, 31. 1 % and 44. 4 %, respectively, in proximal, middle and <b>distal</b> portions of <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> The activity of Riccardin D against polyp formation was more profound in colon, wherein Riccardin D decreased polyp number by 79. 3 %.

40|$|Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) strains {{have been}} {{associated}} with sporadic cases and outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and with the hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. Since adherence of enteric pathogens to epithelial surfaces is often a prerequisite for the subsequent delivery of bacterial enterotoxins and mucosal invasion, we evaluated intestinal adherence by 18 VTEC strains, which were of human origin and belonged to 10 distinct serotypes, 7 days after enteral challenge of rabbits. A total of 23 postweaning rabbits (body weight, 1 kg) were each fed 2 X 10 (8) VTEC, and 5 rabbits were challenged with an equal number of fecal commensal E. coli strains as controls. Each rabbit was monitored daily for the development of diarrhea. At 7 days after infection the proximal jejunum, distal ileum, cecum, and proximal colon were removed from each rabbit and examined for the presence of adherent organisms under light microscopy, after Giemsa staining of Formalin-fixed secretions, and by transmission electron microscopy. Nonbloody diarrhea developed in 16 of 23 VTEC-infected rabbits in contrast to 0 of 5 infected with commensal E. coli strains (P less than 0. 02). Organisms were adherent to surface epithelial cells in the ceca (20 of 23 rabbits), proximal colons (9 of 23), and distal ilea (6 of 23) of VTEC-infected rabbits. Intimate attaching and effacing binding of bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells, in regions where the normal microvillous membrane architecture had been disrupted, was observed under electron microscopy for VTEC of multiple serotypes. In contrast, no organisms were adherent to the jejuni. Adherence of organisms was not seen in any portion of the intestines of rabbits that were challenged with commensals. These findings indicate that multiple serotypes of VTEC demonstrate intimate attaching and effacing binding to rabbit enterocytes and colonocytes in vivo. In addition to bacterial binding in the ceca and colons, VTEC adhere to enterocytes in the <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> of per orally infected postweaning rabbits...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea that}} a SIBO test should be several hours long and that distal {{overgrowth}} is important is wrong and is {{not supported by the}} scientific literature. The optimal testing is 1 hour. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs as a result of excessive numbers of bacteria inhabiting the proximal small intestine. Bacterial concentrations greater than 105 organisms per milliliter is diagnostic for SIBO. We know bacteria are colonizing the proximal and not the <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> for several reasons. First, the gold standard method for detection of SIBO is jejunal aspirates. Intestinal fluid of the proximal intestine is sampled, not distal intestinal fluid. Secondly, the consequences of SIBO are the result of competition between bacteria and the human host for ingested nutrients in the intestine. Various functional consequences of bacterial infiltration cause enterocyte damage in the jejunum such as diminished disaccharidase activity, fat malabsorption, decreased amino acid transport and decreased vitamin B12 absorption. Thus, detection of proximal bacterial overgrowth is critical.|$|E

It was found a decreasing tendency in the glucuronidation from the proximal to distal segment of the small intestine: e. g. 430 nmol, 240 nmol, and 100 nmol PNP-G appeared in the perfusion medium in the proximal, distal jejunum and in the terminal ileum, respectively, when 500 μM PNP was luminally perfused for 90 minutes. Similar ratio was found at the luminal perfusion of other PNP-concentrations, too. Luminal appearance of sulfoconjugate of PNP was considerably lower and no clear gradient tendency in the formation of PNP-S could be detected in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> from the proximal to distal segment.

40|$|Mutations of the adenomatous {{polyposis}} coli (APC) gene predispose {{individuals to}} {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP), characterized by multiple tumours in the large intestine. Most mouse models heterozygous for truncating mutant Apc alleles mimic FAP, however, the intestinal tumours occur mainly in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> To model large intestinal tumours, we generated a new conditional Apc-mutant allele, Apc 15 lox, with exon 15 flanked by loxP sites. Similar survival of Apc 1638 N/ 15 loxand Apc 1638 N/ 1 mice indicated that the normal function of Apc was not impaired by the loxP sites. Deletion of exon 15, encoding nearly all functional Apc domains and containing the polyadenylation signal, resulted in a mutant allele expressing low levels of a 74 kDa truncated Apc protein. Germ line Cre-mediated deletion of exon 15 resulted in ApcD 15 / 1 mice, showing a severe ApcMin/ 1 -like phenotype characterized by multiple tumours in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and early lethality. In contrast, conditional Cre-mediated deletion of exon 15 specifically directed to the epithelia of <b>distal</b> <b>small</b> and large <b>intestine</b> of FabplCre;Apc 15 lox/ 1 mice led to longer survival and to tumours that developed predominantly in the large intestine, mimicking human FAP-associated colorectal cancer and sporadic colorectal cancer.

This differential stimulation of AdoMet decarboxylase by DFMO in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and colon could not be entirely explained {{on the basis of}} differences in polyamine contents, which are known to regulate this enzyme activity. Kinetic and inhibition studies of AdoMet decarboxylase in control <b>small</b> and large <b>intestine</b> revealed that: (1) {{there was no difference in}} Vmax. values between the tissues; (2) the Km for AdoMet was higher in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> than in the colon; and (3) the Ki for product inhibition by decarboxylated AdoMet was higher in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> than in the colon.

The gut immune-associated cells were investigated by histology and immunohistochemistry method. This study found that from proximal to <b>distal</b> segments in <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> of normal mice, the numbers of intraepithelial lymphocyte, IgA(+) and mast cells decreased gradually, whereas CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cell number increased gradually. When 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) was intraperitoneally injected into mice, IEL numbers were significantly decreased in whole <b>small</b> <b>intestines.</b> However, IgA(+) and mast cell numbers decreased merely in the proximal segment while CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cell numbers and their ratio reduced mainly in the distal segment. These findings indicated that sympathetic denervation disturbed the patterns of gut immune-associated cell distribution. It would substantiate the thesis of neuro-immune-endocrine and provide the new ideas for the intestinal disease prevention and drug developments...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} {{the development and}} characterization of a mouse and human epithelial cell monolayer platform of the <b>small</b> and large <b>intestines,</b> with {{a broad range of}} potential applications including the discovery and development of minimally systemic drug candidates. Culture conditions for each intestinal segment were optimized by correlating monolayer global gene expression with the corresponding tissue segment. The monolayers polarized, formed tight junctions, and contained a diversity of intestinal epithelial cell lineages. Ion transport phenotypes of monolayers from the proximal and <b>distal</b> colon and <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> matched the known and unique physiology of these intestinal segments. The cultures secreted serotonin, GLP- 1, and FGF 19 and upregulated the epithelial sodium channel in response to known biologically active agents, suggesting intact secretory and absorptive functions. A screen of over 2, 000 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of potassium ion transport in the mouse distal colon cultures led to the identification of a tool compound. : Siegel and colleagues {{describe the}}ir development of a human and mouse intestinal epithelial cell monolayer platform that maintains the cellular, molecular, and functional characteristics of tissue for each intestinal segment. They demonstrate the platform's application to drug discovery by screening a library of over 2, 000 compounds to identify an inhibitor of potassium ion transport in the mouse distal colon.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{barrier is}} immature in newborn mammals allowing for transfer of bioactive macromolecules, e. g. protecting antibodies, from mother's milk {{to the blood}} circulation and in neonatal rodents lasts until weaning. This passage involves the neonatal-Fc-receptor (FcRn) binding IgG in the proximal and highly endocytic vacuolated enterocytes in the <b>distal</b> immature <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> (SI). Recent studies have suggested an involvement of the transcription factor B-lymphocyte-induced maturation-protein- 1 (Blimp- 1) in the regulation of SI maturation in mice. Hence, {{the objective of the}} present study was to monitor the development of the intestinal barrier function, in relation to Blimp- 1 expression during both natural and precociously induced intestinal maturation in rats. During the suckling period IgG plasma levels increased, while after gut closure it temporarily decreased. This corresponded to a high expression of FcRn in the proximal SI epithelium and the presence of vacuolated enterocytes in the distal SI. The immature foetal-type epithelium was replaced after weaning or induced precocious maturation, by an adult-type epithelium with FcRnneg cells in the proximal and by non-vacuolated enterocytes in the distal SI. In parallel to this epithelial shift, Blimp- 1 expression decreased in the distal SI. The switch from foetal- to adult-type epithelium, with decreased proximal expression of FcRn and distal replacement of vacuolated enterocytes, was concurrent in the two SI regions and could be used for monitoring SI maturation in the rat. The changes in expression of Blimp- 1 in the distal SI epithelium followed the maturation pattern...|$|R
