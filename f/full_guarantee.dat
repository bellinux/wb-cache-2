According to historian Robert Brugger, [...] "...the measure marked a notable departure from Old World oppression."

[...] The authors of the book Inciucio cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.|$|E

"Aseer Zadi" [...] is a {{story about}} a family that prides itself in its traditions and all the men of the family have married thrice since their first and second wives were not capable of bearing them children. The family only thinks that the third wife can give birth to a child and even if first or second wife gives birth to a child, the child is killed. The head of the family Great Peer marries Amna who becomes {{pregnant}} but her child is killed. He marries Naseem who is incapable and finally he marries Bari Sarkar who gives birth to a boy Shahaab while Amna and Naseem are treated as Living Deadbodies wearing only a white suit. Many years pass and Shahaab has grown up. The same is going to happen with him but he hates this principle. His third wife will be Fatima, daughter of Bari Sarkar's brother. Bari Sarkar loves her more than Shahaab but Shahaab hates her. Fatima always teases Amna and Naseem. Shahaab is married to Yasmeen but as she could not bear a child, he is being married to Maira. Maira at first rejects because of the family principle which makes Amna and Naseem happy. Although Maira and Yasmeen are wives of the same man, they are good friends. Shahaab starts liking Maira whereas Maira's cousin Bilal calls her at her in-laws house. Fatima manipulates the situation {{in such a way that}} Shahaab starts doubting Maira. Bari Sarkar abuses Maira but Peer Jalal supports Maira. Seeing both of them alone, Amna suspects an affair between them which creates misunderstanding between Peer Jalal and Bari Sarkar but all that is resolved as Amna was thinking wrong. Maira and Shahaab have a nice relationship. They both go for a honeymoon. Now Shahaab has to marry Fatima. He comes back but Maira faints so he goes back and doesn't come till 1 am. On the other hand, the doctor says to Shahaab that Maira is pregnant. When he tells the truth to Bari Sarkar, she throws Maira in a room. Bari Sarkar says that she will take her to a doctor. But Amna warns Maira by saying what had happened with her. Amna starts blackmailing Peer Jalal while Naseem abuses Peer Jalal and Bari Sarkar by saying the incident which happened with Amna.She says what happened with me should not happen to Maira. He agrees. On the other hand, Shahaab calls Dr. Mehrunnisa in their home. While Naseem says to Amna that you have taken advantage of this situation but Amna says that she has done right. Bari Sarkar goes to her brother's house for forgiveness but to no avail while Fatima supports Bari Sarkar. Upon hearing the truth, Bari Sarkar is shocked. Fatima starts crying while Maira makes fun of Fatima. Yasmeen comes and threatens Maira by saying that you are just pregnant there is no <b>full</b> <b>guarantee</b> that you will give birth to this child. Maira is shocked by Yasmeen's behaviour Now Amna, Naseem and Yasmeen are no more living dead bodies who wear white suits as widow but wearing expensive colourful suits. Yasmeen lures towards Shahaab which makes Maira suspicious. Her mother tells her to keep some distance from Yasmeen. At first she ignores, but later believes. While coming from her mother's home to her in-laws house., she forgets the cloth which is compulsory for all the girls of the house and so Bari Sarkar is furious at her. Maira taunts her by saying that her husband has no problem so whats her problem. Shahaab is angry with Maira. Bari Sarkar, in anger, leaves the house and goes to her brother Sikandar's house. Fatima supports Bari Sarkar which makes Sikandar angry. Shahaab comes to take Bari Sarkar but Fatima refuses by saying that if anyone from the mansion comes to pick Bari Sarkar, he/she should be thrown out of the house. Peer Jalal creates problems between Maira and Shahaab by saying that the child in Maira's womb does not belong to Shahaab. Maira goes to her house where Bilal tells Maira to go in her in-laws house which makes Maira angry. He calls her 2 times and then again her phone rings she thinks its Bilal and she abuses Bilal but it is of Shahaab [...]Maira becomes tensed. Now Naseem starts behaving as the Bari Sarkar of the house. Fatima takes care of Bari Sarkar and goes to bring breakfast. Bari Sarkar sees her laptop as an audio clip is opened and she presses the Play Button. She hears that Fatima has insulted Shahaab and is happy. She feels dejected as she had loved her more than anyone and she betrayed her by saying that no one has come to pick her up. She goes to her house but now she is no more arrogant and a vamp but a good woman [...] She comes to know about Peer Jalal's lies and tells Shahaab to pick Maira. While Yasmeen wants a child from Shahaab, Amna requests Naseem to forgive Peer Jalal and finally she forgives him. Maira meanwhile is angry with Shahaab so Bari Sarkar consoles her. On the other hand, Fatima goes mentally ill. So Sikandar vows to take revenge from Maira. Yasmeen's jealousy is increased so much that she asks divorce from Shahaab but he doesn't give her. Maira tells Shahaab to spend some time with Yasmeen as she is also his wife. Maira is going to the doctor so Bari Sarkar also joins her. Peer Jalal calls Sikander that this is the right time as Maira is going out.Bari Sarkar says to Maira that both boy and girl are same Meanwhile, Sikandar shoots the car in which Maira is going and sees a blooded hand. He is very happy. Shahaab gets a call and he and Yasmeen go to hospital where it comes to know that Bari Sarkar had got the bullet not Maira and that Bari Sarkar is dead. Amna, Naseem, Maira, Yasmeen and Shahaab are shocked. Peer Jalal commits suicide.Many years have passed and Maira has three kids-two sons and one daughter. Yasmeen on the other hand is unhappy so Maira gives her son to Yasmeen forever. Yasmeen is very happy. When Shahaab asks Maira that what should be our daughter's name, she replies that it will be Zeenat Shahabuddin as this was Bari Sarkar's original name. Maira and Shahaab live happily forever.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{a class of}} {{stochastic}} design problems formulated in terms of general inequality conditions on expectations.

In contrast with existing probabilistic methods that only solve such problems with a certain probability (degree of confidence), we propose a novel method that provides a <b>full</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the constructed solution truly solves the original problem. The main idea of our method is based on overapproximating the expectations by suitably constructed upper Riemann-Stieltjes sums and imposing the inequalities on these sums instead. Next to the <b>full</b> <b>guarantee</b> on the constructed solution, the method offers three other advantages. First, it applies to arbitrary probability distributions. Second, under rather mild conditions we can derive a #x 201 C;converse theorem #x 201 D; that states that if the original problem is solvable, our method will find a solution by sufficiently refining the upper Riemann-Stieltjes sums. Finally, we will show that convexity of the function used in the expectation can be exploited to obtain convex design conditions in our approach...|$|E
