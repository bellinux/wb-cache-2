5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was enthusiastic about the idea, but questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E
5|$|During a February science {{committee}} hearing, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> Texas Instruments president Richard Templeton {{regarding the}} company's efforts to compensate cancer-stricken former employees of its Attleboro, Massachusetts, nuclear facility. A prolific fundraiser, he launched his political action committee, the 4MA PAC, in April. As {{a member of}} the Foreign Affairs Committee, he traveled in May with four other legislators to Afghanistan, where they met with President Hamid Karzai and members of the military. That month he was named chairman of Governor Deval Patrick's STEM Advisory Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 Congressman Lamar S. Smith, {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, held hearings on the compensation issue. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members. In November 1999 the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing payment of compensation {{to the families of}} the American Black Hawk victims.|$|E

5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings {{he seems to have}} considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E
5|$|What {{at first}} {{seems to be}} an open-and-shut case becomes {{confused}} though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Locating Red, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> her, hoping {{to get to the bottom}} of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny's house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.|$|E
5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2007, federal {{prosecutors}} charged the Jew with {{one count of}} mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> what influence he could have over the issuing of permits, and reiterated his refusal to resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor Gavin Newsom. On November 7, 2007, {{a federal grand jury}} added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E
5|$|While the Democrats {{were in the}} minority, Randall {{spent much}} of his time scrutinizing the Republicans' {{appropriations}} bills. During the Grant administration, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments' needs. He proposed a bill that would end the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through {{at the end of a}} session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations.|$|E

5|$|While {{traveling}} from Shandong into North Zhili, Choe noticed {{a multitude of}} boats passing by which held officials from the Ministries of War, Justice, and Personnel. When <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> his escorts about this, Choe {{was told that the}} newly enthroned Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1488–1505) had recently impeached a large number of officials from office whom he considered inept and unworthy of their positions. Brook writes that it was quite a comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the courier service, yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball <b>he</b> <b>questioned,</b> except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E

5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919, but {{resigned}} in 1925 {{when he felt}} that the party was only serving the interests of the Brahmins. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> the subjugation of Dravidians as the Brahmins enjoyed gifts and donations from them but opposed and discriminated them in cultural and religious matters. In 1924, E.V. Ramasamy participated in a non-violent agitation (satyagraha) in Vaikam, Kerala. From 1929 to 1932 Ramasamy toured British Malaya, Europe, and Russia, which had an influence on him. In 1939, E.V. Ramasamy became the head of the Justice Party, and in 1944, he changed its name to Dravidar Kazhagam. The party later split and one group led by C. N. Annadurai formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida Nadu (land of the Dravidians).|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 that he did not know anything about Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling the investigator that he had suspected Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the polygraph examiner who tested Feit in 1960 said that <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his polygraph and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the examiner felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E

5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
5|$|After a long-awaited {{pre-season}} {{after the}} agreements from the NFL lockout, {{and the release}} of Delhomme, McCoy became the starter for the Browns. In the home opener against the Bengals, McCoy threw 19 for 40 attempts throwing 213 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in a 27-17 loss. The next two weeks, the Browns defeated the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins with McCoy throwing combined 41 of 71 attempts, 421 yards, and 3 touchdowns with 1 interception. Against the Tennessee Titans in week 5, McCoy threw 1 touchdown and 1 interception in a 13-31 loss. After a bye week, McCoy and the Browns lost to the Oakland Raiders 17-24, McCoy threw for 215 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. After the loss to the Oakland Raiders the Browns played the Seattle Seahawks and won 6-3 as McCoy finished with 178 yards, no touchdowns, and 1 interception. Against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 14, McCoy threw 2 interceptions and no touchdowns in a 3-14 loss where McCoy would also sustain a concussion. His father raised eyebrows when <b>he</b> <b>questioned</b> whether or not McCoy's team had properly evaluated him for the concussion prior to returning to the game. McCoy stated that he did not remember anything. James Harrison, the Steelers player responsible for the helmet-to-helmet hit on McCoy, was subsequently punished by being suspended for the Steelers' next game against the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate Speech, in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. <b>He</b> <b>questioned</b> whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate Speech and discussed Freedom for the Thought That We Hate, in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, The Harm in Hate Speech persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E
