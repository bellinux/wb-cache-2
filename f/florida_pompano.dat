50|$|The <b>Florida</b> <b>pompano</b> (Trachinotus carolinus) is {{a species}} of marine fish in the Trachinotus (pompano) genus of the family Carangidae. It has a {{compressed}} body and short snout; coloration varies from blue-greenish silver on the dorsal areas and silver to yellow on the body and fins. It can be found along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean, depending on the season, and is popular for both sport and commercial fishing. Most <b>Florida</b> <b>pompano</b> caught weigh less than 3 lb and are less than 17 in long, though the largest individuals weigh 8 - 9 lb and reach lengths up to 26 in.|$|E

Despite its name, the range of the <b>Florida</b> <b>pompano</b> extends from Massachusetts to Brazil, but it is more common in areas near Florida. During the summer, it can be found near Sebastian, Cape Hatteras, and the Gulf of Mexico. It is more common near oil rigs, Palm Beach, and Hobe Sound during the winter. It can also be found near the Virgin Islands year round.|$|E

Newly hatched larvae were transparent and had a large, elongate yolk sac and single oil globule. The lower and upper jaws as well as the digestive tract were not fully developed at hatching.

In this study, the growth and survival of <b>Florida</b> <b>pompano</b> larvae fed nauplii of the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus pelagicus were {{compared with those of}} larvae fed the standard reference diet of enriched rotifers Brachionus plicatilis. Experiments were conducted during the first 7 – 9 d posthatch (DPH), a period preceding the provision of Artemia nauplii. Treatments included feeding only copepod nauplii during the first day, the first three days, and on all days, as well as copepod nauplii mixed with rotifers during the entire experiment. In addition, the dietary effects on larval fatty acid composition were examined. Feeding copepod nauplii at a density of 2. 0 – 3. 5 nauplii/mL during the first day or the first three days of feeding had advantages over feeding only rotifers. However, after approximately 3 DPH, increased quantities of nauplii were needed to provide sufficient nutrients for growth. This was demonstrated in larvae fed copepod nauplii for the entire trial, for which survival was significantly higher than for the other treatments but for which growth was significantly reduced. Larvae fed a mixture of rotifers and nauplii for the entire trial had survival similar to that of larvae fed only rotifers (∼ 40 %); however, growth was greater in larvae fed the mixed diet, suggesting that there is a nutritional advantage to including copepods in the diet. Fatty acid analyses revealed that increased levels of docosahexaenoic acid were associated with larvae fed copepods, which probably contributed to the observed higher survival and growth.

40|$|Presumably an individual's risk of {{predation}} {{is reduced}} by group membership and this 'safety in numbers' concept has been readily applied to investigations of schooling prey; however, foraging in groups may also be beneficial. We tested the hypothesis that, when feeding in groups, foraging of a coastal fish (<b>Florida</b> <b>Pompano,</b> Trachinotus carolinus) on a benthic prey source would be facilitated (i. e. fish feeding in groups will consume more prey items). Although this question has been addressed for other fish species, {{it has not been}} previously addressed for <b>Florida</b> <b>Pompano,</b> a fish known to exhibit schooling behavior and that is used for aquaculture, where understanding the feeding ecology is important for healthy and efficient grow-out. In this experiment, juvenile <b>Florida</b> <b>Pompano</b> were offered a fixed number of coquina clams (Donax spp.) for one hour either in a group or as individuals. The following day they were tested in the opposite configuration. Fish in groups achieved greater consumption (average of 26 clams consumed by the entire group) than the individuals comprising the group (average of 14 clams consumed [sum of clams consumed by all individuals of the group]). Fish in groups also had fewer unsuccessful foraging attempts (2. 75 compared to 4. 75 hr(- 1)) and tended to have a shorter latency until the first feeding activity. Our results suggest fish in groups were more comfortable feeding and more successful in their feeding attempts. Interestingly, the consumption benefit of group foraging was not shared by all [...] not all fish within a group consumed equal numbers of clams.

40|$|Aquaculture is {{currently}} the fastest growing sector of protein production, {{and is expected to}} overtake the harvest of wild fisheries. Limitations in nutrition, specifically fatty acid nutrition, are preventing even more dramatic growth of many species of commercial importance. Currently, much of the research involving fatty acids examines requirements as being correlated to thermal guilds (warm vs. cool water) or salinity tolerance (marine vs. freshwater). However, recent studies have revealed the potential for trophic level to be as much, if not more, influential in determining fatty acid requirements of a species. As such, two feeding trials were conducted to determine the requirements of two species of different trophic levels (Oreochromis niloticus and Trachinotus carolinus) based on C 18 PUFA vs. LC-PUFA. Nile Tilapia, O. niloticus, exhibited similar growth regardless of the inclusion of C 18 PUFA or LC-PUFA, however, tissue fatty acid profiles were influenced per the diet provided. As such, it was concluded that Nile Tilapia exhibit the capacity to effectively synthesize LC-PUFA from C 18 PUFA as is seen in many species that occupy low trophic levels. <b>Florida</b> <b>Pompano,</b> T. carolinus, did not exhibit any significant differences in growth regardless of the diet provided, but numerical differences indicated benefits towards inclusion of dietary LC-PUFAs.

40|$|The water {{chemistry}} and economics of a commercial-scale inland marine {{integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}} (IMTA) system was investigated. The system used {{a combination of a}} constructed wetland, sand filter followed by a constructed wetland, and geotextile bags to treat solids waste. This study is a demonstration of a zero-discharge system where commercial nursery production of wetland plants was combined with a marine RAS to treat saline solid waste. Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured. Plant and soil samples were analyzed for TN and TP. A significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) difference in the effluent concentrations was not found. The variability inherent in a commercial-scale system made it difficult to isolate the individual efficiencies of the three treatment systems. Production of wetland plants was critical for aiding nutrient removal by facilitating aggregation of solids and providing conditions for denitrification. On average the nitrate concentration decreased over time due to the denitrification occurring in the plant beds. Water samples were analyzed for dissolved metals: Mn, Ni, Se, Sr, Cd, Li, Hg, Mo, Fe, B, Cu, Pb, Zn, La, Ca, K, and Mg; Mn and Fe showed a gradual increase in concentration over time. This IMTA system successfully produced <b>Florida</b> <b>pompano,</b> and the fish waste and uneaten feed provided enough nutrients to produce multiple cohorts of wetland plants over a two-year period.

30|$|Water {{temperature}} {{is a critical}} factor {{for the success of}} fish hatchery production, and it has significant implication on the growth performance of fish larvae (Boglione et al. 2013 b). Temperature can regulate fish metabolism, food intake and growth (Jobling 1994; Ma 2014), and the effects of temperature on fish growth have been well documented in the larvae of commercially important fish species including haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus L. (Martell et al. 2005), nase Chondrostoma nasus L. (Keckeis et al. 2001), Australian snapper Pagrus auratus (Fielder et al. 2005), striped trumpeter Latris lineata (Choa et al. 2010), and yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi (Ma 2014). In golden pompano, the fast growth at high temperature may be attributed to the improved food ingestion and digestive function of fish larvae after 15 DPH as Ma et al. (2014 b) reported that the goblet cells and gastric glands appeared in the gut of golden pompano larvae after 15 DPH at 27 – 29  °C. The growth of fish larvae tended to be accelerated when fish were weaned from rotifers to Artemia nauplii. Similar to the <b>Florida</b> <b>pompano</b> Trachinotus carolinus (Riley et al. 2009), the length of mouth gape close to 1.05  mm should allow golden pompano larvae to ingest Artemia nauplii and other similar size of food particles by 12 DPH. Therefore, the significant difference in fish size between thermal treatments at 18 DPH may be also related to the use of high energy food from 9 DPH onwards.|$|E
