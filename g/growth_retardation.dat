5|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{seen with}} the syndrome include developmental delay, <b>growth</b> <b>retardation,</b> pulmonary stenosis (an obstruction of blood-flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery) with associated dyspnea (shortness of breath), and renal agenesis (failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period). Undescended testes, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, <b>growth</b> <b>retardation,</b> infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E

Most affected individuals die in the uterus or are stillbirths, and liveborns usually die within a week.|$|E
25|$|Undernutrition during pregnancy, {{and other}} factors, may cause intrauterine <b>growth</b> <b>retardation</b> (IUGR), {{which is one}} cause of low birth weight. However, it has been {{suggested}} that in IUGR the brain may be selectively spared. Brain growth is usually less affected than whole body weight or length. Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine <b>growth</b> <b>retardation</b> also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in adolescence or adulthood. For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas. This was later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18–19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas. The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES), whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES. Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.|$|E
25|$|WR is {{associated}} with abnormalities in bone maturation, and lipids and hormone metabolism.

40|$|Congenital {{isolated}} thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency is an {{autosomal recessive}} disease that manifests as hypothyroidism (cretinism), causing severe mental and <b>growth</b> <b>retardations.</b> Patients {{were found to}} have a single base substitution in the codon for the 29 th amino acid of the TSH beta subunit gene. The alteration is {{in the center of the}} so-called CAGYC region, which consists of an amino acid sequence conserved among all of the known glycoprotein hormone beta subunits. No other nucleotide substitutions have been found in the gene thus far sequenced. Microinjection of the mutated beta mRNAs into Xenopus laevis oocytes led to the formation of conformationally altered beta polypeptides that could not associate with alpha subunits. The mutation created a new recognition site for the enzyme MaeI. Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA digested with MaeI showed that the patients were homozygous and their parents were heterozygous for the mutation. This test was also used to examine other family members for the disease...|$|R

25|$|Microcephalic osteodysplastic {{primordial}} dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal <b>growth</b> <b>retardation,</b> microcephaly with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, {{and distinctive}} skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine <b>growth</b> <b>retardation.</b> She had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her {{first six months of}} life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A brain MRI revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly. This child’s neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked lissencephaly in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} phenylketonuria, it is {{important}} for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta. The child may develop congenital heart disease, <b>growth</b> <b>retardation,</b> microcephaly and intellectual disability as a result. PKU-affected women themselves are not at risk of additional complications during pregnancy.|$|E

However, {{they do not have}} a higher risk of cancer.|$|E
40|$|Leukocyte {{adhesion}} deficiency II (LAD II) {{is a rare}} congenital disease {{which is}} caused by a defect in fucosylation of glycoconjugates. Hypofucosylated structures include ligands for the selectin family of adhesion molecules. This results in a leukocyte adhesion defect causing an immunodeficiency. In addition, LAD II patients show severe mental and <b>growth</b> <b>retardations</b> suggesting a role of fucose in development. Recently, a LAD II patient was treated with oral supplementation of fucose. This simple therapy restored selectin ligands and corrected the immunodeficiency. However, in another patient the treatment protocol had no effect indicating that the biochemical defect in the latter patient is somewhat different. The genetic defect in LAD II has now been located to a gene encoding a GDP-fucose transporter which gates GDP-fucose into the Golgi where fucose is transferred onto glycoconjugates. Point mutations have been detected in this gene in several LAD II patients, which inactivate the transporter function. Thus, LAD II represents the first developmental and immune defect that is based on a malfunctioning nucleotide sugar transporter...|$|R

Heavy infections could lead to acute symptoms such as diarrhoea and anaemia, and chronic symptoms such as <b>growth</b> <b>retardation</b> and impaired cognitive development. Medical conditions are more often serious since coinfection with protozoan parasites such as Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica, and with other nematodes is common. Predominantly a tropical disease of developing countries, trichuriasis is quite common in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{clonazepam}} during pregnancy {{is less clear}} than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine <b>growth</b> <b>retardation,</b> functional deficits, floppy infant syndrome, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, cyanosis, suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and <b>growth</b> <b>retardation.</b> This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or breast feeding, {{it is recommended that}} serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.|$|E

40|$|Increase in {{ultraviolet}} (UV) -B radiation {{has been}} identified as a suspect in amphibian deformities and decline. Eggs of two amphibian species, Polypedates cruciger and Duttaphrynus melanostictus were exposed to UV-B radiation (312 nm) to receive erythemal dose (0. 08 relative response) of the action spectra under laboratory conditions. Biologically estimated doses were calculated to match 50 % (high), 25 % (medium) and 10 % (low) of the average daily irradiance given for the Asian region (17. 92 × 10 - 3 Wm- 2). Hatching success of the eggs and survival, growth of tadpoles and development of malformations were recorded until metamorphosis. Although the exposure had no effect on the hatching success of the eggs of the two species, the survival of tadpoles of both species was significantly reduced compared to the tadpoles coming from unexposed eggs in the control. Tadpoles of both species experienced <b>growth</b> <b>retardations</b> due to UV-B exposure. Exposed individuals were smaller at metamorphosis and they took longer to metamorphose. In addition, malformations such as ulcers, edemas, abnormally pigmented skin were common among the exposed tadpoles. Species-specific differences in the growth were observed between D. melanostictus and P. cruciger but not in the other measured parameters. This study shows that the two anuran species are highly sensitive to levels of UV-B radiation that is present in their natural environment and suffered both lethal and sub-lethal effects...|$|R
