500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

[...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 August 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC had commissioned the six-part comedy Heading Out, which was created and written by Perkins. The BBC's Executive editor of Comedy Commissioning, Kristian Smith, called the show [...] "a warm, intelligent and brilliantly funny sitcom." [...] While Perkins stated that Heading Out [...] "might well be the thing that I'm most proud of. It's been a joy to work on, and I hope that joy proves to be infectious." [...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. She knew that she wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so she could come out to them. The comedian revealed that she is a fan of thrillers and wanted to have a ticking clock element to the show, so she thought Sara's coming out would be a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... "As Bob Dylan proved {{early in}} his career, there’s a very fine line between {{outsider}} folk and a comedy record. The shaggy dog, talking blues about post-apocalyptic monkeys and farmers’ daughters from Another Side Of may have sunk {{to the bottom of}} Dylan’s catalog, but their rambunctious goofiness shines on in Jeffrey Lewis, one {{of a new generation of}} New York anti-folksters. On his second full-length for Rough Trade, the 27-year-old cartoonist brings his cracking voice to bear on the pressing issues of the age: rampaging ghouls, towers of turtles and the fact that no, he doesn’t want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any acid, thank you. The wackiness of Cracked is charming, but the real highlights of the record are songs where Lewis turns his wide-eyed language on more personal matters. “I hope that the art school enjoys your big painting of ruin,” he sighs on “Alphabet.” “We’ve all got <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and it’s <b>good</b> when we do them.” Packed with these strangely perfect bons mots and buoyed by a heroically unhip sense of wonder, Lewis’ lyrics are as tight as his guitar playing is weak. But so what if his musicianship has all the finesse of a dorm-floor sing-along? Lewis specializes in a rambling, autobiographical style that reassures and entertains more than it startles or amazes. It’s good, but not great, and Lewis will likely never quite get around to penning his Blowin' in the Wind or My Back Pages. But the stories on Cracked are bright, funny and warm-hearted. Sometimes, that’s more than enough. [...] " [...] - MAGNET ...|$|R

But the issue and conclusion of all was, that he had a preparation which, if they took such a quantity of every morning, he would pawn his life that they should never have the plague, no, though they lived in the house with people that were infected. This made the people all resolve to have it, but then the price of that was so much (I think it was half a crown[65]).

[...] Here the woman began to give him ill words, and stood at his door all that day, telling her tale to all the people that came, till the doctor, finding she turned away his customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again and give her his box of physic for nothing, which perhaps, too, was good for nothing when she had it.|$|R

They also point out that because the lenses for this camera do not have manual focusing rings, the manual focus that the camera does have is rudimentary at best. According to the review, it lags in wake-up time from sleep mode, picture review right after taking a picture is too long and its lack of ports make it uncompatible with other Nikon 1 accessories.|$|R

We didn't care to knock, for all was dark, and we came away. Rectus proposed that we should reconnoitre the place, and I agreed, although, in reality, there wasn't anything to reconnoitre.
