30|$|Mackey {{apparatus}} is {{a rather}} old test protocol that involves a <b>jacketed</b> <b>cylinder</b> 10 [*]cm in diameter and 17.5 [*]cm in height, covered {{on the top and}} equipped with a thermometer (Khattab et al. 1999). It was originally developed for testing the selfheating and ignition of oils utilised in the wood industry (Bowes 1984). Two tubes are connected to this apparatus, one extending down into the cylinder and the other upward from the cover. A cotton sample soaked with oil is placed in a wire gauze cylinder and held concentrically in the apparatus. The procedure involves boiling of the water in the bath, inserting the sample into the apparatus and recording the thermometer readings (Thompson 1928). The oil is categorised as safe if the temperature does not exceed 100 °C in 1 [*]h or 200 °C in 2 [*]h.|$|E

[...] Each magneto fired all eight cylinders for that bank, driven by bevel gear from the vertical shaft that also drove the bank's single overhead camshaft.

The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.|$|R

40|$|It is {{beneficial}} to utilize geopolymers for their potential properties to rehabilitate concrete structures. These properties include high adhesion to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete even at low degrees of interfacial roughness, high durability and good fire resistance. This paper introduces {{use of a}} ferro-geopolymer jacket to strengthen concrete columns. It {{is a kind of}} jacket constructed with a geopolymer mortar reinforced with a wire mesh. This study was conducted to investigate the behavior of concrete cylinders confined with a ferro-geopolymer jacket in axial compression. OPC concrete cylinders with 100 mm diameter and 200 mm height were fabricated. High calcium fly ash-based geopolymer mortar, activated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3), cured at a temperature of 25 ºC was used. Ferro-geopolymer jackets with a 25 mm thickness, were reinforced with 1, 2 and 3 layers of expanded metal mesh and cast around concrete cylinders. The study results revealed that the compressive load carrying capacity and axial stiffness of concrete cylinders were improved. A monolithic failure mode was obtained {{as a result of a}} strong adhesion between the geopolymer and the concrete core. Enhancement of compressive load carrying capacity of the <b>jacketed</b> concrete <b>cylinders</b> was caused by a combination of a confinement effect and the compressive load resistance of the jacket transferred from concrete core through bonding...|$|R
40|$|To {{successfully}} use the fiber-reinforced-polymer (FRP) {{overlay technique}} for the seismic retrofit and the blast- hardening of RC columns, the mechanical {{behavior of the}} FRP-confined concrete needs to be understood and its response needs to be accurately predicted. Although {{a number of studies}} have been conducted to-date, it is still not clear how the main parameters affect the axial stress- strain response of a FRP-confined concrete cylinder. In particular, while it is understood that FRP jackets inhibit dilatancy, current models do not capture the physics that leads to ascending or strain-softening responses vs. the level of lateral confinement. In this dissertation, a dilatancy-based analytical model for FRP- <b>jacketed</b> circular concrete <b>cylinders</b> in axial compression was developed. The proposed theory is applicable to both the heavily confined case with ascending axial loaded vs. axial strain response, and the lightly confined specimen with strain-softening behavior. As an extension of the circular model, a new model for rectangular FRP-confined sections was then developed. In addition to jacket membrane strain, the jacket flexural strains caused by the cross-sectional shape were taken into account, and the rupture strain of the FRP jacket in the corner zone was predicted. The present model was validated via a large set of existing test results, and excellent agreement with experimental data was observed. As the application of the proposed concrete model, a load-displacement model and an associated computational algorithm were developed and validated for the response and failure conditions of RC columns subject to combined axial and seismic-type (lateral) loads. On the other hand, excluding the strain rate effects on material parameters from modeling, an analytical procedure was also developed to predict the resistance function of FRP-jacketed RC columns subject to combined axial and uniform lateral (simulated blast) loads. The model was validated via the results of the UCSD quasi-static tests on "blast columns", and satisfactory correlation with the experimental load-displacement curves were observed. The present models and the analytical procedures proposed in this dissertation can serve as design/analysis tools for the FRP overlay technique as applied to the seismic retrofit as well as the blast- hardening of RC column...|$|R
