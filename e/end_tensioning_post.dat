40|$|In {{this paper}} {{various aspects of}} the effect of {{eccentricity}} in overturning restraint devices used in light-framed wood shear walls is discussed. To accurately assess the demand on the <b>tension</b> <b>end</b> <b>post,</b> nonlinear finite element modeling is used to investigate the effect that sheathing/nailing can have on the boundary posts in shear walls. Results are presented at both the allowable stress design level and at the strength limit state, and these results are compared against a bare post analysis. Additionally, both one and two story conditions are analyzed. The results show that the sheathing/nailing can significantly reduce the internal post stresses, and this reduction is proportional to post stiffness and nail spacing. Finally, {{various aspects of the}} In-Grade testing program used to determine wood resistance values in the United States are discussed because of the impact they have on the actual distribution of strength in a given grade of lumber...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> cables on {{strengthening}} steel frames and improving their load carrying capacity, giving more resistance against the external load (dead plus live or wind load). Different types of frames are analyzed: simple frame, double bay frame and double story frame. The analysis and the results are obtained using ANSYS finite element (FE) program. Different techniques were used to apply <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> to steel frame. Comparisons are made between these techniques to determine which technique is better in strengthening each type of frame.

50|$|This {{technology}} {{was used to}} create residential and public buildings in Hungary since the early 1970s. The idea behind IMS was constructing premade floor slabs and columns, connecting them afterwards. The gaps between elements were filled with a sealant called PU paste. This filling material however, was known to cause chloride corrosion over time, damaging the beams and in Yugoslavia, they used an inhibitor material and also separated the paste from the <b>tensioned</b> <b>posts</b> with a 1mm thin plastic sheet but in Hungary, they skipped these despite {{only a very small}} amount of inhibitor would've been necessary. Because of this, the building became unstable, and the inhabitants had to move out by the year 1989.|$|R

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} bridge deck panels {{have been used}} for decades to accelerate bridge construction. Cracking of the transverse connection between panels is a common problem that can damage deck overlays and cause connection leaking leading to corrosion of lower bridge elements. To better understand the behavior of bridge deck transverse female-to-female connections, shear and moment lab testing were performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation. Two existing UDOT connections were tested, a welded stud connection and a <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> connection. A variation of the welded connection using rebar was also tested. In addition, two new curved bolt connections were tested as a new method of <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> a connection. The manner of connection cracking and associated cracking loads were recorded along with the ultimate connection capacities. The connections were also tested in a low cycle, high amplitude cyclical shear test. Lab testing showed that the welded stud connection had the lowest moment capacity.

40|$|In recent years, the {{important}} of the maintenance, rehabilitation, and strengthening of reinforced concrete bridges has increased due to various factors including increase in traffic volume and weight, structural aging {{and exposure to}} adverse environmental conditions. External <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> is a suitable technique for rehabilitation or strengthening of concrete bridges. While external <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> have been effectively used for the flexural strengthening of existing bridges, recent experimental investigations {{have shown that the}} efficiency of the shear strengthening using external <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> is significantly reduced by the existing shear cracks. The effect of the existing shear cracks is a complex function depending on a number of parameters including width of the cracks, crack inclination, shear reinforcement ratio and concrete strength. In order to analytically investigate the effect of such shear cracks in externally post-tensioned bridge members, numerical analysis was carried out using ABAQUS software. This paper focuses on a simply supported reinforced concrete girder strengthened by external tendons with existing shear cracks. The accuracy of this type of analytical modelling is verified by comparing with the experimental results conducted on similar reinforced concrete girders...|$|R
