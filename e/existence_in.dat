5|$|Some {{legends of}} the Kami and Cahuilla tribes {{probably}} refer to Lake Cahuilla.

5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched {{nucleic acid}} structure that contains four double-stranded arms joined together.

5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into <b>existence.</b> <b>In</b> this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's <b>existence,</b> <b>in</b> towns and occasionally in the countryside.

5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its <b>existence.</b> <b>In</b> the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did.

Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E

In 1906 Piłsudski, with the connivance of Austrian authorities, founded a military school in Kraków for the training of paramilitary units. In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, while the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.|$|E

5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and <b>existence</b> <b>in</b> the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
