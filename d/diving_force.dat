These rafts are constituted of catching wave boards and valves to promote diving depth by means of enfeebling water resistance when the raft begin to dive. We repeated the experiments to find the relation among buoyancy degree of raft dimension and angle of boards and raft stability. As the result, we made the better raft as shown Fig. 8. 1. And three connected rafts (type II in Fig. 9. 2) was made by making use of reforming in detail on the basis of Fig. 8. 1 type. This type II show better diving depth, therefore it seems easily to apply to sea wave behavior if we try experiments by adopting of law of hydraulic similarity. We proposed equation (4) as theory of relation of wave pressure P・to <b>diving</b> <b>force</b> Ps and a relational diagram (Fig. 2) of diving depth (h) to broken wave height(HT) This diagram shows that there is a high effect to promote broken wave in case of the raft length (1) is longer than wave length (L) and the perimeter K/h is constant. However for application of this diagram, it must needs put in more detail experiments. Experimental data about relation between generated wave to diving depth Lnd second wave are few because of taking many hours for reforming of diving arrangement. (Received July 1, 1974...|$|E
40|$|Condemning {{the hostile}} {{attitude}} of modern poets towards both the manifestations {{and the very}} idea of civilizational progress, Eliza Orzeszkowa, in her extensive article "Listy o literaturze. Wiek XIX i tegocześni poeci" written in 1873, and then Piotr Chmielowski in his "Zarys literatury polskiej ostatnich lat szesnastu", illustrated their arguments with a number of poems, including the sonnet "Dział pieśni" by Leohnard Sowiński. R. Okulicz-Kozaryn starts with reminding his readers that the controversies over the right of poets to put themselves over society, formulate opinions and judgments of civilization and their attempts to promote such values as scientism or utilitarianism, had had a long tradition at the time. By embarking on it, however, Orzeszkowa and Chmielowski appealed to practices of a particular kind, namely to disregard completely the message of a poem and to focus on exploiting it only to support their own arguments. The author of the article analyses the mechanism behind this manipulation and claims that Orzeszkowa, followed by Chmielowski, had even removed some words from the poem that could have been interpreted by the then reader as a sign of affiliation to the national community, and as an expression of democratic and solidaristic beliefs. They also ignored the fact that Sowiński had sacrificed part of his life for these values being sentenced to exile and the following social degradation for his participation in the freedom movement {{at the turn of the}} 1850 s and 1860 s. In the heat of the ideological struggle, Orzeszkowa and Chmielowski did not argue for their own belief and did not even enter into polemics with the most important message in the poem. The truth is that L. Sowiński did not question the civilizational march forward of the mankind but rather showed that, contrary to what the positivists claimed, utilitarianism was just an appetite for enjoying the achievements of progress and maximizing pleasure and was not its <b>diving</b> <b>force,</b> being more like a parasitic residue and a baggage.

40|$|Autodyne lidar with CO 2 -laser {{is a good}} {{system for}} remote {{measurements}} of environmental gases 1 {{as a number of}} them have absorption bands in spectral region 9 - 11 km. In this report we present an analytical approach for calculation of the parameters of a parametric autodyne lidar for environmental DIAL applications. This approach allows one to express analytically the parameters of the atmosphere, such as the absorption coefficient and the distance to remote target, through experimentally measured values. A model of parametric autodyne lidar based on two level laser scheme has been considered. The aim is to derive analytical dependencies of lidar field on parameters of the atmosphere. Two nonlinear differential equations for laser field amplitude at resonator mirrors are derived. Using reflectivity of the remote mirror as a small parameter (it can reach 10 i 9 in field experiments) a perturbation theory has been built, which allows one to reduce nonlinear lidar equations to a couple of linear differential equations with <b>diving</b> <b>force.</b> These equations have been solved both analytically, using proper approximations, and numerically. From the analytical solution two important expressions for the absorption coefficient and the distance to the target have been derived. Two types of lidar mirror modulation mostly used in experiments have been considered, harmonic-like oscillation and a saw-tooth-like oscillation. Comparison of the two mirror modulation schemes leads one to conclusion that the harmonic modulation has two apparent disadvantages. The first one is that in this case one has to deal with specific and short time intervals when the mirror passes its equilibrium point in order to filter out the maximal beating frequency, whereas the saw-tooth modulation results in a fixed beating frequency and then {{there is no need to}} deal with a wide signal spectrum. The second (probably minor) disadvantage is that the maximal beating frequency in case of harmonic-like modulation is higher than the constant beating frequency in case of saw-tooth-like modulation (provided both amplitude and frequency of mirror oscillations are identical in both cases). This difference however may become important when very large distances should be measured. For instance, assume the distance is about 300 km and the mirror oscillation amplitude and frequency are 11 m and 1 kHz respectively. Then the maximal beating frequency in case of harmonic modulation is about 600 MHz, while in case of saw-tooth modulation the beating frequency is about 350 MHz...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop and {{demonstrate}} fundamental strategies for improving the efficiency of photovoltaic devices that are commonly used for solar-energy capture and conversion, we introduced and studied anthranilamides as bioinspired electrets. Charge transfer processes {{play a key role}} in chemical and biological systems. Photoinduced charge transfer represents the central paradigm of light-energy conversion of photosynthesis and photovoltaic devices. The Rehm-Weller equation allows for estimating the <b>diving</b> <b>force</b> of photoinduced charge transfer by employing readily measureable quantities such as the redox potentials and spectroscopic data of electron donors and acceptors. A significant part of my studies focused on the Born solvation term in the Rehm-Weller equation that introduces the electrostatic stabilization of the charge-transfer species by the surrounding media. Cyclic voltammetry, allowed me to demonstrate experimentally the effects of the supporting electrolyte on the redox potentials. These effects were especially pronounced for non-polar solvents. Most importantly, I devised an approach to address the discrepancies that the presence of electrolyte introduces to the charge-transfer analysis. Concurrently, my studies demonstrated that the Generalized Born model allows for addressing the deficiencies in the charge-transfer analysis involving redox species that are not spherical and that have heterogeneous charge distribution. The other significant part of my studies focused on anthranilamides as bioinspired electrets that have the potential to accelerate charge separation and suppress the undesired charge recombination. My research provided the first experimental demonstration that the anthranilamides possess intrinsic dipoles. These amides with large intrinsic dipole moments (that is, electrets) can generate electric field, which enhances electron transfer from their N- to their C-termini and impedes it in the backward direction. To test the ability of the electrets to modify the direction of electron transfer, I incorporated an anthranilamide monomer in electron donor-acceptor (DA) dyads. Comparison between the charge-transfer kinetics of electret-acceptor dyads, revealed a faster initial photoinduced charge separation and a slower charge recombination when electron was transferred toward C-terminus. These findings were consistent with the orientation of the intrinsic dipole moment of the anthranilamide monomer. Aside from previous work employing polypeptides, this is the first demonstration of rectification of charge transfer by dipole moments of synthetic bioinspired derivatives. In summary, the most important contributions from my doctoral work were: (1) developing methods for reliable interpretation of experimental results pertinent to charge-transfer kinetics and thermodynamics; (2) demonstrating rectification of photoinduced charge transfer induced by the anthranilamide intrinsic dipole; and (3) demonstrating that the photoinduced processes result in charges residing on the anthranilamides (i. e., radical ions) which is essential for attaining hopping mechanism for long-range charge transfer...|$|E
