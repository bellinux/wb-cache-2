This paper presents the parametric analysis conducted to derive the optimal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the steel <b>sleeve</b> necessary to secure the bond performance of the swaging type anchorage for CFRP tendon with diameter of 5 mm. To that goal, fi-nite element analysis is performed on the parameters determining the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve</b> like the thickness and inner diameters <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve.</b> The results show that a constant swaging pressure of about 450 MPa on the mean is dis-tributed in the sleeve when the thickness ratio of the stress relief zone to the effective swaging zone <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve</b> is lar-ger than 1. 1 and that the swaging pressure tends to reduce linearly as much as this thickness ratio becomes smaller than 1. 1. The pressure varies within a range of about 30 % according to {{the change in the}} inner diameter <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve</b> whereas varies within a range less than 10 % according to the change in the inner diameter when the thickness ratio is larger than 1. 1. Finally, the optimal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the steel tube sleeve enabling to secure an anchor force larger than the rupture strength of the CFRP tendon with diameter of 5 mm are determined based upon the results of the parametric analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Compared to the bond-type anchor, the {{compression-type}} anchor, whichanchors the CFRP tendon {{by applying}} a compressive force on its surface, presents {{the advantages of}} not needing a curing period for the filler and to reduce the sleeve length by more than 30 %. The fabrication of the compression-type anchor proceeds by changing the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the steel <b>sleeve</b> by hydraulic pressure, {{which means that the}} anchoring performance varies according to the region subjected to the compressive force at the surface of the CFRP tendon. Since the fabrication of the compression-type anchor is generally done uni-directionally, there is naturally some difference in the performance at the loaded end and free end. Accordingly, it is necessary to design the stress softening region to secure uniform anchoring performance at both ends. This study performs finite element analysis on 7 different shapes <b>of</b> <b>sleeves</b> with two types of taper based upon the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>sleeves.</b> From the analysis results, the design of the stress softening region of the free end is not possible by adjusting only the stress softening region but needs also to adjust the inner diameter <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve</b> so as to obtain similar stress softening regions in both loaded and free ends. For the sleeve with two tapers, similar stress softening regions could be achieved after compression by securing a stress softening region longer than 30 mm at the free end. This disposition was also seen to secure longer iso-stres...|$|R

The proposed antenna {{consists of a}} square radiating patch {{with a pair of}} T-shaped slots and a ground plane with a pair <b>of</b> rectangular <b>sleeve</b> and a T-shaped resonator which provides a wide usable fractional bandwidth of more than 125 % (3. 05 – 13. 57 GHz). By optimizing <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> rectangular <b>sleeves,</b> T-shaped slots and resonator, the total bandwidth of the antenna is greatly improved. The designed antenna has a small size of 14 × 22 mm 2. Good return loss and radiation pattern characteristics are obtained in the frequency band of interest.

In the constructional base the front and back in the underarm there are parts which have to be set to the both - the bodice and the sleeve. For the front and the back that is possible if the sleeve and a part of the bodice are separated by a design constructional seam. The type and design <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve</b> depends by the directions of the design constructional seam. If the seam joins the underarm and the neckline, or area around the neckline the type <b>of</b> <b>sleeve</b> is raglan. If the seam connects the underarm and the shoulder the type <b>of</b> <b>sleeve</b> is semi raglan. The type <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve</b> is kimono if the design constructional seam divides the bodice or the sleeve. In the dropped shoulder sleeve design constructional seam is located under the shoulder. The use of the main design principles, the possibilities for combinations between the four types <b>of</b> <b>sleeves</b> and the design with application of 3 D elements are investigated.

40|$|Abstract. Cast {{iron and}} steel {{conveying}} rollers used in hot rolling mills must be changed very frequently because conveyed strips with high temperature induces wear on the roller surface in short periods. This failure automatically stops the production line for repair and maintenance of conveying rollers. In this study {{a new type of}} roller is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with two short shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, a ceramics sleeve provides longer life and therefore reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, for the hollow ceramics rollers, care should be taken for maximum tensile stresses appearing at both edges <b>of</b> the <b>sleeve.</b> In particular, because fracture toughness is extremely smaller compared with the value of steel, stress analysis for the roller is necessary for ceramics sleeve. In this study FEM analysis is applied to the structure, and the maximum stress has been investigated with varying the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the structure. It is found that the maximum tensile stress appearing at the end <b>of</b> <b>sleeves</b> takes a minimum value at a certain amount of shrink fitting ratio...|$|R
