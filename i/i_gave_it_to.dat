"Smile" [...] {{received}} its own answer song when rapper Example recorded a track called [...] "Vile" [...] in 2006, from We Didn't Invent the Remix, with tongue-in-cheek lyrics written from the boyfriend's perspective. While it also features elements from Keith Allen's single [...] "Vindaloo", Example added [...] "I think Lily {{has heard the}} track. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her producer to play to her.

[...] Upon hearing the reply single, Chris Moyles, from BBC Radio 1, recorded his own parody version of the song for The Chris Moyles Show.|$|E
500|$|Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases {{composed}} of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. with the dog, for my friend, to school, in England. Prepositions have {{a wide range of}} uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example, in the phrase <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, [...] "with her", [...] "to me", [...] "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of [...] no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.|$|E

The song was recorded and mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was released for digital download on February 1, 2011, {{and was sent}} to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on February 8. In an interview with Vibe magazine, Diplo revealed {{that when he was}} first asked to put the song together, he thought that [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was not for an official release, saying: [...] "I knew that I was working on something for a Chris Brown record, but I thought it was for a mixtape... When I did the beat, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> one of his writers. Then Busta Rhymes got on it and I was like, 'Okay, {{this is going to be}} a club record.' And then when Wayne got on it 'Look at Me Now' became a radio record. It just took off from there." ...|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up because I thought it was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Ortiz began boxing at the insistence of his father, an alcoholic who often beat his children following his wife's departure. In an interview, Victor said, [...] "I hated that lady. I drew her a card once with a little rose on it and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her.

[...] Another example came from when Leno asked, [...] "Ever order anything off the TV?" [...] Kimmel replied, [...] "Like when NBC ordered your show off the TV?" ...|$|E

However, once he had the copy of the tape, ABC News released video, still pictures, and even transcripts of my interviews to news organizations throughout the world. Protected by its formidable legal and public relations department, ABC News made still photographs from the video, slapped the “ABC News Exclusive” logo on them, and hand delivered them to newspapers, wire services, and television...All of these pictures demanded that photo credit be given to ABC News... The story won a British Press Award for “Scoop of the Year” for a British paper I didn’t even know had published it...I even won a Peabody Award as a “correspondent for Nightline."
