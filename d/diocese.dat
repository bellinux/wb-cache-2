5|$|The partly built nave was {{demolished}} and {{the remaining}} {{eastern part of the}} church closed until it reopened as a cathedral under the secular clergy. In an edict dated June 1542, Henry VIII and Thomas Cranmer raised the building to rank of Cathedral of a new <b>Diocese</b> of Bristol. The new <b>diocese</b> was created from parts of the <b>Diocese</b> of Gloucester and the <b>Diocese</b> of Bath and Wells; Bristol had been, before the Reformation, and the erection of Gloucester <b>diocese,</b> part of the <b>Diocese</b> of Worcester. Paul Bush, (died 1558) a former royal household chaplain, was created the first Bishop of Bristol. The new cathedral was dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop.

5|$|In November 2006, 15 {{conservative}} Episcopal churches {{voted to}} split from the <b>Diocese</b> of Virginia over {{the ordination of}} openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States.

5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun for Richard, though the Roman Catholic <b>Diocese</b> of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991.

The bishop of the Lafayette <b>diocese</b> {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and referred to her as a saint.
