5|$|Helium–cadmium lasers are {{a common}} source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422nm in {{fluorescence}} microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
25|$|A total {{internal}} reflection <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> {{is a type of}} microscope with which a thin region of a specimen, usually less than 200nm, can be observed. It {{can also be used to}} observe the fluorescence of a single molecule, making it an important tool of biophysics and quantitative biology. Daniel Axelrod invented the first total {{internal reflection}} <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> in 1981.|$|E
25|$|BiFC {{does not}} require {{specialised}} equipment, as visualisation is possible with an inverted <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> that can detect fluorescence in cells. In addition, analysis {{does not require}} complex data processing or correction for other sources of fluorescence.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirement}} for an enhanced {{signal to noise}} ratio to maximize localization precision determines the frequent combination of this concept with widefield fluorescent microscopes allowing optical sectioning, such as total internal reflection <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes</b> (TIRF) and light sheet <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Lanthanides, {{including}} neodymium {{are famous}} for their bright luminescence and therefore are widely used as fluorescent labels. In particular, NdCl3 has been incorporated into organic molecules, such as DNA, which could be then easily traced using a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> during various physical and chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|Multicolor FISH and {{the older}} {{spectral}} karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are {{a limited number of}} spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope.</b> In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.|$|E
25|$|For diagnosis, the {{erythrocytes}} can {{be isolated}} by injecting {{them into a}} tissue culture and {{checking to see if}} they are infected. Also, the antigen for Colorado tick fever virus can be identified using the immunofluorescence microscopy. In this method, the antigens {{on the surface of the}} erythrocytes are marked with fluorescence and examined under a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of FIB {{secondary electron imaging}} {{is the fact that}} the ion beam does not alter the signal from fluorescent probes used in the labelling of proteins, thus creating the opportunity to correlate FIB secondary electron images with images obtained by <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Simulated Fluorescence Process (SFP) is a {{computing}} algorithm {{used for}} scientific visualization of 3D data from, for example, <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes.</b> By modeling a physical light/matter interaction process an image is computed showing the data {{as it would}} have appeared in reality when viewed under these conditions.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{simultaneously}} manipulate and image samples that exhibit fluorescence, optical tweezers {{can be built}} alongside a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope.</b> Such instruments are particularly useful {{when it comes to}} studying single or small numbers of biological molecules that have been fluorescently labelled, or in applications in which fluorescence is used to track and visualize objects that are to be trapped.|$|E
25|$|After {{sufficient}} {{time for the}} fusion proteins and their linked fluorescent fragments to interact and fluoresce, the cells can be observed under an inverted <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> that can visualise fluorescence in cells. Although the fluorescence intensity of BiFC complexes is usually <10% of that produced by expression of intact fluorescent proteins, the extremely low autofluorescence in the visible range extremely most cells often makes the BiFC signal orders of magnitude higher than background fluorescence.|$|E

50|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} microscopy: Although {{they use}} a related technology (both are laser scanning <b>microscopes),</b> multiphoton <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes</b> are not strictly confocal microscopes. The term confocal arises from {{the presence of a}} diaphragm in the conjugated focal plane (confocal). This diaphragm is usually absent in multiphoton microscopes.|$|R

25|$|By {{replacing}} the gene {{with a new}} version fused to a green fluorescent protein (or similar) marker, expression may be directly quantified in live cells. This is done by imaging using a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope.</b> It {{is very difficult to}} clone a GFP-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often cannot be used to measure endogenous gene expression. It is, however, widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell, for example via an expression vector. It {{is important to note that}} by fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein's behavior, including its cellular localization and expression level, can be significantly changed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the quantum optical applications, luminescence from the N-V− centers can be applied for imaging biological processes, such as fluid flow in living cells. This application relies on good compatibility of diamond nano-particles with the living cells and on favorable properties of photoluminescence from the N-V− centers (strong intensity, easy excitation and detection, temporal stability, etc.). Compared with large single-crystal diamonds, nanodiamonds are cheap (about 1 USD per gram) and available from various suppliers. N-V− centers are produced in diamond powders with sub-micrometre particle size using the standard process of irradiation and annealing described above. Those nanodiamonds are introduced in a cell, and their luminescence is monitored using a standard <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several chromosome-banding {{techniques}} {{are used in}} cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> {{and is no longer}} as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is particularly helpful for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NORstains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive heterochromatin, which usually lies near the centromere, and NORstaining highlights the satellites and stalks of acrocentric chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|To {{block the}} {{excitation}} light {{from reaching the}} observer or the detector, filter sets of high quality are needed. These typically consist of an excitation filter selecting the range of excitation wavelengths, a dichroic mirror, and an emission filter blocking the excitation light. Most <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes</b> are operated in the Epi-illumination mode (illumination and detection {{from one side of}} the sample) to further decrease the amount of excitation light entering the detector.|$|R

2500|$|Bimolecular {{fluorescence}} complementation (also {{known as}} BiFC) is a technology typically used to validate protein interactions. [...] It {{is based on}} the association of fluorescent protein fragments that are attached to components of the same macromolecular complex. [...] Proteins that are postulated to interact are fused to unfolded complementary fragments of a fluorescent reporter protein and expressed in live cells. [...] Interaction of these proteins will bring the fluorescent fragments within proximity, allowing the reporter protein to reform in its native three-dimensional structure and emit its fluorescent signal. This fluorescent signal can be detected and located within the cell using an inverted <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscope</b> that allows imaging of fluorescence in cells. In addition, the intensity of the fluorescence emitted is proportional to the strength of the interaction, with stronger levels of fluorescence indicating close or direct interactions and lower fluorescence levels suggesting interaction within a complex. Therefore, through the visualisation and analysis of the intensity and distribution of fluorescence in these cells, one can identify both the location and interaction partners of proteins of interest.|$|E

40|$|Light-sheet-based {{fluorescence}} microscopy (LSFM) is a fluorescence technique that combines optical sectioning, the key capability of confocal and two-photon <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes</b> with multiple-view imaging, {{which is used}} in optical tomography. In contrast to conventional wide-field and confocal <b>fluorescence</b> <b>microscopes,</b> a light sheet illuminates only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the detection process. Compared to confocal {{fluorescence microscopy}}, LSFM reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by up to three orders of magnitude. In LSFM, the specimen is embedded in a transparent block of hydrogel and positioned relative to the stationary light sheet using precise motorized translation and rotation stages. This feature is used to image any plane in a specimen. Additionally, multiple views obtained along different angles can be combined into a single data set with an improved resolution. LSFMs are very well suited for imaging large live specimens {{over long periods of}} time. However, they also perform well with very small specimens such as single yeast cells. This perspective introduces the principles of LSFM, explains the challenges of specimen preparation, and introduces the basics of a microscopy that takes advantage of multiple views...|$|R
