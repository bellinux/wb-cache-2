5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model}} for natural Holliday junctions.

5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} {{are a key}} intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a symmetrical sequence and are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> pattern that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E

Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant.

All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E
