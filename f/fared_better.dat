5|$|Dirty Duck {{received}} mostly negative reviews, {{with many}} criticizing it for its crude humor and others seeing {{the film as}} an attempt {{to cash in on the}} success of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The film <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> on home video and is now considered a cult film.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds. Some portfolio managers have expressed skepticism about the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 as an indication of its potential success.|$|E
5|$|WWE Studios, a {{division}} of WWE which produces and finances motion pictures, produced Cena's first movie – The Marine, which was distributed theatrically by 20th Century Fox America beginning on October 13, 2006. In its first week, the film made approximately US$7million at the United States box office. After ten weeks in theaters, the film grossed $18.7million. Once the film was released on DVD, it <b>fared</b> <b>better,</b> making $30million in rentals in the first twelve weeks.|$|E
5|$|Announcing {{that this}} would be his final season before retirement, Shearer's form in the 2004–05 season was patchy; {{alongside}} new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only sevengoals in his 28games as the club finished the season in 14th place. The club <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> in the cup competitions, however, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick in the first round win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.|$|E

5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> if left alone, the Christian Science message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard. Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> than they possibly expected to.|$|E
5|$|In the cup competitions, Rovers were {{knocked out}} of the League Cup at the first round stage in a penalty shootout, having drawn 1–1 with Championship side Luton Town after extra time. They <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> in the FA Cup however, {{reaching}} the fourth round stage where they lost again to a Championship team; this time Derby County. The most successful cup competition for Rovers was the Football League Trophy, in which they reached the final {{for the first time}} since the 1989–90 competition. They were beaten by Doncaster Rovers after extra time at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E

5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E
5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees <b>fared</b> <b>better,</b> due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison. Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{opened the}} regular season on April18 with a four-game series on the road versus the Louisville Colonels, and Stivetts started games two and four. In game two, he {{recorded}} 13strikeouts, but lost the game 5–3 on a tenth-inning, two run double by Tim Shinnick. In game four on April21, Stivetts was again credited with the loss by allowing 17runs to score, seven of which were earned. He <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> in his third start however, allowing just one run as the Browns defeated the Solons by a 14–1score. He struck out 12batters, including the first seven he faced, and hit the first home run of his career.|$|E
5|$|The Smokers {{began their}} innings {{late on the}} first day. By that stage, the pitch had {{deteriorated}} and light was poor, making batting more difficult. By {{the end of the}} day's play forty minutes later, they had lost four wickets and only scored 25 runs. They <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> the following morning, but only three batsmen reached double figures—Billy Gunn, 18, Monty Bowden, 29, and Charles Clarke, 20 not out—as they were bowled out for 111 just before the lunch break. W. G. Grace was the pick of the bowlers, taking five wickets for 29 runs. A first-innings deficit of 139 runs meant that the Smokers were forced to follow on.|$|E
5|$|The better-armoured German battlecruisers <b>fared</b> <b>better,</b> in {{part due}} to the poor {{performance}} of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour). —the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland—had only 128 killed, for instance, despite receiving more than thirty hits. The other German battlecruisers, , Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and , were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, Seydlitz barely making it home, for they had been the focus of British fire for much of the battle.|$|E

5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall <b>fared</b> <b>better,</b> with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched {{at both ends of}} the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|E
5|$|The town walls {{became less}} {{important}} for defence in the 17th century, although in 1633, a footpath was {{built around the}} inside of the wall to help the watch and other law officers better pursue vagrants and criminals. The walls <b>fared</b> <b>better</b> than Southampton Castle, which was sold off to property speculators in 1618, but they played no part in the English Civil War. Some of the masonry from the castle was reused to strengthen the town walls in 1650 during the Third English Civil War.|$|E

An accompanying music video was directed by Nozomi Tanaka, which featured Chisuga in a large aquarium surrounded by bright lights.
