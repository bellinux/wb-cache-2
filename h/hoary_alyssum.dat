50|$|Berteroa incana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Its common names include <b>hoary</b> <b>alyssum,</b> false hoary madwort, hoary berteroa, and hoary alison. It is native to Eurasia {{and it has been}} introduced to western Europe and North America. It is listed as an invasive noxious weed in some areas of United States.|$|E
40|$|The {{allelopathic}} {{effects of}} leaves at rosette {{stage of the}} <b>hoary</b> <b>alyssum</b> (Berteroa incana L.) against some associated grasses like, prairie June grass (Koeleria macrantha), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), blue-bunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) and its own were investigated. The experiment al materials used were the leaf extracts and its allelopathic effects on seed germination and seedling emergence of the abave mentioned grasses in Petri dishes. According to our study, leaves of <b>hoary</b> <b>alyssum</b> rosettes at stage {{have the potential to}} reduce germination rate, root and shoot growth of pasture grasses and <b>hoary</b> <b>alyssum</b> itself due to its allelopathic effect. The leaf leachate solution bioassays also showed that the germination of cheat grass was more susceptible to 4 % solution of allelopathic extract of leaves. <b>Hoary</b> <b>alyssum</b> leaf extract also exhibited allelopathic self-inhibition, in both seedling root and shoot growth at 2 and 4 % concentrations. Self- inhibitory allelopathic effects of <b>hoary</b> <b>alyssum</b> could also be important in preventing seed germination and seedling establishment of neighboring plant...|$|E
40|$|This {{greenhouse}} experiment {{evaluated the}} response of <b>hoary</b> <b>alyssum</b> plants, up to the rosette phase, to different levels of UV-B radiation. The experiment {{was carried out in}} the chambers, equipped with UV-B lamps, emitting biologically effective UV-B radiation of 0 (control), 4, 6 or 8 kJ. As a result, specific traits of the plants such as: leaf number, lamina length, leaf area, specific leaf weight, relative chlorophyll content and shoot biomass were unaffected by any of the UV-B treatments. Significant reductions in the share of large leaves, leaf stalk length and root biomass were noted for plants growing under 8 kJ UV-B BE...|$|E
