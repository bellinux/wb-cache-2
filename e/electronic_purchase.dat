40|$|Although E-Commerce has {{marketability}} {{as well as}} usefulness, {{there are}} few empirical research on consumer acceptance, explained by economic theory. This paper suggests that the consumer product acceptance {{is determined by the}} difference of transaction cost and some other factors, such as uncertainty and asset specificity. In addition, it suggests that the characteristics of digital products may also {{play an important role in}} electronic markets. We find that (1) consumers prefer <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> in buying digital products and (2) transaction costs, uncertainty, and asset specificity have a significant effect on consumer product acceptance. Especially, there is a positive correlation between asset specificity and consumer acceptance in digital products that would be strategic items, paid attention in E-Commerce.

Such collaborations represent enactments of inter-organizational business processes and may be supported through the exchange of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) messages (e. g., <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> orders, invoices etc.). For gaining insights on such processes, recently two distinct approaches for enabling the application of process mining techniques on inter-organizational business processes based on the interchanged EDI messages have been proposed: (i) Message Flow Mining (MFM) and (ii) Physical Activity Mining (PAM). In this paper, we present {{a case study in}} which we apply the PAM methodology on a real-world EDI data set obtained from a German manufacturer of consumer goods.

40|$|Complex {{purchase}} protocols allow several participants (merchants and clients) to {{be involved}} within a single purchase transaction. Moreover, they provide the possibility to merge different heterogeneous payments into one atomic transaction. Although such complex purchases are urgently required, they are, so far, neither provided by existing protocols nor by available products or research prototypes. In this paper we show how to dynamically build such complex heterogeneous purchase processes in a reliable way, by modeling complex interactions between several merchants and clients as transactional processes. Apart from the distribution aspect, {{we focus on the}} heterogeneity of the <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase,</b> by allowing different existing protocols for payment or goods transfer to be merged incrementally, as the user performs a distributed purchase on the Internet.

40|$|The use of {{technological}} applications is directly {{influenced by the}} perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of technology according to the Technology Acceptance Model. In e-commerce applications, the ease or not someone understands how the <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> process works can act positively or as a deterrent, to buy or not. Also, someone is positively influenced by the perceived relative advantage when s/he considers the <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase,</b> and negatively by the complexity perceived on the online purchase process. Certainly, the price and quality are still key factors in making purchases, as in traditional commerce. Evros is an area located in an important geographical area in northeast Greece, in the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey. It is a path for the trade among the three countries. In such a new trade area, {{there are a lot}} of issues to be addressed with regard to the consumer's purchasing behaviour. For residents of border areas, a lot of factors appear to be involved that may affect the user to carry out or not, an e-commerce purchase. The study aims to empirically investigate how factors such as gender, age, educational level, culture, nationality, Internet access, familiarity with technology, price, ease of purchase, risk, trust and security of the website, design of the site, services it offers, past experience and the name and reputation of the e-shop, affect the consumers, residents of this outermost geographical area. The survey was conducted by interviewing 200 people, residents of Evros. The findings are interesting and show that the factors affecting the purchase are gender, level of education and income. Although, the study suffers from a limitation in that it uses a convenience sampling technique without a fully matched profile of the respondents, it could be a basis of a reliable comparison for future research. The major contribution of this study is that it is the first attempt to investigate the impact of the aforementioned factors to the e-commerce in this part of Europe...|$|E

40|$|Research {{as to how}} {{consumer}} trust can be {{built in}} an on-line environment is limited and varies {{in terms of the}} dimensions of the problem that are examined. Consequently, much of our understanding of the antecedents of trust in on-line shopping context remains fragmented. In this study, a previously validated trust measurement instrument was applied in order to investigate the existence and importance of specific factors that are thought to predict the generation of consumer trust in internet shopping in Ireland. The degree to which consumers’ level of technical skill influences their perception of these factors and thus shapes their trust response was also examined. The results provide a refined understanding of the predictors and moderators of trust in an <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> environment and thus make a valuable contribution not only to information systems research but also to the overall body of marketing, trust, and diffusion research.

40|$|E-Commerce is {{expected}} {{to play a major}} role in the 21 st century global market. Of the various E-commerce models (B 2 B, B 2 C, B 2 E and B 2 G), B 2 B has been particularly successful, due to adoption of standardized processes for document exchange (like EDI), shipping, tracking, delivery and payment among supply chain partners. One element of B 2 B is E-procurement. E-procurement focuses on acquisition of resources, especially MRO items, and increasingly materials and components. Some analysts believe that enormous cost savings and increased effectiveness can be achieved through the utilization of E-procurement. E-procurement utilizes <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> procedures implemented through Internet communication and Web based buying tools. Studies in the literature report on the adoption of E-procurement in different countries and industries. This study focuses on the current status of E-procurement in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) located in the Southcoast of Massachusetts. The main objective of this research is to understand the current state of E-procurement in SMEs and to examine those things that influence E-procurement adoption. A questionnaire-based survey was employed for data collection. A conceptual model was developed to describe/explain the adoption of E-procurement and a framework is proposed for the successful adoption of E-procurement on the Southcoast of Massachusetts.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} model checking {{techniques to}} examine NetBill and Digicash. We show how model checking can verify atomicity properties by analyzing simpli ed versions of these protocols that retain crucial security constraints. For our analysis {{we used the}} FDR model checker. 1 Atomicity Properties Correctness is a prime concern for electronic commerce protocols. How can we show that a given protocol is safe for use? Here we show how to use model checking to test whether electronic commerce protocols satisfy some given atomicity properties. For verifying properties of protocols, model checking is a dramatic improvement over doing hand proofs, because it is mechanizable � it is a dramatic improvement over using state-of-the-art theorem provers because it is automatic, fast, and requires no human interaction. Moreover, we found {{a number of problems}} in proposed electronic commerce protocols using model checking. Model checking allows us to focus on just those aspects of the protocol necessary to guarantee desired properties. In doing so, we can {{gain a better understanding of}} why the protocol works and often can identify places of optimizing it. For this paper, we have chosen to check atomicity properties. [2] argue that these properties are central to electronic commerce protocols. In an atomic protocol, an <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> either aborts with no transfer of money and goods � o...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} different maturity stages of eProcurement adoption. eProcurement (i. e. <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> of indirect goods), is a growing reality and it is spreading among companies. However, even inside a growing trend, no and low adopters can still be found, and those already using eProcurement go through many intermediate levels. According to the literature, there can be many factors influencing eProcurement adoption but clear approaches and maturity stages are still not defined. Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes a general framework in which eProcurement maturity is measured by three components: level of adoption, technology and organizational objectives. The framework was applied to 13 case studies of information technology purchases of companies in different sectors; thus, indentifying different approaches that have been clustered in three maturity stages. Findings – First of all, a quite strong relationship is found between eProcurement adoption and technology in place. As far as organizational objectives are concerned, some interesting linkages are found with both the adoption and technological functionalities. These patterns of adoption are grouped into three clusters, named basic, intermediate and advanced. Practical implications – The results of this paper can be useful for practitioners trying to position a company into a maturity model and verify the coherence of the adoption with the technological and organizational choices. Originality/value – The originality of this paper lies in a new framework of analysis of the eProcurement strategies that allows the identification of different maturity stages...|$|E
40|$|E-public {{procurement}} is {{an emerging}} {{feature of the}} EU trading system, with <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> procedures increasingly being implemented through Web based buying tools and public records being held digitally in complex and dynamic systems. The multifaceted and fluid information ecology, which includes the cloud, mobile computing, social media and big data, requires efficient management of the digital assets. Growing e-procurement activity associated with new and evolving business models for storage, access and dissemination has increased the need for effective information governance and assurance. This information and knowledge aspect of the broader procurement architecture makes it imperative to enhance confidence in the soundness of the information governance and assurance processes. Procurement activity, at the multilateral level, is governed by the WTO (World Trade Organization) GPA (Government Procurement Agreement), which is a plurilateral agreement, i. e. applies only to signatories. In its present form, the Agreement contains very limited provisions concerning e-procurement and merely foresees that parties shall consult regularly on developments in this area (WTO 2006). The EU has initiated an e-procurement strategy but the uptake of specific initiatives such as the cloud, has been limited. Main factors influencing EU Member States reluctance to adopt e-procurements are first, apprehension with regard to information governance and assurance aspects; and, second, lack of a clear and coherent legal framework to facilitate e-procurements. This paper evaluates the EU?s recent strategy for e-procurement (European Commission 2012) and explores whether an holistic and cross disciplinary framework can support the broader aims of EU policy (2004, 2011). We propose a theoretical framework which offers a strategic and technology neutral structure for managing procurement related information. This employs common standards and a scalable roadmap, resting on four-pillars of procurement: transparency, accountability, competition, and equity. Within the current EU e-procurement agenda our framework suggests that legal and regulatory convergence, harmonisation of technical standards, and wider market access are the critical success factors for a sustainable e-procurement framework. Our model recognises four main external interdisciplinary drivers: strategic direction; alignment and delivery of business values; performance measurement and indicators; and information governance and assurance. We conclude that an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable public procurement is imperative in addressing {{the complexity of the}} current procurement landscape, and that this is a prerequisite for a fully realised internal common market.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research article is to identify the factors of consumer decisionmaking style {{in the context of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing</b> and test the significance of these factors on the basis of gender and age of respondents through multi-comparison analysis. Data for this report came from a survey of consumers (N = 411) with a structured questionnaire design. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), ANOVA and Post-hoc (for multiple comparisons) were used to achieve the objectives of the study. To contribute to an internationally valid and reliable research instrument for consumer decision-making style in the context of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing,</b> new constructs were identified, which we will call Electronic Consumer Style Inventory (ECSI). Consistent with the hypotheses, in general, the extracted factors in consumers’ electronic buying decision-making style are found to be significant on the basis of respondent gender and age. Customers’ evaluations of e-service quality are critical to service firms that aim to improve their marketing strategies; consequently, accurate measurement of e-service quality is a major concern for management. The resultant implications of this research are discussed by the authors and can help e-vendors and marketing managers achieve a sustainable competitive advantage in global markets and enhance their performance...|$|R
