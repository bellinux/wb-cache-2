5|$|After two years, {{the account}} went viral in 2011. While Capone {{remained}} anonymous, games journalists, such Kotaku and GameSetWatch, began {{to cover his}} tweets and journalists, such as Leigh Alexander (Gamasutra) and Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb), reposted his content. Journalists did not view the parody as a mockery but instead as representative of a growing dissatisfaction over clichéd trends in the mainstream games industry. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> account led to greater respect for Molyneux's temerity. Kotaku wrote that Capone's account displayed uncharacteristic creativity on his part, but Capone countered by saying that most game designers have endless game ideas and that real skill rests in applying them well.|$|E
5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA).

5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders' mentality {{to imitate}} the customs from their Western European homelands meant that {{there were very few}} {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states.

5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass.

Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E
5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
