5|$|Hugh {{obtained}} {{an exemption}} allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> castle at Northallerton in Yorkshire when Henry was ordering {{the destruction of}} most of the illegal castles that had been built during King Stephen's reign. He also built a castle at Norham, designed to help defend the north of England against raids from Scotland.|$|E
5|$|He {{resigned}} {{his post}} in 1932 after being requested {{to step back}} by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy. Muller decided not take his pension, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> title of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary until his death.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford as {{his running}} mate. On one occasion, the Humphrey {{campaign}} asked Sanford {{if he wanted to}} be the vice presidential candidate. Sanford declined, and Humphrey ultimately picked Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine. Though Sanford received a number of legal and business offers from the private sector during this period, he was interested in a position that would allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> political prospects open.|$|E

5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E
5|$|Following Jor-El's coordinates, {{the ship}} crash lands on Earth in Smallville, Kansas. A childless couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent, find Kal-El and raise him as their own, naming him Clark. Clark {{eventually}} becomes an isolated young {{man as a}} result of developing superhuman powers. He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world {{for an extended period of}} time under several disguises.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow, Sam {{and their}} party {{return to the}} Wall after finding two frozen corpses. Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined. Sam points {{out that there is}} no sign of decay on their corpses, even though they have {{apparently}} been dead for weeks. Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> commitment to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is held back by his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} dismiss the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman sent <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Wiedensahl <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|R

5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
5|$|North of the Alps, Army Group G {{followed}} suit on 6 May. Kesselring now decided to surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser {{to supervise the}} SS troops {{to ensure that the}} surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at Saalfelden, near Salzburg, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, the commander of the 101st Airborne Division, who treated him courteously, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at Zeltweg and Graz unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at Berchtesgaden. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created a stir in the United States. Kesselring met with Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Whitney {{returns and}} she helps the Carters repair their new till. Johnny offers her {{the chance of}} moving back into the Vic, which Whitney accepts. Mick also offers her her old job back as a barmaid and Whitney accepts this too. However, Shirley warns Whitney {{to stay away from}} Mick and she tells Shirley that she cannot stop her from being at the Vic. In private, Whitney reveals to Mick that she is engaged to Woody and she shares the news with her family and friends. She asks Mick to give her away and he agrees. Mick struggles with Woody's presence, but agrees to get on with him for Whitney's sake and Whitney admits to Mick {{although}} she can't be with him, she loves him. Linda throws her out after she figures out she's the one Mick kissed and Whitney moves in with Stacey, Stacey's husband and Bianca's relative, Martin Fowler (James Bye) and their kids. Mick takes the rest of her stuff round and offers her Â£200 in lieu of lost wages but she tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> dirty money, annoyed with him revealing all.|$|E

60|$|His French {{was quite}} {{good enough to}} pass in the salon of the marquis, but his ignorance of the Parisian slang spoken among the working-classes would have {{rendered}} it difficult for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up <b>his</b> assumed character among them, and would have needed the fabrication {{of all sorts of}} stories as to his birthplace and past history.|$|R
5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} {{paid attention to the}} fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E
5|$|Having {{retired from}} top-tier football, Loxton soon broke into {{first-class}} cricket. He {{was selected for}} Victoria to make his debut in the match against Queensland in December 1946 because five players, including Miller, were playing in a Test match for Australia against England during their Test tour. The debutant scored 232 not out, sharing a Victorian record sixth-wicket partnership of 289 with Doug Ring, who made 145. When he had scored 183, Loxton hit himself {{on the head with}} his bat in attempting a hook shot, but continued batting until the end of Victoriaâs innings and then opened the bowling in Queenslandâs innings. He took the first wicket before going off to hospital with concussion. Recovering in time to bowl in the second innings, he took 2 wickets for 40 runs (2/40) in an innings win. Loxton's 232 not out remains a record debut score in Australian first-class cricket. His debut performance was enough for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> place when the Test players returned, and he scored 73 and took a total of 3/17 in the next match against arch-rivals New South Wales, which Victoria won by an innings. He compiled 87 in the next match against Queensland, and Victoria won {{all but one of the}} five Sheffield Shield matches in which he playedâthe only draw was washed outâto claim the title. The all-rounder finished the season atop Victoria's batting averages, with 429 runs at a batting average of 143.00. He also headed the bowling averages with 8 wickets at 14.00 runs apiece.|$|E

50|$|A poor knight {{had many}} children. One day, the oldest, Rosald, made a friend named Geirald who persuaded <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come with <b>him</b> on travels; Geirald {{would pay for}} him, if he let the credit for any adventures they had fall <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Rosald agreed. His mother warned <b>him</b> <b>to</b> always <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> promise <b>to</b> Geirald.|$|R
60|$|We {{sat in the}} {{adjacent}} kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer {{out of the same}} bottle. The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for pushing on, and I was urging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up <b>his</b> strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us.|$|R
25|$|On 20 September 2009, Valverde {{clinched}} the overall {{victory in the}} Vuelta a EspaÃ±a. Despite having no stage victories, Valverde's consistency in the mountains allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> race {{all the way to}} end that he captured on stage 9.|$|E

25|$|Following the election, Lieberman {{struck a}} deal with Democratic {{leadership}} allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> seniority and chairmanship of the Governmental Affairs Committee. In return, he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless he asked permission of Majority Whip Richard Durbin. He was free to vote as he pleased on policy matters. Along with Bernie Sanders, Lieberman's caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51â49 majority in the Senate, leaving a slim one Senator majority to control the Senate in the 110th Congress.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{and with}} the {{abolition}} of the monarchy, Guillet expressed a deep desire to leave Italy. He informed Umberto II of his intentions, but the King obliged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> serving <b>his</b> country in whatever form of government it would become. As always, he couldn't disobey an order from his King, so he expressed his desire to teach anthropology at university.|$|R

50|$|The {{theme of}} the story is how ideals {{conflict}} with the demands of society, which Japi resolves by quietly committing suicide {{at the end of the}} book (by stepping from the Nijmegen railway bridge), when it is no longer possible for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pursuing <b>his</b> ideal of doing absolutely nothing.

25|$|The Fellowship leave LothlÃ³rien by {{river to}} Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off, and is confronted by Boromir, {{who tries to}} take the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone. The other members fight off the Uruk-hai, but Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain. After slaying the chieftain, Aragorn watches Boromir die peacefully. Sam follows Frodo, {{accompanying}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> promise to Gandalf to protect Frodo, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry and Pippin.|$|E
25|$|His {{alliance}} with the Franks, crowned by a symbolic adoption of the young Pepin the Short, and with the Avars, on the eastern borders, allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> hand relatively free in the Italian theater, but he soon came to a clash with the Byzantines and with the Papacy. A first attempt {{to take advantage of}} an Arab offensive against Constantinople in 717 achieved few results. To draw closer to the papacy had therefore to wait for the outbreak of tensions caused by the worsening of the Byzantine tax, and the expedition in 724 conducted by the Exarch of Ravenna to destitute the rebel Pope Gregory II.|$|E
25|$|Rumple {{returns home}} to his wife Belle and their newborn baby son. Unfortunately, Isaac is there waiting, and tells him that his happy ending will be taken away if a boy named Henry succeeds in his quest to reverse {{the events of the}} new book.
