25|$|Because {{petroleum}} is {{a naturally}} occurring substance, {{its presence in}} the environment need not {{be the result of}} human causes such as accidents and routine activities (seismic <b>exploration,</b> <b>drilling,</b> extraction, refining and combustion).

Regardless of source, petroleum's effects when released into the environment are similar.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began {{drilling for oil}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support <b>exploration</b> <b>drilling</b> and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented {{a radical departure from}} conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a single-shaft mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain.|$|E

25|$|In September 1999, one of BP's US subsidiaries, BP Exploration Alaska (BPXA), {{pleaded guilty}} to {{criminal}} charges stemming from its illegally dumping of hazardous wastes on the Alaska North Slope, paying fines and penalties totaling $22million. BP paid the maximum $500,000 in criminal fines, $6.5million in civil penalties, and established a $15million environmental management system at all of BP facilities in the US and Gulf of Mexico that are engaged in oil <b>exploration,</b> <b>drilling</b> or production. The charges stemmed from the 1993 to 1995 dumping of hazardous wastes on Endicott Island, Alaska by BP's contractor Doyon Drilling. The firm illegally discharged waste oil, paint thinner and other toxic and hazardous substances by injecting them down the outer rim, or annuli, of the oil wells.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It {{estimated}} a recovery potential of two {{million barrels of}} oil, equivalent {{at the time to}} $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary approval to INOC to proceed with oil <b>exploration</b> <b>drilling</b> in the Golan. INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni. During that time, it was decided that INOC's drilling permits would be returned to the state. In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the Golan. The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded a drilling license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam.|$|E
