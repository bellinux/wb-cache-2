5|$|The Addolorata Society {{was started}} by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> parishioners in 1903 and {{continues}} to be an all-women society. The goal of the group is to find better ways to serve the church. The symbol of the Addolorata Society is the Blessed Mother because she symbolizes love. A member becomes a free life member when she turns eighty, as long as she has a member for at least fifteen years prior to her eightieth birthday. Some of their events include attending funeral Masses and collecting money to purchase altar linens, vestments, and altar lights. The presidents of the society since 1903 in chronological order are as follows: Mrs. Rose Spinelli, Mrs. Michelina Fragale, Mrs. Maria Greco, Mrs. Rose Pascuzzi, Mrs. Santa Bordonaro, Mrs. Anna Bordonaro, Mrs. Sabetta, Mrs. Carmina Chirella, Georgeanne Stearman, and Sandy Laney.|$|E
5|$|Women at Los Alamos were {{encouraged}} to work, due to the shortage of labor and security concerns over bringing in local workers. About 60 wives of scientists were at work in Technical Area by September 1943. About 200 of the 670 workers in the laboratory, hospital and school were women in October 1944. Most worked in administration, but many women such as Lilli Hornig, Jane Hamilton Hall, and Peggy Titterton worked as scientists and technicians. Charlotte Serber headed the A-5 (Library) Group. A large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> worked on numerical calculations in the T-5 (Computations) Group. Dorothy McKibbin ran the Santa Fe office, which opened at 109 East Palace Avenue on 27 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured {{and held in}} a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} the <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> {{who are the}} largest contributors to the cesarean section rate at a maternity facility in South East Queensland, Australia. Examining the characteristics <b>of</b> these <b>women</b> will allow the development of unit-focused initiatives aimed at reducing cesarean sections in these <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> METHOD: A {{modified version of the}} Robson Ten Group Classification System was identified as the most appropriate tool to determine cesarean section rates in different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> A prospective clinical audit was then carried out during a 6 -month period in 2010 using the tool. FINDINGS: The Robson Ten Group Classification System identified that planned repeat cesarean section was the largest contributor to the cesarean rate. This was followed by women having their first baby, women having an induction, and women who have a breech presentation at term. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The Robson classification tool was useful in identifying <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> at risk <b>of</b> a cesarean section. Unit-specific strategies can now be developed and implemented in an effort to lower the rate. These include increasing the vaginal birth after cesarean rate, the uptake of external cephalic version, supporting nonintervention birth environments, and implementing models of care where clinicians are skilled in facilitating normal birth. The value of using such a tool is the ability to monitor change over time as well as facilitating the comparison of data between units of a similar nature. Full Tex...|$|R
5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the previous 12 months (current IPV) on newborn’s health, pregnancy outcomes and couple’s reproductive behaviours were different for postpartum (PP) women as compared to women who had undergone an elective abortion (EA) in Trieste (Italy). This study is part of an unmatched case–control study. The major findings are that current IPV was positively associated with previous stillbirth among both <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> but the association was only marginally significant. Among EA women only, current IPV was significantly associated with previous miscarriages (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 41; 95 %CI, 1. 13 – 5. 14). In both <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> current IPV was associated with a lack of joint couple decision making about contraception; however, the magnitude of this effect was higher among PP women. This study reveals that IPV was associated with poor obstetrical history among both <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> But the associations of current IPV with previous EA and couple reproductive behaviours were stronger among PP women...|$|R
