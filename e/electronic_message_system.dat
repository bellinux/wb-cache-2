40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{explore how}} {{the use of}} {{electronic}} messages support hospital and community care nurses’ collaboration and communication concerning patients’ admittance to and discharges from hospitals. Background: Nurses in hospitals and in community care {{play a crucial role}} in the transfer of patients between the home and the hospital. Several studies have shown that transition situations are challenging due to a lack of communication and information exchange. Information and communication technologies may support nurses’ work in these transition situations. An <b>electronic</b> <b>message</b> <b>system</b> was introduced in Norway to support patient transitions across the health care sector. Design: A descriptive, qualitative interview study was conducted. Methods: One hospital and three adjacent communities were included in the study. We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital nurses and community care nurses. In total, 41 persons were included in the study. The analysis stemmed from three main topics related to the aims of e-messaging: efficiency, quality and safety. These were further divided into sub-themes. Results: All informants agreed that electronic messaging is more efficient, i. e. less time-consuming than previous means of communication. The shift from predominantly oral communication to writing electronic messages has brought attention to the content of the information exchanged, thereby leading to more conscious communication. Electronic messaging enables improved information security, thereby enhancing patient safety, but this depends on nurses using the system as intended. Conclusion: Nurses consider electronic messaging to be a useful tool for communication and collaboration in patient transitions. Relevance to clinical practice: Patient transitions are demanding situations both for patients and for the nurses who facilitate the transitions. The introduction of information and communication technologies can support nurses’ work in the transition situations, and this is likely to benefit the patients...|$|E

A {{survey was conducted}} in 1992 in the headquarters of a large, geographically dispersed telecommunications company in Maryland which used an in-house electronic mail system. The findings showed that <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> were not widely used for socioemotional purposes but were certainly more common among certain groups.

This study aims to determine which patient characteristics are associated with different levels of usage of an <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> in a diverse urban population. Methods  Cross-sectional electronic health record data were extracted for patients 10 {{years of age or}} older who live in New York City and who visited a set of clinics between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2012. Regression analyses determined which participant characteristics were associated with the sending of <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> Results  Older, female, English-speaking participants of white race who received more messages, had any diagnoses, more office visits and a provider who sent messages were more likely to send more messages. Non-Millennial, non-white participants who received fewer messages, had more office visits, any diagnoses, a provider who saw fewer patients with patient portal accounts, lived in a low socioeconomic status neighbourhood, and did not have private insurance were more likely to send zero messages.

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} {{element to}} be analyzed {{is the role of}} spamming, to present how criminals are able to increase the possibility of success of their deceiving actions by reaching a greater number of potential victims and advertise their products. The term spam is used to describe the abuse of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> in order to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages. The term unsolicited refers {{to the fact that the}} message is sent without a verifiable permission granted by the recipient. A message is considered bulk when it is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all of which have an identical content. Spam is a problem of consent, rather than content. This is a significant element to take into consideration, as attempts to regulate contents of e-mail messages risk to contribute undermining the freedom of speech instead of efficiently fighting the phenomenon of spamming. 92% to 96% of e-mails received by most organizations are spam. Spam volumes around the world reach about 250 billion messages a day, that is to say almost 40 spam e-mail messages a day for each woman, man and child in the world. [...] As it is a cheap and anonymous way to promote products on the Internet and since it also allows reaching a large number of people all over the world, spamming represents a very powerful advertising instrument. It is therefore one of the favorite ways used by organized crime to advertise their illegal activities and illicit products.|$|R
40|$|Large {{parts of}} {{professional}} human communication proceed in a request-reply fashion, whereby requests contain {{specifics of the}} information desired while replies can deliver the required information. However, time limitations often force individuals to prioritize some while neglecting others. This dilemma will inevitably force individuals into defecting against some communication partners to give attention to others. Furthermore, communication entirely breaks down when individuals act purely egoistically as replies would never be issued and quest for desired information would always be prioritized. Here we present an experiment, termed "The expert game", where a number of individuals communicate with one-another through an <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system.</b> By imposing a strict limit {{on the number of}} sent messages, individuals were required to decide between requesting information that is beneficial for themselves or helping others by replying to their requests. In the experiment, individuals were assigned the task to find the expert on a specific topic and receive a reply from that expert. Tasks and expertise of each player were periodically re-assigned to randomize the required interactions. Resisting this randomization, a non-random network of cooperative communication between individuals formed. We use a simple Bayesian inference algorithm to model each player's trust in the cooperativity of others with good experimental agreement. Our results suggest that human communication in groups of individuals is strategic and favors cooperation with trusted parties at the cost of defection against others. To establish and maintain trusted links a significant fraction of time-resources is allocated, even in situations where the information transmitted is negligible. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> (EMS) are an {{attractive}} business communication medium several {{studies on the}} usage and impact of EMS have shown that despite the benefits, they have been generally used for routine and informal communication activities. Theoretically, EMS {{have yet to find}} their niche in organizational communications. Technically, EMS designs are not flexible to support communication activities of managers, are not maintainable to permit easy integration with other office applications and access to information from data/knowledge bases, and are not easily extendible beyond the scope of their initial design. Behaviorally, end users are not directly involved in the development of EMS. This dissertation attempts to bridge the transition of EMS technology from <b>message</b> processing <b>systems</b> to communication support systems. First, the dissertation provides an analysis for a knowledge-based <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> (KMS) through a framework. The framework provides a theoretical basis to link management theory to EMS technology. It suggests that the communication needs of the managers vary depending on the activity level, implying related variations in EMS functionality. Second, the dissertation provides a design for the KMS through an architecture which incorporates the design and implementation issues such as, flexibility, maintainability, and extendibility. The superimposition of the KMS on an existing EMS provides flexibility, the loose coupling between the KMS-interface components and the KMS-functions increases its maintainability, and the strong functional decomposition and cohesion enhances the extendibility of the system beyond the scope of its initial design. Finally, the dissertation provides a implementation through the development of a prototype KMS which involves users into the design process through a validation study conducted at University of Arizona. The prototype used GDSS tools in eliciting message attributes for the personal knowledge base. This method proved effective in reducing the bottleneck observed in the acquisition of knowledge from multiple experts, simultaneously. Similarly, the combination of observation with interviews proved effective in eliciting the organizational knowledge base. The validation method measured the system's accuracy (which was very accurate) in prioritizing messages for the users...|$|R

The total of 25 participants aged 17 – 20 years participated in the baseline measurements and were randomized into the intervention (n = 12) and control (n = 13) groups; 9 people in the HIT group and 10 in the CG also participated in the follow-up assessments. Reaction time (mean change [SD] = 0. 02 [0. 03] vs. − 0. 05 [0. 08], p for time*group interaction = 0. 025, dppc 2 = − 0. 297) and choice reaction time (0. 03 [0. 03] vs. − 0. 01 [0. 04], p for time*group interaction = 0. 017, dppc 2 = − 0. 874) improved more in the CG than in the HIT group.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} foundation for electronic information management in organizations. It focuses on the relationships among communication, control, and information flows of the organization. The main thesis addresses {{the question of how}} <b>electronic</b> mail <b>messages</b> may be managed according to their contents, ensuring at the same time, the preservation of organizational and social relationships. A taxonomy for the management of unstructured electronic information relevance based on the treatment of information is derived from current research. Among the three paradigms, the information processing, the information distribution, and the information sharing paradigms, the inadequacy of the first two is recognized, and the treatment of information in its active mode is proposed. This taxonomy can be used to quickly differentiate one research from another and evaluate its adequacy. Three concepts, four cornerstones, and an architecture constitute our framework of information relevance management. The cornerstones are knowledge of the organization, knowledge of the individual, information construction, and information interpretation. Through knowledge of the organization and the individual, the machine production systems are able to distribute and manage information according to the logic of human production systems. The other two cornerstones together improve the unity of interpretation among the organizational members. The physical architecture can adapt a number of applications, each of which, may not only have different knowledge presentations and inference mothods, but also may co-exist in the system simultaneously. An integrated knowledge-based <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system,</b> the AI-MAIL system, is built, tested, and evaluated through a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture and its applicability to the real-world environment. The three operating levels, interorganizational, intraorganizational, and individual, are illustrated through a study of the U. S. Army. From three large scale field studies, the existing AUTODIN I system, a backbone of the Army's communications, is analyzed and evaluated to illustrate the applicability and benefits of the three operating levels. This dissertation contributes to the field of Management Information Systems by offering a methodology, a taxonomy, a new paradigm, a framework, and a system for information management and a method of adaptive organizational design. In addition, it points toward future research directions. Among them are research to deal with ethical issues, organizational research, knowledge engineering, multi-processor configuration, and internal protocols for applications...|$|R
40|$|Many {{parts of}} the world {{endeavor}} to extend access to more individuals and institutions by means of the <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> in the ever-evolving Internet. While that <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> is continuing to incorporate more and more features such as multimedia information, technical barriers in many {{parts of the}} world or uncontrolled behaviours of originators hinder such expansion. It is the lack of user-requirement based policies in the <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> that increases the constraints to such environments. At the same time the need to integrate and coordinate other <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> such as fax, paging, postal mail etc. with the Internet <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> still exists. On the other hand whether constrained or not, users wish to administer their retrieval of messages in particular manners such as blocking unwanted messages, using alternate message delivery media, using strategic message delivery methods especially for lengthy messages, etc., which in turn leads to a formation of requirement-based policies of the <b>messaging</b> <b>system.</b> Currently there are standards governmg message handling, in particular MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), for exchanging mail messages encompassing a multitude of media, such as graphics images, voice, data and full motion video apart from plain text. However, the MIME standard presupposes certain minimum technical capabilities amongst interconnected and participating mail servers and nodes for distribution of such multimedia mail. In particular, the interconnecting channels between mail servers should be of sufficient bandwidth to conduct the large amount of data in MIME messages at 'reasonable' rates and also the nodes must have adequate storage capacity for the same. This requirement (or bandwidth of channels and storage of mail servers for MIME capability prevents users connected to 'under-privileged' mail nodes from enjoying the benefits brought about by multimedia information and messaging. This may be in spite of the end users owning or having access to resource rich machines. On the other hand, with the introduction of MIME capabilities, users are faced with the essential requirement of administration at the server side owing to the fact that the availability of many media types would impose increased abuses, intended or accidental, especially in the face of new inventions of media types. As a strategic solution to this phenomenon, the concept of an adaptive, service-oriented mail server employing a smart approach to routing of multimedia messages in an inter network of mail servers, disparate in storage capacity, performance, network bandwidth and administration, is presented. This concept, described as Hierarchical Actions Transfer (HAT) concept, involves offsetting the bandwidth and capacity limitations or "desires" of a node at a specific level by requesting a mail node a step higher up to oblige to perform services on its behalf (which the former node is incapable of performing or not willing to, due to capacity or bandwidth limitations or self imposed restrictions). The service requests that are in line with the Requirement-Based Policies are known to the server through a specific configuration mechanism. When delivering messages, the server will first look at the configuration of each connected node and then the message delivery will take place accordingly. It would be inevitably a service-oriented strategy to relieve nodes in constrained environments. An added advantage of the approach is that it implements administrative policies for controlling traffic and congestion arising from MIME mail to a mail server site and the level of MIME services made available to users connected to that site. Further, the technique also integrates conventional and primitive messaging mechanisms, such as postal mail, courier by diskettes/tapes, facsimile and paging, into the realm of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging.</b> It could be further enhanced by the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence if it could identify patterns of frequent node requests. However, current implementation that uses "send-mail" as the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) focuses only on the manual and semiautomatic configuration of such services...|$|R

Our goals are to describe an “anytime, anywhere, any-persona and from any-device” multi-services system, which refers {{to the ability to}} send and receive <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> at any particular time using different kinds of personal identities and through a variety of devices wherever you are. These multi-services include various kinds of information such as voice, data, images and multi-media, any of which can be transferred on the wired and wireless computer networks such as LAN, WAN, and telecommunication networks such as telephone, fax and mobile etc. We will also specify what the most important characteristic features in this multi-services system are. Today, there are a multitude of communication devices and corresponding means available to exchange electronic information. However, each of these devices and means has different capabilities. For a user wishing to transfer messages, they ma...|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} transaction {{system is a}} set of participants and their interactions towards an efficient and secured exchange of message between the participants. A secured <b>electronic</b> <b>message</b> transaction <b>system</b> has been designed, developed and implemented where Hill Cipher Cryptosystem is used as the encryption-decryption process with dynamic keys. For this process, any transacted message is to be inputted into the proposed system, and then a matrix of the message length is calculated with its inverse matrix. The calculated inverse matrix is sent to the receiver where he/she used it as the key for the cryptosystem. The key matrix and the Hill Cipher technique have been used to generate the cipher text. The message digest algorithm MD 5 operations have been used on the message to generate the digest of the message. The generated digest is concatenated with the encrypted message and is sent to the destination. In the receiver end, the intended receiver first computes the digest of the message by performing the message digest algorithm MD 5 and compares it with the received digest that establishes the data integration and non-repudiation of the proposed system. The receiver then decrypts the received encrypted message using the Hill Cipher technique with the received inverse matrix and retrieve the message properly which establishes the message confidentiality and authentication. The proposed system has been implemented using the Java programming and analyzed for several applications. Finally, the fundamental security services have been measured and analyzed. This may be applicable for cryptographic applications...|$|R
