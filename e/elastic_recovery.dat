Dough snapback was determined to be a function of both processing parameters, reduction ratio, and dough rest time, as well as different flour properties. The predication equation for dough snapback is based on multiple flour properties and sheeting conditions. Among the variables, Mixograph work, reduction ratio, and dough rest time were the main factors affecting the elastic characteristics of the doughs.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, the {{resistance}} to scratch and wear (pin-on-flat) tests of five different porous TiO 2 films were compared. Such tribological tests were carried out under dry conditions. The coatings were electrodeposited on commercially pure-Ti by anodic oxidation method in different electrolyte solutions at constant voltages. The scratch tests were conducted by applying increasing normal loads up to 400 mN. The coefficient of friction (COF) varied from 0. 2 up to 0. 5, and increased at larger penetrations depths. When the electrolyte concentration was changed from 0. 5 into 1. 0 M H 2 SO 4, the COF slightly decreased. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the coatings produced in H 2 SO 4 / 150 V and Na 2 SO 4 / 100 V did not have their substrates revealed. In addition, the samples anodized in H 2 SO 4 / 150 V had the highest <b>elastic</b> <b>recoveries.</b> Therefore, such coatings {{seem to be more}} resistant to scratch tests than the others. The wear tests were carried out with Berkovich tip as counter-face under constant normal loads of 10 mN in 10 forward-backward cycles. The coatings deposited in H 2 SO 4 / 150 V had the lowest wear volume rates. The findings suggest that the porous Ti oxide coatings electrodeposited above their rupture voltages are more suitable to both scratch- and wear-resistance compared to those prepared at the lowest voltage (H 2 SO 4 / 100 V) ...|$|R

The main problem of this technology is using a high concentration of glycerol, which is a limiting factor for bacteria cells growth (especially in batch fermentation). Results: In this work, the influence of different glycerol concentration in batch fermentation on Clostridium butyricum DSP 1 metabolism was investigated. The biomass was concentrated for two times with the use of membrane module (in case of increasing kinetic parameters). Increased optical density of bacteria cells six times increased the productivity of 1, 3 -PD in cultivation with 20  g/L of glycerol {{at the beginning of the}} process, and more than two times in cultivation with 60 – 80  g/L.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{indentation}} test, the hardness and {{the elastic}} modulus depend strongly on the estimate of the indenter-material contact area at peak load. However, many elastic–plastic behaviours such as <b>elastic</b> <b>recoveries</b> during unloading and piling-up or sinking-in of surface profiles during indentation affect {{the determination of the}} hardness and {{the elastic modulus}}. So, atomic force microscopy is a method of utmost importance to provide an accurate knowledge of the indentation impression especially when plastic deformations occur, that leads to errors in the determination of the contact area. Atomic force measurements of vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and tantalum pure metals as well as stainless steels, often used as substrates for thin films depositions, highlight the difficulties to estimate the contact area. The variation of hardness values determined by atomic force microscopy measurements and nanoindentation test is correlated to the formation of folds of 150 and 100 nm high, around the residual impression of vanadium and tungsten indented at 0. 1 N, respectively. Some folds which increase with increasing loads are detected on the residual impressions of both 35 CD 4 and 30 NCD 16 stainless steels indented under loads of 0. 01 N, only. Such structures are related to pilingup of surface profiles that could lead to an underestimate of the contact area in the indentation test. So, the hardness value of tungsten could be closer to 6 than to 7 GPa whereas the effect of piling-up on the estimation of contact area of vanadium could be lower. Almost no deformation is seen on tantalum and molybdenum. So, the hardness values determined by the various methods are consistent. These results show that atomic force microscopy measurements are quite complementary of the nanoindentation test...|$|R

As steep terrain-adapted animals, changes in muscle work output are expected to be particularly important for goats. In vivo muscle–tendon forces, fascicle length changes and muscle activation were recorded via tendon force buckles, sonomicrometry and electromyography to evaluate the work performance and <b>elastic</b> energy <b>recovery</b> of the three distal MTUs. These recordings confirmed that fascicle strain and force within goat distal hind limb muscles are adjusted in response to changes in mechanical work demand associated with locomotor grade. In general, muscle work was modulated most consistently by changes in fascicle strain, with increased net shortening (P< 0. 001) observed as goats switched from decline to level to incline locomotion. Peak muscle stresses increased as goats increased speed from a walk to a trot within each grade condition (P< 0. 05), and also increased significantly with grade (P< 0. 05 to P< 0. 01). Due to the increase in net fascicle shortening and muscle force, net muscle work per cycle also increased significantly (P< 0. 05 to P< 0. 005) as goats switched from decline to level to incline conditions (LG work: 20 mJ to 56 mJ to 209 mJ; MG work: – 7 mJ to 34 mJ to 179 mJ; SDF work: – 42 mJ to 14 mJ to 71 mJ, at a 2. 5 ms– 1 trot). Although muscle work was modulated in response to changes in grade, the amount of work produced by these three distal pennate muscles was small (being < 3 %) in comparison with the change in mechanical energy required of the limb as a whole. <b>Elastic</b> energy <b>recovery</b> in the SDF and gastrocnemius (GA) tendons was substantial across all three grades, with the SDF tendon recovering 2. 4 times more energy, on average, than the GA tendon.
