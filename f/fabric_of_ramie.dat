40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness of environmental pollution and the extensive 	consideration of mankind health, {{there has been}} an increased demand for natural fibers 	in textile materials recently. As a typical natural fiber, ramie is an increasingly popular 	because of its excellent properties including a high tensile strength, excellent thermal 	conductivity, coolness, ventilation function, moisture absorption, and antibacterial 	function. However, ramie fiber and ramie fabric have some disadvantages such as poor 	elasticity, low wrinkle recovery, low resilience, itchiness, harsh handle, which decreases 	the competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric</b> in the high-grade garment-fabric market. It is 	necessary to use the advanced technologies in the dyeing and finishing for enhancing 	the competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric.</b> This study is aimed to study the natural dyeing and 	functional finishing <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric.</b> At present, ramie fabrics are mostly dyed with synthetic colorants which can give rise 	to serious environmental pollution and potential harm to mankind health. Thus the 	natural and healthy features <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric</b> are greatly weakened. In this study, ramie 	fabrics were dyed with the several natural extracts. But heavy metal ions, which lead to 	environmental pollution, are usually used as mordant in natural dyeing. In this study, the 	eco-friendly rare earth was used as mordant in natural dyeing <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The 	influences <b>of</b> dyeing conditions were studied. The ramie fabrics dyed using rare earth as 	mordant exhibited higher color shade stability against pH variation. Using rare earth as 	mordant in natural dyeing apparently enhanced the color fastness to washing, rubbing 	and light <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics.</b> As compared with Fe 2 + and Cr 6 +, rare earth was more 	efficient, resulting in decrease of mordant concentration in natural dyeing. Thus rare 	earth was effective mordant in the natural dyeing <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics.</b> One <b>of</b> the shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric</b> is its lower wrinkle recovery. The typical 	wrinkle resistant finishing via cross-linking usually decreases strength <b>of</b> cellulose 	<b>fabrics.</b> In this study, ramie fabrics were pretreated with liquid ammonia (NH 3) prior to 	wrinkle resistant finishing. Meanwhile, a kind of thermally reactive polyurethane (PU) 	emulsion was used as strength protector. The liquid NH 3 pretreatment was proved todecrease crystallinity <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fiber and bring about apparent swelling effect. As a result, 	the accessibility <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics</b> treated by liquid NH 3 was elevated. The liquid NH 3 	pretreatment prior to resin finishing gave rise to better wrinkle resistant effect and less 	strength loss. The thermally reactive PU emulsion was proved to decrease strength loss 	<b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric</b> without influencing wrinkle resistant effect. Using liquid NH 3 	pretreatment and employing reactive PU as protector in the wrinkle resistant finishing 	<b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabric</b> can raise strength retention up to 80 %. After 10 laundry cycles, the flat 	appearance and the crease retention <b>of</b> these <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics</b> were over grade 3. 0. Developing electromagnetic shielding textiles has drawn increasing attention recently 	since electromagnetic pollution is harmful to mankind health. In this study, super critical 	carbon dioxide (scCO 2) fluid technology was used to develop electromagnetic shielding 	ramie fabric. The scCO 2 treatment could remove the impurities <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> fibers 	prominently. The scCO 2 fluid could result in the swelling <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fiber and thus 	increase the absorbency <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fiber to additives. Using scCO 2 fluid, the Palladium 	(II) -hexafluoroacetylacetonate could be impregnated into the ramie fiber under 	appropriate conditions. After thermal decomposition at high temperature, the Palladium 	film formed on ramie fibers. The ramie fabrics bearing Palladium catalyst were plated 	with a cooper film via electroless cooper plating. The cooper coated ramie fabrics 	exhibited good shielding effect. This study presented a new way for developing 	electromagnetic shielding fabric. Nanoparticles have been extensively used for the functional finishing of textiles. But 	the nano finishing <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics</b> has less been studied. In this study, the 	multifunctional ramie fabrics coated by TiO 2 nanoparticle were developed. The optimal 	dispersion conditions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension were studied in 	details. A kind of hydrophilic silica aerogel product was proved to be suitable for 	serving as dispersant for dispersion of TiO 2. Using the TiO 2 suspension prepared in 	optimal conditions, ramie fabrics were coated with TiO 2 via a dip-pad-dry process. In 	order to enhance the finishing durability the ramie fabric were pretreated by citric acid 	prior to nano finishing. The ramie fabric finished with working bath containing 0. 8 g/L 	TiO 2 was proved exhibited excellent UV protection and antibacterial property, and high capability for decomposing formaldehyde. Treating fabric with citric acid before coating 	could improve the washing durability of the resultant TiO 2 loaded ramie fabrics. This study explored several ways for developing healthy and highly functional ramie 	fabrics with high added value. The resultant ramie fabrics exhibited high quality. The 	newly developed dyeing and finishing processes are supposed to be helpful for raising 	the competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> and expanding its application...|$|R

30|$|Additional file 1 : Figure S 8 {{displays}} the 13 C solid-state NMR spectra <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fibers {{before and after}} treatment with noble metal nanoparticles. It is well-known that the NMR technique probes the signal from the overall sample volume and the NMR intensity {{is proportional to the}} number of spins. Therefore, for the present ramie samples, the NMR spectra provide us the structure and dynamics information of the bulk molecules rather than the surface because of its small surface-to-volume ratio. The NMR spectra corresponding to untreated and treated ramie fibers were nearly identical, which indicates that the in situ synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles did not change visibly the chemical structures <b>of</b> the bulk <b>ramie.</b> As an indispensable compensation to NMR, FTIR detects the structure and dynamics of the surface molecules. To understand the surface structure change <b>of</b> the treated <b>ramie</b> fibers, FTIR measurements were performed for all the three samples. Comparing with the FTIR spectrum <b>of</b> untreated <b>ramie</b> (Curve a in Additional file 1 : Figure S 9), no obvious differences were found in the FTIR spectra <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics</b> after treatment with silver and gold nanoparticles (Curves b and c in Additional file 1 : Figure S 9).

Whereas, no bacteria colonies were found on agar plates <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fibers treated with silver nanoparticles (Additional file 1 : Figure S 7 c), revealing that the silver nanoparticles on fibers inhibited the growth of bacteria. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} the in situ synthesized silver nanoparticles endow ramie fiber with strong antibacterial property, which enhances the function <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fibers.|$|R
30|$|Morphological changes <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fibers due to {{swelling}} in alkali solution were investigated. The observed twisting {{and changes in}} the cross-sectional shape of the fibers could be explained as a geometrical alteration caused by lateral expansion of coiling fibrils, as the unmercerized ramie fiber showed an S-helix structure. The fibril angle <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> fibers was estimated to be 3 °. Although the swollen fiber untwisted to some extent on washing with water, the shape of the twisted ribbons as observed by scanning electron microscopy was retained even after drying. Concentrated 8 N NaOH produced only a moderate change in morphology, whereas swelling with 3.5 N NaOH at 0 °C expanded the cross sections about 30 times over the initial ones accompanied by a drastic change {{in the shape of the}} fiber.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} alcohol, acetone, and {{methyl ethyl ketone}} {{solvent-based}} treatment on surface topography <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> single fiber are investigated. In this study, the average of specific porous volume and specific surface area <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> single fiber are determined to interpret {{the effects of the}} treatment quantitatively using Brunauer-Emmet-Teller surface area method. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectro-scopy is applied directly to the fiber to detect the differences of molecular group function in the fiber surface. Qualitatively, scanning electron microscopy was also provided. The result shows that the solvent treatment could improve surface topography to gain matrix penetration when utilizing the fiber into polymeric composite material.

40|$|In this study, Eudragit S- 100 {{has been}} covalently {{bound to the}} {{cellulase}} enzyme to form immobilized cellulase enzyme and then {{the effect of the}} treatment on ramie fabric properties is studied. The ramie fabrics treated with immobilized cellulase enzyme show lower quantities of reducing sugar, weight loss, and higher tensile strength than native cellulase enzyme-treated fabrics. Scanning electron microscopic analysis shows that the surface <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics</b> treated with cellulase enzyme is smoother than that of the untreated sample. Furthermore, treatment by the immobilized cellulase enzyme is less damaging to the fibres. X-ray diffraction studies show that there is hardly any loss in the crystallinity <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Low-stress mechanical properties evaluated by the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric indicate that immobilized cellulase enzyme treatment improves the softness, flexibility, and elastic recovery <b>of</b> the <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics.</b> This work was funded by the Galician government (Xunta de Galiza) through the I 2 C postdoctoral program (fellowship ED 481 B 2014 / 133 - 0), and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (grant DPI 2013 - 47100 -C 2 - 2 -P) ...|$|R
30|$|Washing {{fastness}} {{was evaluated}} {{in accordance with}} Australian Standard AS 2001.4. 15 — 2006. The ramie fabrics treated with silver or gold nanoparticles were washed for 45  min at 50  °C {{in the presence of}} ECE reference detergent (4  g/L) by using a lab dyeing machine (Ahiba, Top Speed Nuance). The CIE Lab color coordinate values (L*, a*, and b*) for each specimen were measured before and after washing. L* represents the lightness/darkness, a* value represents the red or green chroma, and b* represents the chromaticity coordinate for yellow/blue. The color difference (ΔE) was obtained based on the changes in color coordinates (ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb*) with the formula: ΔE = [(ΔL*) 2 [*]+[*](Δa*) 2 [*]+[*](Δb*) 2] 1 / 2. The color difference (ΔE) <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics</b> before and after washing was measured by spectrophotometer to assess washing fastness <b>of</b> <b>ramie</b> <b>fabrics</b> according to Australian Standard AS 2001.4.A 05 — 2004.|$|R
30|$|The morphological, physical, and {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} nonwood plant fiber bundles <b>of</b> <b>ramie,</b> pineapple, sansevieria, kenaf, abaca, sisal, and coconut fiber bundles were investigated. All fibers except those of coconut fiber had noncircular cross-sectional shapes. The crosssectional area of the fiber bundles was evaluated by an improved method using scanning electron microscope images. The coefficient factor defined as {{the ratio of the}} cross-sectional area determined by diameter measurement, to the cross-sectional area determined by image analysis was between 0.92 and 0.96 for all fibers. This indicated that the area determined by diameter measurement was available. The densities of the fiber bundles decreased with increasing diameters. The diameters of each fiber species had small variation of around 3.4 %- 9.8 % within a specimen. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus <b>of</b> <b>ramie,</b> pineapple, and sansevieria fiber bundles showed excellent values in comparison with the other fibers. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus showed a decreasing trend with increasing diameter of fiber bundles.|$|R
