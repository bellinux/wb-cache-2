50|$|Introduction - Multiple <b>disk</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are used}} to deliver {{extremely}} high torque in a relatively small space. These clutches can be used dry or wet (oil bath). Running the clutches in an oil bath also greatly increases the heat dissipation capability, which makes them ideally suited for multiple speed gear boxes and machine tool applications.|$|R

5000|$|How {{it works}} [...] - Multiple <b>disk</b> <b>clutches</b> operate via an {{electrical}} actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current is applied through the clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. These lines of flux are transferred {{through the small}} air gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts both the armature and friction disks. The attraction of the armature compresses (squeezes) the friction disks, transferring the torque from the in inner driver to the out disks. The output disks are connected to a gear, coupling, or pulley via drive cup. The clutch slips until the input and output RPMs are matched. This happens relatively quickly typically (0.2 - 2 sec).|$|R
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the <b>clutch</b> <b>disk.</b> This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} engine {{offered in}} the Selbstfahrer is a straight-six otto engine producing 41 kW. It is mounted on the roof to prevent the air intake from drawing in the threshing dust. The torque is transmitted to the gearbox with a single <b>disk</b> dry <b>clutch.</b> For an additional charge, the Selbstfahrer was delivered with a straight-four diesel engine. At least two engine models were used: The Claas LD 40, a 4,7 l diesel and the Perkins 4.270, a 4,4 l diesel. Both engines produce 44 kW.|$|R
50|$|Front-wheel and rear-wheel-drive {{transmissions}} operate similarly. When {{the transmission}} {{is put in}} neutral and the clutch is disengaged, the input shaft, <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> and countershaft can continue to rotate under their own inertia. In this state, the engine, the input shaft and clutch, and the output shaft all rotate independently.|$|R
40|$|Widespread use of <b>disk</b> <b>clutches</b> in {{transmissions}} {{has generated}} {{an interest in}} better understanding the dynamic behavior of clutches subjected to various operating conditions. The research conducted in this study focuses on thermal aspects of clutch engagement. It {{is divided into two}} parts: a study of transient fluid thermal effects during engagement and a study of thermally induced structural instability. Both portions of the research are concerned with the macroscopic behavior of clutches. ^ The fluid thermal model is used to study torque transfer. Experimental data from a wet clutch dynamic test rig has been obtained for various initial temperatures and sliding speeds. By comparing analytical and experimental results it is shown that modeling thermal effects is important for accurately predicting characteristics such as peak torque and engagement time. ^ The stability studies involve analyses of the conditions leading to divergence (static) and flutter (dynamic) instabilities when the clutch is operated under drag operating conditions. Static instabilities are shown to depend on sliding speed, friction coefficient, and temperature. A conservative estimate of the stability boundary can be determined by calculating two points on the boundary. Dynamic instability, which produces squeal vibrations, depends on sliding speed, friction coefficient, and temperature as well as the distribution of the stiffness of the friction material. Two types of instability boundaries are observed. For certain conditions, the stability boundary is “V”-shaped and a very small friction coefficient can cause an unstable response. For other conditions, the stability boundary is trough-shaped. Higher friction coefficients are needed to cause instability. ...|$|R
50|$|A two plate dry <b>disk</b> {{diaphragm}} spring <b>clutch</b> drove Fuller four-speed main and three-speed auxiliary transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive gears. The low gear allowed several very low gears for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|R
50|$|The three {{cylinder}} {{two-stroke engine}} used a Drehschieber ("rotary valve", a turning disk, with intake holes for exact {{timing of the}} fuel-air mixture intake). The fuel-air mixture was sucked in by the vacuum in the three crankshaft housings as usual. The Drehschieber does the intake timing for all three cylinders. The engine was not a radial engine associated with aircraft {{and there was no}} need for a flywheel. All three cranks worked on one common gear. This arrangement and the recoil of the pistons in the turning direction secured a perfect balance of the moving parts. The cylinders were made of KS (Kolbenschmidt) iron cylinder walls and were embedded in the Silumin alloy engine housing. The only things that could be visibly identified as engine parts were the alloy cylinder heads with multiple cooling fins and the exhaust pipes located between the spokes of the cast alloy front wheel. These flat spokes were designed to serve as a functional cooling fan. The two-speed transmission was built as a differential transmission and used slope-meshed gears. The clutch was made of conventional <b>clutch</b> <b>disks.</b> The <b>clutch</b> (with the springs at the outer circle) was located in front of the transmission. The transmission was actuated by foot-operated steel cables. All parts of the engine allowed easy access for service work. After the removal of the engine - only two bolts and some wiring had to be removed - all important parts were within reach.|$|R

50|$|Phenolic resins {{are found}} in a myriad of {{industrial}} products. Phenolic laminates are made by impregnating one or more layers of a base material such as paper, fiberglass or cotton with phenolic resin and laminating the resin-saturated base material under heat and pressure. The resin fully polymerizes (cures) during this process forming the thermoset polymer matrix. The base material choice depends on the intended application of the finished product. Paper phenolics are used in manufacturing electrical components such as punch-through boards, in household laminates, and in paper composite panels. Glass phenolics are particularly well suited {{for use in the}} high speed bearing market. Phenolic micro-balloons are used for density control. Snooker balls as well as balls from many table-based ball games are also made from phenol formaldehyde resin. The binding agent in normal (organic) brake pads, brake shoes and <b>clutch</b> <b>disks</b> are phenolic resin. Synthetic resin bonded paper, made from phenolic resin and paper, is used to make countertops.|$|R
50|$|The {{input of}} the clutch is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft, chain, or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and <b>clutch</b> <b>disks</b> stacked together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire input shaft and <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with clutching can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|R
40|$|Based on a discrete-time second order {{state-space}} {{dynamic model}} of the powertrain system, a piecewise feedback control for the dry clutch engagement process is proposed. The engine speed and the <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> speed {{are assumed to be}} measurable and the control input is the normal engaging force applied to the disks. The controller is designed by minimizing a quadratic performance index subject to constraints on the normal force, normal force derivative, and engine speed. The resulting Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is shown to consist of a piecewise linear feedback control: the state space can be divided into several regions, such that in each region an off-line computed linear controller must be implemented. The explicit piecewise linear form of the MPC law is obtained by using a multiparametric programming solver and can be tuned so that fast engagement, small friction losses and smooth lock-up are achieved. The paper reports numerical results, carried out by a Simulink/MPC Toolbox simulation scheme and a realistic set of parameters, showing the good performance of the closed-loop system...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} wet clutch torque {{transmission}} characteristics {{is a problem}} of both theoretical and practical interest. In this dissertation, the topic is examined from two parallel viewpoints; the fundamental approach involves detailed dynamic modeling of the contacting surfaces, while the applied approach includes a computationally efficient model for the gross features of clutch engagement. The model for torque transfer is validated with experimental data from the Wet Clutch Dynamic Test Rig. ^ The torque transfer model accurately predicts wet clutch engagement performance over a wide range of input parameters. The results demonstrate the importance of accurately determining such parameters as friction material permeability, applied force, and friction coefficient. It is shown that the success of the predictions is closely related to the precise characterization of the friction coefficient. ^ The fundamental study involves the interaction of velocity-dependent friction coefficient and time-varying normal forces. A new type of friction-related dynamic instability is predicted using a perturbation analysis, and simulation results are presented to corroborate the predictions. A finite element model of the contact is developed, and stick-slip before lockup of the <b>clutch</b> <b>disks</b> is shown to produce torque oscillations under non-constant normal forces. ...|$|R

The first case study concerns the malfunction of an automotive cast iron pressure plate operated {{in an automobile}} clutch system.

Both components are designed to function under sliding friction conditions that lead to the severe wear of consumable non-metallic parts of the tribosystems: the <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> and the brake pad, respectively. However, in both cases it was the unexpected failure of the conjugate metallic parts that resulted in terminal system damage. The experimental approach to identify the root cause of failure involved both microstructure characterization, as well as observations of the metallic contact surfaces by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy, in conjunction with microhardness and surface topography measurements. For the case of the stainless steel brake disk in particular, Finite Element Analysis was employed to simulate the operating tribosystem, identify the site(s) prone for crack initiation and validate the failure mechanisms hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|Automated manual {{transmissions}} {{based on}} dry clutch are wide spreading in modern automotive transmissions {{because of the}} possible improvements in performance and comfort with respect to manual transmissions. A key issue for an efficient control of electro-actuated dry clutch transmissions is {{the knowledge of the}} clutch torque transmitted during the engagement. The torque transmitted by the clutch can be directly measured by means of setups which are difficult to be implemented in commercial products. Therefore it is fundamental to define an accurate torque transmissibility model to be exploited for the estimation of the clutch torque. A possible estimator is based on the inversion of the driveline dynamic model like showed by Gliemo et al. (2006) and by Amari et al. (2009), but the robustness of this type of estimation drastically depends on the availability of the system parameters and on <b>clutch</b> <b>disk</b> acceleration and engine torque measurements. As proposed by Vasca et al. (2008), a possible alternative consists in using an analytical model describing the friction phenomena and providing the torque transmitted by the clutch starting from the throwout bearing position. Unfortunately, the nominal characteristic (torque vs position) is influenced by several variables. Some of them, such as friction pads wear and diaphragm spring fatigue, have a “long term” effect, like showed by Mauro et al. (2002). Other variables have a direct influence also on each engagement maneuver. These variables, such as slipping speed, pressure, slipping acceleration and temperature affect the friction coefficient, as tested by Senatore et al. (2011), Feng et al. (2010) and by LuK (1996), and the normal force (D’Agostino et al., 2012) (Cappetti et al., 2012). The difficulties in representing the contributions of the different variables in the clutch torque transmissibility characteristic lead to the definition of corresponding lumped models, so as in the works of Myklebust et al. (2012; 2013). In this paper a temperature dependent torque transmissibility model for dry clutch transmissions is proposed. The model estimates the clutch torque by considering separately the influence of the slipping speed and temperature on the friction coefficient and the influence of the temperature on the normal force determined by the flat spring. In order to estimate the temperatures of interest, two thermal models of a dry dual clutch transmission with a central disk are proposed. The temperatures estimated by means of the proposed thermal models are then used for the analysis of open loop and closed loop operating conditions in a realistic dry dual clutch transmission...|$|R
