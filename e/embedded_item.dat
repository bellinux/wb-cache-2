40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} family of item-response models that allow the {{separate}} and independent specification of three orthogonal components: item attribute, person covariate, and local item dependence. Special interest lies in extending the linear logistic test model, which is commonly used to measure item attributes, to tests with <b>embedded</b> <b>item</b> clusters. The problem of local item dependence arises in item clusters. Existing methods for handling such dependence, however, often fail to satisfy the property of invariant marginal interpretation of the item attribute parameters. While such a property may not be necessary for applications that focus on predictive analysis, it is critical for linear logistic test models. To achieve the marginal property, we implement an iterative estimation method, which is illustrated using data collected from an inventory on verbal aggressiveness...|$|E

The lag effect refers to the finding that the probability of recalling a repeated item varies systematically as a function of lag, or the length of the interval between two presentations of the item. Component-levels theory (Glenberg, 1979) is an explanation of the lag effect based on the encoding variability hypothesis. Descriptive, structural, and contextual components are the three types of encoded information about an item that are posited in the theory. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the structural component assumptions of component-levels theory in free recall. Presentation lists were constructed in which each repeated word and the two words preceding and the two words following the repeated word at each presentation were from the same interitem associative strength (IAS) group. In two control groups, either moderate or zero IAS words were used at all lags within each of the two lists. Each of three experimental groups received lists in which zero IAS words were used at one lag and moderate IAS words were used at the other two lags. Each list contained two exemplars of each of three lags, 0, 5, and 21. In both control groups, the probability of recalling repeated words increased as lag increased. In the experimental groups, the probability of recalling repeated words at the one lag with items of zero IAS resembled the performance level at that lag in the zero IAS control group; recall at the other two lags approximated the performance level at those lags in the moderate IAS control group. The unconditional probability of recalling an <b>embedded</b> <b>item</b> was lower wherever zero, rather than moderate, IAS word groups were used. However, this probability was relatively constant, rather than increasing, over lags. Targer items were more likely to be recalled given that at least one accompanying embedded items was also recalled. The theoretical assumption that the lag effect in free recall is primarily due to the differential storage of structural components was supported. The recall patterns also supported the assumption that the formation of the structural components is limited to associations among words that are processed concurrently...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{supervised}} representation learning has provided {{state of the}} art or close to the {{state of the art}} results in semantic analysis tasks including ranking and information retrieval. The core idea is to learn how to <b>embed</b> <b>items</b> into a latent space such that they optimize a supervised objective in that latent space. The dimensions of the latent space have no clear semantics, and this reduces the interpretability of the system. For example, in personalization models, it is hard to explain why a particular item is ranked high for a given user profile. We propose a novel model of representation learning called Supervised Explicit Semantic Analysis (SESA) that is trained in a supervised fashion to <b>embed</b> <b>items</b> to a set of dimensions with explicit semantics. The model learns to compare two objects by representing them in this explicit space, where each dimension corresponds to a concept from a knowledge base. This work extends Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) with a supervised model for ranking problems. We apply this model to the task of Job-Profile relevance in LinkedIn in which a set of skills defines our explicit dimensions of the space. Every profile and job are encoded to this set of skills their similarity is calculated in this space. We use RNNs to embed text input into this space. In addition to interpretability, our model makes use of the web-scale collaborative skills data that is provided by users for each LinkedIn profile. Our model provides state of the art result while it remains interpretable...|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{the complex}} {{interactions}} between users and items {{as well as}} amongst items themselves {{is at the core}} of designing successful recommender systems. One classical setting is predicting users' personalized sequential behavior (or `next-item' recommendation), where the challenges mainly lie in modeling `third-order' interactions between a user, her previously visited item(s), and the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these higher-order interactions into a combination of pairwise relationships, by way of which user preferences (user-item interactions) and sequential patterns (item-item interactions) are captured by separate components. In this paper, we propose a unified method, TransRec, to model such third-order relationships for large-scale sequential prediction. Methodologically, we <b>embed</b> <b>items</b> into a `transition space' where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences.

Five template cases were constructed, in which were <b>embedded</b> <b>items</b> which were felt to be potentially contentious. Fifty-five out of 94 (59 %) respondents replied. There was a very wide variation in the scores assigned to each vignette. In only five of 65 items was there complete agreement among replies: in general there was a very large range for each item. Thirty of the items showed less than 90 % agreement. The apparent simplicity of the HIS conceals possibilities for ambiguous interpretation of individual items.

40|$|The role of {{contingency}} {{awareness in}} simple associative learning experiments with human participants is currently debated. Since prior work suggests that eye movements can index mnemonic processes that occur without awareness, we used eye tracking {{to better understand}} the role of awareness in learning aversive Pavlovian conditioning. A complex real-world scene containing four <b>embedded</b> household <b>items</b> was presented to participants while skin conductance, eye movements, and pupil size were recorded. One <b>item</b> <b>embedded</b> in the scene served as the conditional stimulus (CS). One exemplar of that item (e. g. a white pot) was paired with shock 100 percent of the time (CS+) while a second exemplar (e. g. a gray pot) was never paired with shock (CS-). The remaining items were paired with shock on half of the trials. Participants rated their expectation of receiving a shock during each trial, and these expectancy ratings were used to identify when (i. e. on what trial) each participant became aware of the programmed contingencies. Disproportionate viewing of the CS was found both before and after explicit contingency awareness, and patterns of viewing distinguished the CS+ from the CS-. These observations are consistent with "dual process" models of fear conditioning, as they indicate that learning can be expressed in patterns of viewing prior to explicit contingency awareness...|$|R

Recent approaches that leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for session-based recommendations have shown that Deep Learning models can provide useful user representations for recommendation.
