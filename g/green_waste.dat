The activated carbon was prepared from <b>green</b> vegetable <b>waste</b> by KOH treatment for 24 h at 60 °C and thereafter evaluated by studying the effects of pH, contact time, dosage and initial concentration and optimized in the batch processing mode.

40|$|In the {{developing}} countries populations, which are already vulnerable and food insecure, {{are likely to be}} the most seriously affected by the effects of climate change, e. g. yield decreases and price increases for the most important agricultural crops. The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report for Africa describes a trend of warming at a rate faster than the global average and increasing aridity: in many parts of Africa, it seems that warmer climates and changes in precipitation will destabilise agricultural production and aggravates food security. The present work concerns the vegetables cultivation in the Parakou region in Benin, where agriculture employs approximately 70 % of the active population and contributes to 36 % of the Gross Domestic Product and 88 % of export earnings. However, the agricultural sector has been regarded as unproductive with low adaptation capacities because of structural factors (e. g. high level of poverty among rural populations, weak mechanization and intensification of production modes), but also because of natural constraints (e. g. poor management of water and soils, leading to soil degradation). Considering the aridity, the low carbon content and the reduced level of nutrients available in the soil, the use of an hydroponic module has been hypothesised. In this way sufficient yields of the crops may be assured and no agricultural machines will be needed for the tillage operations. In addition, the nutrients can be added to the growing solution using residual materials as poultry manure, ashes and <b>green</b> <b>wastes.</b> In order to verify if some construction or maintenance problems can occur and if a growing solution can be easily obtained using agricultural wastes, some tests have been carried out. Moreover laboratory analyses have been done for different solutions that may be adopted with different shares of water, poultry manure, ashes and <b>green</b> <b>wastes.</b> The tests have indicated that the hydroponic module could be used in Benin without incurring in technical problems and that a growing solution containing poultry manure, ashes and <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> can supply to the crops a significant amount of nutrients...|$|R

We added two different doses of clay, biochar or their mixture to pre-composted <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> and monitored carbon mineralization over 21  days in the absence or presence of worms. The resulting co-composts and vermicomposts were then added to a loamy Cambisol and the CO 2 emissions were monitored over 30  days in a laboratory incubation. Our results indicated that the addition of clay or clay/biochar mixture reduced carbon mineralization during co-composting without worms by up to 44  %. In the presence of worms, CO 2 emissions during composting increased for all treatments except for the low clay dose. The effect of the amendments on carbon mineralization after addition to soil was small in the short term. Overall, composts increased OM mineralization, whereas vermicomposts had no effect. The presence of biochar reduced OM mineralization in soil with respect to compost and vermicompost without additives, whereas clay reduced mineralization only in the composts. Our study indicates a significant role of the conditions of composting on mineralization in soil. Therefore, the production of a low CO 2 emission amendment requires optimization of feedstocks, co-composting agents and worm species...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{recovery}} from biomass by gasification technology has attracted significant interest because it satisfies a key requirement of environmental sustainability by producing near zero emissions. Though {{it is not}} a new technology, studies on its integrated process simulation and analysis are limited, in particular for municipal solid waste (MSW) gasification. This paper develops an integrated fixed bed gasifier model of biomass gasification using the Advanced System for Process ENngineering (Aspen) Plus software for its performance analysis. A computational model was developed on the basis of Gibbs free energy minimization. The model is validated with experimental data of MSW and food waste gasification available in the literature. A reasonable agreement between measured and predicted syngas composition was found. Using the validated model, the effects of operating conditions, namely air-fuel ratio and gasifier temperature, on syngas production are studied. Performance analyses have been done for four different feedstocks, namely wood, coffee bean husks, <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> and MSWs. The ultimate and proximate analysis data for each feedstock was used for model development. It was found that operating parameters have a significant influence on syngas composition. An air-fuel ratio of 0. 3 and gasifier temperature of 700 °C provides optimum performance for a fixed bed gasifier for MSWs, wood <b>wastes,</b> <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> and coffee bean husks. The developed model can be useful for gasification of other biomasses (e. g., food wastes, rice husks, poultry wastes and sugarcane bagasse) to predict the syngas composition. Therefore, the study provides an integrated gasification model which can be used for different biomass feedstocks...|$|R
