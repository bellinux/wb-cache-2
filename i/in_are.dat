5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep <b>in</b> <b>are</b> leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed <b>in</b> <b>are,</b> for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: Barrett’s {{esophagus}} (BE) {{is characterized}} by the transition of squamous epithelium into columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia. The increased number and types of immune cells <b>in</b> <b>BE</b> have been indicated to be due to a Th 2 -type inflammatory process. We tested the alternative hypothesis that the abundance of T-cells <b>in</b> <b>BE</b> is caused by a homing mechanism that <b>is</b> found <b>in</b> the duodenum. Patients and Methods: Biopsies from BE and duodenal tissue from 30 BE patients and duodenal tissue from 18 controls were characterized by immmunohistochemistry for the presence of T-cells and eosinophils(eos). Ex vivo expanded T-cells were further phenotyped by multicolor analysis using flowcytometry. Results: The high percentage of CD 4 +-T cells (6963 % (mean 6 SEM/n = 17, by flowcytometry)), measured by flowcytometry and immunohistochemistry, and the presence of non-activated eosinophils found <b>in</b> <b>BE</b> by immunohistochemical staining, were not different from that found in duodenal tissue. Expanded lymphocytes from these tissues had a similar phenotype, characterized by a comparable but low percentage of aE(CD 103) positive CD 4 + cells (4465 % <b>in</b> <b>BE,</b> 4364 % <b>in</b> duodenum of <b>BE</b> and 3467 % in duodenum of controls) and a similar percentage of granzyme-B + CD 8 + cells(4465 % <b>in</b> <b>BE,</b> 3366 % <b>in</b> duodenum of <b>BE</b> and 3667 % in duodenum of controls).
