5|$|As Bonnie {{moved through}} the Bahamas, {{residents}} stocked up on food and water as a precautionary measure; however, no major preparations took place. Most businesses remained open during the system's passage and schools were already closed for the summer. Throughout the islands, the effects from Bonnie were relatively minimal. Heavy rain <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> a few islands and copious lightning was reported. No known damage or loss of life took place.|$|E
5|$|As Julia never posed any {{significant}} threat to land, damage {{related to the}} storm was minimal. Trace amounts of rain reportedly <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> the Cape Verde islands, causing locally light flooding and minor inconveniences. Gusts battering the territory peaked at 30mph (48km/h), resulting in some wind damage to crops. In addition, these winds produced rough sea conditions, and high waves posed few threats along coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Audrey {{directed}} moisture up to a {{front to}} its north across the Midwest during late June 1957 as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Heavy rains <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> central Illinois, {{leading to the}} wettest known event {{to be associated with}} a tropical cyclone or its remains across Illinois.|$|E

50|$|In Texas, winds {{as high as}} 95 mph caused {{extensive}} damage to homes and businesses, resulting in roughly $100 million in damage. Numerous trees were <b>felled</b> <b>across</b> the region and a few structures were destroyed. In Dallas County, a few carports collapsed. Near Venus, 82 mph winds damaged five homes.|$|R
5|$|September 25–26, 1997: After making {{landfall}} in Baja California, Hurricane Nora maintained {{tropical storm}} status into California and Arizona. Moderate to heavy rains <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> southeast California and Arizona, {{with a new}} 24-hour maximum for Arizona (305mm (12inches) falling in the Mogollon Rim). Damage totaled several hundred million, including $40million (1997 USD) to lemon trees. There were a few indirect deaths caused by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Paine brought rainfall {{to most of}} Mexico, including heavier amounts along the coastline and interior northern Oaxaca. The highest total in the country was 12.01inches (30.5cm) in Apazulco, Jalisco. Light precipitation fell in the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, and where Paine moved ashore, upwards of 7inches (18cm) <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> its path. In the area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked down trees and caused disruptions to city services.|$|E
5|$|It {{was another}} 12 {{minutes before the}} {{collapse}} occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be held back. The roof, girders and debris <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> four passenger trains, blocking all tracks. The part of the western wall that fell had crashed through the wall and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorms {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Isis dropped more than two inches (50mm) of rainfall across southern Arizona, resulting in some flash flood warnings and flooding on roadways. The heaviest precipitation <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> the Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains near Tucson, which saw precipitation amounts of up to three inches (75mm). Otherwise, no flooding {{was reported in the}} Tucson area, and the Tucson International Airport reported only 1.1inches (28mm) {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Although Hurricane Marco {{never made}} landfall, {{it was a}} large storm with an unusual and erratic path and as a result, caused heavy {{rainfall}} throughout Central America and the western Caribbean nations. In the Dominican Republic, three people drowned north of Santo Domingo, while 200families fled their homes during the flooding. Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica, which had already caused a total of $3million in damage to roads and left 170families without shelter. After significant damage from Hurricane Lili in the previous month, minimal effects occurred in Cuba. Large amounts of precipitation also <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> Cuba, especially on the Isle of Youth and in Pinar del Río Province. Heavy rains caused thousands to flee their homes. However, damage in the country, if any is unknown.|$|E
5|$|As a disorganized {{tropical}} cyclone {{in the northeastern}} Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as a foot of rain <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity {{as a result of}} heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50mph (85km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{resistance}} now became severe. The telegraph wires {{had been}} cut, taken {{down from the}} poles, and twisted about the road; and trees had also been <b>felled</b> <b>across</b> it. While we were endeavouring to clear away the obstacles, a heavy fire was poured into us. Small parties were therefore sent out to disperse the enemy, and this they did most successfully, capturing three guns {{and a good deal}} of ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Dore {{has come}} into the public {{spotlight}} concerning the mass tree <b>felling</b> <b>across</b> Sheffield {{as part of the}} controversial Streets Ahead programme. As part of the £2 billion partnership with Amey Plc, up to 10,000 mature and healthy street trees across Sheffield are to be felled. Campaigners have shown that this mass deforestation makes road maintenance and resurfacing cheaper over the 25-year contract, and helps corporate profit {{at the expense of the}} environment.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isidore was {{the ninth}} named storm {{and the second}} {{hurricane}} in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore was the fifth of eight named storms to occur in September. The tropical cyclone peaked as a Category 3 hurricane, causing damage as well as four fatalities in Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States. Isidore is noted for threatening to strike the northern Gulf Coast as a Category4 hurricane, but instead striking as a moderate tropical storm due to a track change that brought the storm over the Yucatán Peninsula for over a day, which significantly weakened the cyclone. Its primary impact was the heavy rainfall which <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> southeast Mexico and from the central United States Gulf coast into the Ohio Valley.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, Lin passed {{directly}} over Tonga with winds up to 110km/h (70mph) and heavy rains. Initial reports of damage stated that only vegetation had been impacted. However, later reports stated that power lines had been knocked down by high winds {{and the heavy}} rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa. Some houses lost their rain gutters from the storm. Due to strong winds, officials were forced to shut down power stations in Tongatapu to protect the system. Most of the power lines in Tonga were either downed or damaged by the storm and numerous trees <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> the island. Several roads were also blocked by downed trees and billboards were broken. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{damage was}} minimal {{as a result}} of Katrina. Only a few small mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America. It was {{estimated}} that between 10 and 15inches (250 to 375mm) of rain <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> parts of the region {{as a result of}} Katrina, with one report of 3.58inches (91mm) in six hours from the island of San Andrés east of Nicaragua. Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Aguán and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina. The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Aguán.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this amount of precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in Manatee County.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{amounts of}} 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> {{the states of}} Jalisco and Nayarit. This {{rainfall}} caused one fatality in Jalisco after a mudslide fell on 10houses, killing one of the occupants. Five {{people were killed in}} Puebla by landslides, and one more was crushed after a wall on his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while doing roof repairs. In Michoacán, a man was struck by lightning under a tree in the outer bands of the storm, and two people died in Hidalgo when the roof collapsed in their house. Hurricane Dean killed 12people in Mexico but remarkably no one was killed by its first (and catastrophically powerful) landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Between the two landfalls damages, focused mainly in the agricultural sector, totaled Mex$2.05billion (US$160million).|$|E

5|$|Traveling {{towards the}} northeast, Conson headed towards Okinawa where schools {{were closed and}} local {{transportation}} was disrupted due to the storm. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents about the threat of heavy rains and high winds resulting from the storm. A United States naval base located in Okinawa was placed under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCR) Four as Typhoon Conson was approaching. As the storm neared the islands, the naval base was put under TCCR Three, indicating that winds of 92km/h (57mph) were anticipated within 48hours. Ahead of the storm, upwards of 254mm (10in) <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> the islands, which were indirectly related to the storm. In southern Japan, several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} <b>fell</b> <b>across</b> the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding {{along the}} Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E

50|$|Aucouturier {{was one of}} {{the four}} leading riders disqualified at the end in a race so chaotic that Henri Desgrange swore he would never run another. The Tour had been bedevilled by protesters, some of who {{attacked}} riders, and by trees <b>felled</b> <b>across</b> the road. So frequent were accusations of cheating among riders, including claims that some had taken a train, that on 30 November 1904 the Union Vélocipédique de France disqualified Maurice Garin, Lucien Pothier, César Garin and Aucouturier, who had taken the first four places. Victory went to Henri Cornet, the youngest rider to win.|$|R
