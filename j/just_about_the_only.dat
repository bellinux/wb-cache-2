500|$|To {{celebrate}} Neighbours 25th anniversary, Sky included Nina {{in their}} list of the twenty-five most memorable Neighbours characters. They stated, [...] "Nina represents <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> recognisable name from the lost years of Neighbours in the early noughties, {{as one of the}} least successful groups of teens in the programme's history. Remember Lori? Or Michelle? Or, Lord help us, Taj? In the absence of any usable characters, the writers did that always uncomfortable thing of letting a character get up and sing on screen. Repeatedly." [...] They described her most memorable scenes as being discovered singing by Harold, her mother's marriage to Lou, and her relationship with Jack.|$|E
500|$|Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly {{noted the}} song was one of Destiny Fulfilleds [...] "nice bits here and there", adding, [...] "the pillow-talky pandering of 'Cater 2 U'... is hard to resist." [...] AllMusic's writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{included}} [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{as one of the}} highlights on the album. Slant Magazine writer Eric Henderson opined, [...] "But <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> element of the whole album that really sticks is the Laura Bush-worthy domestic complacency of 'Cater 2 U,' in which the trio espouses their joy in total submission." [...] Dimitri Ehrlich from Vibe magazine found that [...] "the sexy trio is far more believable on the seductive R ballad 'Cater 2 U,' in which they set the feminist movement back more than a century over the course of four minutes". Andy Battaglia writing for The A.V. Club felt that the song and [...] "Soldier" [...] "make sassy end-runs around notions of womanly subservience, but their best musical moments hide in tiny melismatic twirls instead of hooks". The Guardians Caroline Sullivan wrote that [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was one of the songs that showcased [...] "the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically". In a review of Love Songs, Amanda Koellner from the website Consequence of Sound described [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] as a [...] "sleek" [...] album opener. Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine hailed the song [...] "sexy" [...] while USA Todays Elysa Gardner felt it was more [...] "gently sensuous". Rebecca Thomas from MTV News felt that the song differentiated from the trio's other material and added [...] "While the Third Wave set may have side-eyed the gushy ballad, male fans eagerly welcomed [...] ".|$|E

5000|$|Binghamton is {{constantly}} trying to [...] "get the goods" [...] on [...] "McHale and his pirates" [...] {{to send them}} to prison or get them transferred, and he comes close <b>just</b> <b>about</b> all <b>the</b> time, <b>only</b> to have McHale's crew get out of trouble, usually by having some kind of military success, through some form of blackmail (such as telling the admiral what really happened), or because Binghamton wants some kind of a favor from McHale. When he isn't complaining about McHale and his crew to his superiors Binghamton constantly tries to impress superior officers, VIPs, or people with connections for personal gain - which usually backfires, making him look foolish. As a running gag, Binghamton is forever being knocked down (usually by Parker or Carpenter) or covered with something messy (also usually because of Parker). Blind without his glasses, Binghamton also has his glasses knocked or taken off (to keep him from seeing something) a number of times. Occasionally, he is seen throwing darts at a picture of McHale.|$|R

500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion is <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even {{a glimmer of}} a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him {{the kind of man}} characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
