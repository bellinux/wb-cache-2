40|$|Extract] We are {{concerned}} that the Northern Territory’s regulations on <b>kava</b> have not succeeded in controlling its availability in Arnhem Land (the north-eastern region of the NT). Under the <b>Kava</b> Management Act 1998 (NT), one wholesaler is licensed to supply <b>kava</b> (Piper methysticum Forst. f.) to four licensed retailers in Arnhem Land Aboriginal communities. “Kava Management Plans” in “Kava Licence Areas” permit retailers to supply 600 – 800 g per week of <b>kava</b> powder to each purchaser — more than double the known harmful consumption levels (240 – 440 g per week). Legal <b>kava</b> supplied will reach 26 tonnes in 2005 (worth 3. 6 million), with a persistent illegal trade adding 8 tonnes, worth perhaps 2 million. Two proposed additional retail licences 1 will increase <b>kava’s</b> availability. <b>Kava’s</b> social and economic effects remain an ongoing concern.

40|$|Kava-induced liver injury {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in a few patients worldwide {{and appears to be}} caused by inappropriate quality of the <b>kava</b> raw material. When cases of liver disease in connection with the use of <b>kava</b> emerged, this was an unexpected and challenging event considering the long tradition of safe <b>kava</b> use. In order to prevent <b>kava</b> hepatotoxicity in future, a set of quality specifications as standard is essential for the preparation not only of <b>kava</b> drugs and <b>kava</b> dietary supplements in the Western world but also for traditional <b>kava</b> drinks in the South Pacific Islands. For all these purposes a uniform approach is required, using water based extracts from the peeled rhizomes and roots of a noble cultivar such as Borogu with at least 5 years of age at the time of harvest. Cultivated in Vanuatu for centuries, noble varieties (as defined in the Vanuatu <b>Kava</b> Act of December 2002) are well tolerated traditional cultivars with a good safety record. At present, Vanuatu <b>kava</b> legislation is inadequately enforced to meet quality issues for <b>kava,</b> and further efforts are required in Vanuatu, in addition to similar legislation in other <b>kava</b> producing South Pacific Islands. Future regulatory and commercial strategies should focus not only on the standardization of <b>kava</b> drugs, <b>kava</b> dietary supplements, and traditional <b>kava</b> extracts, but also on thorough surveillance during the manufacturing process to improve <b>kava</b> quality for safe human use. The efficacy of <b>kava</b> extracts to treat patients with anxiety disorders is well supported, but further clinical trials with aqueous <b>kava</b> extracts are necessary. We thereby propose a six-point <b>kava</b> solution plan: (1) use of a noble <b>kava</b> cultivar such as Borogu, at least 5 years old at time of harvest, (2) use of peeled and dried rhizomes and roots, (3) aqueous extraction, (4) dosage recommendation of ? 250 mg kavalactones per day (for medicinal use), (5) systematic rigorous future research, and (6) a Pan Pacific quality control system enforced by strict policing. In conclusion, at different levels of responsibility, new mandatory approaches are now required to implement quality specification for international acceptance of <b>kava</b> as a safe and effective anxiolytic herb.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 75 - 81). xvii, 81 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmKava is a shrubby herb {{that has}} been used for centuries by the Pacific Island societies as a ceremonial, medicinal, social and recreational beverage. <b>Kava,</b> in the form of aqueous drinks prepared from rhizome and root, was considered "safe" with only mild but reversible adverse effects. However, between 1990 and 2001, there were 82 case reports of severe liver toxicity and even a few deaths among patients consuming <b>kava</b> extract preparations. Due to the continued usage of <b>kava</b> in the U. S. as well as its importance in the Pacific Islands, it is essential to delineate any negative effects that may occur with <b>kava</b> intake. <b>Kava</b> stem peelings, which contain high amounts of the cytotoxic alkaloid pipermethystine (PM), were reportedly incorporated into commercial extract preparations and were hypothesized to have contributed to the toxic effects of <b>kava</b> observed in humans. PM was shown induced oxidative stress and cell death in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG 2, while the active components of the <b>kava</b> plant called kavalactones (KL) failed to induce any changes. However, 10 -week treatment of PM (2 mg/kg) and <b>kava</b> stem peeling extract (8. 7 Smg/kg) in CS 7 BL 6 mice failed to induce liver toxicity. Short term administration of PM (10 mg/kg) and acetonic <b>kava</b> extracts (100 mg/kg), individually and in combination, also failed to induce liver toxicity in F- 344. However, an initial antioxidant stress response was noted in addition to increased CYP 4 S 0 enzyme expression. From the data obtained, <b>kava</b> toxicity observed in humans are likely due to a number of factors including drug interactions rather than direct liver toxicity from PM and kavalactones alone...|$|R

5000|$|Recent {{publications}} also {{confirm that}} noble <b>kava</b> roots {{appear to be}} safe and that the previously reported rare cases of hepatotoxicity were in most cases likely related to rare allergic reactions or the poor quality of the plant material, including unsuitable cultivars or parts of the plant and plants affected by mold. [...] As such, aside from [...] "the small number of cases of <b>kava</b> hepatotoxicity might have been due to an idiosyncratic reaction of the metabolic type", [...] "liver injury by <b>kava</b> is basically a preventable disease".

The use of these cultivars in the manufacturing of kava-based pharmaceutical products is undesirable due to their very different phytochemistry and relatively high concentrations of potentially harmful compounds (flavokavains). While other ("noble") cultivars also contain these compounds, toxicity seems to be triggered only at relatively high concentrations, too high to be of relevance with the use of noble <b>kava</b> or its corresponding extract preparations".

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe parameters for use in monitoring health, social and economic effects of <b>kava</b> use in Arnhem Land Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory (NT). <b>Kava</b> has been used mainly in eight communities (population > 200), and in smaller associated homeland areas since 1982 with a total population of approximately 6800, using cross-sectional description and comparison using data from three kava-using communities. Interview data combined with health worker assessments were compiled using: (1) a sample (n = 136) aged 16 – 34 years in one community in 2001 – 02; (2) a sample (n = 101) aged 16 years and over in 2000 where physical assessments and biochemical and haematological data were also collected; (3) participant-observation in one community (133 people aged 18 years and over) during 1989 – 91. <b>Kava,</b> supplied illegally, was still being used in Arnhem Land in 2001 – 02. In 2000 dermopathy characteristic of heavy use, abnormally low body mass index (BMI), low blood lymphocytes and abnormally high γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) occurred more frequently with increased <b>kava</b> use. These acute effects emerge at average consumption levels of from 310 – 440 g/week of <b>kava</b> powder. When <b>kava</b> users in one community began to consume it at an average of 240 – 425 g/week from mid- 1990, 19 % of available cash resources were spent on <b>kava</b> with 11 % of cash resources leaving the local community economy.

40|$|Introduction. Hepatic {{toxicity}} from manufactured {{herbal remedies}} that contain <b>kava</b> lactones {{has been reported}} in Europe, North America, and Australia. There is no evidence for serious liver damage in kava-using populations in Pacific Island societies or in Indigenous Australians who have used aqueous <b>kava</b> extracts. This article presents evidence that liver function changes in users of aqueous <b>kava</b> extracts appear to be reversible. Data from one Arnhem Land community [Northern Territory (NT), Australia] with 340 indigenous people older than 15 years of age in 2000 are used. Methods. This study was a cross-sectional study with 98 participants, 36 of whom had never used <b>kava.</b> Among 62 <b>kava</b> users, 23 had discontinued <b>kava</b> at least 1 year before the study. Continuing users had not used <b>kava</b> for 1 to 2 months (n = 10) or 1 to 2 weeks previously (n = 15). Some (n = 14) had used <b>kava</b> within the previous 24 hr. Liver function tests were compared across these groups, taking into account differences due to age, sex, alcohol, and other substance use. Results. The average quantity of <b>kava</b> powder consumed was 118 g/week, and median duration of use was 12 years (range, 1 - 18 years). <b>Kava</b> usage levels were less than one-half of those found in previous studies. More recent <b>kava</b> use was independently associated with higher levels of liver enzymes gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (p < 0. 001) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p < 0. 001), but not with alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin, which were not elevated. In those who were not heavy alcohol users, only those who used <b>kava</b> within the previous 24 hr showed GGT levels higher than nonusers (p < 0. 001), whereas higher ALP levels occurred only in those who last used <b>kava</b> 1 to 2 weeks (p = 0. 015) and 24 hr previously (p = 0. 005). Discussion. Liver function changes in users of aqueous <b>kava</b> extracts at these moderate levels of consumption appear to be reversible and begin to return to baseline after 1 to 2 weeks abstinence from <b>kava.</b> No evidence for irreversible liver damage has been found...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Kava</b> (Piper methysticum), a {{traditional}} and culturally significant Pacific Island beverage, produces soporific relaxant effects similar to Benzodiazepine (Sarris et al, 2012, Journal of Human Psychopharmacology Clinical and Experimental, 27 : 262 - 9). Traditional users consume this drink at volumes 32 {{times greater than}} pharmacologically recommended doses (Aporosa et al, 2014, Anthropologica, 56 : 163 - 75), with reports suggesting 70 % of users frequently drive following <b>kava</b> use (Maneze et al, 2008, Australian & New Zealand Journal Of Public Health, 32 : 314 - 6). Prompted by concerns regarding driver impairment post <b>kava</b> use, this seminal research investigated the effects of <b>kava</b> on two cognitive functions related to driving. Research was based on {{a traditional}}ly influenced <b>kava</b> session. Methods: <b>Kava</b> consumers (n= 20 [18 male/ 2 females], mean age = 35. 35) attended a six hour <b>kava</b> session, each drinking an average 3. 52 litres (SD = 0. 713 litres) of <b>kava.</b> Also present were a non-kava consuming control group (n= 20 [18 male/ 2 females], mean age = 35. 1). At baseline all participants completed computerised tests (Vienna Test System: Traffic WAFA Alertness and WAFG Divided Attention) to assess reaction time, perception and attention. Re-testing was conducted hourly over the six hour period. Pre/post analysis was conducted comparing within person and between group change. Statistical modelling is based on ANOVA and independent t-tests. Results: Data analysis indicated no statistically significant (p< 0. 05) difference between reaction time [F=(13, 264), 0. 582, p= 0. 868] and divided attention [F=(13, 264), 0. 834, p= 0. 624] both within person and between groups at any measurement point over the six hour testing period. Mean reaction time and divided attention at baseline was 249. 95 msec (SD= 37. 57) and 583. 58 msec (SD= 226. 62) respectively. The control and active group mean reaction times at the final test were 256. 70 msec (SD= 36. 86) and 271. 8 msec (SD= 46. 32) respectively. The mean divided attention times for the control and active groups at the final test were 499. 75 msec (SD= 167. 62) and 568. 32 msec (SD= 217. 71). Conclusions: <b>Kava</b> at traditional consumption volumes was not correlated to response latency or impairment on perception and attention tasks. Further research beyond the assessment of these two cognitive functions is required to better understand if <b>kava</b> has any effect on driver ability.
