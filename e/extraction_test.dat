Data of single <b>extraction</b> <b>tests</b> using Coca-Cola Classic®, Diet Coke® and Coke Zero® demonstrate that extractable arsenic, copper, lanthanum, manganese, nickel, yttrium and zinc concentrations correlate significantly with DTPA- and CaCl 2 -extractable metals.

Also, Coca-Cola Classic® extracts uranium concentrations near identical to DTPA, whereas distinctly higher uranium fractions were extracted using Diet Coke® and Coke Zero®.

40|$|When a waste fly ash, {{containing}} {{large amounts}} of As 2 O 3, is solidified using cement and lime, the arsenic concentration in the leachate (<b>extraction</b> <b>test</b> DW 38 414 S 4) {{is determined by the}} solubility of CaHAsO 3 and can be lowered to a value of ca. 5 mg/l, in a saturated solution of Ca(OH) (2). One of the criteria for landfilling of hazardous waste is, however, that the arsenic concentration in the leachate must be lower than 1 mg/l. In this paper, it is shown that oxidation of the waste before solidification, whereby As(III) is oxidised to As(V) using H 2 O 2, lowers the leaching of arsenic, and other contaminants, from the solidified product. With the speciation program MINTEQA 2, it is calculated that the solubility of As(V) {{in the presence of a}} pure Ca- 3 (AsO 4) (2) precipitate is lower than the solubility of As(III) in the presence of a pure CaHAsO 3 precipitate. The arsenic concentration in the presence of both a Ca(OH) (2) and a Ca- 3 (AsO 4) (2) precipitate can even be lowered to 0. 47 mg/l (pH 12. 5). The As concentration in the leachate of the <b>extraction</b> <b>test</b> on an oxidised S/S sample was indeed lowered to ca. 0. 5 mg/l, which is a reduction by a factor of 10 compared to the concentration of ca. 5 mg/l, obtained in the leachate of the <b>extraction</b> <b>test</b> on a non-oxidised S/S sample. This is in very good agreement with the calculated value of 0. 47 mg/l.

The Rigging Test Bed is a test venue being constructed to perform verification and validation of this <b>extraction</b> process. The <b>test</b> bed consists of a long pneumatic piston device capable of providing a constant force simulating the ballute drag force during the extraction events. The <b>extraction</b> <b>tests</b> will take place both inside a high-bay for frequent <b>tests</b> of individual <b>extraction</b> stages and outdoors using a mobile hydraulic crane for complete deployment tests from initial pack pull out to canopy <b>extraction.</b> These <b>tests</b> will measure line tensions and use photogrammetry to track motion of the elements involved. The resulting data will be used to verify packing and rigging as well, as validate models and identify potential failure modes in order to finalize the design of the extraction system...|$|R
