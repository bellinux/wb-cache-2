40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the most relevant}} environmental antimotivation determinants of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> in pedagogical university students. An original questionnaire on antimotivation in <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> designed for students and developed {{on the basis of}} the environmental approach for pedagogical higher education institutions is represented in the article. The components of educational environment are considered as environmental antimotivation determinants of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> in pedagogical university students: spatial and objective one, psychodidactic, social and subjective components, as well as microenvironment (the family environment) and macroenvironment (society as a whole). According to the results of research, the psycho-didactic component of the educational environment of a higher education institution has been found to be a statistically more pronounced antimotivation determinant of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> in pedagogical university students. It has been proved that all environmental antimotivation determinants of <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> singled out in students are in direct correlation dependence. For respondents, <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> antimotives conditioned by psycho-didactic component of the educational environment of the university are of uniform significance, which has been determined on the basis of dispersion calculation...|$|R

40|$|One of very {{important}} competences of nurses is <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> This research {{is focused on}} the <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> pursued by nurses in isolation wards [...] how the nurses perform the <b>educational</b> <b>activity,</b> in what manners the activity is conducted and what problems inhibit nurses from performing the activity. It also examines clients awareness and their opinions on the information provided by nurses. The objective of the thesis was to ascertain implementation of the educational process in isolation wards [...] to ascertain clients awareness of the care of their health in isolation wards and to ascertain preparedness of nurses to perform the <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> In order to fulfill this objective and to confirm hypotheses, a quantitative research using the method of examination through questionnaires was applied. Two questionnaires were drawn up: one for the recipients of the <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> [...] patients/clients and the other one for the providers of the <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> [...] nurses. The examination through questionnaires was undertaken by 177 informants of which 96 were patients/clients and 81 nurses. The data were processed by way of the descriptive statistics using diagrams. The research was conducted in five hospitals. Three hypotheses were raised. Nurses working in isolation wards perform the <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> Clients of isolation wards are informed about the care for their health. A general nurse of an isolation ward possesses skills to perform the educational role. All the three hypotheses have been confirmed {{on the basis of the}} implementation and the analysis of the research. It follows from the data analysis that the <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> pursued by nurses is important. A positive finding is that the nurses working in isolation wards implement the educational process, feel the need of further training in the area of education and communication, and are interested in application of their competences also in particular areas of the work with HIV-positive clients and with the clients suffering from chronic infectious hepatitis. It is obvious from the research that the objectives that had been set have been attained. It is necessary to address the topic henceforth since some problems have appeared in the educational process, hindering nurses from performing the <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> These are insufficient spatial, time and material conditions that can be solved through the proposed organizational and personnel measures...|$|R

Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other <b>educational</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the German closure and censorship of Polish schools, resistance among teachers led almost immediately {{to the creation of}} large-scale underground <b>educational</b> <b>activities.</b> Most notably, the Secret Teaching Organization (Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska, TON) was created as early as in October 1939. Other organizations were created locally; after 1940 they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the TON, working closely with the Underground's State Department of Culture and Education, which was created in autumn 1941 and headed by Czesław Wycech, creator of the TON. Classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues. By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in underground primary education; in 1944, its secondary school system covered 100,000 people, and university level courses were attended by about 10,000 students (for comparison, the pre-war enrollment at Polish universities was about 30,000 for the 1938/1939 year). More than 90,000 secondary-school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly 6,000 teachers between 1943 and 1944 in four districts of the General Government (centered on the cities of Warsaw, Kraków, Radom and Lublin). Overall, in that period in the General Government, one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations; the number rose to about 70% for children old enough to attend secondary school. It is estimated that in some rural areas, the educational coverage was actually improved (most likely as courses were being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities). Compared to pre-war classes, the absence of Polish Jewish students was notable, as they were confined by the Nazi Germans to ghettos; there was, however, underground Jewish education in the ghettos, often organized with support from Polish organizations like TON. Students at the underground schools were often also members of the Polish resistance.|$|E

In order to provide personalization, an adaptation engine adapts the <b>educational</b> <b>activity</b> and the infrastructure according to the context.
