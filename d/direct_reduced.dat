5000|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} {{steelmaking}} is {{the manufacture of}} steel from scrap or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> iron melted by electric arcs. In an electric arc furnace, a batch of steel ("heat") may be started by loading scrap or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> iron into the furnace, sometimes with a [...] "hot heel" [...] (molten steel from a previous heat). Gas burners {{may be used to}} assist with the melt down of the scrap pile in the furnace. As in basic oxygen steelmaking, fluxes are also added to protect the lining of the vessel and help improve the removal of impurities. Electric arc furnace steelmaking typically uses furnaces of capacity around 100 tonnes that produce steel every 40 to 50 minutes for further processing.|$|E

50|$|Reduced iron derives {{its name}} from the {{chemical}} change that iron ore undergoes when it is heated in a furnace at high temperatures in the presence of hydrocarbon-rich gases, carbon monoxide, or elementary carbon. Direct reduction refers to processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting point of iron.

40|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} {{comes at a}} cost, which can be either <b>direct</b> (<b>reducing</b> resources available for growth and reproduction) or indirect (through reducing ecological performance, for example intraspecific competitiveness). While direct costs have been well studied in theoretical models, ecological costs have received almost no attention. In this study we compare models with a <b>direct</b> trade-off (<b>reduced</b> growth rate) to models with an ecological trade-off (reduced competitive ability), {{using a combination of}} adaptive dynamics and simulations. In addition, we study the dependence of the level of defense that can evolve on the type of defense (directly by reducing consumption, or indirectly by inducing herbivore mortality (toxicity)), and on the type of herbivore against which the plant is defending itself (generalists or specialists). We find three major results: First, for both direct and ecological costs, defense only evolves if the benefit to the plant is <b>direct</b> (through <b>reducing</b> consumption). Second, the type of cost has a major effect on the evolutionary dynamics: direct costs always lead to a single optimal strategy against herbivores, but ecological costs can lead to branching and the coexistence of non-defending and defending plants; however, coexistence is only possible when defending against generalist herbivores. Finally, we find that fast-growing plants invest less than slow-growing plants when defending against generalist herbivores, as predicted by the Resource Availability Hypothesis, but invest more than slow-growing plants when defending against specialists. Our results clearly show that assumptions about ecological interactions are crucial for understanding the evolution of defense against herbivores...|$|R

50|$|Modern {{steelmaking}} processes can {{be divided}} into two categories: Primary and Secondary steelmaking. Primary steelmaking involves converting liquid iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap into steel via basic oxygen steelmaking or melting scrap steel and/or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> iron (DRI) in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking involves refining of the crude steel before casting and the various operations are normally carried out in ladles. In secondary metallurgy, alloying agents are added, dissolved gases in the steel are lowered, and inclusions are removed or altered chemically to ensure that high-quality steel is produced after casting.|$|E

50|$|The HIsarna {{ironmaking}} {{process is}} a <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> iron process for iron making in which iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron or hot metal. The process combines two process units, the Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) for ore melting and pre-reduction and a Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV) where the final reduction stage to liquid iron takes place. The process {{does not require the}} manufacturing of iron ore agglomerates such as pellets and sinter, nor the production of coke, which are necessary for the blast furnace process. Without these steps, the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional ironmaking processes.|$|E
