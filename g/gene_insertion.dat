40|$|A dynamic flux balance model {{based on}} a genome-scale {{metabolic}} network reconstruction is developed for in silico analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism and ethanol production in fed-batch culture. Metabolic engineering strategies previously identified for their enhanced steady-state biomass and/or ethanol yields are evaluated for fed-batch performance in glucose and glucose/xylose media. Dynamic analysis is shown to provide a single quantitative measure of fed-batch ethanol productivity that explicitly handles the possible tradeoff between the biomass and ethanol yields. Productivity optimization conducted to rank achievable fed-batch performance demonstrates that the genetic manipulation strategy and the fed-batch operating policy should be considered simultaneously. A library of candidate <b>gene</b> <b>insertions</b> is assembled and directly screened for their achievable ethanol productivity in fed-batch culture. A number of novel <b>gene</b> <b>insertions</b> with ethanol productivities identical to the best metabolic engineering strategies reported in previous studies are identified, thereby providing additional targets for experimental evaluation. The top performing <b>gene</b> <b>insertions</b> were substrate dependent, with the highest ranked insertions for glucose media yielding suboptimal performance in glucose/xylose media. The analysis results suggest that enhancements in biomass yield are most beneficial for the enhancement of fed-batch ethanol productivity by recombinant xylose utilizing yeast strains. We conclude that steady-state flux balance analysis {{is not sufficient to}} predict fed-batch performance and that the media, genetic manipulations, and fed-batch operating policy should be considered simultaneously to achieve optimal metabolite productivity...|$|R

To test this, we analyzed the expression of 112 precisely-mapped, testis-specific reporter <b>gene</b> <b>insertions</b> along the X chromosome. All of the reporter <b>gene</b> <b>insertions</b> showed low levels of expression that were significantly less than those of autosomal insertions, suggesting that the X chromosome is globally inactivated {{in the male}} germ line.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} methods of genetic engineering, minichromosomes {{can be used to}} transfer and express multiple sets of genes onto one engineered chromosome package Traditional methods which involve the insertion of novel genes into existing sequences may result in the disruption of endogenous genes and thus negatively affect the host cell.

50|$|Site {{directed}} mutagenesis {{is a valuable}} technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene. The basics of this technique involve the preparation of a primer {{that will be a}} complementary strand to a wild type bacterial plasmid. This primer will have a base pair mismatch at the site where the replacement is desired. The primer must also be long enough such that the primer will anneal to the wild type plasmid. After the primer anneals, a DNA polymerase will complete the primer. When the bacterial plasmid is replicated, the mutated strand will be replicated as well. The same technique can be used to create a <b>gene</b> <b>insertion</b> or deletion. Often, an antibiotic resistant gene is inserted along with the modification of interest and the bacteria are cultured on an antibiotic medium. The bacteria that were not successfully mutated will not survive on this medium, and the mutated bacteria can easily be cultured.|$|E
50|$|Virus insertional {{mutagenesis}} is possible with both replication competent virus and the self-inactivating vectors that {{are commonly used}} in gene therapy. The virus inserts a gene (known as a viral onocogene) normally near the cellular myc (c-myc)gene. The c-myc gene is normally turned off in the cell; however when it is turned on {{it is able to}} push the cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle and cause the cell to begin replication, causing unchecked cell proliferation while allowing the viral gene to be replicated. After many replications where the viral gene stays latent tumours begin to grow. These tumours are normally derived from one mutated/transformed cell (clonal in origin). Avian leukosis virus {{is an example of a}} virus that causes a disease by {{insertional mutagenesis}}. Newly hatched chicks infected with Avian leukosis virus will begin to form tumours that will begin to appear in their bursa of fabricus (like the human thymus).
