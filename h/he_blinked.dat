5000|$|Michael Irby as Tommy Molinari / Pokerface - An {{associate}} of Scales who {{took on the}} moniker because <b>he</b> never <b>blinks</b> {{as a result of}} a gunshot wound to the head, lodging a bullet in his brain.

Vince once managed to replace his eye drops with turpentine and in retaliation Pokerface suggested Scales use acid on Vince when later they captured him.|$|R
