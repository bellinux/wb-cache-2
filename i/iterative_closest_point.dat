Combining {{information}} from multi-modal vascular images is an effective and efficient way to diagnose and monitor atherosclerosis, in which image registration is a key technique. In this paper a feature-based registration algorithm, Two-step Auto-labeling Conditional <b>Iterative</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>Points</b> (TACICP) algorithm, is proposed to align three-dimensional carotid image datasets from ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR). Based on 2 D segmented contours, a coarse-to-fine strategy is employed with two steps: rigid initialization step and non-rigid refinement step. Conditional <b>Iterative</b> <b>Closest</b> <b>Points</b> (CICP) algorithm is given in rigid initialization step to obtain the robust rigid transformation and label configurations. Then the labels and CICP algorithm with non-rigid thin-plate-spline (TPS) transformation model is introduced to solve non-rigid carotid deformation between different body positions. The results demonstrate that proposed TACICP algorithm has achieved an average registration error of less than 0. 2 mm with no failure case, which is superior to the state-of-the-art feature-based methods...|$|R

In previous works, we presented a 6 D SLAM algorithm which is based on the spatial data from the AIS 3 D Laser Scanner and a variant of the <b>iterative</b> <b>closest</b> <b>points</b> algorithm (ICP). In this paper we focused on the reachable accuracy of the whole approach and therefore performed several ground truth experiments. We will show that the 6 D SLAM algorithm can compensate for erroneous data of the 3 D laser scanner, at least in a limited range. Furthermore we will discuss different aspects which influences the accuracy of our approach...|$|R

The approach {{consists of three}} steps: rigid registration, facial model reconstruction, and facial expression tracking. A Scaling <b>Iterative</b> <b>Closest</b> <b>Points</b> (SICP) algorithm is introduced to compute the optimal rigid registration between a template facial model and a range scan with consideration of the scale problem. A deformable model, physically based on thin shells, is proposed to faithfully reconstruct the facial surface and texture from that range data.

The algorithm iteratively revises the transformation (combination of translation and rotation) needed to minimize an error metric, usually {{the distance from the}} source to the reference point cloud.

40|$|Abstract. A {{fundamental}} problem when building a statistical shape model (SSM) is the correspondence problem. We present an approach for unstructured point sets where one-to-one correspondences {{are replaced by}} correspondence probabilities between shapes which are determined using the Expectation Maximization- <b>Iterative</b> <b>Closest</b> <b>Points</b> registration. We propose a unified MAP framework to compute the model parameters which leads to an optimal adaption of the model to the observations. The optimization of the MAP explanation {{with respect to the}} observation and the generative model parameters leads to very efficient and closed-form solutions for (almost) all parameters. Experimental results on synthetic data and brain structures as well as a performance comparison with a statistical shape model built on one-to-one correspondences show the efficiency and advantages of this approach. ...|$|R

Traditional <b>iterative</b> <b>closest</b> <b>points</b> (ICP) algorithms, which rely on rigid-body alignment, fail in these cases because the error appears as a non-rigid warp in the data. Our algorithm combines the robustness and efficiency of ICP with the expressiveness of thin-plate splines to align high-resolution scanned data accurately, such as scans from the Digital Michelangelo Project [14]. This application is distinguished from previous uses of the thin-plate spline {{by the fact that the}} resolution and size of warping are several orders of magnitude smaller than the extent of the mesh, thus requiring especially precise feature correspondence. 1...|$|R
