Two original experiments E 421 and E 679 with a H 20 -CO 2 fluid {{were carried out}} at 835 K, 200 MPa, over 38 days, and at 856 K, 211 MPa, over 35 days, respectively. In both experiments homogeneous three-phase (a vapor and two liquids) {{fluid inclusions}} were synthesized with 22 and 20 mol % COZ, respectively. The CO 2 phases homogenize to the vapor phase at 302. 2 + 0. 1 K (E 679, cores 1 and 2), and to the liquid phase at 303. 6 f 0. 3 K (E 421, core 3), 303. 9 rt 0. 2 K (E 421, core 4). The C 02 -Hz 0 phases homogenize to the vapor phase at 573. 6 + 0. 4 K (E 679, core 1 and 2), 575. 6 + 1. 5 K (E 421, core 3), and 576. 1 * 0. 8 K (E 421, core 4). Micro cracks and the new hydrothermally precipitated quartz, which directly surrounds the inclusions, were studied with TEM and SEM. The healed cracks have numerous growth imperfections that provide many possible routes for fluid transport. Dislocation arrays and small channels were observed and are often connected to the inclusions. Quartz cores 3 and 4 were subsequently re-equilibrated for 2 1 and 27 days respectively under hydro-thermal conditions with pure H 20, at both a lower pressure of 100 MPa (<b>E</b> <b>463)</b> and a higher pressure of 365 MPa (E 490) {{than that of the}} original experiment E 421.

40|$|We present {{optical and}} near-IR Integral Field Unit (IFU) and ALMA band 6 {{observations}} of the nearby dual Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Mrk 463. At a distance of 210 Mpc, and a nuclear separation of ∼ 4 kpc, Mrk 463 is an excellent laboratory to study the gas dynamics, star formation processes and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion in a late-stage gas-rich major galaxy merger. The IFU observations reveal a complex morphology, including tidal tails, star-forming clumps, and emission line regions. The optical data, which map {{the full extent of}} the merger, show evidence for a biconical outflow and material outflowing at > 600 km s^- 1, both associated with the Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E</b> nucleus, together with large scale gradients likely related to the ongoing galaxy merger. We further find an emission line region ∼ 11 kpc south of Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E</b> that is consistent with being photoionized by an AGN. Compared to the current AGN luminosity, the energy budget of the cloud implies a luminosity drop in Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E</b> by a factor 3 - 20 over the last 40, 000 years.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of fly ash (FA) in cementitious matrices has been frequently used {{in order to}} make the matrix more resistant to the action of chlorides. On the other hand, it is known that Ca(OH) 2 existing in the matrix is consumed by the pozzolanic reactions, which makes easier the carbonation front advance. Given that the chloride ingress and carbonation are the two main causes of degradation in reinforced concrete, we speculate about the behaviour of FA concrete when the structure is submitted simultaneously to chlorides and carbonation. This work studied the influence of carbonation on the chloride migration coefficient in FA concrete. For this, specimens with 0 % and 40 % replacement of cement CEM I 42. 5 R by FA were casted with water/binder 0. 55 and 0. 50 respectively. After 90 days of curing period, half of samples were subjected to accelerated carbonation (20 ÂºC, 55 %RH and 4 %CO 2) for 1, 2 and 3 months. The other half was protected with plastic film during the same period. Non-steady-state migration tests, according to LNEC <b>E</b> <b>463</b> (Portuguese specification), were performed with specimens subjected to both experimental conditions. The results show that, for these conditions, the carbonation has a direct influence on chloride diffusion coefficient, increasing it. For FA concrete samples this effect is more evident. In these cases, the carbonated samples studied showed a diffusion coefficient up to two times higher than noncarbonated ones. The increase in large capillary pores, caused by carbonation, can be responsible for the increase of chloride penetration into concrete subjected to combined actio...|$|E

The polariza-tions from electron scattering in the cones and dichroic absorption by aligned dust grains in the torus are also compared with the observations.

40|$|We present 18 -cm radio maps of four Seyfert nuclei, Mrk 1, Mrk 3, Mrk 231 and Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E,</b> {{made with}} the European VLBI Network (EVN). Linear radio {{structures}} are present in {{three out of four}} sources on scales of ~ 100 pc to ~ 1 kpc, and the 20 -mas beam of the EVN enables us to resolve details within the radio structures on scales of < 10 pc. Mrk 3 was also imaged using MERLIN and the data combined with the EVN data to improve the sensitivity to extended emission. We find an unresolved flat-spectrum core in Mrk 3, which we identify with the hidden Seyfert 1 nucleus in this object, and we also see marked differences between the two highly-collimated radio jets emanating from the core. The western jet terminates in a bright hotspot and resembles an FRII radio structure, whilst the eastern jet has more in common with an FRI source. In Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E,</b> we use the radio and optical structure of the source to argue that the true nucleus lies approximately 1 arcsec south of the position of the radio and optical brightness peaks, which probably represent a hotspot at the working surface of a radio jet. The EVN data also provide new evidence for a 100 -pc radio jet powering the radio source in the Type 1 nucleus of Mrk 231. However, the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1 shows no evidence for radio jets down to the limits of resolution (~ 10 pc).

Two {{experiments were}} performed to study the effect of stocking rate and growing season {{on the performance of}} channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). In the first experiment, a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement was used to study the effect of two stoking rates (0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m²) and two subsequently growing seasons (with five and four month of duration time, respectively). In the second experiment, two stoking rates were compared (0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m²) in a growing season equivalent to a sum of the two growing season of the first experiment. In the first experiment, there was a significant effect for growing seasons in relation to the individual weight gain, average weight, final biomass and biomass gain. The effect of stoking rate was only observed for final biomass and biomass gain, with non-interactive effect between the two studied factors. The final individual weight and weight gain in the growing season of five months with the stoking rate of 0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m 2 were 608. 1 and 531. 4 g; 550. 2 and 473. 5 g, respectively. In the subsequently growing season of four months were 274. 2 and 88. 3 g, 211. 3 and 183. 2 g, for the two stoking rates, respectively. At the initial growing season the final biomass and biomass gain values were, respectively, 298. 0 and 262. 1 g/m², 397. 9 and 354. 5 g/m², for the two stoking rates, respectively. In the subsequently growing season were 132. 9 and 89. 9 g/m² and 179. 9 and 119. 9 g/m², for the two stoking rates, respectively. In the second experiment, there was no effect for the studied characteristics and the values for the individual final weight, weight gain, final biomass and biomass gain were, respectively, for 0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m 2 socking rates, 941. 1 and 758. 1 g; 885. 1 and 701. 2 g; 491. 7 and 578. 1 g/m²; 463. 1 and 535. 4 g/m².

Thus, DLL 4 has emerged as an attractive target for cancer therapy. Anti-DLL 4 antibodies have recently entered clinical trials. However, the potential toxic effects of anti-DLL 4 are poorly understood. In this article, Yan et al. reported that chronic DLL 4 blockade abnormally activates endothelial cells, causes pathological changes of multiple organs and induces vascular neoplasms.

It would appear that this soft X-ray emission comes from a distinct thermal component. The hard component, which has been detected for the first time by ASCA, is found only above 4 keV with an apparent flat spectral slope. We argue that most of these hard X-rays are likely coming directly from the nucleus of Mkn <b>463</b> <b>E,</b> suffering a heavy absorption along our line of sight.

In order to characterize the stellar population and other continuum sources (e. g. featureless continuum) we have measured equivalent widths (Ws) of six absorption features, continuum colours and their radial variations, and performed spectral population synthesis as a function of distance from the nucleus. The Ws for the normal galaxies are strongest at the nucleus and decrease outwards. The two LINER galaxies show a similar behaviour, but with the nuclear Ws in the blue (λ < 4500 Å) ~~ 10 – 20 per cent smaller. Both normal galaxies and LINERs present a redder nucleus than their surroundings. The three Seyfert 2 galaxies present the opposite behaviour, with most Ws in the blue being smaller at the nucleus, which is also bluer than outside. By combining {{the results of the present}} work with those of a previous study, we conclude that, in a sample of 12 Seyfert 2 s of Hubble type S 0, 10 (~~ 80 per cent) present nuclear Ws smaller than those of normal galaxies, while at ~~ 1 kpc from the nucleus this number decreases to 4 (~~ 30 per cent). Sampling regions of ~~ 100 – 200 pc, we conclude that the normal galaxies have nuclear stellar populations dominated by the components with an age of 10 Gyr and metallicity solar or above. The contribution of this component decreases, while that of 1 Gyr increases, with increasing distance from the nucleus. The LINERs present a similar behaviour but have a ~~ 10 – 20 per cent larger contribution of the 1 -Gyr component at the nucleus. For the Seyfert 2 galaxies, there are additional components: in the three cases studied here, there is a significant contribution from a 100 -Myr-old population at the nucleus plus featureless continuum in two cases and also of a 3 -Myr-old component in Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E.</b> Outside the nucleus, the stellar population is similar to that of normal galaxies in ESO 138 -G 1, but it has an excess of old metal-poor components in NGC 7743 and of young components in Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E,</b> when compared with normal galaxies.

In contrast, {{little is known}} about neither the long-term {{evolution of}} the virus in patients who developed broadly Nabs (bNabs) or the mechanism of escape in presence of these bNabs.

The autologous neutralization titers of the sequential sera toward env variants representative of the viral population significantly increased during the follow-up period.

In 81. 8 % of females, k B did not differ among successive egg-pods, suggesting no effect of female age. The remaining females (18. 2 %), showed significant differences in k B values among egg-pods, but without clear temporal patterns.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{importance}} of X-ray scattering and Compton reflection in type- 2 Seyfert galaxies, based upon the analysis of ASCA observations of 25 such sources. Consideration of the iron Kalpha, [O III] line and X-ray variability suggest that NGC 1068, NGC 4945, NGC 2992, Mrk 3, Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E</b> and Mrk 273 are dominated by reprocessed X-rays. We examine the properties of these sources in more detail. We find that the iron Kalpha complex contains significant contributions from neutral and high-ionization species of iron. Compton reflection, hot gas and starburst emission all appear to make significant contributions to the observed X-ray spectra. Mrk 3 is the only source in this subsample which {{does not have a}} significant starburst contamination. The ASCA spectrum below 3 keV is dominated by hot scattering gas with U_X ~ 5, N_H ~ 4 x 10 ^ 23 cm^- 2. This material is more highly ionized than the zone of material comprising the warm absorber seen in Seyfert~ 1 galaxies, but may contain a contribution from shock-heated gas associated with the jet. Estimates of the X-ray scattering fraction cover 0. 25 - 5 %. The spectrum above 3 keV appears to be dominated by a Compton reflection component although there is evidence that the primary continuum component becomes visible close to 10 keV.

Our goal {{is to look for}} broad Pa beta lines, indicating broad-line regions which are hidden by dust from our view at optical wavelengths. Of the 15 objects studied here, three have broad Pa beta lines: MCG- 05. 23. 16, Mrk <b>463</b> <b>E,</b> and NGC 2992. Mrk 176 and NGC 5728 may also have weak broad lines. In NGC 5506, previously reported to have broad Pa beta and hydrogen alpha lines, we find that the Pa beta line profile is continuous and has the same shape as the nearby line (Fe II) lambda 1. 2567, which should not have a broad component. We interpret these observations as gas from the narrow-line region (NLR) with no broad component. In NGC 5506, however, the NLR profiles become broader with increasing wavelength, indicating that highly reddened wings are becoming more readily visible at the longer wavelengths. We confirm the correlation of (O I) lambda 6300 /hydrogen alpha and (Fe II) lambda 1. 644 /Br gamma (the latter transformed to (Fe II) lambda 1. 2567 /Pa beta to compare with our data) found by previous authors when comparing active galactic nuclei (AGNs), supernova remnants, starbursts, and H II regions. The correlation confirms that in all of these objects both (O I) lambda 6300 and the (Fe II) lines come from partially ionized regions in which hydrogen is mostly neutral. Comparison of the infrared optical depths with column depths determined from X-ray data show a general tendency for the objects with detected broad Pa beta to have lower X-ray columns...|$|R

Kv 7. 2 and Kv 7. 3 are the principal molecular components of the slow voltage-gated M-channel, which regulates neuronal excitability. In this study, we demonstrate that tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist used {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer, inhibits Kv 7. 2 /Kv 7. 3 currents heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney HEK- 293 cells. Current inhibition by tamoxifen was voltage independent but concentration-dependent. The IC 50 for current inhibition was 1. 68 ± 0. 44 µM. The voltage-dependent activation of the channel was not modified. Tamoxifen inhibited Kv 7. 2 homomeric channels with a higher potency (IC 50 = 0. 74 ± 0. 16 µM). The mutation Kv 7. 2 R <b>463</b> <b>E</b> increases phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) - channel interaction and diminished dramatically the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen compared with that for wild type Kv 7. 2. Conversely, the mutation Kv 7. 2 R 463 Q, which decreases PIP 2 -channel interaction, increased tamoxifen potency. Similar results were obtained on the heteromeric Kv 7. 2 R 463 Q/Kv 7. 3 and Kv 7. 2 R 463 E/Kv 7. 3 channels, compared to Kv 7. 2 /Kv 7. 3 WT. Overexpression of type 2 A PI(4) P 5 -kinase (PIP 5 K 2 A) significantly reduced tamoxifen inhibition of Kv 7. 2 /Kv 7. 3 and Kv 7. 2 R 463 Q channels.

Its mass is 5. 2 * 10 ^ 7 M_sun, accounting for more than one fourth of the H 2 gas at 374 K, but less than 1 % of the cold H 2 gas computed from CO observations. Because no diffuse gas component of 4 C 12. 50 has been observed to date to be moving at more than 250 km/s from systemic velocity, the H 2 line wings are unlikely to be tracing gas in shock regions along the tidal tails of this merging system.

In the present report, we further examine the interaction of these two oxidase components by using random-sequence peptide phage display library analysis. Screening p 47 -phox with the peptide libraries identified five potential sites of interaction with flavocytochrome b, including three previously reported regions of interaction and two additional regions of interaction of p 47 -phox with gp 91 -phox and p 22 -phox. The additional sites were mapped to a domain on the first predicted cytosolic loop of gp 91 -phox encompassing residues S 86 TRVRRQL 93 and to a domain near the cytosolic C-terminal tail of gp 91 -phox encompassing residues F 450 EWFADLL 457. The mapping also confirmed a previously reported binding domain on gp 91 -phox (E 554 SGPRGVHFIF 564) and putative Src homology 3 domain binding sites on p 22 -phox (P 156 PRPP 160 and G 177 GPPGGP 183).

Plantas de cana-de-açúcar com três a quatro folhas completamente expandidas foram aspergidas com soluções de 2, 4 -D, ametryn, trifloxysulfuron-sodium e ametryn+trifloxysulfuron-sodium nas doses de 1, 30; 1, 00; 0, 0225; <b>e</b> 1, <b>463</b> + 0, 0375 kg ha- 1, respectivamente. Utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado no esquema de parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetições. Nas parcelas foram avaliados os efeitos dos herbicidas e, nas subparcelas, o efeito tempo após a aplicação dos herbicidas. Aos 15, 30, 45 e 60 dias após a aplicação (DAA), amostras de solos rizosférico e não-rizosférico foram coletadas e, em seguida, analisadas estimando-se a densidade populacional de bactérias e fungos, a atividade potencial de solubilização de fosfato inorgânico e a solubilização relativa de fosfato inorgânico. O 2, 4 -D reduziu a densidade populacional bacteriana do solo em todas as épocas de avaliação, demonstrando a maior sensibilidade desse grupo de organismos a esse composto. Todos os herbicidas provocaram redução na densidade populacional fúngica do solo somente aos 15 DAA. O trifloxysulfuron-sodium e o 2, 4 -D favoreceram as maiores atividades de solubilização de fosfato inorgânico aos 15, 30 e 45 DAA e aos 15 e 30 DAA, respectivamente, sem, no entanto, afetar a biomassa microbiana do solo. Maior solubilização relativa de fosfato inorgânico foi observada em amostras de solos tratados com a mistura ametryn+trifloxysulfuron-sodium, indicando alterações no sistema solo. Este trabalho evidenciou que a aplicação dos herbicidas na parte aérea de plantas de cana-de-açúcar afetou o número de microrganismos e a atividade de solubilização de fosfato na rizosfera.

Sugarcane plants with three to four fully expanded leaves and fungi were sprayed with ametryn, trifloxysulfuron-sodium, and ametryn + trifloxysulfuron-sodium at the doses of 1. 30, 1. 00, 0. 0225 and 1. 463 + 0. 0375 kg ha- 1, respectively. A completely randomized design was adopted in a split plot scheme with four replications. The effect of the herbicides was evaluated in the whole plots and the effect of time after application in the split-plots. At 15, 30, 45, and 60 days after spraying (DAS), rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soil samples were collected and immediately analyzed for the populational densities of bacteria and fungi and the potential and relative inorganic phosphate solubilization activity in the soil. 2, 4 -D reduced the bacterial density in the soil for all the evaluation times, densities of bacterial populations in the rhizosphere for all periods of time showing a higher sensitivity of this group to this compound. At 15 DAS, all herbicides tested reduced the number of fungi in the soil. Trifloxysulfuron-sodium and 2, 4 -D led to higher inorganic phosphate solubilization at 15, 30, and 45 DAS, and 15 and 30 DAS, respectively, without affecting microbial biomass. The highest relative inorganic phosphate solubilization was observed in the soils treated with ametryn + trifloxysulfuron-sodium.

A total of 431 subjects (174 females and 257 males) aged 18 - 30 years old were included in the study. Skinfoldthickness equations proposed by Jackson and Pollock, Durnin and Womersley, Petroski and Guedes and Guedes were included in the study. The %BFBMI was predicted using Deurenberg’s age-and-sex specifi c equation. For the assessment of agreement, the paired t test, intraclass correlation coeffi cients and Bland-Altman plots were computed for the correlation between predicted percentage body fat according to each skinfold-thickness equation and %BFBMI. The results showed that the mean values of percent body fat predicted by each skinfold-thickness equation and from body mass index did not differ signifi cantly. Intraclass correlation coeffi cients ranged from 0. 463 to 0. 612. The Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the mean differences were close to zero, especially in males, but demonstrated a limited individual capacity of agreement, with upper and lower confi dence limits at - 13. 5 % and 1. 0 %, respectively. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that, although the values of percentage body fat predicted by each skinfold-thickness equation and using body mass index were similar at a group level, individual biases were sometimes exceptionally high. It is recommended that comparisons between percentage body fat predicted by different anthropometric methods be interpreted with caution.

To investigate how PIP 2 affinity affects the response to physiological stimuli such as receptor stimulation, we exposed homomeric and heteromeric Kv 7. 2, 7. 3, and 7. 4 channels {{to a range of}} concentrations of the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine-M (oxo-M) in a heterologous expression system. Activation of M 1 receptors by oxo-M leads to PIP 2 depletion through Gq and phospholipase C (PLC). Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently transfected with Kv 7 subunits and M 1 receptors and studied under perforated-patch voltage clamp. For Kv 7. 2 / 7. 3 heteromers, the EC 50 for current suppression was 0. 44 ± 0. 08 µM, and the maximal inhibition (Inhibmax) was 74 ± 3 % (n = 5 – 7). When tonic PIP 2 abundance was increased by overexpression of PIP 5 -kinase, the EC 50 was shifted threefold to the right (1. 2 ± 0. 1 µM), but without a significant change in Inhibmax (73 ± 4 %, n = 5). To investigate the muscarinic sensitivity of Kv 7. 3 homomers, we used the A 315 T pore mutant (Kv 7. 3 T) that increases whole-cell currents by 30 -fold without any change in apparent PIP 2 affinity. Kv 7. 3 T currents had a slightly right-shifted EC 50 as compared with Kv 7. 2 / 7. 3 heteromers (1. 0 ± 0. 8 µM) and a strongly reduced Inhibmax (39 ± 3 %). In contrast, the dose–response curve of homomeric Kv 7. 4 channels was shifted considerably to the left (66 ± 8 nM), and Inhibmax was slightly increased (81 ± 6 %, n = 3 – 4). We then studied several Kv 7. 2 mutants with altered apparent affinities for PIP 2 by coexpressing them with Kv 7. 3 T subunits to boost current amplitudes. For the lower affinity (Kv 7. 2 (R 463 Q) /Kv 7. 3 T) or higher affinity (Kv 7. 2 (R <b>463</b> <b>E)</b> /Kv 7. 3 T) channels, the EC 50 and Inhibmax were similar to Kv 7. 4 or Kv 7. 3 T homomers (0. 12 ± 0. 08 µM and 79 ± 6 % [n = 3 – 4] and 0. 58 ± 0. 07 µM and 27 ± 3 % [n = 3 – 4], respectively). The very low-affinity Kv 7. 2 (R 452 E, R 459 E, and R 461 E) triple mutant was also coexpressed with Kv 7. 3 T. The resulting heteromer displayed a very low EC 50 for inhibition (32 ± 8 nM) and a slightly increased Inhibmax (83 ± 3 %, n = 3 – 4). We then constructed a cellular model that incorporates PLC activation by oxo-M, PIP 2 hydrolysis, PIP 2 binding to Kv 7 -channel subunits, and K+ current through Kv 7 tetramers.
