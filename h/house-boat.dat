5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the Baron {{appeared}} as a character in John Kendrick Bangs's comic novels A <b>House-Boat</b> on the Styx, Pursuit of the <b>House-Boat,</b> and The Enchanted Type-Writer. Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published Mr. Munchausen, a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and humor of the original tales. Hugo Gernsback's second novel, Baron Münchhausen's New Scientific Adventures, put the Baron character in a science fiction setting; the novel was serialized in The Electrical Experimenter from May 1915 to February 1917.|$|E
6000|$|... "And how {{we shall}} miss him here," [...] said Scrymgeour, [...] "and in my <b>house-boat!</b> I think I had better sell the <b>house-boat.</b> Do you {{remember}} his favorite {{seat at the}} door of the saloon?" ...|$|E

6000|$|How {{did they}} pass their illimitable leisure, when they rested from the fishing-net {{by day and}} the chicken-coop by night? Did they read the new {{historical}} fictions aloud to one another? Did some of them even meditate the thankless muse and not mind her ingratitude? Perhaps the ladies of the <b>house-boats,</b> when they found themselves--as they often did--in companies of four or five, had each other in to [...] "evenings," [...] at which one of them read a paper on some artistic or literary topic.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to tell me everything," [...] said Yeovil, after another pause; [...] "tell me, Holham, how far has this obliterating process of 'time and tact' gone? It seems to be pretty fairly started already. I bought a {{newspaper}} as soon as I landed, and I read it in the train coming up. I read things that puzzled and disgusted me. There were announcements of concerts and plays and first-nights and private views; there were even small dances. There were advertisements of <b>house-boats</b> and week-end cottages and string bands for garden parties. It struck me that it was rather like merrymaking with a dead body lying in the house." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fact was}} Carley had never camped out. Her set played golf, rode horseback, motored and <b>house-boated,</b> {{but they had}} never gone in for uncomfortable trips. The camps and hotels in the Adirondacks were as warm and luxurious as Carley's own home. Carley now missed many things. And assuredly her flesh was weak. It cost her effort of will and real pain to finish lacing her boots. As she had made an {{engagement}} with Glenn to visit his cabin, she had donned an outdoor suit. She wondered if the cold {{had anything to do}} with the perceptible diminishing of the sound of the waterfall. Perhaps some of the water had frozen, like her fingers.|$|R
60|$|Scrymgeour had a <b>house-boat</b> called, of course, the Arcadia, {{to which}} he was so ill-advised as to invite us all at once. He was at that time lying near Cookham, {{attempting}} to catch the advent of summer on a canvas, and we were all, unhappily, able to accept his invitation. Looking back to this nightmare of a holiday, I am puzzled at our not getting on well together, for who should be happy in a <b>house-boat</b> if not five bachelors, well known to each other, and all smokers of the same tobacco? Marriot says now that perhaps we were happy without knowing it; but that is nonsense. We were miserable.|$|E
6000|$|One day, {{some weeks}} {{after we left}} Scrymgeour's <b>house-boat,</b> I was alone in my rooms, very busy smoking, when William John entered with a telegram. It was from Scrymgeour, and said, [...] "You have got me into a dreadful mess. Come down here first train." ...|$|E
60|$|We met {{first in}} the Merediths' <b>house-boat,</b> the Tawny Owl, which was then lying at Molesey. Gilray, as I soon saw, was a man trying to be miserable, and finding it the hardest task in life. It is strange that the {{philosophers}} have never hit upon this profound truth. No man ever tried harder to be unhappy than Gilray; but the luck was against him, {{and he was always}} forgetting himself. Mark Tapley succeeded in being jolly in adverse circumstances; Gilray failed, on the whole, in being miserable in a delightful <b>house-boat.</b> It is, however, so much more difficult to keep up misery than jollity that I like to think of his attempt as what the dramatic critics call a succès d'estime.|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} pretend that this thought finally drove {{me from the}} scene, for I am of a very hardy make {{when it comes to}} the most frightful sort of suppositions. But the {{afternoon}} was wearing away, and we must go sometime. It seemed better also to leave the gayety at its height: the river covered with soft colors, and the barges and <b>house-boats</b> by the brink, with their companies responsive in harmonies of muslin and gauze and lace to those afloat; the crowds on the opposite shore in constant movement, and in vivid agitation when the bell and the pistol announced a racing event. We parted with our friends on the barge, and found our way through the gypsy crones squatted on the grass, weaving the web of fate and selling brooms and brushes in the intervals of their mystical employ, or cosily gossiping together; and then we took for the station the harmless fly which we had forever renounced as predatory in the morning.|$|R
60|$|Except in the {{immediate}} suburbs of the large towns, there is no ambition beyond that of rustic comfort in the buildings on the shore. There is no such thing, apparently, as a summer cottage, with its mock humility of name, up or down the whole tortuous length of the Ohio. As yet the land is not openly depraved by shows of wealth; those who amass it either keep it to themselves or come away to spend it in European travel, or pause to waste it unrecognized on the ungrateful Atlantic seaboard. The only distinctions that are marked are between the homes of honest industry above the banks and the homes below them of the leisure, which it is hoped is not dishonest. But, honest or dishonest, it is there apparently {{to stay in the}} <b>house-boats</b> which line the shores by thousands, and repeat on Occidental terms in our new land the river-life of old and far Cathay.|$|R
60|$|The rafts {{were very}} well, and the <b>house-boats</b> and the traders' boats, {{but the most}} majestic feature of the riverlife was the tow of coal-barges which, going or coming, the 'Avonek' met every few miles. Whether going or coming they were pushed, not pulled, by the {{powerful}} steamer which gathered them in tens and twenties before her, and rode the mid-current with them, when they were full, or kept the slower water near shore when they were empty. They claimed the river where they passed, and the 'Avonek' bowed to an unwritten law in giving them the full right of way, from the time when their low bulk first rose in sight, with the chimneys of their steamer towering above them and her gay contours gradually making themselves seen, till she receded from the encounter, with the wheel at her stern pouring a cataract of yellow water from its blades. It was insurpassably picturesque always, and not the tapering masts or the swelling sails of any sea-going craft could match it.|$|R
60|$|They {{made for}} Scrymgeour's <b>house-boat,</b> {{with almost no}} words on the young man's part; but the father blurted out several things--as that his {{daughter}} {{knew where he was}} going when he left the Heathen Chinee, and that he had an hour before seen Scrymgeour making love to another girl.|$|E
60|$|Before Scrymgeour {{returned}} to his dingy {{he had been told}} that he would be drowned if he came near that <b>house-boat</b> again. As he sculled away he had a glimpse of the flirting daughter, whom he described to me briefly as being of such engaging appearance that six yards was a trying distance to be away from her.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{during this}} period of waiting and just after I had finished the writing of Hesper we joined our good friends the Eastons on an excursion up the Mississippi on their <b>house-boat,</b> a glorious outing which I mention because it was the farthest removed from my boyhood life on Dry Run prairie whose scenes had just been vividly brought to mind.|$|E
6000|$|While {{the pilot}} {{went on with}} his talk, and in regular, rhythmical motion [...] Swayed {{from one side to}} the other before his wheel, and we listened, [...] Certain typical facts of the picturesque life of the river [...] Won their way to our {{consciousness}} as without help of our senses. [...] It was along about the beginning of March, but already [...] In the sleepy sunshine the budding maples and willows, [...] Where they waded out in the shallow wash of the freshet, [...] Showed the dull red and the yellow green of their blossoms and catkins, [...] And in their tops the foremost flocks of blackbirds debated [...] As to which they should colonize first. The indolent <b>house-boats</b> [...] Loafing along the shore, sent up in silvery spirals [...] Out of their kitchen pipes the smoke of their casual breakfasts. [...] Once a wide tow of coal-barges, loaded clear down to the gunwales, [...] Gave us the slack of the current, with proper formalities shouted [...] By the hoarse-throated stern-wheeler that pushed the black barges [...] before her, [...] And as she passed us poured a foamy cascade from her paddles. [...] Then, as a raft of logs, which the spread of the barges had hidden, [...] River-wide, weltered in sight, with a sudden jump forward the pilot [...] Dropped his whole weight on the spokes of the wheel just in time to [...] escape it.|$|R
60|$|We did not {{penetrate}} its perspective, for {{it seems}} {{one of the}} few things at Hampton Court barred to the public. Everywhere else the place is free to the visitor, who may walk as he pleases on its garden-paths, or over its close-woven turf, or sit out of the sun under its dense black yews, or stroll beneath the oaks by the banks of the Long Canal. If the canal is Dutch, the burly trees which lounge about at their pleasure in the park, impart the true English sentiment to the scene; but, for my part, I did not care to go far from the borders of the beds of hyacinths and tulips and daffodils. The grass sighed with secret tears under the foot, and it was better to let the fancy, which would not feel the need of goloshes, rove disembodied to the bosky depths into which the oaks thickened afar, dim amid the vapor-laden air. From the garden-plots one could look, dry-shod, down upon the Thames, along which the pretty town of Hampton stretches, and in whose lively current great numbers of <b>house-boats</b> tug at their moorings. The Thames beside the palace is not only swift but wide, and from the little flowery height on which we surveyed these very modernest of pleasure-craft they had a remove at which they were lost in an agreeable mystery. Even one which we were told belonged to a rich American could not alienate itself from the past when there were no United States, and very few united colonies. The poorest American, if he could not have a lodgement in the palace (and I do not see how the royal bounty could extend to one of our disinherited condition), or one of the pleasant Hampton houses overlooking the river, might be glad to pass the long, mild English summer, made fast to the willowy bank of the Thames, without mosquitoes or malaria to molest him or make him afraid in his dreamful sojourn.|$|R
60|$|The trader's boat, of {{an elder}} and more {{authentic}} tradition, sometimes shouldered the <b>house-boats</b> {{away from a}} village landing, but it, too, was a peaceful home, where the family life visibly went hand-in-hand with commerce. When the trader has supplied all the wants and wishes of a neighborhood, he unmoors his craft and drops down the river's tide to where it meets the ocean's tide in the farthermost Mississippi, and there either sells out both his boat and his stock, or hitches his home to some returning steamboat, and climbs slowly, with many pauses, back to the upper Ohio. But his home is not so interesting {{as that of the}} houseboatman, nor so picturesque as that of the raftsman, whose floor of logs rocks flexibly under his shanty, but securely rides the current. As the pilots said, a steamboat never tries to hurt a raft of logs, which is adapted to dangerous retaliation; and by night it always gives a wide berth to the lantern tilting above the raft from a swaying pole. By day the raft forms one of the pleasantest aspects of the river-life, with its convoy of skiffs always searching the stream or shore for logs which have broken from it, and which the skiffmen recognize by distinctive brands or stamps. Here and there the logs lie in long ranks upon the shelving beaches, mixed with the drift of trees and fence-rails, and frames of corn-cribs and hencoops, and even house walls, which the freshets have brought down and left stranded. The tops of the little willows are tufted gayly with hay and rags, and other spoil of the flood; and in one place a disordered mattress was lodged high among the boughs of a water- maple, where it would form building material for countless generations of birds. The fat cornfields were often littered with a varied wreckage which the farmers must soon heap together and burn, to be rid of it, and everywhere were proofs of the river's power to devastate as well as enrich its shores. The dwellers there had no power against it, in its moments of insensate rage, and the land no protection from its encroachments except in the simple device of the willow hedges, which, if planted, sometimes refused to grow, but often came of themselves and kept the torrent from the loose, unfathomable soil of the banks, otherwise crumbling helplessly into it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think we'd better {{settle down}} now," [...] said Dick on {{returning}} home from being cast away, {{but this was not}} to be. They took a <b>house-boat</b> trip down the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers, had a number of adventures on the plains and then found themselves in southern waters, where they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{moments are}} numbered; and if I would expose {{him with my}} dying sigh, I must not sentimentalize over my own decay. They were in a punt, her hand {{trailing}} in the water, when I became his. When they parted that night at Cookham Lock, he held her head in his hands, and they gazed in each other's eyes. Then he turned away quickly; {{when he reached the}} punt again he was whistling. Several times before we came to the <b>house-boat</b> in which he and another man lived, he felt in his pocket to make sure that I was still there. At the <b>house-boat</b> he put me in a tumbler of water out of sight of his friend, and frequently he stole to the spot like a thief to look at me. Early next morning he put me in his buttonhole, calling me sweet names. When his friend saw me, he too whistled, but not in the same way. Then my owner glared at him. This happened many months ago.|$|E
6000|$|In time, however, he {{returned}} to the Arcadia Mixture, though not until the <b>house-boat</b> was in its winter quarters. I witnessed his complete recovery, the scene being his chambers.

Conceive the rose lying, as I saw it, on Gilray's hearth-rug, and then imagine it whispering as follows: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{pollution}} in Koluama Area in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria {{to determine its}} effects on fish species composition, histology, shrimp fishery and fishing gear type. A total of twenty (20) species belonging to eleven (11) families were recorded. Strongylura senegalensis, Lagocephalus laevigatus, Tarpon atlantica, Pristis pristis, Galeoides decadatylus and Butis koilomatodon were rare. Ephippion guttifer, Chaetodipterus goreensis, Sardinella maderensis, Sardinella aurita, Liza falcipinnis, Mugil bananensis, Pentanemus quinquarius, Polydactylus quadrafilis and Trichuris lepturis were common. Ethmalosa fimbriata, Liza grandisquamis, Sphyraena guachancho, Mugil curema, Sphyraena guachancho and Dormitator pleurops were abundant. None was dominant. The highest number of fish species (16) were recorded in fish town and none was recorded in Kuloma 1 and one (1) was recorded for Kulauma 11. Foroupa, Ekeni, Ejetu and Ikebiri fishing port 1 and 2 recorded 8, 7, 3 and 5 fish species respectively. Artisanal fishing is based on traditional methods of fishing using essentially canoe and different fishing nets which depend on the season and target fish species. Canoes may be motorized or hand-paddled. Common gear types include shrimp traps, drift gill nets, set gill nets, cast nets, seine nets, hook and lines. Lift nets may be use by women folk who target small shrimp species in the creeks and creek lets. Other fishing methods include hand-picking for periwinkles, oysters and other shellfish by women folk and children. Prominent among the fishing devices are edek, a type of fish fence used in the creeks; alot, a large trap used on sand and mud-banks in the estuaries; and otunwa, a barbed spear. Fishers using these devices either operated from their home villages, exploiting the nearby waters, or staged long distance fishing expeditions, during which they lived in distant camps or <b>house-boats.</b> The heavy metals concentration level values are: Cd (0. 013 a± 0. 001), Cr (2. 04 b± 0. 01), Cu (2. 16 b± 0. 10), Pb (2. 20 b± 0. 16) and Zn (1. 03 ab± 0. 03) for Lagocephalus laevigatus; Cd (0. 01 a± 0. 001), Cr (1. 60 b± 0. 44), Cu (1. 25 ab± 0. 08), Pb (1. 10 ab± 0. 15) and Zn (0. 50 b± 0. 04) for Tarpon atlantica and Cd (0. 02 ab± 0. 003), Cr (2. 35 ab± 0. 40), Cu (2. 60 a± 0. 08), Pb (2. 30 a± 0. 45) and Zn (1. 11 a± 0. 17) for Pristis pristis.

60|$|But we {{had only}} that one day there, and in our haste {{to give it to}} the regatta we could only make sure of driving over a {{beautiful}} picture- postal bridge {{on our way to the}} meadows by whose brink our college barge was moored, and making believe to tug at its chain. It was really doing nothing of the kind, for it was familiar with boat-racing in the Thames where the Thames is still the Isis at Oxford, and was as wholly without the motive as without the fact of impatience. Like many other barges and <b>house-boats</b> set broadside to the shore for a mile up and down as closely as they could be lined, it was of a comfortable cabin below and of a pleasant gallery above, with an awning to keep off the sun or rain, whichever it might be the whim of the weather to send. But that day the weather had no whims; it was its pleasure to be neither wet nor hot, but of a delicious average warmth, informed with a cool freshness which had the days of the years of youth in it. In fact, youth came back in all the holiday sights and scents to the elderly witness who ought to have known better than to be glad of such things as the white tents in the green meadows, the gypsy fires burning pale in the sunlight by the gypsy camps, the traps and carriages thronging up and down the road, or standing detached from the horses in the wayside shadow, where the trodden grass, not less nor more than the wandering cigar-whiff, exhaled the memories of far-off circus-days and Fourths of July. But such things lift the heart in spite of philosophy and experience, and bid it rejoice in the relish of novelty which a scene everywhere elementally the same offers in slight idiosyncrasies of time and place. Certain of these might well touch the American half-brother with a sense of difference, but there was none that perhaps more suggested it than the frank English proclamation by sign-board that these or those grounds in the meadows were this or that lady's, who might be supposed waiting in proprietory state for her guests within the pavilion of her roped-off enclosure. Together with this assertion of private right, and the warning it implied, was the expression of yet elder privilege in the presence of the immemorial wanderers who had their shabby camps by the open wayside and offered the passer fortune at so low a rate that the poorest pleasurer could afford to buy a prophecy of prosperity from them; I do not know why they proposed to sell with these favorable destinies small brushes and brooms of their own make.|$|R
60|$|Smokers, {{who know}} how tobacco {{develops}} the finer feelings, hardly require to be told what happened next. Suddenly Scrymgeour remembered that he was probably leaving {{the owner of the}} Heathen Chinee without any Arcadia Mixture. He at once filled his pouch, and, pulling softly back to the <b>house-boat,</b> replaced the tin on the window, his bosom swelling with the pride of those who give presents. At the same moment a hand gripped him by the neck, and a girl, somewhere on deck, screamed.|$|E
60|$|Leaving them {{to their}} conference, at Charley's {{suggestion}} we boarded our skiff and pulled over to the Old Steamboat Wharf, where Big Alec's ark was lying. An ark is a <b>house-boat</b> of small though comfortable dimensions, and is as necessary to the Upper Bay fisherman as are nets and boats. We were both curious to see Big Alec's ark, for history said {{that it had been}} the scene of more than one pitched battle, and that it was riddled with bullet-holes.|$|E
60|$|Matters {{work out}} still more awkwardly {{when it is}} he who is the host. I {{remember}} being with him on his <b>house-boat</b> one day. It was a little after twelve, and we {{were sitting on the}} edge of the boat, dangling our feet in the river--the spot was a lonely one, half-way between Wallingford and Day's Lock. Suddenly round the bend appeared two skiffs, each one containing six elaborately-dressed persons. As soon as they caught sight of us they began waving handkerchiefs and parasols.|$|E
6000|$|... "At the corner," [...] Sabatini continued, [...] "just out {{of sight}} behind that tall hedge, is my motor car. I want you to land and make your way there. My chauffeur has his instructions. He {{will take you to}} a village some eight miles up the river, a village called Heslop Wood. There is a boat-builder's yard {{at the end of the}} main street. You will hire a boat and row up the river. About three hundred yards up, on the left hand side, is an old, dismantled-looking <b>house-boat.</b> I want you to board it and search it thoroughly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After a time we {{left the}} <b>house-boat,</b> and were in {{chambers}} in a great inn. I {{was still in his}} pocket, and heard many conversations between him and people who came to see him, and he would tell them that he loathed the society of women. When they told him, as one or two did, that they were in love, he always said that he had gone through that stage ages ago. Still, at nights he would take me out of my case, when he was alone, and look at me; after which he walked up and down the room in an agitated manner and cried 'Vixi.' ...|$|E
60|$|Wondering what mess I {{could have}} got Scrymgeour into, I good-naturedly obeyed his summons, and soon I was smoking placidly {{on the deck of}} the <b>house-boat,</b> while Scrymgeour, sullen and nervous, tramped back and forward. I saw quickly that the only tobacco had {{something}} to do with his troubles, for he began by announcing that one evening soon after we left him he found that we had smoked all his Arcadia. He would have dispatched the boy to London for it, but the boy had been all day in the village buying a loaf, and would not be back for hours. Cookham cigars Scrymgeour could not smoke; cigarettes he only endured if made from the Arcadia.|$|E
6000|$|The Tawny Owl {{lay on the}} {{far side}} of the island. There were ladies in it; and Gilray's misery was meant to date from the moment when he asked one of them a {{question}}, and she said [...] "No." [...] Gilray was strangely unlucky during the whole of his time on board. His evil genius was there, though there was very little room for him, and played sad pranks. Up to the time of his asking the question referred to, Gilray meant to create a pleasant impression by being jolly, and he only succeeded in being as depressing as Jaques. Afterward he was to be unutterably miserable; and it was all he could do to keep himself at times from whirling about in waltz tune. But then the nearest boat had a piano on board, and some one was constantly playing dance music. Gilray had an idea that it would have been the proper thing to leave Molesey when she said [...] "No;" [...] and he would have done so had not the barbel-fishing been so good. The barbel-fishing was altogether unfortunate--at least Gilray's passion for it was. I have thought--and so sometimes has Gilray--that if it had not been for a barbel she might not have said [...] "No." [...] He was fishing from the <b>house-boat</b> when he asked the question. You know how you fish from a <b>house-boat.</b> The line is flung into the water and the rod laid down on deck. You keep an eye on it. Barbel-fishing, in fact, reminds one of the independent sort of man who is quite willing to play host to you, but wishes you clearly to understand at the same time that he can do without you. [...] "Glad to see you with us if you have nothing better to do; but please yourself," [...] is what he says to his friends. This is also the form of invitation to barbel. Now it happened that she and Gilray were left alone in the <b>house-boat.</b> It was evening; some Chinese lanterns had been lighted, and Gilray, though you would not think it to look at him, is romantic. He cast his line, and, turning to his companion, asked her the question. From what he has told me he asked it very properly, and all seemed to be going well. She turned away her head (which is said not to be a bad sign) and had begun to reply, when a woful thing happened. The line stiffened, and there was a whirl of the reel. Who can withstand that music? You can ask a question at any time, but, even at Molesey, barbel are only to be got now and then. Gilray rushed to his rod and began playing the fish. He called to his companion to get the landing-net. She did so; and after playing his barbel for ten minutes Gilray landed it. Then he turned to her again, and she said, [...] "No." ...|$|E
6000|$|At Cookham {{he could}} only get tobacco that made him uncomfortable. Having {{recently}} begun to use a new pouch, he searched his pockets in vain for odd shreds of the Mixture {{to which he had}} so contemptibly become a slave. In a very bad temper he took to his dingy, vowing for a little while that he would violently break the chains that bound him to one tobacco, and afterward, when he was restored to his senses that he would jilt the Arcadia gradually. He had pulled some distance down the river, without regarding the Cliveden Woods, when he all but ran into a blaze of Chinese lanterns. It was a <b>house-boat</b> called--let us change its name to the Heathen Chinee. Staying his dingy with a jerk, Scrymgeour looked up, when a wonderful sight met his eyes. On the open window of an apparently empty saloon stood a round tin of tobacco, marked [...] "Arcadia Mixture." ...|$|E
6000|$|Scrymgeour {{thought it}} over. [...] "She is {{grateful}} to me," [...] he concluded, [...] "for drawing away suspicion {{from the other}} man, but what can have made the father so amiable? Suppose she has not told him that I am an impostor, he should still look upon me as a villain; and if she has told him, he should be still more furious. It is curious, but no affair of mine." [...] Three times {{within the next few}} days he encountered the lady on the tow-path or elsewhere with a young gentleman of empty countenance, who, he saw must be the real Lothario. Once they passed him {{when he was in the}} shadow of a tree, and the lady was making pretty faces with a cigarette in her mouth. The <b>house-boat</b> Heathen Chinee lay but a short distance off, and Scrymgeour could see the owner gazing after his daughter placidly, a pipe between his lips.|$|E
6000|$|Scrymgeour's captor, who was {{no other}} than {{the owner of the}} Heathen Chinee, dragged him {{fiercely}} into the <b>house-boat</b> and stormed at him for five minutes. My friend shuddered as he thought of the explanations to come when he was allowed to speak, and gradually he realized that he had been mistaken for someone else--apparently for some young blade who had been carrying on a clandestine flirtation with the old gentleman's daughter. It will take an hour, thought Scrymgeour, to convince him that I am not that person, and another hour to explain why I am really here. Then the weak creature had an idea: [...] "Might not the simplest plan be to say that his surmises are correct, promise to give his daughter up, and row away as quickly as possible?" [...] He began to wonder if the girl was pretty; but saw it would hardly do to say that he reserved his defence until he could see her.|$|E
60|$|After luncheon I took a taxicab, {{called on}} my tailor, looked {{in at the}} club, and bought some cigarettes. The whole of London seemed covered with dust sheets, to smell of paint. My club was {{in the hands of}} furbishers. My {{tobacconist}} was in his <b>house-boat</b> on the Thames. I met only one or two acquaintances, who seemed so sorry for themselves that their depression was only heightened by recognizing me. The streets were given over to a strangely clad crowd of pilgrims from other lands,--American women with short coats, pince nez, and Baedekers, dragging along their mankind in neat suits and outrageous hats. One seemed to recognize nothing familiar even in the shop-windows. I was glad enough {{to get back to the}} Milan, especially so as in the lift I came upon Felicia. She started a little at seeing me, and seemed a little nervous. When the lift stopped at her floor I got out too.|$|E
60|$|One day Pettigrew visited us. He {{brought his}} Gladstone bag with him, {{but did not}} stay over night. He was glad to go; for at first none of us, I am afraid, was very civil to him, though we {{afterward}} thawed a little. He returned to London and told every one how he found us. I admit we were not prepared to receive company. The <b>house-boat</b> consisted of five apartments--a saloon, three bedrooms, and a kitchen. When he boarded us we were distributed as follows: I sat smoking in the saloon, Marriot sat smoking in the first bedroom, Gilray in the second, Jimmy in the third, and Scrymgeour in the kitchen. The boy did not keep Scrymgeour company. He had been ordered on deck, where he sat with his legs crossed, the picture of misery {{because he had no}} coals to break. A few days after Pettigrew's visit we followed him to London, leaving Scrymgeour behind, where we soon became friendly again.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the lesser}} {{annoyances}} to which Thomson was subjected in Africa was {{the presence of}} rats in the night-time, which he had to brush away like flies. Until he was asked whether there was not danger in this, it never seems to have struck {{him that it was}} more than annoying. Yet though he and the two other travellers mentioned (doubtless they are not alone in this) have put up cheerfully with almost every hardship known to man, this does not make them indifferent to the comforts of civilization when they return home. Du Chaillu was looking very comfortable in a <b>house-boat</b> the other day, where his hosts thought they were [...] "roughing it"--with a male attendant; and in Stanley's easy-chairs you sink to dream. The last time I saw Thomson in his rooms in London he was on his knees, gazing in silent rapture at a china saucer with a valuable crack in it.|$|E
