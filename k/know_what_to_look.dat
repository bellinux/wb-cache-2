60|$|Since {{this most}} Christian war {{includes}} laying mines in the fairways of traffic, and since these mines may be laid {{at any time}} by German submarines especially built for the work, or by neutral ships, all fairways must be swept continuously day and night. When a nest of mines is reported, traffic must be hung up or deviated till it is cleared out. When traffic comes up Channel it must be examined for contraband and other things; and the examining tugs lie out {{in a blaze of}} lights to remind ships of this. Months ago, when the war was young, the tugs did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for specially. Now they do. All this mine-searching and reporting and sweeping, plus the direction and examination of the traffic, plus the laying of our own ever-shifting mine-fields, is part of the Trawler Fleet's work, because the Navy-as-we-knew-it is busy elsewhere. And there is always the enemy submarine with a price on her head, whom the Trawler Fleet hunts and traps with zeal and joy. Add to this, that there are boats, fishing for real fish, to be protected in their work at sea or chased off dangerous areas whither, because they are strictly forbidden to go, they naturally repair, and you will begin to get some idea of what the Trawler and Auxiliary Fleet does.|$|E

40|$|Defining {{acceptable}} tolerances for a {{shock test}} {{has always been}} a problem {{due in large part to}} the use of Shock Response Spectra (SRS) as the sole description of the shock. While SRS do contain a wealth of information if one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for, it is commonly accepted that different agencies can generate vastly different time domain test inputs whose SRS all satisfy the test requirements within a stated tolerance band. At an even more basic level, the laboratory test specifications often fail to resemble the field environment even though the SRS appear to be similar. A concise means of bounding the time domain inputs would be of great benefit in reducing the variation in the resulting shock tests. This paper describes a methodology that uses temporal moments to improve the repeatability of shock test specifications...|$|R

Besides, we didn't have the technical means to conduct such tests.” This supports the United States Ambassador to Russia's allegation that information on the composition of the gas used during the hostage rescue was only given after unacceptable delay, when prompt information on the exact drugs, or the proper antidotes to those drugs used might have saved lives.|$|E
50|$|One {{issue that}} has limited the growth of {{professional}} hamster racing is the difficulty in handicapping, or attempting to predict the winner, of a hamster racing contest. As with horse racing, the handicapping of hamsters relies on observations of the speed, pace, form, and class of the animal. However, while many bettors believe themselves to be good horse handicappers, few <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for in hamster handicapping as they are unfamiliar with the species. This means that the large population of horse racing bettors are often unwilling to migrate to hamster racing because {{to do so would}} require either placing uninformed, pure-chance bets or learning to judge and handicap an entirely new animal.|$|E
50|$|Joint {{attention}} is another cognitive capacity Tomasello explores. Joint {{attention is}} when two individuals {{share the same}} attention on a particular object. This could be done through an action, like pointing, gazing, or showing body movement directed toward another object or by verbally letting another organism <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at. Tomasello found evidence to prove that infants can begin to engage in joint attentional interactions because they understand that others around them are also agents of joint attention. This is unique because it means that infants {{have the capacity to}} identify with adults and distinguish the underlying goal of those around the infants through their actions. This is different from the idea that infants just acknowledge external motives and respond to these actions without true understanding.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the many}} dynamic forces {{operating}} {{to bring about}} modification or transformation of an existing cultural landscape, {{one of the most}} interesting and important is that of man's religions. Although it is sometimes difficult to separate the religious component from ethnic, social or economic factors in our urbanized and secular Western society, it can be accomplished with a moderate amount of effort if one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for and can understand what he sees. The most obvious religious elements, such as churches, great monuments and other sacred places, may stand out even to the untutored eye, but these are marks of the "outer face" of an organized, institutionalized religion. It can, perhaps, be more rewarding to discover visible manifestations of the religious intensity of the individual member of the faith under study. In this investigation, the question is: Have the Japanese Buddhists in the United States managed to produce any imprint on the cultural landscape that can be identified as a religious one...|$|R
40|$|For Microform Academic Publishers to film all the Orwell correspondence, drafts, and manuscripts {{in over a}} {{score of}} UK {{libraries}} and archives it was essential they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for and where.

One letter omitted from the edition was found at Reading and this, with four letters recently discovered by Ralph Desmarais in the C. D.
