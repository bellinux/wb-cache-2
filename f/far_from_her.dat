25|$|The {{desire to}} {{document}} the jekt as a vessel was still there {{and after the war}} the Nordland fylkesmuseum was urged to buy a new jekt. Anna Karoline was chosen because she was in a relatively original condition and she is the only Nordlandsjekt in such condition that has been preserved. As of 2014 here are three other jekts in Norway. It is the newly built copy of the jekt Brødrene and the jekt Pauline of Steinkjer, the latter is so much repaired and rebuilt that she is <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> original condition. Both are carvel built and sailing, contrary to Anna Karoline which is on land. The Holvikejekta located at Sandane in Western Norway is also ashore and as Anna Karoline she is also clinker built.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, {{she entered}} the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, where she has said {{that for the first}} time in her life, she did not feel like an outsider. In 1961 she won a Fellowship to attend a Summer session at Yale University, where she met Chuck Close and Brice Marden, who would remain close friends. It was during this time she began to study Italian {{monotone}} still life painter Giorgio Morandi, and painted abstract works. In 1962 she graduated from Herron with a BFA, and moved to Venice, Los Angeles, to pursue an MFA at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating in 1965.

She lived in Venice until 1980, painting and sculpting, and working as an instructor at California State College, the University of California, Irvine and California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia.|$|E
25|$|The {{final day}} of the meeting was {{highlighted}} by Martina Ratej's first round Slovenian record throw to win the women's javelin contest, upsetting the defending champion and favourite Mariya Abakumova. Markus Münch provided his second personal best in as many years at the Winter Throwing event, but on this occasion his best was enough to take the gold in the men's discus. Following gold at the 2010 World Indoors, Nadzeya Astapchuk dominated the women's shot put: six of her throws that day were enough to win, although an injury hampered her performance and she was <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> best form. The men's hammer was a close contest with the experienced Nicola Vizzoni just keeping the young Belarusian Yury Shayunou at bay. Sandra Perković was one of the stand-out performers in the under-23s competition: having set a Croatian national record in the discus in the weeks prior to the competition, she won the women's gold with a throw of 61.93m – which would have been enough for a silver medal in the senior ranks.|$|E

500|$|Secrest {{notes that}} much is {{overlooked}} {{in the rush to}} have love conquer all in South Pacific, [...] "questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside. [...] As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love." [...] Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque, [...] "little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand".|$|E
500|$|Tamar outlived her consort, David Soslan, {{and died}} of a [...] "devastating disease" [...] not <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> capital Tbilisi, having {{previously}} crowned her son, Giorgi-Lasha, coregent. Tamar's historian relates that the queen suddenly fell ill when discussing state affairs with her ministers at the Nacharmagevi castle {{near the town of}} Gori. She was transported to Tbilisi and then to the nearby castle of Agarani where Tamar died and was mourned by her subjects. Her remains were transferred to the cathedral of Mtskheta and then to the Gelati monastery, a family burial ground of the Georgian royal dynasty. The traditional scholarly opinion is that Tamar died in 1213, although there are several indications that she might have died earlier, in 1207 or 1210.|$|E

In the interrogation room, Olivia discovers that Jones believes {{she is one of}} the soldiers in his war, having been a test subject on a Massive Dynamic nootropic drug known as [...] "Cortexiphan" [...] when she was a child. Jones claims that she is special, and instructs her to a remote site with a key in his possession to retrieve a package. Olivia follows his instructions, finding a package full of strange puzzles. The first puzzle is a light box containing a number of lights which Jones' instructions require her to disable with her thoughts only. Olivia, having learned from Nina Sharp that the only Cortexiphan trials were done in Ohio, <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> childhood Jacksonville, Florida home, is confident Jones is mistaken.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the book {{suggests}} a pilgrimage, and yet the narrator does not stray <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> home near the creek: the journey is metaphysical. [...] Margaret Loewen Reimer, in one of the first critical studies based on the book, noted that Dillard's treatment of the metaphysical {{is similar to that of}} Herman Melville. [...] While [...] "Melville's eyes saw mainly the darkness and the horror" [...] of the natural world, possibly stemming from his New England Puritan roots, Dillard's [...] "sinister" [...] vision of the world comes [...] "more from a horror at the seeming mindlessness of nature's design than from a deeply pervasive sense of evil." [...] Unlike Melville, however, Dillard does not moralize the natural world or seek to find parallels in human cultural acts; focusing largely on observation as well as scientific analysis, Dillard follows the example of Charles Darwin and other naturalists.|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{received}} generally mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who commended the song's reggae-flavour, but some dismissed Stefani's {{performance on the}} track. Sal Cinquemani wrote for Slant Magazine that the single [...] "doesn't venture too <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> band's established template," [...] claiming that [...] "it finds Stefani effortlessly grooving to a reggae-flavored beat and an admittedly catchy hook, complete with her signature yelp, but it hews {{too close to the}} sound of No Doubt's slept-on sixth album, Push and Shove." [...] Cinquemani also noted that during the song's breakdown [...] "she feels forced, even for the eternally youthful Stefani, on an otherwise breezy track." [...] Bradley Stern wrote for MuuMuse that the song is [...] "dangerously catchy, and an obvious radio smash upon first listen." [...] Nolan Feeney of Time remarked that, [...] "In less capable hands, 'Baby Don't Lie' would leave a weaker impression, but Stefani and all her vocal idiosyncrasies {{find a way to make}} it her own." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Willa Paskin of New York magazine praised Perry's {{looks in the}} video as [...] "detailed, outlandish, [...] semi-gorgeous rainbow-kabuki". Kara Warner from MTV News also praised her appearance in the video, calling her an [...] "angelic alien princess". She also felt the video was Perry's [...] "most complex, stylized and out-there video production yet". Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly felt that West's rap verses helped the song top the Billboard Hot 100, and called the video an [...] "awesomely bizarre sci-fi video, which impressively resists any obvious Spielberg references". Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone described the video as [...] "a sequel to Avatar or a Katy Perry video game", and felt the song and video were [...] "a bold move away from Perry's usual silliness and sexuality". Los Angeles Times described the video as a [...] "sweeping visual manifestation". In a more negative review, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized Perry, saying she looked like an [...] "animated video-game character", while saying West was a [...] "non-presence". Cinquemani later went on to say: [...] "It's a step up from bras that shoot whipped cream and fireworks, but this is ultimately Sigimondi's vision, and it's <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> finest five minutes." [...] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the video for [...] "E.T." [...] won awards for Best Collaboration and Best Special Effects.|$|E

She went off the road on a stage not <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> home town, and again hit a stone wall at over 100km/h (60mph). The car was destroyed, but Mouton and Pons were unharmed. Mouton {{explained}} to her team boss Roland Gumpert, later of Gumpert supercar fame, that she had had to dodge a photographer. Mouton went on to record successive points finishes. She finished fourth in Sweden in a quadruple win for Audi, after an early driving error that had sent her Quattro into a snow bank. In Portugal, Mouton finished second to Mikkola, ahead of Lancia's Röhrl and Markku Alén. After the first section of the Safari Rally, totaling over 1,600km (1,000mi), Mouton arrived to the finish on three wheels and said she was [...] "totally exhausted" [...] from the effort. She eventually placed third behind Opel's Ari Vatanen and her teammate Mikkola. After four events, Mikkola and Mouton were first and second in the drivers' championship.|$|E
