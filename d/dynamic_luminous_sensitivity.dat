40|$|We used {{electroretinography}} (ERG) {{to determine}} spectral and <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> and the temporal resolution (flicker fusion frequency, FFF) in three sympatric (but phylogenetically distant) coastal shark species: Carcharhinus plumbeus (sandbar shark), Mustelus canis (smooth dogfish), and Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish). Spectral sensitivities were similar (range ~ 400 – 600 nm, peak sensitivity ~ 470 nm), {{with a high}} likelihood of rod/cone dichromacy enhancing contrast discrimination. Spiny dogfish were significantly less light sensitive than the other species, whereas their FFF was ~ 19 Hz at maximum intensities; a value {{equal to that of}} sandbar shark and significantly above that of smooth dogfish (~ 9 – 12 Hz). This occurred even though experiments on spiny dogfish were conducted at 12 versus 25 °C and 20 °C for experiments on sandbar shark and smooth dogfish, respectively. Although spiny dogfish have a rod-dominated retina (rod:cone ratio 50 : 1), their visual system appears to have evolved for a relatively high temporal resolution (i. e., high FFF) through a short integration time, with the requisite concomitant reduction in <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Our results suggest adaptive plasticity in the temporal resolution of elasmobranch visual systems which reflects the importance of the ability to track moving objects such as mates, predators, or prey...|$|R

Because the image dissector and echelle grating spectrometer are not commonly used in clinical practice, the basic concepts and characteristics of these components are discussed. A comparison with a silicon target vidicon suggests that the image dissector has a <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity</b> that is 130 to 190 times {{greater than that of}} the vidicon. Multielement detection limits for Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni with the image dissector/echelle spectrometer are lower than with the silicon vidicon by a factor ranging from four to 27, and are comparable to, or better than, single-element detection limits reported for a silicon vidicon and conventional optics.

40|$|Summary The {{absolute}} light sensitivities, temporal properties, and spectral sensitivities of {{the visual}} systems of three mid-Atlantic temperate reef fishes (Atlantic spadefish [Ephippidae: Chaetodipterus faber], tautog [Labridae: Tautoga onitis], and black sea bass [Serranidae: Centropristis striata]) were studied via electroretinography (ERG). Pelagic Atlantic spadefish exhibited higher temporal resolution but a narrower dynamic range than the two more demersal foragers. The higher <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of tautog and black sea bass were similar to other benthic and demersal coastal mid-Atlantic fishes. Flicker fusion frequency experiments revealed significant interspecific differences at maximum intensities that correlated with lifestyle and habitat. Spectral responses of the three species spanned 400 – 610  nm, with high likelihood of cone dichromacy providing the basis for color and contrast discrimination. Significant day-night differences in spectral responses were evident in spadefish and black sea bass but not tautog, a labrid with characteristic structure-associated nocturnal torpor. Atlantic spadefish responded to {{a wider range of}} wavelengths than did deeper-dwelling tautog or black sea bass. Collectively, these results suggest that temperate reef-associated fishes are well-adapted to their gradient of brighter to dimmer photoclimates, representative of their unique ecologies and life histories. Continuing anthropogenic degradation of water quality in coastal environments, at a pace faster than the evolution of visual systems, may however impede visual foraging and reproductive signaling in temperate reef fishes...|$|R
40|$|The aurorae are <b>dynamic,</b> <b>luminous</b> {{displays}} {{that grace}} the night skies of Earth’s high latitude regions. The solar wind {{emanating from the}} Sun is their ultimate energy source, but the chain of plasma physical processes leading to auroral displays is complex. The special conditions at the interface between the solar wind-driven magnetosphere and the ionospheric environment {{at the top of}} Earth’s atmosphere play a central role. In this Auroral Acceleration Region (AAR) persistent electric fields directed along the magnetic field accelerate magnetospheric electrons to the high energies needed to excite luminosity when they hit the atmosphere. The “ideal magnetohydrodynamics” description of space plasmas which is useful in much of the magnetosphere cannot be used to understand the AAR. The AAR has been studied by a small number of single spacecraft missions which revealed an environment rich in wave-particle interactions, plasma turbulence, and nonlinear acceleration processes, acting on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The pioneering 4 -spacecraft Cluster magnetospheric research mission is now fortuitously visiting the AAR, but its particle instruments are too slow to allow resolve many of the key plasma physics phenomena. The Alfvén concept is designed specifically {{to take the next step}} in studying the aurora, by making the crucial high-time resolution, multi-scale measurements in the AAR, needed to address the key science questions of auroral plasma physics. The new knowledge that the mission will produce will find application in studies of the Sun, the processes that accelerate the solar wind and that produce aurora on other planets...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to analog VLSI implementations of algorithms for visual cortical processing is presented. Specifically, we introduce a massively parallel architecture, organized as a planar resistive network with voltage controlled current generators locally connected to model interaction schemata responsible of specific sensitivities in cortical neurons. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by designing and simulating a 24 Θ 24 nodes analog module implementing Gaborlike oriented receptive fields, {{that can be used}} in machine vision real time systems to evidence texture differences. 1 Introduction Visual information is processed in a number of successive stages.

40|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{office buildings}} {{are characterized by}} large glazed surfaces, often located without any consideration about orientation. Without a suitable solar control strategy, this fact implies several problems related to visual comfort, thermal comfort and energy demand, which is mainly related to HVAC and, to a smaller extent, to artificial lighting. Moreover, if the office room is large, the values of physical parameters influencing comfort are relevantly variable from point to point, mainly {{as a function of}} the distance from glazed surfaces. Typically, daylighting requirements of occupants located far from the windows can conflict with the thermal comfort requirements of occupants located next to the windows. In this work a case-study is analysed. It consists in a medium size office room located in a typical office building, in an urban context of the Northern Italy. Different solar control devices and related control logics are compared; their effects on global comfort conditions and energy demand are assessed. The considered devices consist of different kinds of movable external slats, some of which incorporating PV cells. This analysis is performed by means of a specific software: "Ener_Lux", already presented in previous PLEA Congresses. Once defined the kind of devices and the related operating logic, the program simulates the <b>dynamic</b> thermal and <b>luminous</b> behaviour of the physical system, provides various comfort assessment index values and calculates the primary energy demand for HVAC and lightin...|$|R
40|$|Designers {{are often}} asked {{to gauge the}} {{influence}} of an illuminant or a visual signal on the human eye in a particular application. It {{has long been known}} that physical measurement is insufficient for this purpose. This is, in part, because the human sense of vision is not equipped with a competent radiation detector that is independent of wavelength. "The ability to see is a partnership of light and sight [...] . " Photometry, a specification computed from a radiometric measurement, was developed as an attempt to capture what is human about human vision so that the sterile specifications of radiometry might be thus rendered more useful as a predictive tool. As it has developed and matured, photometry has become an exacting tool requiring sometimes extraordinary attention to detail that lies beyond the experience of many of us. But even with appropriate attention to detail, photometry takes account only of the spectral distribution of radiation in comparison to the spectral <b>sensitivity</b> (<b>luminous</b> efficiency) of the observer, {{and the size of the}} pupil. These characteristics of vision arise early in the perceptual chain. Other features of human vision, which vision science is beginning to systematically quantify, may be viewed as additional signposts pointing to the need for a more thorough humanization of radiometry. Visual illusions provide an example as do a variety of visual effects in which the percept is not veridical. This paper will review selected characteristics of human vision that point to the need for moving beyond photometry. Two examples, one involving the use of LED illuminants in traffic signals, and the other showing the theoretical advantages of a modified wing-tip strobe, will be used to illustrate the problem area. It is possible to foresee a future in which designers could use a photometric correction incorporating these additional factors...|$|R
