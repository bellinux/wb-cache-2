5|$|Another helpful {{character}} is a young local girl, who watches the reconstruction efforts <b>from</b> <b>afar,</b> and scampers off when she is seen. The girl, played by Carradine's real life domestic partner, Barbara Hershey, provides a tool box and some food. Detractors of the veteran's efforts include a band of local teenagers, {{one of whom is}} played by John Blyth Barrymore, a personal friend of Carradine's and a frequent guest star on Kung Fu.

5|$|He {{worked at}} Nintendo until 1996, {{when he left}} to work at other {{developers}} including Electronic Arts, Vivendi Games, Midway Games, and THQ. He established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009, and , runs mobile games studio Carried Away Games. After following the fan community <b>from</b> <b>afar,</b> he came out to fans in mid 2012 and the press began to show greater interest in his work. He had planned {{to write a book}} about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea.|$|E
50|$|Another, more serious, {{possibility}} is the African {{shore of the}} Red Sea, with the name perhaps being derived <b>from</b> the <b>Afar</b> {{people living in the}} Danakil desert (Ethiopia, Eritrea) between Adulis and Djibouti.|$|R

5|$|Light showers {{from the}} {{precursor}} front skirted Bermuda prior to tropical development, with 24-hour precipitation totals {{of no more}} than 0.87 in (22mm) recorded on the territory. Moisture brought on by the storm <b>from</b> <b>afar</b> enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in Bermuda; 1.75 in (45mm) of precipitation fell at L.F. Wade International Airport on July 18, with an additional 1.6 in (40mm) recorded the next day. Although the rains proved to be mostly beneficial, minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor-drainage areas.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring this <b>from</b> <b>afar,</b> and {{dissatisfied}} with Dohna's timidity in bringing Saltykov to battle, Frederick sent Carl Heinrich von Wedel to take command. Wedel arrived on 20 July {{and established a}} blocking position at Züllichau. This would prevent the Russians from entering Prussian territory and reaching the Oder. He wanted to attack the Russians at dawn the next day, but could not find an appropriately weak location in the Russian defenses.|$|E
5|$|Samsulbahri (sometimes spelled Sjamsulbahri; {{abbreviated}} Samsu) is {{the primary}} male protagonist. He is described as having skin the colour of langsat, with eyes as black as ink; however, <b>from</b> <b>afar</b> he can be confused with a Dutchman. These physical attributes have been described by Keith Foulcher, a lecturer of Indonesian language and literature at the University of Sydney, as indicating Samsu's mimicry and collaborationist nature. His good looks are also seen as a physical manifestation of his moral and kind nature.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters are a {{group of}} near {{passerine}} birds in the family Meropidae. Most species are found in Africa but others occur in southern Europe, Madagascar, Australia and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies and usually elongated central tail feathers. All are colourful and have long downturned bills and pointed wings, which give them a swallow-like appearance when seen <b>from</b> <b>afar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The usual call is {{an eerie}} high-pitched wailing contact call, kee-ow... kee-ow... kee-ow, made while flying or roosting, {{and can be}} heard <b>from</b> <b>afar.</b> Birds may also make a harsh {{screeching}} alarm call. They also make a soft, chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call with some success.|$|E
5|$|Reshef {{decided to}} change tactics. He {{personally}} commanded the 40th Armored Battalions, after reinforcing it with tanks salvaged and repaired from the previous night's fighting, and maneuvered to attack from the west – {{from the direction of}} the canal – hitting Egyptian positions in the flank, while a tank company and an infantry company attacked from south to north. Reshef's forces engaged the Egyptians from long range, picking off defensive positions <b>from</b> <b>afar,</b> while using alternate fire and movement to advance to the crossroads. The defending infantry battalion, exhausted by continuous fighting and suffering from a severe lack of ammunition, soon withdrew allowing the Israelis to at last seize the junction.|$|E

5|$|The album package {{consists}} of 156 Polaroid photos that unfold into a 2×2 square. The Polaroid photos are seemingly random. One {{of the photos}} featured on the front cover is the eyeball of Dennis Rodman, former Chicago Bulls player and friend of the band, while another photo is of Vedder's foot {{after he had been}} stung by a stingray. The pictures, when viewed <b>from</b> <b>afar,</b> blend to form the No Code triangle/eyeball logo that is the theme throughout the album. The CD and vinyl came with lyrics printed on the back of replica Polaroids. Only nine Polaroids came in a set, leaving one to have to obtain another set to accumulate all thirteen songs.|$|E
5|$|The noise {{eventually}} {{stops and}} James {{returns to the}} house. After she explains what has happened, he finds his car ransacked and the blonde woman watching him <b>from</b> <b>afar.</b> His phone has also had its battery stolen and he realizes the house has been breached. The couple attempt to leave in James' car but a third masked stranger in a pin-up girl mask rear-ends them with a pickup truck, forcing them to flee. Back inside the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun {{and wait for the}} intruders in a bedroom. One of the strangers puts a country record on the turntable, filling the house with music.|$|E
5|$|The {{scale of}} {{camouflage}} patterns {{is related to}} their function. Large structures need larger patterns than individual soldiers to disrupt their shape. At the same time, large patterns are more effective <b>from</b> <b>afar,</b> while small scale patterns work better up close. Traditional single scale patterns work well in their optimal range from the observer, but an observer at other distances will not see the pattern optimally. Nature itself is very often fractal, where plants and rock formations exhibit similar patterns across several magnitudes of scale. The idea behind multi-scale patterns is both to mimic the self-similarity of nature, and also to offer scale invariant or so-called fractal camouflage that works at close range {{as well as at}} traditional combat range.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement <b>from</b> <b>afar.</b> Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has {{specific}} Disciplines, {{which can}} be used in combat and to create approaches to quests. Although some powers overlap clans, no two clans share the same three Disciplines. More physical vampires can enhance themselves to become fast and lethal killers or summon spirit allies to attack their foes; others can mentally dominate their targets to force their cooperation or render themselves invisible to hide from detection; and others can boil their opponent's blood <b>from</b> <b>afar.</b> Some Disciplines, such as Auspex (which boosts perception, highlighting other characters' auras through obstacles) and Blood Buff (which temporarily upgrades strength, dexterity, stamina and lockpicking), are common to all vampires. Several abilities can be active at the same time. Blood is a primary currency in Bloodlines, used to activate Disciplines and abilities. It is drained with each use, and can be replenished by drinking from rats, visiting blood banks or drinking from humans by attacking or seducing them; the player can feed on enemies during combat. Drinking from innocents for too long can kill them, costing a character humanity points.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music <b>from</b> <b>afar.</b> Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, (or Main Ethiopian Rift or Ethiopian Rift Valley) is {{a branch}} of the East African Rift that runs through Ethiopia in a {{southwest}} direction <b>from</b> the <b>Afar</b> Triple Junction.
