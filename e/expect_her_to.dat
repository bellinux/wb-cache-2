5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way. In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
25|$|When Lawrence became romantically {{involved}} with Wall Street banker Bert Taylor in 1927, Astley proposed marriage, an offer Lawrence refused {{because she knew}} Astley would <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave the stage and settle in rural England. The two remained close until he married actress Madeleine Carroll in 1931. When Lawrence divorced Gordon-Howley, she and Taylor became engaged and remained so for two years, with each free to enjoy a social life separate from the other.|$|E

She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|Sue Ellen's storylines in {{the first}} season focus on the character's bout with alcohol and her slowly deteriorating {{relationship}} with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on {{the birth of her}} son with J.R., John Ross Ewing III. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: [...] "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be interesting." [...] Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, the NFL had coyly {{revealed}} the show's set list in its magazine: [...] "Though Madonna's set list was not officially announced at press time, fans might <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> give all her luvin', provide {{a ray of}} light and be in vogue with her music". Before the show, Madonna {{expressed concern about the}} physical and time constraints of the event. [...] "I have eight minutes to set up my stage, 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth, and I have seven minutes to take it down. So, that football field is clean for {{the second half of the}} game", she said. [...] "How do you do that? This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out." [...] The singer's plan to have 100 drummers descend from the stadium ceiling was cancelled, since the structure could not support the weight.|$|E
500|$|René Pérez Joglar, who {{performs}} {{as the lead}} singer of Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band {{under the name of}} Residente, appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Gordita". He explained the conception of the song, in which he raps about the fact that [...] "he liked Shakira better when — early in her career: she was chubbier, had dark hair and was a rock chick", by saying that [...] "I told her (Shakira) {{it was a good idea}} to make fun of yourself. That way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it". British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of [...] "Loca". He said that he felt [...] "honoured" [...] that Shakira chose him for the song, by saying that [...] "She's a bit of a trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale. You'd <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> use an American rapper (for the song), but she chose me. It meant a lot".|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{responded to}} the PTC's {{criticism}} on Twitter, and said that parents should not <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> parent their children and that [...] "touchy subject matters" [...] should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape. The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive. And we decided to hone in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've been victimized in this scenario." [...] Rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions.|$|E

500|$|In Pinafore, Sullivan {{exploits}} minor keys for comic effect, {{for instance}} in [...] "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes {{was impressed with the}} introduction to the opening chorus which includes [...] "a rousing nautical tune... in a key of no nonsense, C major... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of [...] "Sorry her lot" [...] in 2/4 [...] After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." [...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make it so hard to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E

500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara {{will be able to do}} anything that you'd <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about what someone with her abilities should be able to do in an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up in March 2010, Minaj revealed the title to the song, and Garrett later hinted around details around his single with Minaj, stating, [...] "I just did Nicki’s first single featuring me. It’s gonna be a fucking bomb. It’s very, very explosive! It’s a club banger. It’s a lot broader than what people would <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come with. The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1952 Hellman {{was called}} to testify before HUAC, which had heard {{testimony}} that she had attended Communist Party meetings in 1937. She initially drafted a statement that said her two-year membership in the Communist Party had ended in 1940, {{but she did not}} condemn the party nor express regret for her participation in it. Her attorney, Joseph Rauh, opposed her admission of membership on technical grounds because she had attended meetings, but never formally become a party member. He warned that the committee and the public would <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take a strong anti-communist stand to atone for her political past, but she refused to apologize or denounce the party. Faced with Hellman's position, Rauh devised a strategy that produced favorable press coverage and allowed her to avoid the stigma of being labeled a [...] "Fifth Amendment Communist". On May 19, 1952, Hellman authored a letter to HUAC that one historian has described as [...] "written not to persuade the Committee, but to shape press coverage." [...] In it she explained her willingness to testify only about herself and that {{she did not want to}} claim her rights under the Fifth Amendment–"I am ready and willing to testify before the representatives of our Government as to my own actions, regardless of any risks or consequences to myself." [...] She wrote that she found the legal requirement that she testify about others if she wanted to speak about her own actions [...] "difficult for a layman to understand." [...] Rauh had the letter delivered to the HUAC's chairman Rep. John S. Wood on Monday.|$|E
2500|$|This {{terminology}} was {{popularized by}} the Roman Catholic priest Andrew Greeley who wrote:The central symbol (of religion) is God. One's [...] "picture" [...] of God {{is in fact}} a metaphorical narrative of God's relationship with the world and the self as part of the world. ...The Catholic [...] "classics" [...] assume a God who is present in the world, disclosing Himself in and through creation. The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be somewhat like God. The Protestant classics, on the other hand, assume a God who is radically absent from the world, and who discloses (Himself) only on rare occasions (especially in Jesus Christ and Him crucified). The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be radically different from God.Runar Eldebo, a Swedish seminary instructor and correspondent for Pietisten (an online ecumenical newsletter), provided a Lutheran slant on Greeley's distinction between Catholic imagination and Protestant imagination. Invoking Karl Barth, Eldebo wrote:Protestant imagination is dialectic and makes people pilgrims. It is deep in conflict and antagonistic to the ingredients of a common, human life. Catholic imagination is analogical. It is founded in creation itself and views creation as God in disguise. According to Catholic imagination, God lurks everywhere. According to Protestant imagination, Karl Barth for example, God is hidden everywhere but found only in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Therefore, according to Greeley, Protestants are never at home on earth, they are pilgrims on their way. Catholics, meanwhile, like to dwell on earth. They enjoy life and are not {{in a hurry to get}} to heaven because God lurks everywhere, especially where you do not <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be.|$|E
2500|$|Radio City Music Hall {{selected}} {{the film to}} be its Easter attraction. The film was a US box-office failure and many reviews, particularly those for Ball, were particularly brutal; the movie has a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Time Magazine said, [...] "The movie spans about 20 years, and seems that long in running time [...] [...] [...] Miss Ball has been molded over the years {{into some sort of}} national monument, and she performs like one too. Her grace, her timing, her vigor have all vanished." [...] Time Out London declared she [...] "simply hasn't the drive and steel of a Rosalind Russell, an Angela Lansbury or a Ginger Rogers, all of whom played the part before her," [...] and said of Saks, [...] "When he's not ogling his star in perpetual soft focus and a $300,000 fashion parade, [...] fails to get enough retakes, match his shots, or inject the essential vim." [...] Pauline Kael in The New Yorker wondered, [...] "After forty years in movies and TV, did she discover in herself an unfulfilled ambition to be a flaming drag queen?" [...] The New Republics Stanley Kauffman, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role [...] "fifteen years earlier," [...] described her as [...] "too old, too stringy in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints." [...] Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed {{going so far as to}} suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role.
