A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Prig, looking steadfastly at her friend, put {{her hand}} in her pocket, and {{with an air of}} surly triumph drew forth either the oldest of {{lettuces}} or youngest of cabbages, but at any rate, a <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> of an expansive nature, and of such magnificent proportions that she was obliged to shut it up like an umbrella before she could pull it out. She also produced a handful of mustard and cress, a trifle of the herb called dandelion, three bunches of radishes, an onion rather larger than an average turnip, three substantial slices of beetroot, and a short prong or antler of celery; the whole of this garden-stuff having been publicly exhibited, but a short time before, as a twopenny salad, and purchased by Mrs Prig on condition that the vendor could get it all into her pocket. Which had been happily accomplished, in High Holborn, to the breathless interest of a hackney-coach stand. And she laid so little stress on this surprising forethought, that she did not even smile, but returning her pocket into its accustomed sphere, merely recommended that these productions of nature should be sliced up, for immediate consumption, in plenty of vinegar.|$|E
