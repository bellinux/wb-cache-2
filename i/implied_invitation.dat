In New Jersey Coalition Against War in the Middle East v. JMB Realty Corp.

Despite the broad powers granted to those seeking to use these facilities as public forums, mall owners retain the right to establish regulations regulating the time, place and manner of exercising [...] of freedom of speech rights on their properties.|$|E
60|$|After he {{had been}} with her {{three or four times}} it struck him that to have come at last into her house had had the horrid effect of {{diminishing}} their intimacy. He had known her better, had liked her in greater freedom, when they merely walked together or kneeled together. Now they only pretended; before they had been nobly sincere. They began to try their walks again, but it proved a lame imitation, for these things, from the first, beginning or ending, had been connected with their visits to the church. They had either strolled away as they came out or gone in to rest on the return. Stransom, besides, now faltered; he couldn’t walk as of old. The omission made everything false; it was a dire mutilation of their lives. Our friend was frank and monotonous, making no mystery of his remonstrance and no secret of his predicament. Her response, whatever it was, always came to the same thing—an <b>implied</b> <b>invitation</b> to him to judge, if he spoke of predicaments, of how much comfort she had in hers. For him indeed was no comfort even in complaint, since every allusion to what had befallen them but made the author of their trouble more present. Acton Hague was between them—that was the essence of the matter, and never so much between them as when they were face to face. Then Stransom, while still wanting to banish him, had the strangest sense of striving for an ease that would involve having accepted him. Deeply disconcerted by what he knew, he was still worse tormented by really not knowing. Perfectly aware {{that it would have been}} horribly vulgar to abuse his old friend or to tell his companion the story of their quarrel, it yet vexed him that her depth of reserve should give him no opening and should have the effect of a magnanimity greater even than his own.|$|E

40|$|The {{human mind}} assimilates {{information}} and experiences quickly and constantly, and is aided by mental systems that {{we rely on}} to function. We classify the input of our lives with extreme efficiency. Our notions about the things we encounter {{in the world are}} learned from past experiences, and these expectations help us file the data of our lives. My work is composed to create pause. I am interested in slowing down the processes of assimilation by manipulating our expectations, and extending events measured in microseconds into saturated and engaging experiences. Functional qualities, visual rhythms, and exaggerated proportions are some of the elements I employ in the objects I make to quietly challenge our preconceived notions and our expectations. The importance of genuine utility in my ceramic work is precluded by the desire to borrow a certain quality from the vocabulary usable objects: familiarity. Pottery contains an <b>implied</b> <b>invitation.</b> The intentional placement of openings, lids, and handles in my work conveys the specificity of function, clarifying that the objects I make have an intended purpose. The exact function is less obvious, and a situation is created that pairs a sense of knowing with a sense of mystery. The desire to identify the purpose of an object is an open invitation for continued exploration. Scrutiny and inspection reveal both undulations in edges once considered straight and subtle variations on flat planes. These details act as rewards for a heightened level of engagement. The objects I make exhibit a compositional preference for repetition over variety, and I position repeated elements in regular, metered fashion. This allows the eye to travel predictable paths across my work. A rhythm develops, with a cadence that promotes a rambling exploration of the form. Edges and lines are also measured, and they exhibit a confident, grounded quality that guides visual investigation in a steady and considered way. The mild restlessness of the viewer, caused by their derailed expectations, is placated by regularity. Vessels for containment are, by their own nature, the product of a desire for order. They are tools to categorize our environment, and provide place by defining the spaces they create. The interior spaces in my work are made special by manipulating access to them. Sometimes small lids open into large spaces, other times lids are large enough to require special attention during removal, and some interiors are difficult or impossible to reach. Given these circumstances, the vessels most often contain only a rarefied space. Simply reaching the interior, literally or visually, is an event, a private ritual, that is a self-justifying endeavor. My work displays an attraction to a massing of materials. Industrial architecture and earthen construction are related to the solid volumes in the forms, and the masses I make contribute to an ironic sense of small-scale monumentality. The exaggerated proportions of my work maintain compositional balance through the careful manipulation of a variety of visual elements, including volume and mass and the delicate placement of details. The objects I make appear to be probing their own identity in a subtle and playful way, intentionally undermining their apparent seriousness. Upon investigation, a codified order both mysterious and liberating emerges in the work, and makes it resonate with my intentions. The objects I make are simultaneously an anthropological study and an artistic endeavor, and incorporate an attempt to understand the world we live in, through making. My work has been informed by particular objects, including Japanese Mingei, or folk craft. Not exclusive to that country, but found worldwide, handmade objects have the ability to be fully embedded within the cultures in which they are found, and to reflect the lifestyles and social conditions of the maker. I intend the same level of integration between my work and the society from which it draws. I use surfaces that refer to a variety of sources, and include shiny glazes and polished slips. This use of various treatments helps prolong the assignment of a clear historical lineage to the work. Instead, it can both be rooted in the present and also have a sense of being from elsewhere. By focusing on a rudimentary treatment of the surface, the form of an object I make takes center stage. The composed nature of my work reflects the quiet focus of my investigations. I have a disciplined approach, aimed at augmenting one 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with his or her surroundings by creating objects that contain cryptic lessons. I appreciate the idea that the forms I make have a challenging complexity that can be read on multiple levels. When one pauses, then engages in an unspoken conversation with the objects I make, my intentions have been realized. Adviser: Peter Pinnel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} {{correlates of}} adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines in average-risk Canadians. Methods 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2. 1 respondents {{who were at}} least 50 years old, without past or present CRC and living in Ontario, Newfoundland, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia were included. Outcomes, defined according to current CRC screening guidelines, included adherence to: i) fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (in prior 2 years), ii) endoscopy (colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy) (prior 10 years), and iii) adherence to CRC screening guidelines, defined as either (i) or (ii). Generalized estimating equations regression was employed to identify correlates of the study outcomes. Results Of the 17, 498 respondents, 70 % were non-adherent CRC screening to guidelines. Specifically, 85 % and 79 % were non-adherent to FOBT and endoscopy, respectively. Correlates for all outcomes were: having a regular physician (OR = (i) 2. 68; (ii) 1. 91; (iii) 2. 39), getting a flu shot (OR = (i) 1. 59; (ii) 1. 51; (iii) 1. 55), and having a chronic condition (OR = (i) 1. 32; (ii) 1. 48; (iii) 1. 43). Greater physical activity, higher consumption {{of fruits and vegetables}} and smoking cessation were each associated with at least 1 outcome. Self-perceived stress was modestly associated with increased odds of adherence to endoscopy and to CRC screening guidelines (OR = (ii) 1. 07; (iii) 1. 06, respectively). Conclusion Healthy lifestyle behaviors and factors that motivate people to seek health care were associated with adherence, <b>implying</b> that <b>invitations</b> for CRC screening should come from sources that are independent of physicians, such as the government, in order to reduce disparities in CRC screening. </p...|$|R

40|$|Goal pursuit {{implies that}} people {{have the freedom to}} set {{themselves}} goals they want and can reach, and that they can strive for at their own pace using their own means. As cultures and political systems vary widely regarding the freedom they allow for such goal setting and goal striving, socio-cultural contexts should infl uence whether and how goal setting and goal striving occurs. For example, in a culture with binding norms of social reciprocity, accepting a dinner <b>invitation</b> <b>implies</b> that the guest will reciprocate in a form that matches the original event. To the contrary, in a culture where such norms have been fading, accepting such an invitation leaves the guest with the freedom to invite the host back or not; and even if she commits to returning the favor, she still has full freedom of when, where, and how to enact it. The role of culture in goal pursuit may thus be discussed at various levels of analysis. First, cultural norms and values might affect the determinants of goal setting and goal striving, desirability, and feasibility. Does culture affect what future outcomes and behaviors are perceived as desirable and thus qualify as 9 G oal P ursuit in the C ontext of C ultur...|$|R
6000|$|I observed, as I drew near, {{that he was}} not so rude as I had anticipated, for he kept many cattle, {{and dogs}} to watch them, and I saw where he had made maple-sugar {{on the sides of the}} mountains, and above all {{distinguished}} the voices of children mingling with the murmur of the torrent before the door. As I passed his stable I met one whom I supposed to be a hired man, attending to his cattle, and I inquired if they entertained travellers at that house. [...] "Sometimes we do," [...] he answered, gruffly, and immediately went to the farthest stall from me, and I perceived that it was Rice himself whom I had addressed. But pardoning this incivility to the wildness of the scenery, I bent my steps to the house. There was no sign-post before it, nor any of the usual invitations to the traveller, though I saw by the road that many went and came there, but the owner's name only was fastened to the outside; a sort of <b>implied</b> and sullen <b>invitation,</b> as I thought. I passed from room to room without meeting any one, till I came to what seemed the guests' apartment, which was neat, and even had an air of refinement about it, and I was glad to find a map against the wall which would direct me on my journey on the morrow. At length I heard a step in a distant apartment, which was the first I had entered, and went to see if the landlord had come in; but it proved to be only a child, one of those whose voices I had heard, probably his son, and between him and me stood in the doorway a large watch-dog, which growled at me, and looked as if he would presently spring, but the boy did not speak to him; and when I asked for a glass of water, he briefly said, [...] "It runs in the corner." [...] So I took a mug from the counter and went out of doors, and searched round the corner of the house, but could find neither well nor spring, nor any water but the stream which ran all along the front. I came back, therefore, and, setting down the mug, asked the child if the stream was good to drink; whereupon he seized the mug, and, going to the corner of the room, where a cool spring which issued from the mountain behind trickled through a pipe into the apartment, filled it, and drank, and gave it to me empty again, and, calling to the dog, rushed out of doors. Erelong some of the hired men made their appearance, and drank at the spring, and lazily washed themselves and combed their hair in silence, and some sat down as if weary, and fell asleep in their seats. But all the while I saw no women, though I sometimes heard a bustle in that part of the house from which the spring came.|$|R
