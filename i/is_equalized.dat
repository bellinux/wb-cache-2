25|$|In this XX/XO sex {{determination}} system, gene expression on the X chromosome <b>is</b> <b>equalized</b> by downregulating expression of genes on both X chromosomes of hermaphroditic XX organisms by half. In these XX organisms, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is assembled on both X chromosomes {{to allow for}} this tightly regulated change in transcription levels. The DCC is often compared to the condensin complex, which is conserved across the mitotic and meiotic processes of many species. This complex {{is crucial to the}} condensation and segregation of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Because data substantiates the theory that dosage compensation in other species is caused by chromatin-wide modifications, many theorize that the DCC in particular functions similar to the condensin complex in its ability to condense or remodel the chromatin of the X chromosome.|$|E
500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which <b>is</b> <b>equalized</b> to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{thermodynamic}} system, {{differences in}} pressure, density, and temperature all tend to equalize over time. For example, consider a room containing {{a glass of}} melting ice as one system. The difference in temperature between the warm room and the cold glass of ice and water <b>is</b> <b>equalized</b> as heat from the room is transferred to the cooler ice and water mixture. Over time {{the temperature of the}} glass and its contents and the temperature of the room achieve balance. The entropy of the room has decreased. However, the entropy of the glass of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the room has decreased. In an isolated system, such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler regions always results in a net increase in entropy. [...] Thus, when the system of the room and ice water system has reached temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at its maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.|$|E

However, considering {{the high number of}} sounds, a preliminary experiment of loudness equalization would have been quite long. As a consequence, the sounds' loudnesses <b>were</b> <b>equalized</b> with regard to the value given by the loudness model of Zwicker and Fastl [24].|$|R
30|$|Additionally, {{we would}} like to {{highlight}} that just as a single-carrier channel can <b>be</b> <b>equalized</b> in the frequency domain, it is also possible to equalize an OFDM channel in the time domain. Due to the similarity, we again refer the reader to Appendix 3 for a detailed mathematical derivation of the time-domain method. The question in which domain the wideband channel should <b>be</b> <b>equalized,</b> shall <b>be</b> addressed in the following section.|$|R
2500|$|Disc herniations {{can result}} from general wear and tear, such as {{constant}} sitting or squatting, driving, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, herniations can also result from the lifting of heavy loads. Professional athletes, especially those playing contact sports such as American football, are prone to disc herniations as well. Within such an athletic context, herniation is often the result of sudden blunt impacts against, or abrupt bending or torsional movements of, the lower back. When the spine is straight, such as in standing or lying down, internal pressure <b>is</b> <b>equalized</b> on {{all parts of the}} discs. While sitting or bending to lift, internal pressure on a disc can move from 17 psi (lying down) to over 300 psi (lifting with a rounded back)[...] Herniation of the contents of the disc into the spinal canal often occurs when the anterior side (stomach side) of the disc is compressed while sitting or bending forward, and the contents (nucleus pulposus) get pressed against the tightly stretched and thinned membrane (anulus fibrosus) on the posterior side (back side) of the disc. The combination of membrane thinning from stretching and increased internal pressure (200 to 300 psi) results in the rupture of the confining membrane. The jelly-like contents of the disc then move into the spinal canal, pressing against the spinal nerves, which may produce intense and potentially disabling pain and other symptoms.|$|E
60|$|Great merriment {{has been}} excited in the Old Country because {{years ago the}} first English {{travelers}} found that the class of persons by them denominated servants were in America denominated help or helpers. But the term was the very best exponent {{of the state of}} society. There were few servants in the European sense of the word; there was a society of educated workers, where all were practically equal, and where, if there was a deficiency in one family and an excess in another, a helper, not a servant, was hired. Mrs. Brown, who has six sons and no daughters, enters into agreement with Mrs. Jones, who has six daughters and no sons. She borrows a daughter, and pays her good wages to help in her domestic toil, and sends a son to help the labors of Mr. Jones. These two young people go into the families in which they are to be employed in all respects as equals and companions, and so the work of the community <b>is</b> <b>equalized.</b> Hence arose, and for many years continued, a state of society more nearly solving than any other ever did the problem of combining the highest culture of the mind with the highest culture of the muscles and the physical faculties.|$|E

The probe enters the drogue, and its tip is grasped by soft-capture latches which are then retracted using electrically-driven motors to provide close alignment.

5000|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances, antibubbles are short-lived. An {{air bubble}} with a soap skin may last several minutes. Antibubbles often have lifetimes {{of a few}} seconds or less; however, if the electrical potential between {{the inner and outer}} fluid <b>is</b> <b>equalized,</b> antibubbles can last as long as, or longer than, air bubbles. Antibubbles with a lifetime of at least tens of hours can be produced by adsorbing colloidal particles at the air-water interfaces of the antibubble.|$|E
50|$|With this technique, {{the signal}} feeding the {{side-chain}} of a dynamic range compressor <b>is</b> <b>equalized</b> or filtered {{so that the}} sibilant frequencies are most prominent. As a result, the compressor only reduces {{the level of the}} signal when there is a high level of sibilance. This reduces the level over the entire frequency range. Because of this, attack and release times are extremely important, and threshold settings cannot be placed as low as with other types of de-essing techniques without experiencing more blatant sound artifacts.|$|E

50|$|An {{elliptic}} filter (also {{known as}} a Cauer filter, named after Wilhelm Cauer, or as a Zolotarev filter, after Yegor Zolotarev) is a signal processing filter with equalized ripple (equiripple) behavior in both the passband and the stopband. The amount of ripple in each band is independently adjustable, and no other filter of equal order can have a faster transition in gain between the passband and the stopband, for the given values of ripple (whether the ripple <b>is</b> <b>equalized</b> or not). Alternatively, one may give up the ability to adjust independently the passband and stopband ripple, and instead design a filter which is maximally insensitive to component variations.|$|E
