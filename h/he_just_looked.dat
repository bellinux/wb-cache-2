25|$|During in Huiyang, Holmes {{was under}} the command of Colonel (later Sir) Douglas Clague. He was {{assigned}} to deal with external affairs and to co-operate closely with the guerillas of the East River Column (東江縱隊). With the help from the guerillas, Holmes had organised a number of rescue plans trying to save the prisoners of war from the Japanese concentration camps and had conducted espionage in the Japanese-occupied region. According to the recollection of Paui Tsui, Holmes and his companions once secretly entered Hong Kong and reached the foot of Lion Rock. From the foot of the mountain, he used binoculars to spy the concentration camp far away in To Kwa Wan regardless the potential danger of being discovered by the Japanese. Fortunately, although Holmes was a Westerner, the Japanese had never recognised that the fluent Cantonese speaker was in fact a British. Tsui explained the reason was because Holmes was not huge physically and with the disguise of wearing bamboo hat and grey linen clothing, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> the same as a common Chinese farmer. His bravery was appreciated by the British government that he was awarded a Military Cross in early 1943 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) of the Military Division a few months later. It was rare at that time to be decorated twice in a single year.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{described}} {{his account of}} the litigation: [...] "Erhard sent seven lawyers to the courtroom; I had one. They argued I was taking illegal liberty with the most incredible educational system in existence, and that I must be stopped immediately. The judge must have thought that we were arguing over some might trivial scribblings, because <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> up quizzingly over his Franklin specs and threw the whole case right out the door." [...] Erhard filed three lawsuits against Frederick, claiming copyright infringement. All of est/Erhard's suits were ruled 'nuisance claims'and summarily [...] "thrown out of court" [...] in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
50|$|The voice {{suggests}} that Billy first {{tries to make}} contact with boys through internet. Disgusted by the kinky ads he reads, Billy says he won't send a pic as a reply and that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> for someone to talk to ("Clickin' for dick").|$|R
5000|$|Jake Novoa (Richard Lawrence-O'Bryan)Jax's father, he is {{a charming}} yet {{dangerous}} wizard who {{is obsessed with}} power. He seems evil, but <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> out for his kids. He is first introduced in season 2 when Jax is video chatting Jake. In season 4, Jake comes to Miami.|$|R
50|$|After Giles {{agrees to}} look up {{information}} on the Chumash people, and Buffy leaves, Angel appears from Giles's back room, having come to Sunnydale because his friend {{had a vision of}} Buffy in danger. Willow goes to get coffee and runs into Angel. He tells her <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> out for Buffy because she might be in trouble.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was sorry}} for the kid. I told him so in a fatherly kind of way. And <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at me and says, 'Thanks very much, Henry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{what the}} woman {{we had in}} to wash him said. She said <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> {{as if he was}} asleep, he looked that {{peaceful}} and resigned. No one would think he'd make such a beautiful corpse." ...|$|E
60|$|Katie was {{standing}} {{looking out of}} the window. She turned as the door opened, and then she saw Andy. Her lips parted, {{as if she was}} going to say something, but she didn't say nothing. And Andy, he didn't say nothing, neither. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked,</b> and she just looked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> over my shoulder," [...] I replied. [...] "Shall I {{speak to}} him? I'd {{like to know}} what he intends to do next." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding this piece, Young {{claims that}} this {{performance}} {{makes clear that}} even a butterfly makes sound. [...] "A person should listen to what <b>he</b> ordinarily <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> at, or look at things <b>he</b> would ordinarily <b>just</b> hear." ...|$|R
2500|$|Moss {{has participated}} in, founded, and financed many {{charitable}} endeavors {{since joining the}} NFL, particularly aimed at helping children. Many times when talking about his charity work, he has said <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> forward to [...] "seeing smiles." [...] He has donated clothing and food to needy families, given away free backpacks to Boston area school-children, and hosted autograph signings. He has also bussed children to amusement parks, NBA games, and even NFL games {{in which he has}} played.|$|R
60|$|Lord Rotherwood was {{standing}} by the counter, reading so intently that he did not see his cousins' arrival. When they entered <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> up, shook hands, asked after Ada, and went on reading. Lily began looking for some books for the school, which she had long wished for, and was now able to purchase; Emily sat down in a melancholy, abstracted mood, and Florence and Jane stood together talking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Faith. [...] "The {{people that}} are buried here weren't any better than other folks, Una. But when anyone is dead you mustn't say {{anything}} of him but good or he'll come back and ha'nt you. Aunt Martha told me that. I asked father {{if it was true}} and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> through me and muttered, 'True? True? What is truth? What IS truth, O jesting Pilate?' I concluded from that it must be true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then while I was {{fumbling with}} my water-bottle, he collapsed. He {{forgot all about}} Ortheris. Suddenly he said {{something}} that cut me all to ribbons. His face puckered up just like {{the face of a}} fretful child which refuses to go to bed. 'I didn't want to be aut of it,' he said petulantly. 'And I'm done!' And then--then <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> discontented and miserable and died--right off. Turned his head a little way over. As if he was impatient at everything. Fainted--and fluttered out.|$|E
6000|$|... "An' that minds me that they've putt the wee laddie Splint into blue tights wi' brass buttons. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like {{an uncanny}} sort o' speeder! It's a daft-like dress for onything but a puggy, but the bairn's as prood o't {{as if it}} was quite reasonable. It maitters little what he putts on, hooiver, for he wad joke an' cut capers, baith pheesical an' intellectual, I verily believe, if he was gaun to be hanged! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Penguin is {{referred}} to multiple times in Beware the Batman. In [...] "Animal", Harvey Dent and his Special Crime Unit {{are looking at a}} sketch of the Penguin, with Dent wondering if <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like a penguin or actually is one. In [...] "Epitaph", a newspaper read by a cop has a headline about [...] "Penguin Man" [...] sightings. In the same episode, a news report ticker displays the headline [...] "Oswald Cobblepot identified as the 'Penguin Man'".|$|R
50|$|He is {{a seven-year-old}} boy who idolizes Lovely Singh. He also loves gadgets. He helps Lovely Singh catch Anthony and helps Anthony escape when Lovely Singh manages to catch him. <b>He</b> is <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for fun.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell you," [...] said George, {{wiping his}} mouth; [...] "wife, these times are quite another thing {{from what it}} used to be down in Georgia. I {{remember}} then old mas'r used to hire me out by the year; and one time, I remember, I came and paid him in two hundred dollars--every cent I'd taken. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> it over, counted it, and put it in his pocket book, and said, 'You are a good boy, George'--and he gave me half a dollar!" ...|$|E
6000|$|FALDER. When I went there--they were at supper--my sister {{wanted to}} give me a kiss--I know. But <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at her, and said: [...] "What have you come for?" [...] Well, I {{pocketed}} my pride and I said: [...] "Aren't you going to give me your hand, Jim? Cis is, I know," [...] I said. [...] "Look here!" [...] he said, [...] "that's all very well, but we'd better come to an understanding. I've been expecting you, and I've made up my mind. I'll give you fifteen pounds to go to Canada with." [...] "I see," [...] I said--"good riddance! No, thanks; keep your fifteen pounds." [...] Friendship's a queer thing when you've been where I have.|$|E
6000|$|... "When," [...] {{said our}} friend slowly, [...] "I'd had my fill of watching, I {{covered it with}} a rug, took this fellow away with me, and went to bed. There {{was nothing else to}} do. At dawn I was awakened by three dreadful cries--not like a dog's at all. I hurried down. There was the poor beast--wriggled out from under the rug-stretched on its side, dead. This fellow of mine had {{followed}} me in, and he went and sat down by the body. When I spoke to him <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> round, and wagged his tail along the ground, but would not come away; and there he sat till it was buried, very interested, but not sorry at all." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "That song {{is about}} {{the person in the}} world that I hate more than Saddam Hussein," [...] Rose said. [...] "It was good {{to be able to get}} that stuff off my chest because I was able to express myself without doing {{anything}} stupid that would get me in trouble." [...] Guitarist John Connolly also noted, [...] "Dez is just a piece of shit. <b>He’s</b> <b>just</b> one of those people where, he’s basically a bad person. There’s good people and bad people in this world, and <b>he’s</b> <b>just,</b> <b>he</b> wants to be a good person and he wants to act like a good person, but <b>he’s</b> really <b>just</b> a bad dude and <b>he’s</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> out for himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He may {{not have}} been staring at me. Probably, <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> the way the ship was going, and {{thinking}} of some girl in New York. I don't think you can make much of a romance out of it, father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Skene, disparagingly. [...] "But ain't <b>HE</b> the gentleman! <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> at him. It's {{like the}} Prince of Wales walking down Pall Mall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just then, I remember," [...] {{the doctor}} went on suddenly, [...] "the bells of St. Jude's close by began to peal {{out for the}} finish of a wedding. That brought Godwin back to life. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> from one woman to the other with a queer, miserable sort of smile, enough to make your heart break. And they both looked at him. The face of the wife--poor thing!--was as bitter hard as a cut stone, but she sat there, without ever {{stirring}} a finger. As for the other woman--I couldn't look at her. He beckoned to me; but I couldn't catch his words, the bells drowned them. A minute later he was dead.|$|E
60|$|I {{was afraid}} I {{should never be}} able to forgive Jimmy. I couldn't sleep a wink that night, and I cooked that dinner next day in a terrible state of mind. Every ring that came at the door made my heart jump,--but in the end Jimmy didn't ring at all, but just walked in with his uncle in tow. The minute I saw Joseph P. I knew I needn't be scared of him; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> real common. He was little and thin and kind of bored-looking, with grey hair and whiskers, and his clothes were next door to downright shabbiness. If it hadn't been for the thought of that chef, I wouldn't have felt a bit ashamed of my old-fashioned Thanksgiving spread.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say that young Andy showed us all jolly quick that he hadn't come home just to be an {{ornament}} about the place. There was exactly one boss in the restaurant, and it was him. It come a little hard at first {{to have to be}} respectful to a kid whose head you had spent many a happy hour clumping for his own good in the past; but he pretty soon showed me I could do it if I tried, and I done it. As for Jules and the two young fellers that had been taken on to help me owing to increase of business, they would jump through hoops and roll over if <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at them. He was a boy who liked his own way, was Andy, and, believe me, at MacFarland's Restaurant he got it.|$|E
5000|$|Mike casually asks Katherine {{to marry}} him and she excitedly says yes. She wonders what brought on his {{proposal}} and he answers, [...] "Just seems like the right time." [...] But when she goes to hug him, she sees what <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at: Jackson and Susan.|$|R
40|$|Jimmy Finger {{lived in}} the {{apartment}} directly above. It was 1973, and I was seven. Jimmy was two years older and attended what his mother called the “special school,” suggesting that Jimmy went there {{because he was a}} genius. And he looked like a genius to me: plastic-framed glasses, uncombed hair, filthy clothes. In the only photo that I have of him, he looks like he’s trapped inside of an invisible jail cell. He’s screaming, his arms are raised over his head as though he’s pounding at bars no one can see, and his glasses are crooked. He looks like an insane genius. Or maybe <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> insane...|$|R
60|$|While {{the duchess}} was speaking, she {{was seated in}} her boudoir, looking into the Green Park; the duke's horses were in the courtyard, and {{he was about to}} ride down to the House of Lords; <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in, as was his custom, to say {{farewell}} till they met again.|$|R
6000|$|St. John arrived first. I had entreated {{him to keep}} {{quite clear}} of the house till {{everything}} was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, [...] "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?" [...] I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got {{him to make the}} tour of the house. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.|$|E
60|$|He quickened {{his pace}} {{as he left}} the Piazza, and after two or three {{turnings}} he paused in a quiet street before a door at which he gave a light and peculiar knock. It was opened by a young woman whom he chucked under the chin as he asked her if the Padrone was within, and he then passed, without further ceremony, through another door which stood ajar on his right-hand. It admitted him into a handsome but untidy room, where Dolfo Spini sat playing with a fine stag-hound which alternately snuffed at a basket of pups and licked his hands with that, affectionate disregard of her master's morals sometimes held {{to be one of the}} most agreeable attributes of her sex. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> up as Tito entered, but continued his play, simply from that disposition to persistence in some irrelevant action, by which slow-witted sensual people seem to be continually counteracting their own purposes. Tito was patient.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything's all right," [...] {{he shouted}} jubilantly. [...] "I told father right off, licketty-split, {{as soon as}} I got home," [...] he added when he reached us. [...] "I was anxious to have it over with. I says, solemn-like, 'Dad, there's {{something}} I've got to tell you, and I don't know how you'll take it, but it can't be helped,' I says. Dad looked pretty sober, and he says, says he, 'What have you been up to, Peter? Don't be afraid to tell me. I've been forgiven to seventy times seven, so surely I can forgive a little, too?' 'Well,' I says, desperate-like, 'the truth is, father, I'm a Presbyterian. I {{made up my mind}} last summer, the time of the Judgment Day, that I'd be a Presbyterian, and I've got to stick to it. I'm sorry I can't be a Methodist, like you and mother and Aunt Jane, but I can't and that's all there is to it,' I says. Then I waited, scared-like. But father, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> relieved and he says, says he, 'Goodness, boy, you can be a Presbyterian or anything else you like, so long as it's Protestant. I'm not caring,' he says. 'The main thing is that you must be good and do what's right.' I tell you," [...] concluded Peter emphatically, [...] "father is a Christian all right." ...|$|E
60|$|Downe {{said that}} they were all well, thanks; they were out that morning somewhere; <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> to see if they were walking that way. Ah, there they were, just coming down the street; and Downe pointed to the figures of two {{children}} with a nursemaid, and a lady walking behind them.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> only <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> scornful, {{and said}} {{something}} about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, {{and then he went}} to studying. By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.|$|R
