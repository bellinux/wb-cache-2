5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E

It was published by the university printer, Joseph Barnes, who would have required guarantees for the costs: Gibson's view <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> probably provided by Thomas Allen, with the Earl paying [...] "the customary honorarium" [...] as dedicatee.|$|R

25|$|The fine old {{sandstone}} bridge which {{carried the}} road up to Corsehill was demolished {{in the early}} 1990s.

50|$|Catalectis {{is a small}} genus of {{the fungus}} moth family, Tineidae. It is a small and little-studied group, whose precise {{relationships}} remain to be discovered. C. pharetropa was once mistaken for a species of Clepticodes, and Oenoe drosoptila of the Meessiinae was also proposed as a species of Catalectis; ít may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> all, in fact, closely related.|$|R

25|$|Initially {{there were}} white {{characters}} {{on a black}} background, all of plastic. In 1992, the design was changed to one of black characters on a white background in metal or fibreglass; in that same year, the European blue ribbon was added with the Portuguese 'P' denominator. In 1998, a yellow ribbon {{on the right side}} was added with the month and year in which the car was first registered (e.g. 99/12 for December 1999 - the year comes on top of the month). This is different from systems such as in Germany (where the numbers indicate the start and end month of the vehicle's registration) and more similar to systems such as in Italy (where the date indicates the year of vehicle registration). Note that the date is that of first-ever registration of the vehicle, not the date the vehicle was registered in Portugal. Some vehicles carry plates that have a year and month seemingly out of tune with the alphanumeric sequence, and the reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> imported used vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{interpretations of}} the {{symbolism}} of grave goods revolved around religion (equipment for the hereafter), legal concepts (inalienable possessions) and social structure (status display, ostentatious destruction of wealth). There was multiplicity of messages and variability of meanings characterised the deposition of objects in Anglo-Saxon graves. In Early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, 47% of male adults and 9% of all juveniles were buried with weapons, {{some of which were}} very young. The proportion of adult weapon burials is much too high to suggest that they all represent a social élite. The usual assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> 'warrior burials', and this term is used throughout the archaeological and historical literature. However, a systematic comparison of burials with and without weapons, using archaeological and skeletal data, suggests that this assumption is much too simplistic and even misleading. Anglo-Saxon weapon burial rite involved a complex ritual symbolism: it was multi-dimensional, displaying ethnic affiliation, descent, wealth, élite status, and age groups. This symbol continued until c.700 when it ceased to have the symbolic power that it had before. Heinrich Härke suggests this change was due to the changing structure of society and especially in ethnicity and assimilation implying the lowering of ethnic boundaries in the Anglo-Saxon settlement areas of England, towards a common culture.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} feature of the inner product and norm squared <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> quantities unaffected by Lorentz transformations. In fact, it can be taken as the defining property of a Lorentz transformation that it preserves the inner product (i.e. {{the value of the}} corresponding bilinear form on two vectors). This approach is taken more generally for all classical groups definable this way in classical group. There, the matrix [...] is identical in the case [...] (the Lorentz group) to the matrix [...] to be displayed below.|$|E

[...] There are many reports that admissions departments consider only the highest test results in different test subsections, sometimes called superscore results or superscoring, so if a student takes a standardized test during multiple sittings, for example, admissions officers consider the highest math and verbal scores, regardless of test date. Two sources in the Washington Post suggested that colleges routinely superscore the SAT test but rarely the ACT, possibly because of difficulty processing five separate rounded numbers.|$|E

50|$|Another {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> prosperous cities <b>that</b> flourished {{because they}} were located along major trade routes in the Byzantine Empire, and not merely prosperous peasant settlements. After conquest by the Arabs, the trade routes changed, {{and as a result}} these towns lost the majority of the business which fostered their economies. On this view, settlers eventually abandoned their towns and headed for other cities <b>that</b> <b>were</b> flourishing under the Arabs and the Umayyads as increasing urbanisation took its toll.|$|R
2500|$|If a, b and c have {{rational}} ratios, {{then the}} same family of planes can be written in terms of integer indices (hkℓ) by scaling a, b and c appropriately: divide by {{the largest of the}} three numbers, and then multiply by the least common denominator. [...] Thus, integer Miller indices implicitly include indices with all rational ratios. [...] The reason why planes where the components (in the reciprocal-lattice basis) have rational ratios are of special interest <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> the lattice planes: they are the only planes whose intersections with the crystal are 2d-periodic.|$|E
2500|$|Less common are {{unilateral}} {{contracts in}} which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer {{are not required to}} communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not contractual offers but merely an [...] "invitation to treat" [...] (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions. The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is [...] "unscientific and misleading".|$|E
2500|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{may have}} {{believed}} {{themselves to be}} partly descended from Huns, through their Angle, Saxon, and Jute ancestors. In his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, the historian Bede stated:... any of which nations [...] knew there were in Germany, from whom the Angles or Saxons, who now inhabit Britain, {{are known to have}} derived their origin; for which reason they are still corruptly called Garmans by the neighboring nation of the Britons. Such are the Frisons, the Rugins, the Danes, the Huns, the Ancient Saxons, and the Boructuars (or Bructers). There are also in the same parts many other nations still following pagan rites, to whom the aforesaid soldier of Christ designed to repair, ...As James Campbell has noted, this list of peoples has generally been regarded by historians as being a list of peoples living in Germany at the time Bede wrote this passage in the 8th century, [...] "ut the sense of the Latin <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> the peoples from whom the Anglo-Saxons living in Britain were derived." [...] He wrote that the list of peoples fits the 5th century better, when the Anglo-Saxons began migrating to Britain, than the 8th century, and noted that [...] "Huns sound odd; it is equally odd that Priscus heard of a boast by Attila that he had authority over the islands in the ocean." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both {{contraception}} {{and abortion}} are usually censured by Rastas, {{and a common}} claim in Rasta discourse <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> inventions of Babylon created {{in an attempt to}} decrease the black African birth-rate. Rastas also typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality, regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural; this attitude derives from references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible. The scholar of religion Fortune Sibanda suggested <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> likely homosexual Rastas who deliberately concealed their sexual orientation because of these [...] attitudes.|$|R

50|$|Coastal raids {{were not}} {{uncommon}} in fourteenth century England, with privately owned shipping and occasionally royal ships from France, Castile, Genoa, Scotland and Scandinavia all conducting nuisance attacks against coastal shipping and fishing villages throughout the era, even during periods of peace.

500|$|One [...] charge [...] {{levelled}} by Livingstone {{and many}} others against the Boers <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when attacking tribal settlements they abducted {{women and children and}} took them home as slaves.
