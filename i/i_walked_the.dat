500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he was in}} {{many ways}} {{spiraling}} out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of [...] "Ring of Fire" [...] was a crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and entering the Top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature mariachi-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash. He said that it had come to him in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of [...] "Ring of Fire." [...] In her book, <b>I</b> <b>Walked</b> <b>the</b> Line: My Life with Johnny, Liberto says that Cash gave Carter the credit for monetary reasons.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 February, Winx {{returned}} in the Chipping Norton Stakes. Originally at odds of 1.10, she drifted out slightly to 1.22 {{because of the}} heavy going. With the rain still falling shortly before the race, Waller walked the course and determined it was safe for Winx to run. [...] "I {{was so close to}} scratching her but we made the right decision. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> track before the race and it looked pretty good to me. It was safe and that was my main concern," [...] he said. Although her time was slow, Winx won with ease by two lengths over longshot Lasqueti Spirit. Hartnell did not handle the track and was well back in eighth. [...] "Today the conditions were fair and even," [...] said Bowman, [...] "yeah sure it is wet but everyone is getting their chance and it is just a case of whether your horse can cope with the surface or not. Clearly this mare can." ...|$|E
