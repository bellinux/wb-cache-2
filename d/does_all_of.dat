500|$|Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and {{misogyny}} through Kilgrave's {{use of the}} phrase [...] "Smile", calling the season [...] "the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique" [...] from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to [...] "similar well-meaning scenarios [...] play out {{in the real world}} time and again each day" [...] many in the form of gendered street harassment, that resonates with many women. Hill also added that [...] "Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent," [...] due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that [...] "Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise." [...] Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that [...] "powerlessness is not gendered." ...|$|E
500|$|Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals {{with the}} base track {{first and then}} {{have the rest of}} the song built around it in order to make her voice the center of the piece. [...] "Janet did all of her {{background}} vocals and not just the lead vocals. The idea with her has always been that she <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> her own vocals, so that it's totally a Janet record." [...] On the title track [...] "Rhythm Nation", her vocals range from Bb3 to G5, climaxing within its middle eight. Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R styles, making [...] "use of elements across the R spectrum, including use of a sample loop , triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes (D naturals and G naturals)." [...] This style of music, known as new jack swing, was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley, Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson's 1986 single [...] "Nasty", which also features a distinctive triplet swing. Jon Pareles observed the album's diversity catered {{to a wide variety of}} radio formats, including pop, quiet storm, Adult contemporary and mainstream rock. [...] "Black Cat" [...] was a stand-out for the record, not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson, but for its stark departure from her general style of music, delving into hard rock. While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it, Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song. It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound.|$|E

This means the queen <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the foraging for about 30 days before workers take over. At the beginning she mainly focuses on collecting fiber for envelope construction, but as the colony begins to develop she allots more time for foraging for food including both flesh and liquid. Workers begin helping with larval feeding and nest development when just a few days old and take their orientation flight at about 5 days old. At this point they begin to take over food and material collection for the nest. These foraging trips can last between a few minutes to one hour, but most are less than 10 minutes in length. As D. media searches for prey it stops for a moment over each flower in contrast to other species such as V. flaviceps which quickly fly up and down each plant. They will fly up to a couple hundred meters to forage for food.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{source code}} {{for the current}} TeX software is written in WEB, a mixture of documentation written in TeX and a Pascal subset {{in order to ensure}} portability. For example, TeX <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its dynamic allocation itself from fixed-size arrays and uses only fixed-point arithmetic for its internal calculations. As a result, TeX has been ported to almost all operating systems, usually by using the web2c program to convert the source code into C instead of directly compiling the Pascal code. Knuth has kept a very detailed log of all the bugs he has corrected and changes he has made in the program since 1982; , the list contains 427 entries, not including the version modification that should be done after his death as the final change in TeX. Donald Knuth offers monetary awards to people who find and report a bug in TeX. The award per bug started at US$2.56 (one [...] "hexadecimal dollar") and doubled every year until it was frozen at its current value of $327.68. Knuth has lost relatively little money as there have been very few bugs claimed. In addition, recipients have been known to frame their check as proof that they found a bug in TeX rather than cashing it.|$|E

60|$|The {{inventor}} of the watch, if this doctrine be true, did not in reality invent it; he only looked on, while the blind causes, the only true artists, were unfolding themselves.

So must it have been with Mr. Southey and Lord Byron, when the one fancied himself composing his Roderick, and the other his Childe Harold. The same must hold good of all systems of philosophy; of all arts, governments, wars by sea and by land; in short, of all things that ever have been or that ever will be produced. For, according to this system, it is not the affections and passions that are at work, in as far as they are sensations or thoughts. We only fancy, that we act from rational resolves, or prudent motives, or from impulses of anger, love, or generosity. In all these cases the real agent is a something-nothing-everything, which <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> which we know, and knows nothing of all that itself does.|$|E
