50|$|When <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were discontinued, their successors, the Legal Tender Notes, {{could not}} be used to pay import duties, {{a large part of the}} U.S. federal tax base at the time, and thus <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> took precedence. As a result, most <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were redeemed, though the few {{remaining}} <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> are the oldest valid currency in the United States today.|$|R
50|$|The later United States Notes {{could not}} be used to pay customs duties, only gold and <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes.</b> Importers {{therefore}} continued to use <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> in place of gold. In March 1862, <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were made legal tender.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{private and}} state banknotes, <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were printed on both sides. The reverse side was printed in green ink, {{and so the}} <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were dubbed [...] "greenbacks". Initially they were {{discounted}} relative to gold, but being fully redeemable in gold were soon at par. In December 1861, the government had to suspend redemption, and they declined. Chase authorized paying interest on <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes,</b> which sustained their value.|$|R
2500|$|... 1861: The first $5 {{bill was}} issued as a <b>Demand</b> <b>Note</b> {{with a small}} {{portrait}} of Alexander Hamilton {{on the right and}} an allegorical statue representing freedom {{on the left side of}} the obverse.|$|E
2500|$|The first U.S. federal currency, the greenback <b>demand</b> <b>note,</b> {{was printed}} in 1861â€“1862 during Chase's tenure as Secretary of the Treasury. [...] It was Chase's {{responsibility}} {{to design the}} notes. In an effort to further his political career, his face appeared {{on a variety of}} U.S. paper currency, starting with the $1 bill so that the people would recognize him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{colloquialism}} [...] "buck"(s) (much {{like the}} British word [...] "quid"(s, pl) for the pound sterling) {{is often used}} to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar. This term, dating to the 18th century, may have originated with the colonial leather trade. It may also have originated from a poker term. [...] "Greenback" [...] is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century <b>Demand</b> <b>Note</b> dollars created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the Civil War for the North. The original note was printed in black and green on the back side. It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the dollars of other countries). Other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include [...] "greenmail", [...] "green" [...] and [...] "dead presidents" [...] (the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills).|$|E
5000|$|Once in {{circulation}} the Legal Tender Notes became {{the unit of}} account for prices in dollars - both gold and the hoarded <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were quoted in terms of them. In May the war began to turn against the Union and hopes for a quick end to hostilities were abandoned. As the year progressed {{the price of gold}} rose as the hoarding of commodities began in earnest. Eventually silver and even copper coins disappeared from circulation. As early as the second week of May the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were being quoted at a premium for sale to importers who used them in place of gold to pay customs duties. The premium commanded by gold and <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> became a political issue, and in June, Secretary Chase drew criticism by selling $2.25 million worth of 7.3% interest bearing Treasury <b>Notes,</b> seven-thirties, for <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> at a three percent premium to par, which were immediately resold by the buyers for a six percent premium in legal tender. While this action allowed Secretary Chase to achieve two important goals, distributing the seven-thirties debt and retiring <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes,</b> it amounted to an official acknowledgement that the new United States Notes had depreciated compared to the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes.</b> By mid-summer gold dollars were trading for a fifteen percent premium to legal tender while <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were available for an eight percent premium, and newspapers were reporting the price of <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> under the description [...] "United States Notes for Custom-House Purposes" [...] or [...] "Custom-House Notes". As customs duties averaged $6 to 9 million per month the slow drain of outstanding <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> was tracked in the financial columns. By December it was estimated that the supply would soon be exhausted and that importers would have no option but gold for paying import duties. When the supply of <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> had been nearly exhausted they commanded a price at parity with or at only a slight discount to gold dollars {{despite the fact that the}} latter continued to command a steep premium to United State Notes through the 1870s.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> {{were also}} {{authorized}} by the Act of July 17, 1861 and were a transitional issue connecting Treasury Notes to modern paper money. The denominations of the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> ($5, $10 and $20) complemented those of the Seven-Thirties ($50 to $5000) - {{much in the way}} that the Small Treasury Notes of 1815 complemented the Large <b>Notes.</b> The <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> had been intended to function as money, and were payable to bearer, but were authorized within the legal framework of Treasury Notes since the U.S. was not generally assumed to have the authority to issue banknotes at that time. Eventually the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were granted legal tender status and were replaced in function by United States Notes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{confusion}} existed {{over the}} status of the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> until the act of March 17, 1862, clarified that these were to enjoy legal tender status as well. Thus, <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were at least as good as Legal Tender Notes, and clearly superior because only the former could be used to pay duties on imports - a major source of revenue to the Union government. As a result, Assistant Treasurer Cisco announced that he reserved the right to redeem future 5% short term deposits of <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> in the new Legal Tender Notes and speculators, foreseeing the higher value of <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes,</b> removed them from circulation as the new notes began to circulate during April.|$|R

5000|$|Because of the {{distinctive}} green ink on their reverse, and because state-chartered bank and Confederate {{notes of the}} day typically had blank reverse, the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> were nicknamed [...] "greenbacks", a name later inherited by Legal Tender and Federal Reserve Notes. The obverse of the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> contained familiar elements such as the images of a bald eagle, Abraham Lincoln, and Alexander Hamilton, though the portraits used on <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> {{are different from the}} ones seen on U.S. currency today.|$|R
50|$|Debate in Congress {{had turned}} towards {{meeting the demand}} {{obligation}} by declaring the notes legal tender - thus obligating all parties to accept them as payment-in-full for contracted debt. While this debate was on-going the cash needs of the government called and the Act of February 12, 1862, authorized an additional $10,000,000 in <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes.</b> This act brought the final possible amount of <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> that could be issued to a sum of $60,000,000 (by April the full $60,000,000 in <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> had been issued).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> are {{no longer}} found in circulation, but are instead {{in the hands of}} collectors. Of the {{surviving}} <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes,</b> the vast majority are $5 and $10 notes with [...] "For the" [...] engraved on them and from the locations of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. No notes are known with the actual signatures of F. E. Spinner and L. E. Chittenden. Because of their rarity, <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> are mainly collected by acquiring a single example of the $5 and $10 denomination. Facsimile reproductions are also available.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the many}} {{apocryphal}} stories surrounding Ledbetter's standoff, perhaps none is more famous than {{the request for}} donuts contained in his <b>demand</b> <b>note.</b> While it was widely reported that Ledbetter had asked for [...] "666 jelly donuts", a read of his actual <b>demand</b> <b>note</b> clearly shows he was ordering Dunkin donuts for the police: [...] "666 Dunkin' Donuts for my fine friends in the TPD (Tallahassee Police Department), FSUPD (Florida State University Police Department) and the LCSD (Leon County Sheriff's Department)." ...|$|E

50|$|Just {{before they}} were to be released, the Act of August 5, 1861, stipulated several changes to the {{issuance}} of <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes.</b> It allowed for <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> to be issued in denominations of not less than $5 and be redeemable through the assistant treasurer's office at St. Louis or the bullion depository in Cincinnati. This act also stated that the Treasurer of the United States and Register of the Treasury or any treasury official appointed by {{the secretary of the treasury}} should sign the notes. Under this act, <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> did not need to carry the seal of the U.S. Treasury. This act also granted a traditional privilege of Treasury <b>Notes</b> to the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> in that {{they were to be}} receivable in payment of all public dues, a privilege which was to figure prominently in their eventual disposition.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inability}} of the Union government to redeem these notes for specie [...] "on demand" [...] caused great concern to Congress in early 1862. Some banks had pledged to make a $150 million loan to the government; the final installment was due on 4 February 1862, and these banks continued to accept <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> to use in this obligation. This supported {{the value of the}} notes for a while.After 4 February, Secretary Chase authorized John Cisco, Assistant U.S. Treasurer in New York City, to accept <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> for short term deposits at five percent interest - thus making the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> as good as interest bearing deposits, but with the credit of the government. New York banks quickly made the certificates of such deposits their clearing standard. The <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> became the unit of account for dollar denominated obligations in place of gold, which had begun to disappear from circulation, having risen to a 1 to 2% premium over paper.|$|R
5000|$|The obverses of all {{denominations}} <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> {{contained the}} following common features printed on them: ...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the {{emission}} {{was limited to}} $150,000,000 total face value between the new Legal Tender Notes and the existing <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes.</b> The Act also intended for the new notes {{to be used to}} replace the <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> as soon as practical. The <b>Demand</b> <b>Notes</b> had been issued in denominations of $5, $10, and $20, and these were replaced by United States Notes nearly identical in appearance on the obverse. In addition, notes of entirely new design were introduced in denominations of $50, $100, $500 and $1000. The Demand Notes' printed promise of payment [...] "On Demand" [...] was removed and the statement [...] "This Note is a Legal Tender" [...] was added.|$|R
50|$|The {{reverse of}} the $20 <b>Demand</b> <b>Note</b> {{contains}} a small numeral 20 inside of an oval that {{is surrounded by}} an eight-sided star; {{all of this is}} located around the shield-shaped object with the numeral 20 in it. The top and bottom borders feature geometrical design elements with UNITED STATES printed horizontally in every other geometric shape.|$|E
