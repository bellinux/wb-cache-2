40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} play {{an important}} role in the mobilization of phosphorus (P), and these activities may be beneficial for plant P utilization. We investigated the effects on microbial P availability of different combinations of aluminum and iron (Al + Fe) concentrations and different P pools in <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> from boreal forest ecosystems. We measured respiration rates in laboratory incubations before and after additions of glucose plus (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (Glu+N), with or without a small dose of KH 2 PO 4. Glu+N was added in excess so that the availability of the inherent soil P would be growth-limiting for the microorganisms. The exponential increases observed in microbial growth after substrate additions (Glu+N) was slower for <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> with high Al+Fe concentrations than for <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> with low Al+Fe concentrations. Adding a small dose of KH 2 PO 4 to <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> with high Al+Fe concentrations did, however, increase the exponential growth, measured as the slope of the log-transformed respiration rates, by more than 200 %. By contrast, the average increase in exponential growth was only 6 % in <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> with low Al+Fe concentrations. Almost eight times more carbon dioxide (CO 2) was evolved between the substrate additions and the point at which the respiration rate reached 1 mg CO 2 h– 1 for soils with high Al+Fe concentrations compared to <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> with low Al+Fe concentrations. The amount of CO 2 evolved was positively related to the Al+Fe concentration of the <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> (r 2 = 0. 86, P < 0. 001), whereas the slope was negatively related to Al+Fe concentration (r 2 = 0. 70, P < 0. 001). Easily available P forms were negatively related to the Al+Fe concentration, whereas organic P showed a strong positive relationship to Al+Fe (r 2 = 0. 85, P < 0. 001), suggesting that other forms of P, as well as inorganic P, are affected by the increased sorption capacity. The results indicate that P mobilization by microorganisms is affected by the presence of sorption sites in the humus layer, and that this capacity for sorption may relate not only to phosphate but also to organic P compounds...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater {{discharge}} {{areas in}} boreal forest ecosystems can potentially be areas where Fe and Al accumulate {{in the forest}} floor and affect the solubility of P. This {{study was conducted to}} determine phosphate sorption properties using <b>humus</b> <b>soils</b> containing high native amounts of Al and Fe. <b>Humus</b> <b>soils</b> were collected from two different forested groundwater discharge areas varying in pH and amount and distribution of At and Fe species. The phosphate sorption capacities were 265 and 216 mmol P kg(- 1) dry wt. soil, respectively, for the two <b>humus</b> <b>soils.</b> Pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe dominated in the first soil, 738 mmol kg(- 1) dry wt. The concentration of pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe in the second soil was 317 mmol kg(- 1) dry wt [...] whereas citrate-dithionite (CD) extracted 548 mmol Al and Fe kg(- 1) dry wt. Using 0. 1 mol dm(- 3) NaCl as ionic medium gave a higher phosphate sorption compared with deionized water at the midrange additions, but no difference at the highest addition. Phosphate sorption was pH independent when 0. 1 mol dm(- 3) NaCl was used, whereas deionized water gave a sorption minimum at approximately pH 6. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in solution was positively correlated with phosphate sorption, especially in 0. 1 mol dm(- 3) NaCl ionic medium. However, dissolved organic P (DOP) was unaffected by the phosphate sorption. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) indicated that precipitation of Al and Fe phosphates dominated at higher phosphate additions in the soil with mainly organically bound At and Fe, whereas both surface sorption and precipitation occurs in the soil with a larger amount of CD-extractable Fe...|$|R

50|$|Since it is {{the surface}} upon which most {{economic}} activities occur, land {{is one of the}} most important natural resources contributing towards economic development. Kosovo has a total surface area of 10,877 square kilometers which is classified as: 53 to 54.23% agricultural land, 40.92% forest land and 4.85% infertile land. Kosovo possesses a wide variety of soils. It is assessed that 15% of the soil in Kosovo is high quality soil, followed by 29% of medium quality, so 56% of all soil is poor quality soil, while the high and medium quality make up 44% of the soil in Kosovo. The high and medium quality soil is composed 11% by <b>humus</b> <b>soil,</b> 8.4% grey carbonate land, 7.8% alluvial soil, and other dark and serpentine soils.

50|$|The foot shell {{was placed}} on three smaller stones. It was made from a greyish brown clay having a height of 105 mm and diameters of 83 mm at the stand and 207 mm at its mouth. The outside wall of the vessel is irregularly {{decorated}} with 23 mm long parallel impressions of a comb-like tool. Inside, the foot shell was filled up to a height of two-thirds with <b>humus</b> <b>soil</b> on which the skull lay. The giant beaker was placed upside down over the cup. The retracted walls below {{the mouth of the}} vessel were carefully framed with larger stones. The giant beaker consists of a brownish-gray to reddish-brown clay. It has a height of 425 mm with diameters of about 97 mm at the base and 240 mm at the mouth. Its largest diameter is 195 mm to 210 mm at a height of 265 mm from the base. The shards of the damaged vessels base could not be recovered. Below the vessels rim, the vessel is decorated with an irregular series of small triangular recesses, whose tips are directed downward. Prior to its discovery the vessel and its interior was intact but it has been damaged with the bulldozer. The shape of the giant beaker corresponds to the Bentheim group, defined by Karl Hermann Jacob Friesen, although this vessel stands out because of its size. Wegewitz interprets the giant beaker as storage vessel. The skull has been preserved from its cranium to the ear bones and nasal bone, while the facial skeleton and jaws were probably decomposed after the funeral. The closed air space inside the large vessel favoured the preservation of the skull as opposed to being stored in well-aerated sandy soil at the site. In the earthy filling of the foot shell a few remains of tooth enamel were found. Due to its small amount Wegewitz suspected that at the times of the funeral only the head and upper jaw were present while the lower jaw and cervical vertebrae were already lost. The skull was anthropologically determined as most likely that of an adult male. Whether the burial was dug in a pit into the ground or settled above the ground could not be determined due to lack of soil discolouration at site. Likewise, it remains unclear whether the head burial was created in close proximity to a possibly nearby or lost full body burial.|$|E
