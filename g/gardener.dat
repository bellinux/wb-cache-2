5|$|Delahaye had {{departed}} Mauritius in May 1797, arriving in France and on 9 July {{to be appointed}} as an official on a commission sent to Italy to plunder the libraries and museums of northern Italy {{in the wake of}} Napoleon’s victories there. On his return he was appointed head <b>gardener,</b> first at Trianon in 1798 and then, in 1805, on the Empress Joséphine’s estate at Malmaison. A Scotsman, Alexander Howatson, had been appointed Head <b>Gardener</b> at Malmaison. Napoleon did not like having an Englishman as an employee and being presented with an excessive bill by Howatson for transportation of shrubs to Malmaison, Napoleon had an opportunity to dispense with his services. The post of Superintendent of the Château de Malmaison gardens was given to the botanist Charles de Mirbel. It was through de Mirbel that Delahaye had obtained the position of Head <b>Gardener</b> at Malmaison, based on his successful restoration of the gardens at Le Trianon and also Marie Antoinette's old garden at Versailles. This garden was probably the most important collection of living Australian plants in Europe in this period. For several decades Delahaye was the only <b>gardener</b> in Europe who had actually seen the plants from New Holland growing in their natural habitat, and many of the plants he grew he had collected himself. Although tensions developed between Delahaye and Empress Josephine's chief botanist, Aimé Bonpland, Delahaye continued to work for Empress Joséphine until her death in 1814 after which he entered business (possibly in 1826 when Malmaison was sold) as manager of a successful private nursery at Montreuil, near Versailles, which also occupied his wife and sons. Here he kept a collection of natural history specimens and an extensive herbarium together with seeds and ethnographic specimens brought back from his voyage.|$|E

50|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that community gardens have a similar effect in adults. A study found that community <b>gardeners</b> in Utah had a lower body mass index than their non-gardening siblings and unrelated neighbors. Administrative records were used to compare body mass indexes of community <b>gardeners</b> to that of unrelated neighbors, siblings, and spouses. <b>Gardeners</b> {{were less likely to be}} overweight or obese than their neighbors, and <b>gardeners</b> had lower body mass indexes than their siblings. However, there was no difference in body mass index between <b>gardeners</b> and their spouses which may suggest that community gardening creates healthy habits for the entire household.|$|R

5|$|The grounds {{were laid}} out by Humphry Repton (1752–1818) a leading {{landscape}} <b>gardener.</b> Parts of Repton's designs still exist, notably the carriage drive which winds its way from the house, sections of which follow the original route. In addition to the conservatory and the almshouses in Blaise Hamlet, Nash built the limestone dairy in 1802.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house.

The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
50|$|The Garden {{is usually}} a haven for the <b>gardeners,</b> since many of them live in very tight quarters. Some <b>gardeners</b> live in Single Room Occupancy units (SRO’s) - rooms that have no {{bathroom}} or kitchen -- which are converted hotel rooms that used to house the immigrant Asian male community in the 20th century. Additionally, {{because many of the}} <b>gardeners</b> have agrarian backgrounds, gardening is a powerful recreational devise and it is also a place for many <b>gardeners</b> to congregate and create friendships.|$|R
50|$|Despite the sizable {{distance}} between France and the Balkans, {{there are reports}} of Bulgarian <b>gardeners</b> around Metz as early as 1870. <b>Gardeners</b> were the leading force of Bulgarian economic emigration.

40|$|Sales of {{vegetable}} transplants have been increasing {{in the last}} few years as more people try home gardening.   This creates a need for education so that new <b>gardeners</b> will have a positive experience, and an opportunity to provide information that helps new <b>gardeners</b> use IPM in their gardens.   While information on disease resistant vegetable varieties is available, not all home <b>gardeners</b> know where to find it and not all producer/retailers use it a factor in choosing the transplant varieties to sell. This project has two objectives: 1) to encourage producer/retailers to grow  and market disease resistant vegetable varieties for home <b>gardeners,</b> and 2) to encourage home <b>gardeners</b> to choose resistant vegetable varieties for a successful gardening experience...|$|R

He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|An {{apprentice}} boilermaker {{before the}} war, Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 {{and worked as}} a <b>gardener.</b> In 1932, he published Hell's Bells and Mademoiselles, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his war experiences. Attempting to enlist for service during the Second World War, Maxwell was rejected on the grounds of his age before enlisting under an alias in Queensland; his identity was discovered, and after a short period in a training position, he sought discharge. In 1967, aged 71, he died of a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time.
