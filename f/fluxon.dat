40|$|<b>Fluxons</b> in long Josephson {{junctions}} are physical {{manifestations of}} travelling waves that connect rest {{states of the}} model partial differential equation (p. d. e.), which is a perturbed sine-Gordon equation. In the reduced traavelling wave ordinary differential equation (o. d. e.), <b>fluxons</b> correspond to heteroclinic connections between fixed points. In the absence of surface impedence effects, <b>fluxons</b> persist in parameter regimes until the fixed points disappear, after which the system ‘switches’ to another configuration. It is known {{that the presence of}} surface impedence produces a singular perturbation of the model equation, together with a new phenomenon: the <b>fluxons</b> switch in parameter regimes before the fixed points are lost. Why this occurs is unknown, and is the focus of this paper. Two disjoint possibilities are: (1) instability: <b>fluxons</b> still exist, but they become unstable in the p. d. e. due to surface impedance effects; (2) nonexistence: the <b>fluxons</b> fail to exist, even though the fixed points remain. Here, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the second scenario, characterized by a global bifurcation in the travelling wave phase space: a breakdown of heteroclinicorbits, undetected at the local linearized level. Moreover, this global o. d. e. bifurcation occurs at parameter values consistent with the p. d. e. switching phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|A quantum {{statistical}} {{theory is}} developed for a fractional quantum Hall effects {{in terms of}} composite bosons (fermions) each of which contains a conduction electron and an odd (even) number of <b>fluxons.</b> The cause of the QHE is by assumption the phonon exchange attraction between the conduction electron ("electron", "hole") and <b>fluxons</b> (quanta of magnetic fluxes). We postulate that c-fermions with \emph{any} even number of <b>fluxons</b> have an effective charge (magnitude) equal to the electron charge $e$. The density of c-fermions with $m$ <b>fluxons,</b> $n_\phi^{(m) }$, is connected with the electron density $n_{\mathrm e}$ by $n_\phi^{(m) }=n_{\mathrm e}/m$, which implies a more difficult formation for higher $m$, generating correct values $me^ 2 /h$ for the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\mathrm H}\equiv j/E_{\mathrm H}$. For condensed c-bosons the density of c-bosons-with-$m$ <b>fluxons,</b> $n_\phi^{(m) }$, is connected with the boson density $n_ 0 $ by $n_\phi^{(m) }=n_ 0 /m$.

40|$|The {{critical}} current density (Jc) through a superconductor in high magnetic fields {{is controlled by}} the inclusions and microstructure of the material that hold <b>fluxons</b> stationary to keep the resistance zero and is described using Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) theory. Although the functional form of Jc for superconducting-normal-superconducting (SNS) Josephson-Junctions (J-Js) is known in the low field limit, includes the local properties of the junctions and has been confirmed experimentally in many systems, there are no general solutions for Jc of J-Js in high fields. Scaling laws describe the functional form (magnetic field, temperature and strain dependence) of Jc for polycrystalline superconductors in high fields but do not include local grain boundary properties. They are derived by considering isolated pinning sites where at criticality <b>fluxons</b> either depin or free <b>fluxons</b> shear past pinned <b>fluxons</b> as part of the flux line lattice. However, visualisation of solutions to the Time Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations for polycrystalline materials have shown that <b>fluxons</b> cross the superconductor by flowing along the grain boundaries. Here we derive clean- and dirty- limit analytic equations for of SNS J-Js in high fields and verify them using computational solutions to TDGL theory. We consider SNS J-Js to be the basic building blocks for grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials since they provide flux-flow channels. The J-Js description provides a mathematical framework that includes the utility of scaling laws together with our microscopic understanding of barriers to supercurrent flow and helps identify the grain boundary engineering that can improve in low temperature polycrystalline superconductors used in high magnetic field applications.

In experiment, we measure the <b>fluxon</b> velocity versus current in one junction {{as a function of}} the state (Meissner or resistive) of the neighboring junction. The analysis, made for the limit of high <b>fluxon</b> density, shows that the interaction with the resistive state results in an increase of the effective damping for the moving <b>fluxon</b> and, therefore, in reduction of its velocity. Numerical simulations confirm this result for various <b>fluxon</b> densities. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.
