5|$|The {{official}} phrasing for {{the ranks}} {{uses the word}} cadet as a preface — as an example, cadet corporal. However, custom omits cadet <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> reference. Thus, corporal is the usual wording. Generally, {{where there is a}} need to distinguish between cadets and Canadian Forces members, ranks will be written or spoken as cadet corporal and abbreviated as C/Cpl.|$|E
5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} clones are then {{seen in a}} forest – one walks behind a tree and reappears dressed <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> attire. He climbs another tree and {{ends up in the}} {{bathroom}} of the woman's apartment, where he retrieves a package. The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself underneath a car. He opens the package and finds a gasoline can, which he pours into a compartment located behind the car's license plate. All three clones enter the car and drive to the box, which they step back into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{works of}} author Irvine Welsh, {{particularly}} Trainspotting, contain several references to Hibernian. The team is often mentioned <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> conversation {{and is the}} team many of his characters support. Visual references to Hibs are noticeable in Danny Boyle's film adaptation of Trainspotting; Begbie wears a Hibs shirt while he plays five-a-side football, while many Hibs posters and pictures {{can be seen on}} the walls of Mark Renton's bedroom.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet from time to time <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> settings and {{get to know each other}} better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|That a large {{population}} remained in residence in the north sector of Mundo Perdido during the Terminal Classic {{is evidenced by the}} quantity of burials of differing gender and age. Some were interred inside collapsed buildings or <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> graves. They were usually accompanied by very few funerary offerings, generally bone and lithic artefacts. The dense occupation of the north sector, which included elite activity, continued for at least a hundred years after the abandonment of the rest of Tikal and is perhaps linked to the nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at Temple III. While the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido continued in use, the rest of the complex was partially abandoned. The occupation of the Mundo Perdido came to an end in the Terminal Classic and very few traces of Postclassic activity have been recovered, limited to a few ceramic finds in Structure 3D-43 to the north.|$|E

25|$|The SDA {{attempts}} {{to have a}} relatively positive relationship with retail employers, {{with the idea that}} it allows it to negotiate better outcomes for its members than a more confrontational approach because of the reluctance of SDA members to take industrial action, which rarely if ever occurs in the SDA.

Patterson indicated that men fulfilling this social role would touch more and after initial touch <b>in</b> <b>casual</b> relationships and as the relationship became more intimate during serious dating or marriage relationships, women would touch more. American culture still dictates that men ‘make the first move’ {{in the context of a}} dating relationship.|$|E
