At the low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> the penetration depth in the bath was studied. The experiments focused on studying the effect of nozzle diameter, lance height and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> on the penetration depth.

More specifically, it was studied how the previous published empirical relationships fitted the current experimental data. It was found that the relationships of Banks [1], Davenport [2], Chatterjee [3] and Qian [4] agreed well with the experimental data of this investigation for nozzle diameters of 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm. However, for smaller nozzle diameters there were considerable deviations. Therefore, a new correlation heuristically derived from energy conservation consideration was suggested and showed better agreement for small nozzle diameters. The experiments carried out at higher <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> focused on the study of swirl motion.

40|$|In this work, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} {{efforts on the}} effect of surfactants on air-water flow in a vertical pipe by also considering pipe inclinations between 20 ° (with respect to horizontal) and vertical. For air-water flow, independent of the inclination, there is a regular annular <b>flow</b> at large <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and an irregular churn or slug <b>flow</b> at low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Closely related to the transition between regular and irregular flow, although not necessarily coinciding with it, there is a minimum in the pressure gradient {{as a function of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> In <b>gas</b> wells, surfactants are used to shift this minimum to lower <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> which allows a stable gas production up to lower reservoir pressures. In this work, we investigate how the pipe inclination affects air-water flow without and with surfactants. Surfactants generate foam, which decreases the density and increases the thickness of the film at the pipe wall. For vertical flow, we previously established that surfactants increase the pressure gradient at high <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> decrease the pressure gradient at low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> shift the minimum in the pressure gradient to lower <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and shift the transition between regular and irregular <b>flow</b> to lower <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The new results described in this paper show that for large <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> both the <b>flow</b> with and without surfactants is unaffected by the inclination. At low gas velocities, however, in inclined pipes the surfactants are much less effective at shifting the transition between irregular flow and regular flow and at shifting the minimum in the pressure gradient than in vertical pipes. The foam causes a regular film morphology at the top wall of the pipe, but is unable to make the morphology of the bottom liquid film regular. As a result, at low <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> the relative decrease of the pressure gradient due to surfactants is smaller for smaller inclinations from horizontal. This larger relative decrease for vertical flow compared to inclined flow is related to an increased foam formation and therefore a smaller mass density of the film in vertical flow. </p...|$|R

40|$|In steel {{refining}} process, {{an increase}} of interfacial area between the metal and slag through the metal droplets emulsified into the slag, so-called ``metal emulsion'', is one prevailing view for improving the reaction rate. The formation of metal emulsion was experimentally evaluated using Al-Cu alloy as metal phase and chloride salt as slag phase under the bottom bubbling condition. Samples were collected {{from the center of}} the salt phase in the container. Large number of metal droplets were separated from the salt by dissolving it into water. The number, surface area, and weight of the droplets increased with the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and have local maximum values. The formation and sedimentation rates of metal droplets were estimated using a mathematical model. The formation rate increased with the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and has a local maximum value as a function of <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> while the sedimentation rate is independent of the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> under the bottom bubbling condition. Three types of formation mode of metal emulsion, which occurred by the rupture of metal film around the bubble, were observed using high speed camera. During the process, an elongated column covered with metal film was observed with the increasing <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> This elongated column sometimes reached to the top surface of the salt phase. In this case, it is considered that fine droplets were not formed and in consequence, the weight of metal emulsion decreased at higher <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R

30|$|To detect {{concentration}} of arsenic, an ELAN DRC II ICP-MS (PerkinElmer, America) {{equipped with an}} atomizer and a spray chamber was used. The ICP-MS normal operating parameters were as follows: RF power 1100  W, lens voltage 7.25  V, nebulizer <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> 0.98  L/min, auxiliary <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> 1.2  L/min, and plasma <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> 15.00  L/min. Arsenic species were separated by Series 200 HPLC (PerkinElmer, America) with an automatic sample injector and directly introduced into ICP-MS. A C 8 chromatographic column (PerkinElmer, America) was used with the mobile phase containing 1  mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, 0.05  mM dipotassium EDTA, and 0.05  % methanol (pH 6.8).|$|R
