Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and <b>enteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} {{will be in}} pain and have a loss of appetite after surgery. Part of the body's response to surgery is to direct energy to wound healing, which increases the body's overall energy requirements. Surgery affects nutritional status indirectly, particularly during the recovery period, as it can interfere with wound healing {{and other aspects of}} recovery. Surgery directly affects nutritional status if a procedure permanently alters the digestive system. <b>Enteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (tube feeding) is often needed. However a policy of 'nil by mouth' for all gastrointestinal surgery has not been shown to benefit, with some suggestion it might hinder recovery.|$|E

There is only limited evidence from trials {{to support the}} use of vitamin B6 to improve outcome. Hyperalimentation may be necessary in certain cases to help maintain volume requirements and allow weight gain. [...] A physician might also prescribe Vitamin B1 (to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy) and folic acid supplementation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the presentations given at an ESPEN Workshop on "Lipids in the ICU" held in Tel Aviv, Israel in November 2014 and subsequent discussions and updates. Lipids {{are an important}} component of <b>enteral</b> and parenteral <b>nutrition</b> support and provide essential fatty acids, a concentrated source of calories and building blocks for cell membranes. Whilst linoleic acid-rich vegetable oil-based <b>enteral</b> and parenteral <b>nutrition</b> is still widely used, newer lipid components such as medium-chain triglycerides and olive oil are safe and well tolerated. Fish oil (FO) -enriched <b>enteral</b> and parenteral <b>nutrition</b> appears to be well tolerated and confers additional clinical benefits, particularly in surgical patients, due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects. Whilst the evidence base is not conclusive, {{there appears to be a}} potential for FO-enriched nutrition, particularly administered peri-operatively, to reduce the rate of complications and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay in surgical ICU patients. The evidence for FO-enriched nutrition in non-surgical ICU patients is less clear regarding its clinical benefits and additional, well-designed large-scale clinical trials need to be conducted in this area. The ESPEN Expert Group supports the use of olive oil and FO in nutrition support in surgical and non-surgical ICU patients but considers that further research is required to provide a more robust evidence bas...|$|R

The study was planned for 1, 000 patients, but was interrupted at 410 due to slow recruitment after 4 years. Primary outcome was not conclusive, but as secondary outcome ICU mortality was reduced in the treatment group. This reduction was, however, not sustained as 6 -month all-cause mortality.
