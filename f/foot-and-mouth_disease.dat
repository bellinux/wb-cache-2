5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease,</b> rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|Severely {{threatened}} by the 2001 outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique animal as {{a crucial part of}} traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies and the aid of the British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.|$|E
5|$|The Reading Half Marathon is held on {{the streets}} of Reading in March of each year, with 16,000 {{competitors}} from elite to fun runners. It was first run in 1983 and has taken place in every subsequent year except 2001, when it was cancelled because of concerns over that year's outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{centers on}} the ongoing {{conflict}} between principled patriarch Homer Bannon and his unscrupulous and arrogant son, Hud, during an outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> putting the family's cattle ranch at risk. Lonnie, Homer's grandson and Hud's nephew, is caught in the conflict and forced to choose which character to follow.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> and bluetongue {{are caused by}} viruses. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus {{is caused by a}} small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in pups. Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections. However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease.|$|E
5|$|The herd {{thrived on}} Llandudno's Great Orme; by 2001 {{they reached a}} {{population}} of 250, and {{were in danger of}} running out of food. Following complaints about goats wandering into people's gardens, the council rejected proposals for a cull, deciding to use a combination of rehoming and birth control. RSPCA marksmen tranquilised nannies and inserted contraceptive progesterone implants to control the numbers of the genetically unique breed. By 2007, 85 goats had been relocated to areas including Kent, Yorkshire, the Brecon Beacons and Somerset, but further efforts were interrupted by an outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Dover's Hill {{was bought}} by the National Trust in 1928, and until {{recently}} contained a monument to Robert Dover. The Games were revived for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but {{did not return to}} being a regular event until the Robert Dover's Games Society was founded in 1965. Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday, and attract thousands of visitors. An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games. Events have included the tug of war, gymkhana, shin-kicking, dwile flonking, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, morris dancing, and, in 1976, poetry. After dusk a bonfire is lit, followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden, where the entertainment continues well into the night.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to the British chain of command in early 2000, he assumed the {{position}} of Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, the second-highest position in the British Army, and a post which entailed promotion to full general and membership of the Army Board. As Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was responsible for assembling forces for the 2000 British intervention in Sierra Leone, which included Brigadier David Richards—later Chief of the Defence Staff—and Jackson's son Mark. He also handled requests from the civilian authorities for assistance with the <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> crisis, floods and strikes by firefighters and fuel-tanker drivers. While still Commander-in-Chief, he stood in for the Chief of the General Staff, marching behind the coffin at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. At the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks, Jackson was on a visit to the British training facility in Alberta, Canada. He managed to return to the UK the next day aboard a casualty evacuation aircraft and had overall responsibility for force generation for the British Army's contribution to the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) is {{a member}} of the Aphthovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family and is the cause of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> in pigs, cattle, sheep and goats. It is a non-enveloped, {{positive}} strand, RNA virus. FMDV is a highly contagious virus. It enters the body through inhalation.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011 a <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> {{outbreak}} was {{registered in}} the village of Rezovo.|$|E
25|$|The {{laboratory}} {{carries out}} research into <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) {{as well as}} other diseases affecting livestock.|$|E
25|$|The Minister for Agriculture, Frederick Peart, {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} investigate the outbreak. The Report of the Committee of Inquiry on <b>Foot-and-Mouth</b> <b>Disease</b> part 1 and part 2 were published on 7 March 1969 and 3 November 1969. This report became more {{commonly known as the}} Northumberland Report. It provided recommendations to keep the disease out of the country and plans for fighting the <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> {{broke out}} in 1937. The animal {{population}} was decimated like never before seen in Zoo Basel's history and the zoo had to temporarily close its doors.|$|E
25|$|Origins of the 1967-8 <b>Foot-and-Mouth</b> <b>Disease</b> Epidemic was {{published}} by the Chief Veterinary Officer, John Reid, on 7 February 1968. This report described the {{lessons learned from the}} outbreak.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 crisis saw {{the last}} {{reported}} case of human <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> The victim was a farm-worker who {{was believed to}} have contracted the virus by consuming contaminated milk. The disease was not life-threatening {{and they were able}} to recover within several weeks.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August 2007 the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) {{confirmed}} that cattle on farmland within the parish {{were found to}} be infected with <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> This was the first outbreak {{of its kind in the}} UK for six years.|$|E
25|$|A {{contained}} four-site {{outbreak of}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> in the United Kingdom {{was found by}} regular livestock testing by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), namely in August 2007 three times, and once the following month, all in the west of Surrey, England.|$|E
25|$|Located {{near the}} former tiger enclosure, this area {{used to be}} a petting farm, but was closed due to an {{outbreak}} of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> The petting farm is now a picnic lawn and a former kune kune pig enclosure has been demolished in favour of a food stall.|$|E
25|$|These cattle have {{a rather}} unusual status, being of a husbanded species but {{living as a}} wild animal. As being of the bovine species, they would be culled if they {{contracted}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> Special considerations apply to health monitoring and maintenance of biosecurity {{is a matter of}} the highest priority.|$|E
25|$|The 1956 Melbourne Games {{were largely}} successful, barring a water polo match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which {{political}} tensions caused to end as a pitched {{battle between the}} teams. Due to a <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak in Britain {{at the time and}} the strict quarantine laws of Australia, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm.|$|E
25|$|Swine plague spreads {{very quickly}} in wild boar, with {{epizootics}} being recorded in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and other regions. <b>Foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> {{can also take}} on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts Pasteurellosis, hemorrhagic septicemia, tularemia and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.|$|E
25|$|Later work {{included}} {{live and}} pre-recorded interviews, {{the reading of}} market reports, the writing of bulletin pieces and ultimately two years as the main Hereford radiocar reporter at breakfast. It was during this time Andrew {{had the opportunity to}} cover major fires, floods and later the outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> Andrew also reported on the Queen's visit to Royal Worcester and would, every year, present live from the Remembrance Service.|$|E
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is the <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Curse of Carlisle is a 16th-century curse {{that was}} first invoked by Archbishop Dunbar of Glasgow in 1525 against {{cross-border}} families, {{known as the}} Border Reivers, who lived by stealing cattle and pillage. For the millennium celebrations, the local council commissioned a 14-tonne granite artwork inscribed with all 1,069 words of the curse. Following {{the installation of the}} stone, Carlisle suffered floods, <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease,</b> job losses and a goal famine for the football team.|$|E
25|$|An {{infection}} of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> in the United Kingdom {{was confirmed by}} the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, on 3 August 2007, on farmland located in Normandy, Surrey. All livestock in the vicinity were culled on 4 August. A nationwide ban on the movement of cattle and pigs was imposed, with a 3-km (1.9-mi) protection zone placed around the outbreak sites and the nearby virus research and vaccine production establishments, together with a 10-km (6.2-mi) increased surveillance zone.|$|E
25|$|In addition, she is or {{has been}} Vice-President of the Animal Welfare Intergroup, {{a member of}} Intergroups on Peace Issues and Consumer Affairs, {{a member of the}} Parliament's Delegation to ACP (African Caribbean, and Pacific) Countries, {{and a member of the}} Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council. As part of her {{committee}} work, she was the Parliament's Rapporteur (draftsperson) on a Commission Communication on the impact of air transport on the environment, and the Vice-President of the parliament's committee of inquiry into <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early 2001, Limestone Lad {{returned}} to hurdles {{and won the}} Bank of Ireland Hurdle at Naas, before beating Boss Doyle by {{three and a half}} lengths to take the Boyne Hurdle for a second time in February. He was unable to contest the 2001 Cheltenham Festival as the meeting was abandoned owing to an outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> At Fairyhouse in spring he finished third to Bannow Bay in the Champion Stayers Hurdle. In his final steeplechase he finished second to Sackville in the Powers Gold Cup at the same course nine days later.|$|E
25|$|They also {{assisted}} the Gardaí in searches for reported parachutists, missing persons, and crashed aircraft. They kept a watch for floating mines and provided cordons when required. They also assisted in policing at two General Elections. Assistance to other Government Departments was also provided, and included the distribution to households of tea rationing forms and ration books (March 1941), census of turf cutting (July 1941), {{a survey of}} accommodation available for refugees, {{and the provision of}} patrols to enforce the regulations governing the movement of cattle on outbreak of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|FAO {{established}} an Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases in 1994, {{focusing on the}} control of diseases like rinderpest, <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> and avian flu by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme, which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest {{for an extended period}} of time. Meanwhile, Locust Watch monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, {{a farmer}} from Bryn Farm {{in the county}} of Shropshire, {{concerned}} by the health {{of one of their}} sows, sought veterinary advice and the animal was found to have contracted <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> Bryn Farm was immediately put into quarantine and general animal movement was banned. The virus rapidly spread to the nearby Ellis Farm. Two cows from the latter had already been sent to market, leaving the farmers in a vulnerable position. In the following months, over 2,364 outbreaks were detected in the United Kingdom. Ninety-four percent of the cases occurred in North-West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
25|$|They {{continue}} to be utilized for embryonic studies, as prenatal development continues to seek testing for fatal diseases. Sea urchins are being used in longevity studies for comparison between the young and old of the species, particularly {{for their ability to}} regenerate tissue as needed. Scientists at the University of St Andrews have discovered a genetic sequence, the '2A' region, in sea urchins previously thought to have belonged only to viruses that afflict humans like <b>Foot-and-Mouth</b> <b>Disease</b> Virus. Oceanography has taken in interest in monitoring the health of urchins and their populations as a way to assess overall ocean acidification, temperatures, and ecological impact studies.|$|E
