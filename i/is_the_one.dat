A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment.

5|$|Early {{descriptions}} of the species came from Carl Ludwig Willdenow, who named it Lichen carneus in 1787, and Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard, who, in 1790, named it Auricularia corticalis. However, the sanctioned name is Thelephora quercina, given by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, and sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in {{the first volume of}} his Systema Mycologicum. The specific name quercina is in reference to Quercus, the generic name for oak. A number of authors (including Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Lucien Quélet and Giacomo Bresadola) reclassified Bulliard's Auricularia corticalis throughout the 19th century, while Persoon's Thelephora quercina was reclassified by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, who placed it in Corticium as Corticium quercinum. However, in 1879, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke transferred the species to his newly described genus Peniophora, declaring it the type species. Despite subsequent attempts at reclassification, Cooke's name <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> currently used.|$|E
