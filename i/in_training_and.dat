5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E

5|$|Believing Mercer to {{have been}} captured, General Currie assumed command of the battle and {{with the use of}} {{saturation}} bombardment was able to retake the lost trenches and drive the Germans back to Mount Sorrel despite heavy casualties. On the 21 June a Canadian burial party found 30 bodies in a sector of trench, amongst them General Mercer's remains, only recognisable by his uniform decoration. Mercer was buried in a military grave at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery, later surmounted with a Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Mercer's funeral was attended by many men of his Division and from his old regiments as well as numerous Canadian and British officers who had worked alongside him. Mercer was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his courage under fire, the third time he had been so mentioned, and his division was taken over by Major-General Louis Lipsett who was himself killed in action two years later. Mercer is remembered as an efficient and capable organiser who never got the opportunity to demonstrate the tactical nous he had shown <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> exercises. He also remains the highest ranking Canadian officer to ever be killed in combat and reportedly by friendly fire.|$|E

5|$|The Kirov-class (Project 26) cruisers were a {{class of}} six cruisers built in the late 1930s for the Soviet Navy. After the first two ships, armor {{protection}} was increased and subsequent ships are sometimes called the Maxim Gorky class. These were the first large ships built by the Soviets from the keel up after the Russian Civil War, and they were derived from the , being designed with assistance from the Italian Ansaldo company. Two ships each were deployed in the Black and Baltic Seas during World War II, while the last pair was still under construction in the Russian Far East and saw no combat during the war. The first four ships bombarded Axis troops and facilities after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.

5|$|The RAAF {{was slow}} to bring its Vengeances into service, their first combat {{missions}} being flown in June 1943. The main deployment of the type took place between mid-January and early March 1944, when squadrons operated in support of Australian and United States Army forces in New Guinea. This force was withdrawn after only six weeks as the Vengeance was considered inferior to other aircraft available to the Allied air forces. All of the RAAF's five Vengeance-equipped squadrons were re-equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. Vengeances continued to be used <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> support roles with the RAAF until 1946, and some were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy between 1948 and 1950 for ground training.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E

40|$|Fatty acids {{are known}} to {{decrease}} insulin-mediated glucose utilization in humans, both at rest and during exercise. To evaluate the effect of endurance <b>training</b> <b>in</b> this process, we infused lipids or saline in groups of sedentary <b>and</b> highly <b>trained</b> subjects. Whole body glucose utilization and substrate oxidation were monitored during a 2. 5 -h hyperinsulinemic clamp. During the last 30 min, a cycling exercise was superimposed. During hyperinsulinemia at rest, whole body glucose utilization and glucose oxidation were higher <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> subjects than <b>in</b> sedentary subjects. Compared with the control experiments with the antilipolytic agent acipimox, lipid infusion stimulated lipid oxidation {{to the same extent}} <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> as <b>in</b> sedentary subjects. It reduced whole body glucose utilization by 37 % <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> by 41 % in sedentary subjects. During exercise, lipid infusion increased more lipid oxidation <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> than <b>in</b> sedentary subjects and reduced whole body glucose utilization by 43 +/- 4 % <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> by 22 +/- 4 % in sedentary subjects (P < 0. 01). The present data indicate that lipid infusion has similar effects on lipid oxidation and whole body glucose utilization during hyperinsulinemia at rest <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> sedentary subjects. During exercise, however, it increases more lipid oxidation and produces a more important reduction in glucose utilization <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> than <b>in</b> sedentary subjects. These results suggest that endurance training enhances the inhibitory effect of lipids on whole body glucose metabolism during exercise...|$|R

5|$|In April 1955 the Australian {{government}} had committed army, navy {{and air force}} elements to the Far East Strategic Reserve {{to assist in the}} defence of Malaya from internal and external security threats. While British Commonwealth forces had been operating against the communist terrorists since 1948, the battalions of the regiment came relatively late to the Malayan Emergency, and when 2 RAR arrived in theatre in October 1955 to join the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, the war had been running for over seven years. 2 RAR was replaced by 3 RAR in 1957, which was in turn replaced by 1 RAR in 1959. During the Emergency the three battalions were involved in 45 contacts, killing 17 guerrillas for the loss of seven men killed in action. According to Jim Molan the attention to detail required of five years of infantry soldiering in Malaya exposed the regiment to jungle warfare skills developed by the British Army during its most successful counterinsurgency war. This experience later informed the development of its own doctrine, with the Malayan Emergency making a significant contribution to the professionalism of the regiment. Meanwhile, the regimental depot—which had been renamed 4 RAR soon after formation—was subsequently incorporated into the School of Infantry and renamed Depot Company, Royal Australian Regiment in 1960. Despite the end of the State of Emergency in Malaya, 1 RAR was employed on anti-terrorist operations along the Thai border in late 1960. 1 RAR was replaced in Malaya by 2 RAR in 1961, with the battalion involved <b>in</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> counter-terrorist operations. It was subsequently employed on operations along the Thai border for three months in mid-1962, and again in May and June 1963, being involved in a number of minor contacts. 2 RAR handed over to 3 RAR in August, and returned to Australia. 3 RAR was also committed to operations along the Thai border in early 1964.|$|E
