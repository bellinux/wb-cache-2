Willems, Implantation of RFID-tag into human molars to reduce hard forensic identification labor. Part 1. Working principle, Forensic Sci. Int. 156 (2006) ]. Maximal vertical occlusal load {{during which the}} implanted RFID-tags remain active was evaluated in vitro. The temperature dependency of the implanted RFID-tags was studied on the extracted teeth {{to find out the}} maximal obtainable temperature before failure and a test with <b>embedded</b> <b>thermistors</b> to verify temperature distributions. The maximal working temperature of the implanted RFID-tags was revealed and gave indications for the set-up of measuring intra oral and intra tooth temperature during the cremation of a human body. Fatigue was induced on the implanted teeth by thermocycling. The results of this investigation showed the need of putting an extra insulating layer around the modified tags before implantation. The different in vitro tests indicated that the implanted RFID-tags can support certain oral and forensic circumstances. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Batteries {{for use in}} vehicle {{applications}} have {{complex and}} coupled electrochemical and thermal phenomena, although these classes of phenomena are often treated separately in modeling efforts. Because important aspects of battery performance, aging, and safety are sensitive to both temperature and electrochemical states, {{it is important to}} include both aspects in a single model. We do this by coupling a well-established 1 D electrochemical model, Dualfoil, with a 3 D thermal model of a battery cell, and solving the resultant energy balance with the finite-volume package Fluent. Independent sizing of the electrochemical and thermal meshes enables simultaneously efficient solution of the electrochemical behavior and accurate resolution of heat transfer in a macroscopic cell. Experiments on 18650 cells with <b>embedded</b> <b>thermistors</b> provided a rough validation of the model. We found that convective cooling with a fan resulted in significantly diminished discharge capacity and efficiency at 4 A and 8 A for a 2. 2 -Ah energy-type cell. This multiphysics approach represents an important contribution to rigorous treatment of battery systems and should find applications in the design of safe and durable automotive cells and packs...|$|R

The availability of baseline thermal flux data is important for testing hypotheses of endangered species such as the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), whose numbers have declined since the 1960 s by more than 80 % in portions of their range. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} quantify heat flow in Steller sea lions under controlled conditions at various water temperatures, flow speeds, and for stationary versus foraging animals. Heat flux and skin temperature data were collected from seven captive Steller sea lions using heat flux sensors (HFSs) with <b>embedded</b> <b>thermistors.</b> Optimal sensor placement was determined using infrared thermography to measure the major pathways of heat flow along the surface of the animals. Experiments were conducted on swimming animals in a large habitat tank with and without a harness to test for effects of increased hydrodynamic drag, and on stationary animals in a temperature controlled swim flume. In the latter, measurements were taken at three water temperatures (9. 0 ? 0. 2 ?C, n= 5; 7. 0 ? 0. 2 ?C, n= 5; and 4. 0 ? 0. 0 ?C, n= 5) and five current settings (0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 0 m/s). The novel sensor attachment technique designed and utilized in this study allowed for the collection of heat flux data independent of human manipulation during actual measurements. Results from infrared thermography and HFSs revealed consistent spatial patterns in heat loss for foraging animals, suggesting that the body trunk plays an important role in temperature regulation. Mean heat flux for animals swimming with a harness was significantly greater than mean heat flux for unencumbered animals, and heat flux increased with decreasing water temperatures. These data provide insight into the thermoregulatory responses of Steller sea lions, and show that although animals lose more heat in colder water, they also unload rather than conserve excess heat when swimming with drag. These data represent valuable new direct measurements of heat flux for Steller sea lions in water using animal-borne heat flux sensors, and may be useful for comparison with other swimming otariids...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{was developed to}} rapidly and accurately measure the thermal conductivity of vacuum insulation panel (VIP). The newly-developed device, mainly consisting of a wirelessly powered and controlled circuit of a resistive-heater and a <b>thermistor</b> <b>embedded</b> in VIP, was based on evaluation theory of thermal insulation materials of conventional large flat thermal protection plate {{and structure of the}} embedded-type heat-flow sensor. The time evolution of the temperature field closely around the thermistor after resistive heating for different time intervals was empirically approximated, physically modeled, and numerically simulated in finite element method with software ASNSYS, to prove its feasibility. The test results revealed quite a few technical strengths of the new technique, including low cost, easy operation, high accuracy, and rapid measurement of thermal conductivity of VIPs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an electronic temperature sensing (ETS) yarn by <b>embedding</b> commercially available <b>thermistors</b> within the fibres of a yarn. The thermistor is initially soldered onto a fine copper wire and then encapsulated to form a polymer micro-pod. The micro-pod protects the thermistor from mechanical and chemical stresses. Thereafter the fine copper wire with micro-pods is covered by a tubular warp knitted structure to craft the final ETS yarn. The miniature size of the micro-pod makes the electronics invisible to the wearer. Such a yarn can be used to knit or weave any textile structure. It is also capable of providing temperature readings at a given point (localised) and {{can be used to make}} a wearable thermograph. Where the ETS yarn is included in a garment, it can be safely washed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{thermal flow}} sensor with smart {{electronic}} interface is presented. The sensor {{is based on}} four germanium <b>thermistors</b> <b>embedded</b> in a thin membrane. The thermistors form a Wheatstone bridge supplied with a constant current. Both bridge output voltage and voltage at the bridge supply terminals are functions of the flow offering high initial sensitivity and wide measurement range, respectively. The signal interface {{is based on a}} relaxation oscillator. The circuit provides a rectangular-wave output whose frequency is related to the bridge unbalance, whereas the duty cycle {{is a function of the}} voltage at the bridge supply terminals. Hence, both sensor signals are simultaneously and independently carried on the same output signal, featuring non-monotonic characteristic over a wide flow range accompanied with a very high sensitivity at low flow velocities. Moreover, as the circuit excites the bridge with a constant current, the connection of remote sensors without accuracy degradation is possible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, fabrication, packaging, and performance characterization of a conformal helix antenna created {{on the outside}} of a 10 mm × 30 mm capsule endoscope designed to operate at a carrier frequency of 433 MHz within human tissue. Wireless data transfer was established between the integrated capsule system and an external receiver. The telemetry system was tested within a tissue phantom and in vivo porcine models. Two different types of transmission modes were tested. The first mode, replicating normal operating conditions, used data packets at a steady power level of 0 dBm, while the capsule was being withdrawn at a steady rate from the small intestine. The second mode, replicating the worst-case clinical scenario of capsule retention within the small bowel, sent data with stepwise increasing power levels of – 10, 0, 6, and 10 dBm, with the capsule fixed in position. The temperature of the tissue surrounding the external antenna was monitored at all times using <b>thermistors</b> <b>embedded</b> within the capsule shell to observe potential safety issues. The recorded data showed, for both modes of operation, a low error transmission of 10 − 3 packet error rate and 10 − 5 bit error rate and no temperature increase of the tissue according to IEEE standards...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the feasibility of temperature-controlled radio-frequency catheter ablation of left and right sided manifest accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and to gain more insights into biophysical aspects of temperature-controlled catheter ablation in humans. Background The electrode-tissue interface tempera-ture and other biophysical parameters are among important variables determining the efficacy and safety of radio-frequency ablation of accessory pathways. Exper-imental studies have shown that radiofrequency-induced tissue necrosis can be accurately predicted by monitoring of catheter tip temperature. Methods 38 consecutive patients (14 f, 24 m; aged 42 ± 12 years) with anterograde conducting accessory pathways (left sided: n = 22; right sided: n= 16) underwent temperature-controlled radiofrequency ablation (HAT 200 S, Dr Osypka, Germany). The electrode temperature was monitored via a <b>thermistor</b> <b>embedded</b> into a 4 mm catheter tip. Power output was adjusted automatically during energy delivery in a closed loop system (preselected temp. : 701 ± 5 - 8 °C). Results Accessory pathway conduction was successfully abolished in all patients after the delivery of 2 - 3 ± 2 1 radiofrequency pulses (range: 1 - 9, median: 2). Interruption of the accessory pathway as evidenced by loss of preexcita-tion occurred after 5 - 9 ± 5 - 4 s. At the time of the interrup-tion of the accessory pathway the catheter tip temperature measured 54 - 2 ± 11 - 2 °C in patients with left and 44 - 9 ± 50 *C in patients with right sided accessory path-ways, respectively (/>< 0008). Higher temperature levels during left sided applications did not shorten the time it took for the effect to appear (left sided accessory pathway...|$|R
40|$|Oral feeding {{competency}} is {{a primary}} requirement for preterm infant hospital release. Currently there is no widely accepted method to objectively measure oral feeding. Feeding consists primarily of the integration of three individual feeding events: sucking, breathing, and swallowing, and the objective of feeding coordination is to minimize aspiration. The purpose of this work was to quantify the infant feeding process from signals obtained during bottle feeding and ultimately develop a measure of feeding coordination. Sucking was measured using a pressure transducer embedded within a modified silicone bottle block. Breathing was measured using a <b>thermistor</b> <b>embedded</b> within nasal cannula, and swallowing was measured {{through the use of}} several different piezoelectric sensors. In addition to feeding signals, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were obtained as an indicator of overall infant behavioral state during feeding. Event detection algorithms for the individual feeding signals were developed and validated, then used {{for the development of a}} measurement of feeding coordination. The final suck event detection algorithm was the result of an iterative process that depended on the validity of the signal model. As the model adapted to better represent the data, the accuracy and specificity of the algorithm improved. For the breath signal, however, the primary barrier to effective event detection was significant baseline drift. The frequency components of the baseline drift overlapped significantly with the breath event frequency components, so a time domain solution was developed. Several methods were tested, and it was found that the acceleration vector of the signal provided the most robust representation of the underlying breath signal while minimizing baseline drift. Swallow signal event detection was not possible due to a lack of available data resulting from problems with the consistency of the obtained signal. A robust method was developed for the batch processing of heart rate variability analysis. Finally a method of coordination analysis was developed based on the event detection algorithm outputs. Coordination was measured by determining the percentage of feeding time that consisted of overlapping suck and breath activity...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. A {{new generation of}} silicon-micromachined or micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) sensors for the general purpose of microflow measurement and control is presented here. The first one is a polysilicon hot-wire anemometer made by a combined bulk and surface micromachining process. The new devices feature batch-fabricated freestanding micro polysilicon hot wires {{that are similar to}} conventional metal hot wires. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental (steady-state and dynamic) results show that MEMS hot wires have order-of-magnitude better frequency response, finer spatial resolution, and higher sensitivity over conventional hot-wire anemometers. A novel MEMS thermal shear-stress sensor featuring vacuum-cavity insulation has been developed. The device is a polysilicon wire <b>thermistor</b> <b>embedded</b> in a silicon-nitride diaphragm which sits on top of a vacuum cavity. The vacuum cavity is to improve the thermal isolation between the polysilicon wire and substrate. To characterize the devices, both steady-state and transient heat-transfer theories have been established and used to calibrate wind-tunnel results, temperature sensitivities and frequency responses. Shear-stress sensor array chips have also been developed. Each of the shear-stress imagers has more than 100 sensors integrated on a 1 x 2. 85 [ [...] . ] chip. Our measurement results from a fully developed 2 -D channel flow are well agreeable with previously published results. For the first time, real-time 2 -D wall shear-stress images in a turbulent flow have been experimentally obtained. A new technology for the integration of micro-sensors, micro-actuators and microelectronics (M 3) on a single chip has been explored. Prototype M 3 chips including shear-stress sensors, magnetic actuators and CMOS circuits have been fabricated. This technology sets a base for the future development of a fully functional M 3 chip drag reduction. Finally, a novel flexible MEMS skin technology fully compatible with IC process has been developed. Mechanically, the skin is made of metal leads sandwiched between polyimide layers that connect a number of silicon islands together. The skin can be applied conformablly on non-planar surfaces. The first application of this technology is a flexible shear-stress sensor skin that has been successfully used for the real-time measurement of shear-stress distribution on the leading edge of a delta wing model. ...|$|R
