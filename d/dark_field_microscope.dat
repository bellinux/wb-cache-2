This inverse series could be directly correlated to the size and hydration thermodynamics of the anions. At higher salt concentrations, the liquid–liquid phase transition displayed a direct Hofmeister series that correlated with the polarizability of the anions. A simple model was derived to take both charge screening and surface tension effects into account at the protein/water interface. Fitting the thermodynamic data to this model equation demonstrated its validity in both the high and low salt regimes. These results suggest that in general positively charged macromolecular systems should show inverse Hofmeister behavior only at relatively low salt concentrations, but revert to a direct Hofmeister series as the salt concentration is increased...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLocalized Surface Plasmon Resonance: Single Particle to Ensemble Binding Measurements. byJamie Nicholas KulpDoctor of Philosophy in ChemistryUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Marcin Majda, Chair	Plasmonic {{nanoparticles}} are {{an emerging}} technology, which demonstrates immense utility {{in the field}} of sensitive, label-free, molecular detection assays. Plasmonic nanoparticles exhibit a physical phenomenon known as Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance or LSPR. LSPR is a phenomenon based on the collective oscillations of free, surface electrons in certain metals such as silver and gold. The surface electrons couple to incident light at a specific frequency corresponding to the resonance frequency of these surface electron's oscillations. These oscillations scatter the incident light at the resonant frequency with a very high efficiency. The frequency of these oscillations and the scattered light is not only dependent on physical characteristics of the particles, such as their material composition, geometric shape and size, but also on the refractive index of both the particle and the surrounding medium in which the particles are located. Changes in the refractive index at the interface between the particle's surface and the surrounding medium, is the physical basis of analytical methods utilizing plasmonic nanoparticles. The sensitivity of the LSPR frequency to the surrounding medium's refractive index allows for the ability to observe changes in the refractive index at the particles surface due to molecular binding events. The monitoring of changes in the refractive index is accomplished by analyzing the peak LSPR frequency {{as a function of the}} refractive index at the surface interface of the particle and the surrounding medium. As molecular binding events occur at the surface interface between the particle and the surrounding medium, an increase in the local refractive index occurs. This increase in the local refractive index is accompanied by a red shift in the maximum LSPR wavelength of the scattered light. By monitoring changes in the maximum wavelength of scattered light, a calibration curve can be constructed, which relates the changes in the LSPR frequency to changes in the local refractive index at the particles surface. Changes in refractive index are ultimately related to a change in the mass of absorbed particles at the particle's surface due to molecular binding. There are various instrumental methods that have been shown to be capable of detecting these refractive index changes at the plasmonic particles surface. These methods include solution-based ensemble techniques, as well as single particle scattering measurements. Solution-based ensemble measurements commonly utilize UV-Visible spectrophotometers, but can also include the use of the backscattering interferometer. Single particle methods are predominately performed using the <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering microscopy. The <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering <b>microscope</b> is ideal for single particle measurements on plasmonic nanoparticles due to the particles remarkably high scattering coefficients relative to their geometrical size. The <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering <b>microscope</b> also has relatively low background noise, which is particularly important for experiments on the single particle level where the signal-to-noise ratio must be maximized. Single particle <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering methods involve the coupling of a <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering <b>microscope</b> with a spectrometer in order to collect and analyze the scattered light of individual nanoparticles. The limitations and benefits of each of these experimental designs are discussed further in the body of this dissertation. Briefly, solution-based assays offer the benefit of being performed in colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles without the need to utilize specialized surface chemistry as a means to immobilize the particles to the underlying substrate. Solution-based measurements are also compatible, in most situations, with instrumentation that is commonly found in laboratories. As a result of the compatibility of solution-based measurements with common laboratory instruments, such as the UV-visible spectrometer, measurements do not generally require dedicated, specialized instrumentation. This of course is not universally true as will be seen with experiments are performed using the backscattering interferometer. However, many examples of solution-based assays utilizing more common laboratory instrumentation are now available in the literature. Despite these advantages, solution-based colloidal measurements are ensemble measurements and due to the statistical nature of these measurements, individual, unique features that may occur on the single particle level are obscured due to the averaging of many particles contribution to the collected signal. To overcome this statistical limitation, single particle assays have been developed. Most notably among these single particle experiments is the use of <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering microscopy, coupled with spectroscopic measurements of the scattered light to examine the optical properties of individual nanoparticles. While this platform has shown that it is possible to interrogate individual particles, as well molecular binding events occurring at the surface of the particles, there are a few technical drawbacks to this method as well. The first of these technical drawbacks is the need to immobilize the particle onto the underlying substrate. This is to prevent random Brownian motion of the particles when performing experiments in aqueous environments. When observing the particles in a vacuum or air environment this need is not as rigorous as the electrostatic interactions between the particle and the underlying substrate are sufficient to immobilize the particle during measurements. In order to explore binding events occurring in aqueous systems, which include receptor-ligand binding, DNA-DNA base pairing and other solution-based molecular recognition events, it is necessary to develop a method of immobilizing the particle to the surface of the underlying substrate utilizing surface chemistry techniques. In this dissertation it is shown that the use of the supported lipid bilayer is a very effective and versatile means of accomplishing this immobilization of the particle to the underlying substrate used in <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> microscopy. This can be accomplished by incorporating biotin-functionalized lipids into the composition of a supported lipid bilayer formed on the particles, as well as the supported bilayer formed on the underlying substrate. The formation of a supported lipid bilayer containing a fraction of biotin-functionalized lipids on the underlying substrate, as well as the nanoparticle, it is possible to tether the particles to the substrate surface through streptavidin-biotin molecular interactions. This proves to be a robust and simple method of immobilizing particles to a substrate capable of supporting the formation of a supported lipid bilayer. Silica oxide or glass is a material, which allows for the spontaneous formation of a supported lipid bilayer from single unilaminar vesicles. Presented here is the synthesis of cubic geometry nanoparticles that are surrounded with a thin silica shell of nanometer thickness. This thin silica shell allows for the spontaneous formation of a supported lipid bilayer on individual nanoparticles. This feature facilitates the immobilization of the particles for studies using the <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> scattering <b>microscope.</b> Nanoparticle-based analytical platforms, regardless of being implemented on the single particle level or using colloidal, solution-based ensemble measurements, offer a very robust and sensitive, label-free analytical technique for quantify molecular binding events occurring at the particle's surface...|$|R

It {{was found that the}} integrated intensity of monochromatic light in a phase contrast or <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope</b> was dependent on relative cell volume. For cells of different size and shape (Sf 9, MDCK, CHO, A 549, tracheal epithelia, BHK), increased cell volume was associated with decreased signal intensity; generally the signal decreased 10 – 20 % for a twofold increase in cell volume. A theory relating signal intensity to relative cell volume was developed based on spatial filtering and changes in optical path length associated with cell volume changes. Theory predictions were confirmed by signal measurements of cell layers bathed in solutions of various osmolarities and refractive indices. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the transmitted light detection permitted measurement of cell volume changes of < 1 %. The method was applied to characterize transfected cells and tissues that natively express water channels. Pf in control Chinese hamster ovary cells was low (0. 0012 cm/s at 23 °C) and increased more than fourfold upon stable transfection with aquaporins 1, 2, 4, or 5. Pf in apical and basolateral membranes in polarized epithelial cells grown on porous supports was measured.

The work in this thesis examines two of these motors: the F 1 portion of F 1 F O- ATP synthase, which is responsible for ATP production in bacteria and eukaryotes, and the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM), which rotates the flagella of a bacterium, enabling locomotion. The aim of these investigations was to measure the stepping dynamics of these motors, in order to further elucidate details of the stepping mechanism, the mechanism of rotation, and the mechanochemical cycle. A back-scattering laser <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope</b> of unprecedented resolution was designed and constructed to observe the rotation of gold nanoparticles attached to fixed motors. This micro- scope is capable of sub-nanometer and 20 μs resolution. The protocols and algorithms to collect and analyze high resolution rotational data developed for these experiments have yielded novel discoveries for both F 1 and the BFM. While most of the previous single-molecule work has been done on F 1 from the thermophilic Bacilus PS 3 (TF 1), only mitochondrial F 1 has been well characterized by high-resolution crystal structures, and single-molecule studies of mesophilic F 1 are lacking. This thesis presents evidence that mesophilic F 1 from E. coli and wild type yeast F 1 from S. cerevisiae are governed by the same mechanism as TF 1 under laboratory conditions. Experiments with yeast F 1 mutants allow a direct comparison between single-molecule rotation studies and high resolution crystal structures.

The majority of this body of work explores nanoparticles optical responses as they undergo energy transfer processes for biological sensing. The latter portion of this dissertation discusses optical microscopy in undergraduate analytical chemistry. In the first experiment, plasmon resonance energy transfer between gold nanospheres and cytochrome c was investigated. As cytochrome c adsorbs {{to the surface of}} a nanoparticle, the plasmonic energy is transferred from the nanoparticle to cytochrome c, as a result there are spectral dips in the extinction spectrum of the gold nanoparticle. This optical phenomenon was studied in Hi-Fi microchannels and HeLa cells undergoing ethanol induced apoptosis. The second set of experiments encompasses the observations of the optical changes of gold-capped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) undergoing uncapping by dithiothreitol and glutathione. The uncapping process was studied in flow cells with dithiothreitol as the uncapping agent, and also in lung cancer cells using glutathione as the cleaving agent. Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy was employed to image the optical changes as gold is cleaved from MSNs.

A total of 80 teeths were divided into four groups of 20 teeth each taken from separate quadrants, on the basis of one of the following four treatments: (1) Root planning alone in first quadrant (RP group); (2) tetracycline-containing gel in the second quadrant (TCG group); (3) root planning plus tetracycline-containing gel in third quadrant (RP + TCG group); (4) root planning plus a mixture of tetracycline and citric acid-containing gel in fourth quadrant (RP + TC-CAG group). Plaque index (PI), sulcular bleeding index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were measured for 0 day, 8 th week, and 12 th week, respectively. Subgingival plaque samples from each site were collected at the same visits and examined with <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope</b> for proportions of motile rods and spirochetes. Results: From 0 day to 12 th week, PI, sulcular bleeding index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment levels decreased significantly in all the groups. From 0 day to 12 th week, RP + TC-CAG group showed a significantly higher change in the PI score. From 0 day to 12 th week, RP group showed a significantly higher change in sulcular bleeding index score. A significant decrease in probing pocket depth and gain in clinical attachment level was noted at 12 th week in RP + TC-CAG group compared to the other groups. A significant decrease in the proportion of motile rods was found primarily in the RP + TC-CAG group. There was a decrease in the proportion of spirochetes in all the groups. Conclusion: The results indicated that the use of a mixture of tetracycline and citric acid-containing gel was effective in improving gingival health and in changing subgingival microflora...|$|E
40|$|With device scaling, {{the current}} optical {{lithography}} technique is reaching its technological limit to print small features. Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) lithography has shown promise to print extremely thin lines reliably and cost-effectively. Many challenges remain before introducing EUV to large scale manufacturing. The main challenge {{addressed in this}} study is particle removal from EUV mask surfaces (CrON 1, CrON 2, and fused silica) and thermal oxide (SiO₂). Effective pre-clean procedures were developed for each surface. As chemical cleaning methods fail to meet SEMATECH criteria, addition of megasonic energy to EUV mask cleaning baths is seen as a promising cleaning methodology. As the requirement to print fine lines needs to be met, all materials used in EUV mask fabrication either absorb the incident EUV wavelength light or reflect it. Therefore, the masks used in the industry will be reflective instead of the conventional transmissive masks. Also, for the same reason, no protective pellicle can be used leading to all the surfaces unprotected from particle contamination. To avoid the detrimental effect of the particle contamination, a cleaning study for nano-particle removal was performed. A <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope</b> was utilized to study the removal of gold nano-particles from surfaces. The cleaning procedures utilized H₂SO₄ and NH₄OH chemistries with and without megasonic irradiation. The cleaning variables were bath concentration, temperature, and megasonic power. The contamination variables were the gold nanoparticles charge and size, from 40 nm to 100 nm. For 100 nm negatively charged gold nano-particles deposited on a CrON 1 surface, a 1 : 10 H₂SO₄:DI bath at boiling temperature (101 °C) without megasonics gave high particle removal efficiency (PRE) values as did a 1 : 10 H₂SO₄:DI bath at 35 °C with 100 W megasonics. Comparison of removal of poly diallyl-dimethyl ammonium chloride (PDAC) coated and uncoated gold nano-particles deposited on a CrON 1 surface using dilute H₂SO₄ baths indicated that the coated, positively charged nano-particles were more difficult to remove. PRE trends for different baths indicate surface dissolution (shown to be thermodynamically favorable) as the particle removal mechanism. However, experimental etch rates indicated minimal surface etching in a 10 minute bath. Increased surface roughness indicated possible local galvanic corrosion at particle sites. Low surface etching results meet SEMATECH requirements. During the fused silica surface cleaning study, particle charge (negative) and size (100 nm) of the contamination source and cleaning bath chemistry (NH₄OH) were kept constant. Low PREs were obtained at room temperature for all NH₄OH bath concentrations; however, high PREs were obtained at an elevated temperature (78 °C) without megasonics and at room temperature in more dilute chemistries with megasonic power applied. Similar PRE trends were demonstrated for thermal SiO₂ surfaces. The experimental etch rates of the thermal SiO₂ agree with published values...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, {{head and}} neck {{squamous}} cell cancers (HNSCC) account for over 375, 000 deaths annually. The majority of these cancers arise in the outermost squamous cells which progress {{through a series of}} precancerous changes before developing into invasive HNSCC. It is widely accepted that prognosis is strongly correlated to the stage of diagnosis, with early detection more than doubling the patient’s chance of survival. Currently, however, 60 % of HNSCCs are diagnosed when they have already progressed to stage 3 or stage 4 disease. The current diagnostic method of visual examination often fails to recognize early indicators of HNSCC, thereby missing an important prevention window. Determination of cancer from non-malignant tissues is dependent on pathological examination of lesion biopsies. Thus, all patients with any clinically suspicious lesions undergo surgical biopsies. Furthermore, these surgical biopsies carry risks. In addition to the risk of general anesthesia for patients undergoing panedoscopy, some patients have poor healing and develop ulcerations or infections as a result of surgical biopsy at any anatomical site. Additionally, studies have shown that approximately 50 % of suspected biopsies are later pathologically confirmed normal. An enormous amount of labor, facility, and monetary resources are expended on non-malignant biopsies and patients who ultimately have no malignancy. It would be of immense overall benefit to clinicians and patients to have a non-invasive and portable technique that could rapidly identify those patients that would benefit from further surgical biopsy from those that only need follow-up clinical observations. Once carcinoma is confirmed in a patient, treatment currently involves modalities of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy plays a significant role, particularly in the management of localized HNSCC, because it is a non-invasive and function-preserving modality. However, the effectiveness of radiotherapy is limited by hypoxia. Previous studies showed that tumors reoxygenated during radiotherapy treatment may have a better prognosis. Despite decades of work, there is still no reliable, cost-effective way for measuring tumor hypoxia over multiple time points to estimate the prognosis. To address these unmet clinical needs, three aims were proposed. The first aim was to improve early detection by identifying biomarkers of early pre-cancer as well as developing an objective algorithm to detect early disease. Neovasculature is an important biomarker for early cancer diagnosis. Even before the development of a clinically detectable lesion, the tumor vasculature undergoes structural and morphological changes in response to oncogenic signaling pathways [8]. Without receiving a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to proliferate, early tumor growth is limited to only 1 - 2 mm. High-resolution optical imaging is well suited to characterize the earliest neovascularization changes that accompany neoplasia owing to its sensitivity to hemoglobin absorption and resolution to visualize capillary level architecture. Dark field microscopy is a low-cost and robust method to image the neovasculature. We imaged neovascularization in vivo in a spontaneous hamster oral mucosa carcinogen model using a label-free, reflected-light spectral <b>dark</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope.</b> Hamsters’ cheek pouches were painted with 7, 12 -Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to induce precancerous to cancerous changes, or mineral oil as control. Spectral dark field images were obtained during carcinogenesis and in control oral mucosa, and quantitative vascular features were computed. Vascular tortuosity increased significantly in oral mucosa diagnosed as hyperplasia, dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to normal. Vascular diameter and area fraction decreased significantly in dysplasia and SCC compared to normal. The areas under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) computed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) were 0. 95 and 0. 84 for identifying SCC or dysplasia, respectively, vs. normal and hyperplasia oral mucosa combined. To improve AUCs for identifying dysplasia, quantitative vascular features were computed again after the vessels were split into large and small vessels based on diameter. The large vessels preserved the same significant trends, while small vessels demonstrated the opposite trends. Significant increases in diameter and decreases in area fraction were observed in SCC and dysplasia. The AUCs were improved to 0. 99 and 0. 92 for identifying SCC and dysplasia. These results suggest that dark field vascular imaging is a promising tool for pre-cancer detection. Optical imaging can also be applied to quantifying other important characteristics of solid tumors in {{head and neck}} cancer (HNC), such as hypoxia, abnormal vascularity and cell proliferation. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is a simple and robust method to measure tissue oxygenation, vascularity and cell density. It is particularly suitable for applications in the operation room because of its compact design and portability. In addition, a fiber probe-based system is ideal for obtaining measurements at suspicious lesions {{in the head and neck}} area during surgery. Thus, my second aim was to reduce the number of unnecessary HNSCC biopsies by developing a robust tool and rapid analysis method appropriate for clinical settings. We propose the use of morphological optical biomarkers for rapid detection of human HNSCC by leveraging the underlying tissue characteristics in the aerodigestive tracts Prior to biopsy, diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained from malignant and contra-lateral non-malignant tissues of 57 patients undergoing panendoscopy. Oxygen saturation (SO 2), total hemoglobin concentration ([THb]), and the reduced scattering coefficient were extracted using an inverse Monte Carlo (MC) method previously developed by former student in our lab. Differences in malignant and non-malignant tissues were examined based on two different groupings: by anatomical site and by morphological tissue type. Measurements were acquired from 252 sites, 51 of which were pathologically classified as SCC. Optical biomarkers exhibited statistical differences between malignant and non-malignant samples. Contrast was enhanced when parsing tissues by morphological classification rather than by anatomical subtype for unpaired comparisons. Corresponding linear discriminant models using multiple optical biomarkers showed improved predictive ability when accounting for morphological classification, particularly in node-positive lesions. The false-positive rate was retrospectively found to decrease by 34. 2 % in morphologically- vs. anatomically-derived predictive models. In glottic tissue, the surgeon exhibited a false-positive rate of 45. 7 % while the device showed a lower false-positive rate of only 12. 4 %. Additionally, comparisons of optical parameters were made to further understand the physiology of tumor staging and potential causes of high surgeon false-positive rates. Optical spectroscopy is a user-friendly, non-invasive tool capable of providing quantitative information to discriminate malignant from non-malignant head and neck tissues. Predictive models demonstrated promising results for diagnostics. Furthermore, the strategy described appears to be well suited to reduce the clinical false-positive rate. To further improve the speed for extracting the tissue oxygenation and [THb] to reduce the time when patients were under anesthesia, the third aim was to develop a rapid heuristic ratiometric analysis for estimating tissue [THb] and SO 2 from measured tissue diffuse reflectance spectra. The analysis was validated in tissue-mimicking phantoms and applied to clinical measurements in head and neck, cervical and breast tissues. The analysis works in two steps. First, a linear equation that translates the ratio of the diffuse reflectance spectra at 584 nm to 545 nm to estimate the tissue [THb] using a Monte carlo (MC) -based lookup table was developed. This equation is independent of tissue scattering and oxygen saturation. Second, SO 2 was estimated using non-linear logistic equations that translate the ratio of the diffuse reflectance spectra at 539 nm to 545 nm into the tissue SO 2. Correlations coefficients of 0. 89 (0. 86), 0. 77 (0. 71) and 0. 69 (0. 43) were obtained for the tissue hemoglobin concentration (oxygen saturation) values extracted using the full spectral MC and the ratiometric analysis, for clinical measurements in head and neck, breast and cervical tissues, respectively. The ratiometric analysis was more than 4000 times faster than the inverse MC analysis for estimating tissue [THb] and SO 2 in simulated phantom experiments. In addition, the discriminatory power of the two analyses was similar. These results show the potential of such empirical tools to rapidly estimate tissue hemoglobin and oxygenation for real-time applications. In addition to its use as a diagnostic marker for various cancers, tissue oxygenation is believed to play a role in the success of cancer therapies, particularly radiotherapy. However, since little effort has been made to develop tools to exploit this relationship, the fourth aim was to estimate patient prognosis by measuring tumor hypoxia over multiple time points so physicians are able to develop more informed and effective clinical treatment plan. To test if oxygenation kinetics correlates with the likelihood for local tumor control following fractionated radiotherapy, we again used diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to noninvasively measure tumor vascular oxygenation and [THb] associated with radiotherapy of 5 daily fractions (7. 5, 9 or 13. 5 Gy/day) in FaDu xenografts. Spectroscopy measurements were obtained immediately before each daily radiation fraction and during the week after radiotherapy. SO 2 and [THb] were computed using an inverse MC model. Oxygenation kinetics during and after radiotherapy, but before a change in tumor volume, was associated with local tumor control. Locally controlled tumors exhibited significantly faster increases in oxygenation after radiotherapy (days 12 - 15) compared with tumors that recurred locally. (2) Within the group of tumors that recurred, faster increases in oxygenation during radiotherapy (days 3 - 5) were correlated with earlier recurrence times. An AUC of 0. 74 was achieved when classifying the local control tumors from all irradiated tumors using the oxygen kinetics with a logistic regression model. (3) The rate of increase in oxygenation was radiation dose dependent. Radiation doses ≤ 9. 5 Gy/day did not initiate an increase in oxygenation whereas 13. 5 Gy/day triggered significant increases in oxygenation during and after radiotherapy. Additional confirmation is required in other tumor models, but these results suggest that monitoring tumor oxygenation kinetics could aid in the prediction of local tumor control after radiotherapy. Angiogenesis is a highly regulated process to support tissue growth. Neovasculature is designed by nature to grow toward areas lacking nutrition and oxygen. Cancer cells proliferate too quickly to have their nutritional and oxygen needs completely satisfied, which results in an imbalanced state of angiogenesis leading to tortuous blood vessels, hypoxic tissues and radioresistance. We characterized the tumor-induced vascular features with simple, robust and low-cost dark field microscopy and spectroscopy to enable early cancer diagnosis, improvement of surgical biopsy accuracy and better predict the prognosis of radiotherapy for HNC. Our results demonstrated that these noninvasively measured, label-free vascular features are able to detect pre-cancer, reduce unnecessary surgical biopsies and predict prognosis of radiotherapy.
