40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} {{has been}} widely used to produce automotive structural components due to the superior properties of the hydroformed parts {{in terms of their}} light weight and structural rigidity. Compared to the traditional manufacturing process for a closed-section member including stamping and followed by welding, tube-hydro forming leads to cost savings due to reduced tooling and material handling. However, the high pressure pumps and high tonnage press required in hydroforming, lead to increased capital investment reducing the cost benefits.

40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} is {{a process}} of forming closed-section, hollow parts with different cross sections by applying combined internal hydraulic forming pressure and end axial compressive loads or feeds to force a tubular blank to conform to the shape of a given die cavity. It {{is one of the most}} advanced metal forming processes and is ideal for producing seamless, lightweight, near net shape components [...] This innovative manufacturing process offers several advantages over conventional manufacturing processes such as part consolidation, weight reduction and lower tooling and process cost. To increase the implementation of this technology in different manufacturing industries, dramatic improvements for <b>hydroformed</b> <b>part</b> design and process development are imperative. The current design and development of tube hydroforming processes is plagued with long design and prototyping lead times of the component. The formability of hydroformed tubular parts is affected by various physical parameters such as material properties, tube and die geometry, boundary conditions and process loading paths. Finite element simulation is perceived by the industry to be a cost-effective process analysis tool and has the capability to provide a greater insight into the deformation mechanisms of the process and hence allow for greater product and process optimization. Recent advances in the non-linear metal forming simulation capabilities of finite element software have made simulation of many complex hydroforming processes much easier. Although finite element based simulation provides a better understanding of the process, trial-and-error based simulation and optimization becomes very costly for complex processes. Thus, powerful intelligent optimization methods are required for better design and understanding of the process. This work develops a better understanding of the forming process and its control parameters. An experimental study of ‘X ’ and ‘T’-branch type tube hydroforming was undertaken and finite element models of these forming processes were built and subsequently validated against the experimental results. Furthermore these forming processes were optimized using finite element simulations enhanced with numerical optimization algorithms and with an adaptive process control algorithm. These new tools enable fast and effective determination of loading paths optimized for successful hydroforming of complex tubular parts and replace trial-and-error approaches by a more efficient customized finite element analysis approach...|$|E

50|$|While {{springback}} {{has long}} been a topic of discussion for sheet metal forming operations it has been far less of a topic of research for tube hydroforming. This may in part be a result of the relatively low levels of springback naturally occurring when deforming the tubes into their closed section geometries. Tube Hydroformed sections by the nature of their closed sections are very rigid and do not display high degrees of elastic deformation under load. For this reason it is likely that negative residual stress induced during tube hydroforming might be insufficient to deform the part elastically after the completion of forming. However, as more and more tubular parts are being manufactured using high strength steel and advanced high strength steel parts, springback must be accounted for in the design and manufacture of closed section tube <b>hydroformed</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Load-adapted local {{reinforcements}} {{are used}} in the automotive industry in terms of lightweight construction and improvement of properties of mechanically loaded components. This can be done by the conventional way of separately formed reinforcement parts that are joined during the assembly process, or in the modern form of tailored products. In this report the research results of joining local reinforcements during the process of hydroforming are shown. Thereby, component and reinforcement are joined by a form lock in the hydroforming process, that ensures handling stability from the removal out of the shaping die until the end of curing of the previously applied adhesive on the reinforcement. This joining method is challenged to work within the circumstances of the hydroforming process, the requirements of a combined process and the potential of the adhesives. Major design criteria are the shaping of the form-locked joint and design of the adhesive bond. The demand on the form-locked joint is, to ensure handling stability until the adhesive layer has completely cured. When designing the form elements it is necessary to find a compromise between the maximum possible clamping of the parts {{on the one hand and}} minimal influence on the thickness profile of the <b>hydroforming</b> <b>part</b> on the other hand. By comparing different design alternatives in experiment and simulation it was determined that a sufficient handling stability is achieved best by using existing undercuts in the hydroforming profile by an embracing reinforcement and combining this undercut advantageously with an additional form element in the profile. To determine the best possible adhesive bond, the properties of several adhesives were tested and compared and also different adhesive systems were evaluated in terms of their process capability. An adhesive was supposed to be found, that can be applied previously, is compatible to hydroforming and contamination and achieves maximum strength in the cured state. In addition, the adhesive has to fill a diverging gap between reinforcement and <b>hydroforming</b> <b>part.</b> In this research project none of the adhesives available on the market could meet all general requirements. The research institutes see great potential in a development of pre-applicable melting adhesives towards greater flexibility and formability. Due to the experiments and testing of component properties, the feasibility of the method was successfully demonstrated. The reinforcement and the <b>hydroforming</b> <b>part</b> can be joined without adapting the hydroforming process and the handling stability of the reinforcement is given by the form-lock, generated in the hydroforming process. To create an adhesive bond, pre-applicable adhesives can be used advantageously. The locally reinforced hydroformed components show a significant increase in load capacity in the 3 -point bending test. In the fatigue test with local tension loads on the reinforced area of the component, an improvement of life expectancy was detected. In the crash test, local reinforcements also contribute to an improvement of the component behaviour. The risk of corrosion is minimized when the adhesive layer is optimal developed, resulting in passing the corrosion test after the EDP coating of the parts...|$|R

The hydroformed aluminium is then removed from the mold.Hydroforming allows complex shapes with concavities to be formed, which would be difficult or impossible with standard solid die stamping. <b>Hydroformed</b> <b>parts</b> can often be made with a higher stiffness-to-weight ratio and at a lower per unit cost than traditional stamped or stamped and welded parts.

Advances in FEA and FEM in recent years has enabled hydroform processes to be more widely engineered for varieties of parts and materials.

40|$|New {{requirements}} {{from the}} automotive industry regarding light weight design request the realization of structural parts with maximum strength over 1, 000 MPa. On the other hand, demands concerning part complexity, function integration and part quality become higher and higher. The press hardening technology of boron-manganese alloyed steel for blank based part applications represent {{the state of the}} art. Typical applications are reinforcement parts in crash relevant car body structures.

By this, hydroforming of tubes and blanks at room temperature represents also {{the state of the art}} for several applications in car body structures or exhaust systems, but also for special applications outside the car industry. These parts are mainly made from materials such as steel, high-strength steel, stainless steel and aluminium. Originating from increased demands for <b>hydroformed</b> <b>parts</b> regarding maximum strength and complexity the limits of conventional hydroforming processes are reached. The use of temperature as a process parameter in hydroforming offers the chance to increase the application field of this innovative technology. The potential of this strategy was proven; complex car body parts of aluminium and magnesium were realized at elevated temperatures. However, today available fluids can only be used up to 300 C because of the limited thermal resistance of the available fluids. Gaseous media (e. g. nitrogen) offer the chance to use the potential of temperature-supported hydroforming also in steel forming. Consequently, temperatures up to 1, 0000 ́ 3 C can be provided. In analogy to hot stamping processes for blanks, it is also possible to combine the gas forming process with a special heat treatment and to realize closed structural parts with highest strength in anthology to applications of hydroformed car body structures, such as A-pillars (BMW, VOLVO, OPEL), roof rails (AUDI), cross members (BMW), crash cans (VOLVO) or sill reinforcement parts (AUDI, VOLVO), in serial production...|$|R

40|$|The Aerospace {{industries}} of the 21 st century demand {{the use of}} cutting edge materials and manufacturing technology. New manufacturing methods such as hydroforming are relatively new and {{are being used to}} produce commercial vehicles. This process allows for part consolidation and reducing the number of parts in an assembly compared to conventional methods such as stamping, press forming and welding of multiple components. Hydroforming in particular, provides an endless opportunity to achieve multiple crosssectional shapes in a single tube. A single tube can be pre-bent and subsequently hydroformed to create an entire component assembly instead of welding many smaller sheet metal sections together. The knowledge of tube hydroforming for aerospace materials is not well developed yet, thus new methods are required to predict and study the formability, and the critical forming limits for aerospace materials. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the formability and the mechanical properties of aerospace materials, a novel online measurement approach based on free expansion test is developed using a 3 D automated deformation measurement system (Aramis®) to extract the coordinates of the bulge profile during the test. These coordinates are used to calculate the circumferential and longitudinal curvatures, which are utilized to determine the effective stresses and effective strains at different stages of the tube hydroforming process. In the second step, two different methods, a weighted average method and a new hardening function are utilized to define accurately the true stress-strain curve for post-necking regime of different aerospace alloys, such as inconel 718 (IN 718), stainless steel 321 (SS 321) and titanium (Ti 6 Al 4 V). The flow curves are employed in the simulation of the dome height test, which is utilized for generating the forming limit diagrams (FLDs). Then, the effect of stress triaxiality, the stress concentration factor and the effective plastic strain on the nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids are investigated through a new user material for burst prediction during tube hydroforming. A numerical procedure for both plasticity and fracture is developed and implemented into 3 D explicit commercial finite element software (LS-DYNA) through a new user material subroutine. The FLDs and predicted bursting pressure results are compared to the experimental data to validate the models. Finally, the new user material model is used to predict the bursting point of some real tube <b>hydroforming</b> <b>parts</b> such as round to square and round to V parts.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{fuel costs}} and the current drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption, a need to reduce vehicle weight is apparent. Weight reduction {{can be achieved by}} replacing conventionally stamped structural members with <b>hydroformed</b> <b>parts.</b> The weight reduction can be further enhanced by reducing the thickness of the hydroformed members through the use of advanced high strength steel (AHSS). A primary limitation in hydroforming AHSS, is the limited ductility or formability of these materials. This limitation becomes acute in multi-stage forming operations in which strain path changes become large making it difficult to predict formability. Thus, the focus of the current work is to study the effects of pre-bending on the subsequent hydroformability of Dual-Phase DP 600 steel tubes. As part of this effort, the effect of key bending and hydroforming process parameters, bending boost and hydroforming end-feed, have been studied in a parametric fashion. Multi-step pre-bending and hydroforming experiments were performed on 76. 2 mm (3. 0 ") OD tubes with a wall-thickness of 1. 85 mm (DP 600). Experiments were also performed on 1. 74 mm Interstitial Free (IF) steel tube, which provided a low strength, high formability baseline material for comparison purposes. A fully instrumented servo-hydraulic mandrel-rotary draw tube bender was used in the pre-bending experiments in which various levels of boost were applied. The results showed that increased boost reduced the major (tensile) strain and thinning at the outside of the bend. At the inside of the bend, the compressive minor strain became larger and thickening increased. Hydroforming of the straight and pre-bent tubes was conducted using various levels of load-control end-feed (EF). For both straight and pre-bend tube hydroforming, an increase in hydroforming EF resulted in increased burst pressure and corner-fill expansion (CFE). The effect of bending boost on CFE was also measured. For a given hydroforming EF case, a tube bent with greater boost achieved a higher burst pressure and consequently a greater CFE which increased the hydroformability of the material. Pre-bending was shown to consume a considerable amount of the formability of the tube in the hydroforming experiments. For the same EF case, the pre-bent tubes could only achieve a fraction of the straight tube CFE at burst. The pre-bending and hydroforming experiments were complimented by finite element simulation in the hope of providing additional insight into these processes. The finite element (FE) models were able to accurately predict the strain and thickness changes imposed during pre-bending. The models were able to accurately predict the CFE, EF displacement, and strain and thickness distributions after hydroforming. The extended stress-based forming limit curve (XSFLC) failure criterion was applied to predict failure (onset of necking) during hydroforming, which was measured as the burst pressure in the experiments. For straight tube hydroforming, the XSFLC predicted the correct failure pressure versus hydroforming EF load trend, but over predicted the failure pressures. In pre-bend hydroforming, the models were able to capture the effect of bending boost and hydroforming EF on the hydroformability of the tubes. The XSFLC was able to capture the drop in formability for bending versus straight tube hydroforming, but was unable to capture the failure pressure versus hydroforming EF load trend or magnitude. Further work is required to make the XSFLC applicable to straight and pre-bend hydroforming...|$|R

Through the use of two case studies with components similar to ones used in gas turbine engines, this paper presents {{different ways in which}} hydroforming technology could be exploited to reduce both the part count and operations required to manufacture certain aerospace structures by using methods which have already shown to be effective in other industries. It is shown that cost, manufacturing operations and manufacturing complexity can be reduced while maintaining the function of a component by switching the manufacturing process from a conventional method to one that includes <b>hydroforming.</b> These <b>parts</b> illustrate a method for assessing hydroforming manufacturability from reported theory and heuristics in the available literature. The results provide an example which engineers can use as a case study for how to start assessing how easily a given component can be adapted to the hydroforming process and how the benefits can be assessed. The reason for these results is that hydroforming offers a greater level of material formability compared to other forming processes and as individual components become geometrically more complicated the overall part count can be reduced as it takes fewer components to make an assembly, which in turn reduces weight as fewer nuts, bolts, seals and welding flanges are needed. The automotive industry has already demonstrated that this approach can deliver tangible benefits and hydroformed components are already used in larger airframe structures, but the hope is that the same approach can facilitate similar weight and cost savings in gas turbine engine components...|$|R

A generalized forming severity indicator that combines both the conventional forming limit diagram (FLD) and the forming limit stress diagram (FLSD) was adopted to detect excessive thinning, necking/splitting and wrinkling in the numerical simulation of formed parts. In order to rapidly explore and capture the Pareto frontier for multiple objectives, two optimization strategies were developed: normal boundary intersection (NBI) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based {{on the concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 dominated solutions 2 ̆ 2. The NBI method produced a uniformly distributed set of solutions. For the MOGA method, a stochastic Kriging model was used as a surrogate model. Furthermore, the MOGA constraint-handling technique was improved, Kriging model updating was automated and a hybrid global-local search was implemented in order to rapidly explore the Pareto frontier. Both piece-wise linear and pulsating pressure paths were investigated for several case studies, including straight tube, pre-bent tube and industrial tube hydroforming. For straight tube hydroforming, the optimal load path was obtained using the NBI method and it showed a smaller corner radius compared to that predicted by the commercial program LS-OPT 4. 0.
