40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a Galerkin {{finite element model}} of magnetisation dynamics in granular thin films. The governing equations of motion are the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equations</b> with an effective magnetic field taking contributions from exchange interactions, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, applied magnetic field {{as well as the}} magnetostatic field given by Maxwells equations. The magnetostatic field is formulated as a scalar potential described by Poissons equation which is solved using a second order finite element method. The <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equations</b> are discretized in time using an implicit midpoint method which naturally conserves the magnitude of the magnetisation vector. An infinite thin film is approximated using periodic boundary conditions with material microstructure represented using the Voronoi tessellation. The effects of thermal fluctuations are modelled by the stochastic Langevin-Gilbert equations, again solved by a Galerkin finite element method. The implicit midpoint time-stepping scheme ensures that solutions converge in a manner which is consistent with the Stratonovich interpretation of the stochastic integral. The model is then used to investigate the influences of material microstructure on the reversal mechanism of nano-scale cobalt particles, as well as the role of damping in the reversal process and the temperature dependence of hysteresis.

A physical description of the reversal mechanism {{which leads to the}} two peaks as they result from the axial demagnetizing field is included. Principal conclusions based on the various solutions are as follows: (1) The two‐peak effect {{is a direct result of}} the axial demagnetizing field. (2) The damping constant, over the range studied, results in slower switching time as α increases; however, minimum switching as a function of α exists in this model. The higher values of α tend to damp out the two‐peak effect. (3) Increased intensity of the applied field decreases the appearance of the two peaks.

30|$|Our {{objective}} here is {{to provide}} a new model for estimating oil flow through wellhead chokes improving upon the <b>Gilbert’s</b> <b>equation</b> and derivatives of it. Based on this formula, the liquid flow rate is as a function of three parameters such as wellhead pressure, choke size, and gas–liquid ratio. Since almost all models available in the literature used these three variables to predict the flow rate, we decided to include a new parameter named basic sediment and water (BS&W) to develop a model with new parameters and better performance. Also, it is necessary to say that the temperature did not have any significant impact on the flow rate based on relevancy factor formula; not including it in the new model (Discussion section). Another novelty is that it uses a mean square error (MSE) function test as the single-objective function for the GA and Solver algorithms, and then applies the optimized formula to a testing data subset, that is evaluated in terms of a set of statistical accuracy and correlation measures. A dataset of 182 wellhead choke measurements from wells drilled in the Reshadat oil field, located offshore southwest of Iran, is used to evaluate models to predict liquid flow rates through wellhead chokes (see Appendices 1, 2 and 3 for details of the reservoir and individual data record values).|$|R

Under common constitutive assumptions, it has the form of a parabolic PDE: γ− 1 m˙ + μm×m˙ = m× (αΔm+ β(m· e) e + hs + he). Here m˙ and Δm denote, respectively, the time derivative and the Laplacian of m, and the symbol × denotes the cross product; γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a negative constant; α, β, μ are positive constants; e is a unimodular vector (the easy axis); he is the external magnetic field and hs is the stray field, the magnetic field generated by the body. 1 In ferromagnetic bodies, it is possible to observe magnetic domains, i. e., regions where the orientation is nearly constant, separated by narrow transitions layers, the domain walls. The application of an external magnetic field induces re-orientation and growth of some domains at the expense of others.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of spin-pumping, described by Tserkovnyak et al., is formally analyzed {{in the general}} case of a magnetic multilayer consisting {{of two or more}} metallic ferromagnetic (FM) films separated by normal metal (NM) layers. It is shown that the spin-pumping-induced dynamic coupling between FM layers modifies the linearized <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equations</b> in a way that replaces the scalar Gilbert damping constant with a nonlocal matrix of Cartesian damping tensors. The latter are shown to be methodically calculable from a matrix algebra solution of the Valet-Fert transport equations. As an example, explicit analytical results are obtained for a 5 -layer (spin-valve) of form NM/FM/NM'/FM/NM. Comparisons with earlier well known results of Tserkovnyak et al. for the related 3 -layer FM/NM/FM indicate that the latter inadvertently hid the tensor character of the damping, and instead singled out the diagonal element of the local damping tensor along the axis normal to the plane of the two magnetization vectors. For spin-valve devices of technological interest, the influence of the tensor components of the damping on thermal noise or spin-torque critical currents are strongly weighted by the relative magnitude of the elements of the nonlocal, anisotropic stiffness-field tensor-matrix, and for in-plane magnetized spin-valves are generally more sensitive to the in-plane element of the damping tensor.

The damping is shown to have a Gilbert form only in the adiabatic limit while the relaxation time becomes strongly dependent on the geometry of the thin film. It is also shown that the induced noise characteristic of sd-exchange is inherently colored in character and depends on the symmetry of the Hamiltonian of the magnetization in the film.
