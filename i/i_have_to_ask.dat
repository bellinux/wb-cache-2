25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{president}} of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film {{would be released}} in 2011 or 2012. Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?" [...] Nolan said that he never even thought a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan only agreed to a third film {{on the basis of}} finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors. Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for forgiveness." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{wanted the}} story for {{the third and final}} {{installment}} to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?" [...] He returned out of finding a necessary way to continue the story, but feared midway through filming he would find a sequel redundant. The Dark Knight Rises is intended to complete Nolan's Batman trilogy. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. In February 2010, work on the screenplay was commencing with David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan. When Goyer left to work on the Superman reboot, Jonathan was writing the script based on the story by his brother and Goyer. Tom Hardy was cast as Bane and Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was cast as John Blake, and Marion Cotillard was cast as Miranda Tate. Filming began in May 2011 and concluded in November. Nolan chose not to film in 3-D but, by focusing on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format, hoped to push technological boundaries while nevertheless making the style of the film consistent with the previous two. Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. The Dark Knight Rises featured more scenes shot in IMAX than The Dark Knight. Cinematographer Wally Pfister expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX. During the film, set eight years after Dark Knight, the arrival of new foe Bane forces Bruce to return to his old role as Batman, only to find himself overpowered and captured by Bane as Gotham is cut {{off from the rest of}} the world with a stolen Wayne Enterprises fusion generator prototype set to go off in a few months. With the aid of thief Selina Kyle, Bruce is able to return to Gotham and defeat Bane while redeeming his image as Batman. The film concludes with Bruce having 'retired' as Batman after faking his death to live with Selina Kyle, evidence suggesting that he has passed on the Batcave to new ally Detective John Blake (real first name Robin) while Gotham rebuilds in memory of the Dark Knight's heroism.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all I {{would like to say}} is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E
