5000|$|Where an {{aircraft}} {{passes through a}} cloud, it can disperse the cloud in its path. This {{is known as a}} <b>distrail</b> (short for [...] "dissipation trail"). The plane's warm engine exhaust causes existing water droplets to evaporate, leaving a clear wake through an otherwise cloudy sky.|$|E
5000|$|Clouds {{form when}} {{invisible}} water vapor ( [...] in gas phase) condenses into microscopic water droplets ( [...] in liquid phase) or into microscopic ice crystals ( [...] in solid phase). This may happen when {{air with a}} high proportion of gaseous water cools. A <b>distrail</b> forms when the heat of engine exhaust evaporates the liquid water droplets in a cloud, turning them back into invisible, gaseous water vapor.|$|E
40|$|The {{lifecycle}} {{of individual}} (initially line-shaped) contrails behind aircraft and of contrail cirrus (aged contrails mixed with other ice clouds) is described. The full contrail lifecycle is covered, from ice formation for given water, heat and particulate emissions, {{changes in the}} jet, wake and dispersion phases, until final sublimation or sedimentation. Contrail properties are deduced from various in-situ, remote sensing and model studies. Aerodynamically induced contrails and <b>distrails</b> are explained briefly. Contrails form both in clear air and inside cirrus. Young contrails consume most of the ambient ice supersaturation. Optical properties of contrails are age and humidity dependent. Contrail occurrence and radiative forcing depends on the ambient Earth-atmosphere conditions. Contrail cirrus seems to be optically thicker than assessed previously and may not only increase cirrus coverage but also thicken existing cirrus. Some observational constraints for contrail cirrus occurrence and radiative forcing are derived. Key parameters controlling contrail properties, besides aircraft and fuel properties, ambient pressure, temperature and humidity, are the number of ice particles per flight distance surviving the wake vortex phase, the contrail depth, and particle sedimentation, wind shear, turbulence and vertical motions controlling contrail dispersion. The climate impact of contrails depends among others on the ratio of shortwave to longwave radiative forcing (RF) and on the efficacy with which contrail RF contributes to surface warming. Several open issues are identified, including re-nucleation from residuals of sublimated contrail ice particles...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} distrails (aircraft {{dissipation}} trails) with associated fall streak clouds {{were analyzed using}} multispectral geostationary satellite data. One <b>distrail</b> was observed on 23 July 2000 in a single cloud layer over southeastern Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay. Another set of trails developed on 6 January 2000 {{at the top of}} multilayer clouds off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. The distrails on both days formed in optically thin, midlevel stratified clouds with cloud-top heights between 7. 6 and 9. 1 km. The <b>distrail</b> features remained intact and easily visible from satellite images for 1 - 2 h in spite of winds near 50 km at cloud level. The width of the distrails spread as far as 20 km within 90 min or less. Differences between the optical properties of the clouds surrounding the trails and those of the fall streak particles inside the distrails allowed for easy identification of the fall streak clouds in either the 3. 9 -micrometer brightness temperature imagery, or the 10. 7 -micrometer - 12. 0 -micrometer brightness temperature difference. Although the three-channel infrared retrieval was better at retrieving cloud properties in the multilayer cloud case, two independent remote sensing retrievals of both <b>distrail</b> cases showed that the fall streaks had larger particle sizes than the clouds outside of the trails...|$|E
40|$|The heat of {{combustion}} of {{an aircraft}} or spacecraft's fuel can under certain conditions evaporate existing clouds (if not too dense) and yield a <b>distrail</b> or dissipation trail. Narrow dis-trails, the opposite of contrails, are often viewed (3) by ground based observers. Contrails, exhaust trails, ship trails, etc. have been seen on weather satellite imagery most vividly in clear skies (4, 5, 6). Distrails, on the other hand, have probably been seen on space-craft imagery which have not been publ ished. Imagery of the fallstreaks phenomena (3),,ice particles falling from a cloud. are also scarce...|$|E
40|$|Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant {{exploded}} and burned, spewing ionized radioactive debris {{into the}} atmosphere along with steam and hot air. On 2 May 1986, at approximately 1200 GMT, a DMSP visual (. 4 - 1. 1 microns) photo (Fig. I) with resolution of near 0. 3 nm was taken of the Soviet Union. Downstream from Chernobyl was a clearing swath thru the cumulus cloud lines (Brandli, 2) aligned to the gradient level flow. This melting of the clouds {{is similar to a}} <b>distrail</b> (Corfidi & Brandli, 3). Fig. 2 shows the surface weather map {{about the same time as}} the DMSP photo. The DMSP photo is a one-of-a-kind which shows weather and environmental implications of the worst nuclear disaster of all time...|$|E
