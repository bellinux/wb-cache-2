[...] The developers voted on the concept, and it passed. The game's instruction manual refers to Samus as if she were male to obscure her real sex {{until the end of the}} game. Sakamoto noted that during the course of the Metroid series, developers constantly try to express Samus' femininity without sexually objectifying her. Samus' image was based on actress Sigourney Weaver in her role as Ellen Ripley from Aliens, and actress Kim Basinger from 9½ Weeks and My Stepmother Is an Alien. Sakamoto and Kiyotake said that the character's last name [...] "Aran" [...] was taken from Edson Arantes do Nascimento, the birth name of the famous soccer player Pelé.|$|E

500|$|A {{key element}} of Simpson's {{promotion}} was The Ashlee Simpson Show, which debuted on June 16, 2004, and ran for eight episodes, achieving high ratings for cable television. Jessica's reality show, , had debuted in 2003 and had proved highly successful, being credited with reviving her flagging music career; reality television proved similarly effective in helping launch Simpson's music career. It {{has been said that}} Simpson's father and manager Joe Simpson [...] "redefined how you sell records" [...] through his use of reality television to promote his daughters. Simpson said that she initially did not want to do the reality show but that her father persuaded her to do it because it would be about the production of her album: [...] "...I thought that was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cool.</b> You're actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made."

500|$|Metroid was {{designed}} to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of Super Mario Bros. with the non-linear exploration of The Legend of Zelda and a distinctly darker aesthetic. The name of the game is a portmanteau of the words [...] "metro" [...] (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist. Halfway through development of the original Metroid, one of the staff said to his fellow developers [...] "Hey, wouldn't that be <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the idea was accepted. Ridley Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a [...] "huge influence" [...] after the world of the first Metroid had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe. In recognition of this, a character was given the name Ridley, after director Scott.|$|E

Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci described Nimoy's character as [...] "a mix of Howard Hughes and Bill Gates", while Nimoy referred to Bell as a [...] "master of the universe" [...] who is [...] "brilliant, wealthy and very powerful". Nimoy's part of the final scene of the episode with Olivia was very brief. Nimoy described the scene as [...] "interesting, entertaining" [...] and [...] "that you'll {{want to see more}} of this relationship and what it's all about". Actress Anna Torv described the final scene as calm yet threatening, [...] "That's what's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> about working on Fringe, is everything seems kind of calm and lovely, but there's always something going on underneath". While shooting, Nimoy commented that the character [...] "was a unique experience," [...] as he had not acted outside of the Spock character for a number of years.

At the time of Cohan's casting, however, she had been given little exposure to the character script-wise, and was unaware she would play a [...] "nasty person". It was not until The CW up-fronts that Kripke gave her a [...] "good spiel" [...] about Bela [...] because she would be interviewed. The actress later turned down an offer from him to provide more of the character's backstory, and instead opted to learn it as the episodes were filmed. In order to prepare for her role, Cohan received training in weaponry to be [...] "well equipped with swords {{and a lot of}} instrumentssharp instruments", and in kickboxing alongside Ruby's actress Katie Cassidy. Cohan and Cassidy also decided to catch up on Supernatural before filming for the third season began, by watching the first two seasons together.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} were simple and {{limited by the}} budget. The {{on-screen}} blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds [...] "Grandpa". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood {{to come out of}} its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was [...] "virtually solid" [...] by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface decapitates Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within [...] of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury.

About ten o'clock,--when man is asleep, and day fairly forgotten,--the beauty of moonlight is seen over lonely pastures where cattle are silently feeding. On all sides novelties present themselves.

But above all, the wonderful trump of the bull-frog, ringing from Maine to Georgia. The potato-vines stand upright, the corn grows apace, the bushes loom, the grain-fields are boundless.

6000|$|All true comradeship has in it {{those three}} {{elements}} which I have remarked {{in the ordinary}} exclamation about the weather. First, it has a sort of broad philosophy like the common sky, emphasizing {{that we are all}} under the same cosmic conditions. We are all in the same boat, the [...] "winged rock" [...] of Mr. Herbert Trench. Secondly, it recognizes this bond as the essential one; for comradeship is simply humanity seen in that one aspect in which men are really equal. The old writers were entirely wise when they talked of the equality of men; but they were also very wise in not mentioning women. Women are always authoritarian; they are always above or below; that is why marriage is a sort of poetical see-saw. There are only three things in the world that women do not understand; and they are Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. But men (a class little understood in the modern world) find these things the breath of their nostrils; and our most learned ladies will not even begin to understand them until they make allowance for this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> camaraderie. Lastly, it contains the third quality of the weather, the insistence upon the body and its indispensable satisfaction. No one has even begun to understand comradeship who does not accept with it a certain hearty eagerness in eating, drinking, or smoking, an uproarious materialism which to many women appears only hoggish. You may call the thing an orgy or a sacrament; it is certainly an essential. It is at root a resistance to the superciliousness of the individual. Nay, its very swaggering and howling are humble. In the heart of its rowdiness there is a sort of mad modesty; a desire to melt the separate soul into the mass of unpretentious masculinity. It is a clamorous confession of the weakness of all flesh. No man must be superior to the things that are common to men. This sort of equality must be bodily and gross and comic. Not only are we all in the same boat, but we are all seasick.|$|E
6000|$|Looking at that {{polished}} row of boots, Cecilia felt {{lonely and}} unsatisfied. Stephen {{worked in the}} Law Courts, Thyme worked at Art; both were doing something definite. She alone, it seemed, had to wait at home, and order dinner, answer letters, shop, pay calls, and do a dozen things that failed to stop her thoughts from dwelling on that woman's tale. She was not often conscious {{of the nature of}} her life, so like the lives of many hundred women in this London, which she said she could not stand, but which she stood very well. As a rule, with practical good sense, she kept her doubting eyes fixed friendlily on every little phase in turn, enjoying well enough fitting the Chinese puzzle of her scattered thoughts, setting out on each small adventure with a certain cautious zest, and taking Stephen with her as far as he allowed. This last year or so, now that Thyme was a grown girl, she had felt at once a loss of purpose and a gain of liberty. She hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry. It freed her for the tasting of more things, more people, and more Stephen; but it left a little void in her heart, a little soreness round it. What would Thyme think if she heard this story about her uncle? The thought started a whole train of doubts that had of late beset her. Was her little daughter going to turn out like herself? If not, why not? Stephen joked about his daughter's skirts, her hockey, her friendship with young men. He joked about the way Thyme refused to let him joke about her art or about her interest in [...] "the people." [...] His joking was a source of irritation to Cecilia. For, by woman's instinct rather than by any reasoning process, she was conscious of a disconcerting change. Amongst the people she knew, young men were not now attracted by girls as they had been in her young days. There was a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> and friendly matter-of-factness in the way they treated them, a sort of almost scientific playfulness. And Cecilia felt uneasy as to how far this was to go. She seemed left behind. If young people were really becoming serious, if youths no longer cared about the colour of Thyme's eyes, or dress, or hair, what would there be left to care for--that is, up to the point of definite relationship? Not that she wanted her daughter to be married. It would be time enough to think of that when she was twenty-five. But her own experiences had been so different. She had spent so many youthful hours in wondering about men, had seen so many men cast furtive looks at her; and now there did not seem in men or girls anything left worth the other's while to wonder or look furtive about. She was not of a philosophic turn of mind, and had attached no deep meaning to Stephen's jest--"If young people will reveal their ankles, they'll soon have no ankles to reveal." ...|$|E
