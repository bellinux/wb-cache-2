5000|$|The {{bird fauna}} {{of the lake}} and its {{vicinity}} makes over 200 species, out of which 95 species are breeding. The lake is an important breeding ground for the Armenian gull (Larus armenicus) with about 4,000-5,000 pairs. During migration the Lake is visited by wide variety of birds including raptors, such as Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and Steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis), waterbirds such as red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) and ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), while during the wintering period the lake hosts another set of species such as Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus) and <b>great</b> <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus ichthyaetus). Sometimes the lake is visited by very rare Armenian migrant lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus).|$|E

50|$|The {{bird species}} in Mongolia include several {{that are very}} large; six species of cranes present account for half the numbers in the world. There are 22 {{endangered}} species of birds including hawks, falcons, buzzards, cranes and owls. Though cranes are not hunted for superstitious reasons, they are still threatened due to habitat degradation and only 5000 breeding pairs are reported, mostly in Dornod’s Mongol Duguur Strictly Protected Area. In eastern Mongolia, a critically endangered species of crane is the white naped crane (Tsen togoru). Overall there are 469 species of birds, including species which are also domesticated and linked to the wild ancestral species. Of these, 330 species are migratory and 119 are seen in Mongolia throughout the year. Species identified include: golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), lammergeyer (Gypaetus barbatus), spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), great white egrets (Egretta alba), whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), <b>great</b> <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus ichthyatus), black storks (Ciconia nigra), swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and snowcock (Tetraogallus altaicus) or Altain ular.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus (H 5 N 1) (QH 09) was isolated from dead wild birds (3 species) in Qinghai, China, during May–June 2009. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses showed that QH 09 was clearly distinguishable from classical clade 2. 2 viruses and belonged to clade 2. 3. 2. In May 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H 5 N 1) caused a disease outbreak in wild {{birds in the}} Qinghai Lake region of the People’s Republic of China (1). Subsequently, this virus (QH 05, clade 2. 2) disseminated from Asia to Europe and Africa, {{which has led to}} great concern and energetic debates about the role of migratory birds in influenza epidemics (1 – 5). In 2006, this virus was detected in migratory birds in Qinghai (6, 7). In 2007, viruses similar to QH 05 were isolated from surveyed anseriformes in Qinghai and showed only a short evolutionary distance from earlier viruses (8). Genetic diversity of avian influenza viruses (H 5 N 1) was not detected in wild birds in Qinghai before 2008 (7, 8). We report evidence that a second lineage of viruses, in addition to clade 2. 2, has emerged in wild birds in Qinghai. The Study During May 8 –June 15, 2009, a total of 273 wild birds died in the wetlands of Gengahai Lake, Qinghai Province, China (Figure 1) during an influenza outbreak. We obtained 224 great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), 16 <b>great</b> <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus ichthyaetus), 15 brownheaded gulls (Larus brunnicephalus), 9 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), 5 ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), 3 great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), and 1 commo...|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{and near}} the delta of the Ural River are especially important to migrating birds as an important stop-over along the Asian flyway. They host many endemic and endangered species, such as great white pelican, Dalmatian pelican, pygmy cormorant, cattle egret, little egret, greater flamingo, white-headed duck, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, glossy ibis, houbara bustard, <b>great</b> <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull,</b> slender-billed gull, squacco heron, common crane, demoiselle crane, slender-billed curlew, black stork, red-breasted goose, lesser white-fronted goose, lesser kestrel, whooper swan, tundra swan, osprey, pallid harrier, short-toed eagle and many others. The pygmy cormorant was observed sporadically before 1999 and more regularly after that. Cattle egret is observed since 1990 between April and September (as most other migratory birds in this area), with {{the total population of}} several dozen couples. It feeds on frogs, mollusks and small fish. Upstream, there are more of the stationary bird species, such as grouse, wild pigeon and partridge.|$|E
40|$|Data on number {{increase}} of the Cormorant and change of its status in Donetsk region at the Sea of Azov coast are presented for the last 6 years.

40|$|The {{movements}} of four species of breeding waterbirds were studied using color marking, radio-tracking, and satellite-tracking at Qinghai Lake between April and September, 2006. Forty five bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) were captured with foot traps, including six individuals tagged with radio transmitters in April and another six birds with satellite transmitters in July. A total of 104 brown-headed gulls (Larus brunnicephalus) were captured with hand nets, and six {{of these were}} radio-tagged in April. Fifty one great black-headed gulls (L. ichthyaetus) were captured with foot traps, including two birds that were radio-tagged in April. Seventy five great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) were captured using the spotlight method, including six birds radio-tagged in May and June, and four individuals tagged with satellite transmitters in August. Data showed three distinct movement routes for the bar-headed goose, one for the brown-headed gull, four for the <b>great</b> <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull,</b> and two for the great cormorant. Furthermore, one of these routes was shared by all four waterbird species—from Luci Island and Egg Island to Quanwan along the shore near the Buhahekou and Tiebuqiahekou. These areas are also important as foraging and resting sites for many other waterbird species during migration periods...|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull</b> (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) {{is a small}} gull that breeds in much of Europe and Asia, {{and also}} in coastal eastern Canada.

40|$|Between 1982 and 1984, 893 Black-headed and 117 Common Gulls {{were trapped}} outside the {{breeding}} season in northeast England, and individually marked with wingtags or colour-rings.

Proportionately fewer second-year and first-year birds returned than adults. These percentages are considerably lower than the estimated annual survival rate for <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls,</b> showing {{that some of the}} birds probably spent subsequent winters outside the study area. Some of the birds which did not return to the study area were recovered or seen elsewhere, mainly in eastern parts of Britain: few moved to the west coast. Foreign <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> which overwintered in the British Isles were most numerous compared to British birds in the south and east of the British Isles. A small proportion of Continental <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> remained in Britain during the breeding season: the consequences of these birds joining the British breeding population are discussed. Overwintering <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> in the study area were observed feeding inland on fields and refuse tips, and at the coast.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al Joint Meeting of 30 th Meeting of the European Society of Veterinary Pathology-Annual Meeting of the European College of Veterinary Pathology and 24 th Annual Meeting of the Spanish Society of Veterinary Pathology, celebrado en León (España) del 5 al 8 de septiembre de 2012. [...] et al. [Introduction]: <b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) are a {{suitable}} model {{to unravel the}} epidemiology of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection in wild waterbirds because they are a common colony-breeding species in which LPAIV infection is limited mainly to the H 13 and H 16 subtypes. However, the sites of virus replication and associated lesions are poorly understood. [Material and methods]: We performed virological and pathological analyses on tissues of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> naturally infected with LPAIV. [Results]: We found that 24 of 111 <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> collected from breeding colonies were infected with LPAIV (10 X H 16 N 3, 1 X H 13 N 8, 13 X undetermined), based on virus and viral genome detection in pharyngeal and cloacal swabs. Of these 24 gulls, 15 expressed virus antigen in their tissues. Virus antigen expression was limited to epithelial cells of intestine and cloacal bursa. No histological lesions were detected in association with virus antigen expression. [Discussion & Conclusion]: Our findings show that LPAIV in <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> is mainly a superficial intestinal tract infection in absence of detectable lesions. These findings imply that LPAIV in <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> has adapted to fecal-oral transmission with minimal pathogenicity to its host. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} data in {{the first}} half of 1990 (May, 1989 - April, 1993) and mid- 2000 (May, 2002 - April, 2006) to understand long-term status of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus ridibundus) in the estuary of the Nakdong River under rapid changes. During the period (May, 1989 - April, 1993 and May, 2002 - April, 2003 for a total of 8 years), a total of 201, 519 individuals of Laridae were discovered at the estuary and the number of the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus ridibundus) was 32, 538 (16. 15 %). Monthly average of the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> showed that there were just a small number of individuals arrived in July and August, but the number increased from September, reached the highest in April for the first term (1989 - 1993). The second term showed that some individuals were discovered in summer (June - August), then the number increased from October and reached the peak in April. Monthly average in the latter period marked 5. 7 times higher than that of the former. In the aspect of individuals, there is a significant difference between the two period (P< 0. 05) and it is discovered that the number of individuals in 2000 s (Mean= 6923. 50) was higher than that of 1990 s (Mean= 1211. 00). Comparing individuals of gulls, herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> for 8 years, it was found out that the herring gulls (Larus argentatus) showed the largest number (average= 5313. 13), followed by the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (average= 4067. 25) and gulls (average= 1207. 63). The fluctuation on individuals of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> in the mid- 2000 s (May, 2005 - April, 2006) recorded the average number of 472. 75, then 113. 50 in DMD, 244. 00 in JJ and SJD, 635. 25 in SJ and DY, 727. 50 in LUD and 643. 50 in USD, showing significant differences among regions (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1970 's, declines were {{noticed in the}} {{breeding}} populations of <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> and various tern species on the Ravenglass Local Nature Reserve, Cumbria. By 1983, terns were extinct as breeding species and <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> numbers had fallen from 10, 000 breeding pairs in 1976 to only 2, 290. The annual cycle of <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> was examined {{and a number of}} hypotheses constructed as to possible causes of the declines. These hypotheses were tested using historical information and field data collected at Ravenglass {{and a number of other}} Cumbrian <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> colonies. Historical data from Ravenglass suggest that <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> breeding success was poor in a number of years. The reasons for this poor breeding success are not known but disturbance, predation and food shortage caused by agricultural change, vegetation change or weather factors appear to have been important. In 1984 the 1, 514 pairs of gulls that settled at Ravenglass produced no young, probably as a result of predation by foxes on eggs and small chicks. No gulls settled to breed at Ravenglass in 1985 and none have done so since. Studies at other Cumbrian colonies since 1985 revealed different causes of reduced breeding success at different sites in different years. This may have been important in reducing the number of potential recruits to Ravenglass from other colonies. Other ground-nesting birds breeding at Ravenglass (except She 1 duck which breed in rabbit burrows) suffered fox predation in 1984 - 87. Gulls from both inland and coastal gulleries fed predominantly inland. Levels of heavy metal and radionuclide contaminants in gulls are below those recorded to be harmful. It is concluded that the decline was probably caused by a combination of a number of factors (see above). A number of changes in the colonial behaviour of <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> at Ravenglass were noted in the later stages of the decline suggesting ways In which the gulls responded to the reduction in colony size...|$|R

40|$|During {{a period}} of 3 years, 1998 – 2000, 1047 faecal swabs from <b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> were sampled at one {{location}} in Southern Sweden. Salmonella spp. was found in 28 individuals (2 · 7 %) and the dominating serotype found was S. Typhimurium (83 %). Twenty-five per cent of the Salmonella-infected gulls were later recaptured and re-sampled. We found that Salmonella infection in <b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> was of short duration, and that infection in this bird species was predominantly expressed as carriage without disease manifestations. All S. Typhimurium isolates were subjected to antibiotic resistance profiling and molecular characterization by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and IS 200 polymerase chain reaction. The S.

40|$|We {{monitored}} {{population size}} from 1996 to 2003 and studied behavioural interactions (in 2001) between the native <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> Chroicocephalus ridibundus and an expansive, opportunistic predator, the Caspian Gull Larus cachinnans, at water reservoirs in Poland. The expansive species caused a population {{decline in the}} native species and affected its choice of nest sites. The <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> perceived the risk of predation {{on the part of}} the larger Caspian Gulls. When both species occurred in close proximity, the native gull breeding pairs built nests where the vegetation was higher and its cover greater than at the sites chosen by pairs breeding far away from the expansive species. The native gulls in proximity to the expansive species spent more time guarding their nests. However, this was not compensatory, as egg losses were higher and breeding success much lower in pairs breeding near the Caspian Gulls than in those breeding far from the latter. Such a low breeding performance in the <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls</b> was probably caused either by predation on the part of Caspian Gulls or by aggressive interactions among <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls.</b> In fact, the rate of intraspecific aggression in native gulls was higher in pairs breeding in proximity to the expansive species than in those breeding far away from it. These intraspecific fights, caused by the presence of the expansive species were, at least partially, responsible for egg and chick losses. We did not find the presence of native gulls to have any effect on the behaviour and breeding performance of the expansive gull. These results indicate that the expansive predatory Caspian Gull negatively affects local population size and alters the behaviour of the native <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gull,</b> and may, both directly and indirectly, affect its reproductive performance...|$|R
