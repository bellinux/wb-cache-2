500|$|Well {{known for}} his wit and sense of humor, one of Marshall's most {{enduring}} jokes came during a Senate debate in which, in response to Senator Joseph Bristow's catalog of the nation's needs, Marshall quipped the often-repeated phrase, [...] "What this country needs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> five-cent cigar", provoking laughter. After his terms as vice president, he opened an Indianapolis law practice, where he authored several legal books and his memoir, Recollections. He continued to travel and speak publicly. Marshall died while on a trip after suffering {{a heart attack in}} 1925.|$|E
500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow in which the senator provided {{a long list of}} what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, [...] "What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that" [...] and quipped loudly enough others to overhear, [...] "What this country needs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> five-cent cigar." [...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of you in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E
500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told me I should listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rose held such rancor for Fafara {{because of}} the way he {{allegedly}} treated Foss-Rose when Coal Chamber were together.

500|$|Frazier {{made his}} sophomore debut on November 7, 2010, in an {{exhibition}} game against East Stroudsburg. He added 10 points, 6 assists, and two steals. Frazier also recorded a team-high 4 turnovers. DeChellis commented, [...] "Offensively we were poor tonight and we had too many turnovers... something we've struggled with in practice." [...] On November 12, 2010, Frazier made his second appearance as a sophomore with 6 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal. He shot 1-of-5 on field goals, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Frazier was named the game's starting shooting guard and was allowed 30 minutes of playing time. He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very nice job defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> player. He bothered him all night." [...] Frazier made his first impression above the 10-points barrier on January 15, 2011 vs. Ohio State, with 11 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists. He shot 4-of-4 {{from the field and}} made three of four free throws. On March 12, 2011, Frazier scored 22 points against Michigan State, his season-high as a sophomore, helping the team pull off the upset victory in the semifinals of the 2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. He played in his first NCAA Tournament game against Temple, contributing 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals. He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. For some reason he jumped over to my right and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E

I did not wait to be asked twice, as you may guess. His cutter has a very neat little cabin, quite big enough for two men not only to sleep but to sit and smoke in. We left the scuttle wide open, of course. As to his provisions for supper, they were not of a luxurious kind. He complained that the shops in the village were miserable. There was a big village within a mile and a half. It struck me he had been very long doing his shopping; but naturally I made no remark.

6000|$|I do not {{ask whether}} you pay your {{subscriptions}} regularly or not-- that is quite right and necessary, {{but there is something}} more than that wanted to make a club go on rightly. Mere paying and receiving money will never keep men together any more than any other outward business. A man may pay his club-money regularly and yet not be a really good member. And how is this? You remember that I tried to shew you that a family, and a nation, and a church, all were kept together by the same principle of bearing one another's burdens, just as a benefit club is. Now, what makes a man a good member of Christ's Church,--a good Christian, in short? A man may pay his tithes to the rector, and his church-rates to repair God's house, and his poor-rates to maintain God's poor, all very regularly, and yet be a very bad member of Christ's Church. These payments are all right and good; but they are but the outside, the letter of what God requires of him. What is wanted is, to serve God in the SPIRIT, to have the spirit--THE WILL, of a Christian in him; that is, to do all these things for GOD'S sake--not of constraint, but willingly--"not grudgingly, for God loveth a cheerful giver." [...] No! If a man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> member of Christ's Church, he lives a life of faith in Jesus Christ, and of thankfulness to Him for His infinite love and mercy in coming down to die for us, and thus the love of God and man is shed abroad in his heart by God's Spirit, which is given to him. Therefore, that man thinks it an honour to pay church-rates, and so help towards keeping God's house in repair and neatness. He pays his tithes cheerfully, because he loves God's ministers, and feels their use and worth to him. He pays his poor-rates with a willing mind, for the sake of that God who has said, [...] "that he who gives to the poor lends to the Lord." [...] And so he obeys not only the letter but the spirit of the law.|$|E
