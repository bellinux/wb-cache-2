25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide <b>fire</b> <b>ignition</b> under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E

On the other hand, the number of wildfire ignitions is increasing in Portugal, Spain and Greece, but in Portugal its occurrence density is much higher. Since 2000 Portugal registered {{an average of about}} 28, 500 <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> every year, and this situation causes an important dispersion of detection and fire fighting resources, contributing to reduce their effectiveness. In order to evaluate the distribution of wildfire ignitions, we analyzed 127, 492 fires detected in Portugal during the period 2001 - 2005 in relation to variables such as population density, proximity to urban areas and road network, land cover types, altitude, causes and final burnt area. Results showed that most part of <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> are concentrated in the north and centre littoral areas, in the most populated municipalities, and were intentionally caused. Although municipalities with more than 100 persons per km 2 only represents 21 % of the territory, they concentrated more than 70 % of <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> occurring in Portugal, but only about 14 % of total burnt area. We verified that 85 % of <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> occurred at less than 500 m from urban areas and 98 % were within a distance of 2 km. <b>Fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> were also located very close to the main roads (70 % at less than 500 m, and 98 % at less than 2 km). Most ignitions were located in agricultural and social/urban areas (60 % and 25 %, respectively), and only 15 % in forested or uncultivated areas (8. 5 % and 6. 5 %, respectively). We verified that about 80 % of ignitions occurred at elevations below 500 meters, and that 85 % of <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> originated a burnt area lower than 1 ha, and only 0. 3 % of them originated large wildfires with 500 hectares or more. These results emphasise the crucial role of human distribution and activity in the spatial distribution of wildfire ignitions, and can be very useful in fire risk management and in prevention strategies implementation...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the area}} burned by single {{wildfires}} may range over many orders of magnitude, {{only a handful}} papers has explored the {{factors that contribute to}} drive <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> into large burns. While in southern Europe most <b>fire</b> <b>ignitions</b> are of human origin, fire propagation is mostly influenced by weather conditions, topography and fuel type. In this framework, the phenological status of vegetation represents the primary driver influencing fuel availability and moisture content. Therefore, any investigation on fire behavior requires the capability of capturing spatio-temporal changes in coarse-scale vegetation phenology that are descriptive of changes in fuel conditions. The aim of this study is thus to apply a habitat suitability modelling tool originally developed in wildlife science for reconstructing the phenological niche of the ignition points of wildfires from remotely-sensed multitemporal NDVI profiles in Sardinia (Italy) in the period of 2000 - 2008. Overall, our findings indicate that wildfires occur preferentially in remotely-sensed phenological conditions that considerably differ from the mean phenological conditions in Sardinia. When compared to the entire set of ignition points (irrespective of the resulting <b>fire</b> size), <b>ignitions</b> resulting in burned areas larger than 20 ha are preferentially associated to a longer and later fire season showing also marked preference for higher fuel loads.
