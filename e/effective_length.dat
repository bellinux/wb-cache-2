40|$|Objective: To {{verify the}} {{relationship}} between maxillary and mandibular <b>effective</b> <b>lengths</b> and dental crowding in patients with Class II malocclusions. Materials and Methods: The sample comprised 80 orthodontic patients with complete Class II malocclusions in the permanent dentition (47 male, 33 female) who {{were divided into two}} groups according to the amount of mandibular tooth-arch size discrepancy. The maxillary and mandibular <b>effective</b> <b>lengths</b> (Co-A and Co-Gn) and tooth-arch size discrepancies were measured on the initial cephalograms and dental casts, respectively. Intergroup comparisons of apical base lengths were performed with independent t-tests. Correlation between base length and dental crowding was examined by means of Pearson's correlation coefficient (P <. 05). Results: Patients with Class II malocclusion and moderate to severe crowding had significantly smaller maxillary and mandibular <b>effective</b> <b>lengths</b> than subjects with the same malocclusion and slight mandibular crowding. A weak inverse correlation was also found between maxillary and mandibular <b>effective</b> <b>lengths</b> and the severity of dental crowding. Conclusion: Decreased maxillary and mandibular <b>effective</b> <b>lengths</b> constitute an important factor associated with dental crowding in patients with complete Class II malocclusion.

25|$|The {{dynamical}} Casimir {{effect is}} {{the production of}} particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made {{by researchers at the}} Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect.|$|E
25|$|A flute {{produces}} {{sound when}} {{a stream of}} air directed across {{a hole in the}} instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes {{in the body of the}} instrument, thus changing the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes.|$|E

25|$|Quite at the {{opposite}} end of the spectrum, in terms of the complexity of the key system developed by Boehm, was the Giorgi flute, an advanced form of the ancient holed flute. Patented in 1897, the Giorgi flute was designed without any mechanical keys, though the patent allows for the addition of keys as options. Giorgi enabled the performer to play equally true in all musical keys, as does the Boehm system. Giorgi flutes are now rarities, found in museums and private collections. The underlying principles of both flute patterns are virtually identical, with tone holes spaced as required to produce a fully chromatic scale. The player, by opening and closing holes, adjusts the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> of the tube, and thus the rate of oscillation, which defines the audible pitch.|$|E

40|$|This work aims to {{determine}} how the <b>effective</b> slip <b>length</b> for a wall-bounded flow may depend on, among other geometrical parameters, the phase shift between patterns on the two walls. An analytical model is developed for Stokes flow through a channel bounded by walls patterned with a regular array of rectangular ribs and grooves, where the patterns on the two walls can be misaligned by any phase shift. This study incorporates several previous studies as limiting or special cases. It is shown that the phase shift can have qualitatively different effects on the flow rate and <b>effective</b> slip <b>length,</b> depending on the flow direction. In a narrow channel, increasing the phase shift may mildly decrease the flow rate and <b>effective</b> slip <b>length</b> for flow parallel to the grooves, but can dramatically increase the flow rate and <b>effective</b> slip <b>length</b> for flow transverse to the grooves. It is found that unless the channel height is much larger than the period of the wall pattern, the effect due to wall confinement has {{to be taken into account}} on evaluating the <b>effective</b> slip <b>lengths...</b>|$|R

The loop antenna was equipped with a tuneable loading coil that changed the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio.

Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.|$|E
50|$|The {{resonant}} {{frequencies of}} the air column in a pipe are inversely proportional to the pipe's <b>effective</b> <b>length.</b> In other words, a shorter pipe produces higher notes. For a pipe with no tone holes but open at both ends, the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> is the physical length of the pipe plus a little more for the small volumes of air just beyond {{the ends of the}} pipe that are also involved in the resonance. An open hole anywhere along the middle of the pipe shortens the pipe's <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> and therefore raises the pitch of the notes it produces. The closer an open hole is to the blowing end, the shorter the remaining <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> is and the more it raises the pitch. Generally, a hole in a given position doesn't reduce the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> quite as much as cutting the pipe at that position would, and the smaller the hole, the less it reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> when open. Closing the hole increases the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> and lowers the pitch again. However, a pipe with a closed tone hole is not acoustically identical to a pipe with no hole; the shape of the fingertip or pad that closes the hole modifies the pipe's internal volume and <b>effective</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

We consider the <b>effective</b> slip <b>length</b> which is defined {{with respect to the}} level of the mean height of the surface roughness. With increasing corrugation amplitude the effective no-slip boundary plane is shifted towards the bulk of the fluid, which implies a negative <b>effective</b> slip <b>length.</b> The analysis of the wall shear stress indicates that a flow circulation is developed in the grooves of the rough surface provided that the local boundary condition is no-slip.

When the intrinsic slip length is larger than the corrugation amplitude, the flow streamlines near the surface are deformed to follow the boundary curvature, the vortex vanishes, and the <b>effective</b> slip <b>length</b> saturates to a constant value.
