40|$|Describing and categorizing {{organizational}} forms {{remains a}} central problem in organization theory. Unfortunately defining organizational form poses numerous difficulties. Rather than attempting to categorize entire organizations, researchers have instead suggested focusing on how particular tasks are performed, i. e., adopting {{the process as}} the unit of analysis. An important practical problem then is to identify processes that would be suitable for performing a desired task, especially processes that are enabled {{by the use of}} new electronic media and other forms of <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> <b>Coordination</b> theory provides an approach to the study of processes. In this view, the form a process takes depends on the coordination mechanisms chosen to manage dependences among tasks and resources involved in the process. These mechanisms are primarily information-processing and so the use of new media will particularly affect their cost, perhaps changing which are preferred. In this paper, I use coordination theory to analyze the software change process of a large mini-computer manufacturer and suggest alternative ways the dependences involved could be managed and thus alternative forms the process could take. Mechanisms analyzed include those for task assignment, resource sharing and managing dependences between modules of code. The organization studied assigned problem reports to engineers based on the module which appeared to be in error; engineers specialized in particular modules. The framework suggests alternative mechanisms including assignment to generalists based on workload or based on market-like bids. Modules of code were not shared, but rather "owned" by one engineer, thus reducing the need for coordination; a more elaborate code management system would be required if multiple engineers needed to work on the same modules. Finally, engineers managed dependences between modules informally, based on their personal knowledge of which other engineers used their code; alternatives include formally defining the interfaces between modules and tracking their users. Software bug fixing provides a microcosm of coordination problems and solutions. Similar coordination problems arise in most processes and are managed by a similar range of mechanisms. For example, diagnosing but reports and assigning them to engineers may have interesting parallels to diagnosing patients and assigning them to specialists. While the case presented does not formally test coordination theory, it does illustrate the potential of the coordination theory for exploring the space of organizational forms. Future work includes developing more rigorous techniques for such analyses, applying the techniques to a broader range of processes, identifying additional coordination problems and mechanisms and developing tools for collecting and comparing processes and perhaps automatically suggesting potential alternatives. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{incomplete}} contracts {{has been used}} to study the relationship between buyers and suppliers following the deployment of modern <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> to facilitate <b>coordination</b> between them. Previous research has sought to explain anecdotal evidence from some industries on the recent {{reduction in the number of}} suppliers selected to do busi-ness with buyers, by appealing to relationship-specific costs that suppliers may incur. In contrast, this paper emphasizes the fact that <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> enables greater completeness of buyer-supplier contracts through more economical monitoring of additional dimensions of supplier performance. The number of terms included in the contract is an imper-fect substitute for the number of suppliers. Based on this idea, alternative conditions are identified under which increased use of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers without invoking relationship-specific costs. We find that a substantial increase in contract completeness due to reduced cost of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> could increase the cost per supplier even though the cost of coordination and the cost per term monitored decrease. Such an increase in the cost per supplier leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers the buyer chooses to do business with. Similarly, we find that if coordination cost is reduced when more <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> is deployed so that the number of suppliers in the buyer’s pool increases substantially, the buyer might choose to make the supplier contracts less complete and instead rely on a more market-oriented approach to finding a supplier with good fit...|$|R

40|$|Supply {{chain is}} defined as a system of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, {{retailers}} and customers where material, financial and information flows connect participants in both directions. Most supply chains are composed of independent agents with individual preferences. It is expected that no single agent has the power to optimise the supply chain. Supply chain management is now seen as a governing element in strategy and as an effective way of creating value for customers. The so-called bullwhip effect, describing growing variation upstream in a supply chain, is probably the most famous demonstration that decentralised decision making can lead to poor supply chain performance. Information asymmetry {{is one of the most}} powerful sources of the bullwhip effect. Information sharing of customer demand has an impact on the bullwhip effect. <b>Information</b> <b>technology</b> has lead to centralised information, shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes. The analysis of causes of the bullwhip effect has lead to suggestions for reducing the bullwhip effect in supply chains by strategic partnership.

A questionnaire was sent to <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> managers and experienced professionals {{in the area of}} <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance, who work in public organizations. Based on the collected data, we used the structural equations technique to verify the impact of the following mechanisms on the effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance: top management support; performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> steering committee; use of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> strategic planning; performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> investment portfolio management.

40|$|Large {{portions}} of the US population live in poor inner-city communities. Health needs assessment data have shown that these communities have disproportionately high rates of chronic illnesses. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model was developed to address the gaps {{that exist in the}} primary care system, and emphasizes a redesign of primary care that is patient centered, utilizes multiple levels of healthcare professionals, <b>information</b> <b>technology,</b> and care <b>coordination.</b> However, little evidence exists on the value of this model which may explain why it has not gained wide acceptance by primary care providers. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} examine the efficacy of the PCMH model through emergency department and inpatient utilization reductions, and with a specific focus on the role of social connectedness. This research used existing data on 706 participants from Columbia University and a local New York inner-city hospital. An in-depth analysis of hospital utilization data, using an unpaired two-sample t-test and linear regression, found that the PCMH framework strengthens continuity of care and care coordination, and helps reduce avoidable hospitalization utilization. Additionally, these reductions were greater for study participants with strong social support networks. This research highlights the relationships between primary care, social support networks, and good health outcomes. Over time, further enhancement of the PCMH and systemic changes to the delivery of care may contribute to the development of a stronger primary care system that place patients at the center of care, focuses on the importance of social connectedness, and contributes to a lasting impact on society through the development of overall healthier communities...|$|R
