Compassionate and caring, she <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far as healing Butler from fatal wounds {{sustained}} fighting a troll, {{even though he has}} been integral in the plan to hold her hostage—this act is the first step to changing Artemis' attitude and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Everything <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> planned until Caesar {{finds the}} money gone. He realizes {{that if he}} runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides {{he has to get}} the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, {{thinking}} that maybe she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.|$|E

6000|$|... "To let Tommy Bogey <b>go</b> <b>as</b> supercargo. He's seaman {{enough to}} <b>go</b> <b>as</b> first mate, but he's {{too young for}} that yet. Also, I want to take Bluenose as a free passenger." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{ashamed to}} have to tell you, if you don't see; and I won't. But if you <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a detective, <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a detective; and if you <b>go</b> <b>as</b> their friend, to help them and serve them, then go that way. But don't you try to carry water on both shoulders. If you do, I won't stir a step with you; so there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{with your}} {{permission}} I will certainly do so, signor," [...] Francis said. [...] "Of course I should prefer to <b>go</b> <b>as</b> an officer on board {{one of the}} ships; but if not, I will <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a volunteer." ...|$|R

5|$|Slow lorises have {{relatively}} large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (mesial) maxillary incisors {{are larger than}} the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, {{and they have a}} diastema (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first mandibular premolar is elongated, and the last molar has three cusps on the crown, the shortest of which is near the back. The bony palate (roof of the mouth) only <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far back as the second molar.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E
5|$|The clip starts showing Gaby Moreno {{playing a}} melody in a guitar while staying {{close to a}} window, {{watching}} the people walk on the street below. Meanwhile, scenes of all the places featured on the video are interpolated. Just as the song begins, Arjona is shown leaving the Tikal ruins on an orange Jeep, as well as images of Moreno singing {{in front of a}} piano. Then, as Arjona abandons the Jeep and <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> a passenger on another vehicle, Moreno is shown singing inside a house, close to another Jeep similar to that of Arjona's. Finally, Arjona reaches the town on which Moreno has been waiting for him, just to find that she is gone to where he has been before, on the Tikal ruins. As of October 2017, the video has received over 520 million views on YouTube.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as that, Dick--I don't <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as that. But it is unwise and unsound, and we, {{who know}} both hemispheres, ought to set our faces against it. We have already some gallant fellows from that {{quarter of the}} world among us, and I hope to live to see more." ...|$|R

5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because it was too early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
5|$|Yang and Hunt {{distance}} themselves from {{each other as they}} keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and <b>goes,</b> <b>as</b> planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.|$|E

25|$|In his {{conclusion}} Westlund rejects Lindquist's {{view of the}} amulet as a solemn heathen prayer. In his opinion the mention of Thor and 'the gods' reflect a post-conversion magical view of the heathen gods. He even <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far as suggesting that the wearer of the amulet was probably a baptised Christian.|$|E
25|$|The very use of obscene Russian vocabulary, called mat, {{can enhance}} the humorous effect of a joke by its {{emotional}} impact. Due to the somewhat different cultural attitude to obscene slang, such an effect is difficult to render in English. The taboo status often makes mat itself {{the subject of a}} joke. One typical plot <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> follows.|$|E
25|$|While Fulgentius {{claims to}} explain the Aeneid as an allegory for {{the full range of}} human life, the work seems to end rather abruptly, and the telling only <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> far as manhood. There is no {{evidence}} to suggest, however, that any part of the original text was lost. His hurried finish was probably caused by a loss of interest in its completion.|$|E
