5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{deadwood}} {{techniques for}} branches {{are applied to}} conifers. Deciduous trees tend to shed dead branches and <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> the wound, while conifers often retain the dead limb, which naturally becomes weathered and eroded over time. Most deadwood techniques for the tree's trunk apply equally well to deciduous and to conifer bonsai, although the driftwood style (in which much of the trunk is dead) is generally restricted to conifers.|$|E
500|$|A {{disorder}} {{commonly found}} in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as [...] "dry eye". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness. This disorder can decrease or <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proximal}} tendons of the biceps brachii {{are commonly}} involved in pathological processes {{and are a}} frequent cause of anterior shoulder pain. Disorders of the distal biceps brachii tendon typically result from partial and complete tears of the muscle. [...] Partial tears are usually characterized by enlargement and abnormal contour of the tendon. Complete tears generate a soft-tissue mass in the anterior aspect of the arm, the so-called Popeye sign, which paradoxically leads to a decreased strength during flexion and supination of the forearm. Tears of the biceps brachii occur in athletic activities and corrective surgery repairs biceps brachii tendon tears. [...] Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically repaired by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis is resurfacing the tendon by screw fixation on the humerus and biceps tenotomy is trimming the long head of the biceps tendon promoting the muscle origination from the coracoid process. Preexisting degeneration in the tendon can cause partial tears called lesions and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. The most common symptom of a biceps tear is pain. It {{will be the most}} severe in the muscle, but may stretch to the shoulders and elbows as well. [...] Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury. [...] In most cases, the muscle will <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.|$|E

In that {{trunk of}} mine is a bottle of oils for the burns, {{though most of the}} sore places are already beginning to <b>heal</b> <b>over,</b> and the doctor said that I need not apply it any more, unless I found that they smarted too much for bearing. As for the other wounds, they are strapped up and bandaged, and he said that unless they inflamed badly, they would be best let alone for a time. So sit down quietly, and let me hear the news." ...|$|E

50|$|The edible {{dormouse}} {{is capable of}} limited autotomy; if another animal grasps the tail, the skin breaks easily and slides off the underlying bone, allowing the dormouse to escape. The exposed vertebrae then break off and the wound <b>heals</b> <b>over,</b> forming a fresh brush of hair.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree to}} which trees are able to repair gross {{physical}} damage to their bark is very variable. Some are able to produce a callus growth which <b>heals</b> <b>over</b> the wound rapidly, but leaves a clear scar, whilst others such as oaks do not produce an extensive callus repair.|$|R
50|$|In EverQuest II, Druids are {{a priest}} class divided into Wardens and Furies. They are neutral and {{can come from}} cities of either alignment.

50|$|The {{heart valve}} changes seen with {{moderate}} and intermittent use {{can result in}} permanent damage and life-threatening heart problems if use of the causative drug is increased or continued, however longitudinal studies of former patients suggest that the damage will <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> time to some extent at least.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{gene therapy}} is an {{attractive}} strategy for tendinopathies by providing candidate sequences that mediate neotendon formation and tendon <b>healing</b> <b>over</b> durable periods of time. Studies in adapted preclinical animal models demonstrated the feasibility of applying such gene-based protocols to treat such tendon injuries, providing reasonable hope for translation to the patients soon.|$|R

50|$|A free {{gingival graft}} is a dental {{procedure}} {{where a small}} layer of tissue {{is removed from the}} palate of the patient's mouth and then relocated to the site of gum recession.

50|$|The beetle lays a small egg {{on either}} the vine or the fruit. The larva burrows into the plant, {{allowing}} bacteria to enter and infecting the section of vine which then dies, or the fruit itself, which will usually rot. If detected in time, the larva can be removed from a pumpkin in time to save the fruit, by careful dissection and removal of the larva and its feces. The pumpkin will usually then <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> the wounds and survive.|$|E
50|$|Once in {{the lung}} or ectopic site, the worm stimulates an {{inflammatory}} response that {{allows it to}} cover itself in granulation tissue forming a capsule. These capsules can ulcerate and <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> time. The eggs in the surrounding tissue become pseudotubercles. If the worm becomes disseminated and gets into the spinal cord, it can cause paralysis; capsules in the heart can cause death. The symptoms are localized in the pulmonary system, which include a bad cough, bronchitis, and blood in sputum (hemoptysis).|$|E
50|$|A subdermal implant {{refers to}} a body {{modification}} that is placed underneath the skin, therefore allowing the body to <b>heal</b> <b>over</b> the implant and creating a raised design. Such implants fall under the broad category of body modification. Many subdermal implants are made out of silicone, either carved or mold injected. Many people who have subdermal implants use them {{in conjunction with other}} types of body modification to create a desired, dramatic effect. This process is also known as a 3-D implant, or pocketing.|$|E

50|$|Around 800 BCE Homer in The Iliad gives {{descriptions}} of wound treatment {{by the two}} sons of Asklepios, the admirable physicians Podaleirius and Machaon and one acting doctor, Patroclus. Because Machaon is wounded and Podaleirius is in combat Eurypylus asks Patroclus to cut out this arrow from my thigh, wash off the blood with warm water and spread soothing ointment on the wound.

This is one of the only instances where a mediocre baseball player was given a high position in the Yomiuri organization.
