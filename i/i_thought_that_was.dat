5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> pretty stupid right there.|$|E

500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides his {{increasing}} {{influence in}} Washington, {{by the late}} 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure. [...] After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he subsequently endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off. [...] He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. [...] As Koch related, [...] "He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? I {{want you to know}} he's nasty to everybody.' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> rather nice." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls my age, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} warmly {{by members of}} the Enterprise cast and crew. Anthony Montgomery said prior {{to the end of the}} first series that he [...] "absolutely loved 'Dear Doctor'; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fantastic". After the end of the series, John Billingsley named the episode as one of his favourites as it was the first time he felt the character was three-dimensional, and executive producer Brannon Braga subsequently called the episode a [...] "classic". Writer André Bormanis said that [...] "Dear Doctor" [...] was [...] "great example of a classic Star Trek / Science Fiction [...] "what if" [...] scenario that raised interesting and complex social issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E

500|$|Wee and Morse {{replicated}} [...] "people juggling" [...] for the semi-finals on August 2, 2006, {{winning over}} {{the audience and}} Hasselhoff ("I think I have just gotten out of 'I Hate Jugglers Anonymous'. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fantastic!"). One of ten acts to return for the finals two weeks later, The Passing Zone brought Hasselhoff to the stage and, as all three men wore torches atop construction helmets (and with Hasselhoff holding four spinning plates), Wee and Morse passed sickles back and forth around him. Though Morgan thought they had done well, the act finished in the bottom five when {{the results of the}} viewers' vote were announced on August 17, 2006.|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E

500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{hitchhike}} on weekends to New York City, {{dressed as a}} man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get [...] "plugged into the gay community." [...] In a 1975 interview, she recalled, [...] "I wore drag because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a way to show I was gay. It's changed now, {{but in the early}} 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!" [...] However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} been cited as an {{influence}} on director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered The Lord of the Rings via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a [...] "brave and ambitious attempt." [...] In another interview, Jackson stated that he [...] "enjoyed [...] {{and wanted to know}} more." [...] Bakshi is quoted as saying [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> kind of fucked up." [...] On the audio commentary for the DVD release of , Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting [...] "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.|$|E
500|$|Kesha re-recorded [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] for {{her debut}} studio album, Animal. The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{original}} first-person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game, which incorporated a more spy-oriented style of gameplay, with the player [...] "trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen." [...] Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision: [...] "It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story-oriented direction." [...] He stated {{that he did not}} feel comfortable developing Gravity Bone as a first-person shooter game, and kept adding [...] "bits and bits of more and more unconventional" [...] elements as a result. He explained that he [...] "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, but he just has a bunch of tools on his belt, like a power drill or a can of pressurized Freon, a screwdriver. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> kind of funny and interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Drizzt {{was created}} by happenstance. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then {{managing}} editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but {{asked if he could}} rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was [...] "set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the Realms. When I found out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} May, Island Def Jam {{pushed forward}} the release date for Graduation up from September to an {{unspecified}} late August date, a decision that West first announced on the introductory track of his Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape. On July 19, the album's release date was changed once more and moved to September 11, 2007, the same US release date as rapper 50 Cent's third studio album Curtis. When first presented with the proposal of his label moving the release date of his album yet again {{as well as the}} idea of a sales competition between him and 50 Cent, West initially expressed his indifference towards the thought, saying, [...] "When I heard that thing about the debate, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the stupidest thing. When my album drops and 50's album drops, everybody wins because you're gonna get a lot of good music at the same time." [...] However, then Def Jam president and CEO Jay Z welcomed competition, feeling that it would be prosperous for hip-hop and the date became permanent.|$|E
