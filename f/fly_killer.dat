50|$|Another {{projectile}} <b>fly</b> <b>killer</b> is the Bug-a-Salt, a miniaturized shotgun which {{shoots a}} spray of dry table salt using a spring-compressed air blast similar to a BB rifle. It has an accurate range of 3 ft, and the killed bugs remain whole for easy clean up. The pneumatic salt-shot approach is claimed to be effective because the high speed, small-sized salt grains are apparently undetected by the targeted fly until {{it is too late}} to dodge them.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} month they {{were replaced by}} the 1st Antisubmarine Squadron being deployed from Langley Field, Virginia with the 2d Antisubmarine Squadron arriving in January 1943 forming the 1st Antisubmarine Group (Provisional) with specialized long-range Liberator bombers equipped with RADAR and other submarine detection equipment. From St. Eval, the squadrons <b>flew</b> <b>killer</b> hunts against German U-Boats in the Bay of Biscay. Both of these squadrons were reassigned to Port Lyautey in French Morocco in March 1943 to shore up scanty Allied anti-submarine defences in the Atlantic approaches to the Straits of Gibraltar. German U-boats had very recently sunk four ships in an Allied convoy about a hundred {{miles off the coast}} of Portugal. Also, over the long term, the Allies wanted to increase air anti-submarine patrols and convoy coverage to secure their preparations for the impending Tunisian offensive and the subsequent invasion of Sicily.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Since its {{arrival in}} Senegal in 2004, Bactrocera invadens (Diptera Tephritidae) synonymized with Bactrocera dorsalis has caused much {{economic}} damage in mango crops. Effective and efficient control activities against B. invadens were {{necessary in order}} to continue mango production, and biological control measures were envisaged. In such conditions, the government of Senegal allowed the Asian parasitoid Fopius arisanus to be released in some orchards around Ziguinchor. Materials and methods. The dynamics of fruit fly species was studied with lure traps (methyl eugenol and terpinyl acetate with Dichlorvos). Mango fruit were sampled from the control orchard and orchards with released F. arisanus, to compare the differences in tephritid infestation. Results and discussion. The levels of B. invadens populations were 1. 6 − 2. 5 times higher in the control than in orchards where F. arisanus was released. The fruit were also 5 – 6 times more infested in the control orchard than in those that received F. arisanus. Between May and July 2012 the majority of the pupae (92 %) collected from fruit samples developed into adult flies, while only 39 % of the pupae transformed to adults between October and December after effective action of the parasitoids. In both orchard treatments, the level of native fruit fly populations was about the same. Wild fruit were infested mostly by Ceratitis cosyra, from which were reared native parasitoids such as Fopius caudatus, F. silvestrii, F. desideratus, Diachasmimorpha fullawayi, D. carinata, Psyttalia cosyrae, and P. concolor. In contrast with Mangifera indica, Citrus spp., Anacardium occidentale, Psidium guayava, Saba senegalensis, and Landolphia heudelotii were mainly infested by B. invadens which showed parasitism by F. arisanus. Pteromalidae and Eulophidae were also found from the pest <b>fly</b> pupae. <b>Killer</b> <b>flies</b> (Diptera: Muscidae) such as Coenosia attenuata Stein, C. atra Meigen and C. tigrina Fabricius emerged from the fruit samples. Conclusion. Sanitation against fruit flies in Casamance should take into account the conservation of natural enemies such as parasitoids and predators for an effective biological control of tephritids.

50|$|The {{squadron}} <b>flew</b> antisubmarine hunter <b>killer</b> missions from Morocco, deploying to {{stations in}} Tunisia in September 1943. It operated 24 {{hours a day}} until the landing of the United States Fifth Army at Salerno, Italy. It extended antisubmarine patrols until 9 September to cover the sea west of Sardinia and Corsica. One B-24 destroyed three German flying boats northwest of Sardinia. In addition to the antisubmarine patrols, the 1st Squadron flew escort for several Allied convoys and covered the escape of Italian naval vessels from Genoa and Spezia to Malta following Italy's surrender. Both the 1st and 2nd Antisubmarine Squadrons made-up the 480th Antisubmarine Group {{under the command of}} Colonel Jack Roberts. In June 1943, the group was assigned to the Northwest African Coastal Air Force under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Hugh Lloyd, RAF, but the group operated {{under the control of the}} USN FAW-15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco, (now Kenitra, Morocco).|$|R
40|$|The {{compound}} eye {{of insects}} imposes a tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity, which should exacerbate with diminishing eye size. Tiny lenses {{are thought to}} deliver poor acuity because of diffraction; nevertheless, miniature insects have visual systems that allow a myriad of lifestyles. Here, we investigate whether size constraints result in an archetypal eye design shared between miniature dipterans by comparing the visual performance of the fruit fly Drosophila and the <b>killer</b> <b>fly</b> Coenosia. These closely related species have neural superposition eyes and similar body lengths (3 to 4 mm), but Coenosia is a diurnal aerial predator, whereas slow-flying Drosophila is most active at dawn and dusk. Using in vivo intracellular recordings and EM, we report unique adaptations in the form and function of their photoreceptors that are reflective of their distinct lifestyles. We find that although these species have similar lenses and optical properties, Coenosia photoreceptors have three- to fourfold higher spatial resolution and rate of information transfer than Drosophila. The higher performance in Coenosia mostly results from dramatically diminished light sensors, or rhabdomeres, which reduce pixel size and optical cross-talk between photoreceptors and incorporate accelerated phototransduction reactions. Furthermore, we identify local specializations in the Coenosia eye, consistent with an acute zone and its predatory lifestyle. These results demonstrate how the flexible architecture of miniature compound eyes can evolve to match information processing with ecological demands...|$|R
