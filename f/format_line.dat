Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case.

The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom <b>format),</b> <b>line</b> alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of <b>format</b> (<b>line</b> vs. bar), viewers’ familiarity with variables, and viewers’ graphicacy (graphical literacy) skills on the comprehension of multivariate (three variable) data presented in graphs. Fifty-five undergraduates provided written descriptions of data {{for a set of}} 14 line or bar graphs, half of which depicted variables familiar to the population and half of which depicted variables unfamiliar to the population. Participants then took a test of graphicacy skills. As predicted, the format influenced viewers’ interpretations of data. Specifically, viewers were more likely to describe x – y interactions when viewing line graphs than when viewing bar graphs, and {{they were more likely to}} describe main effects and “ z – y ” (the variable in the legend) interactions when viewing bar graphs than when viewing line graphs. Familiarity of data presented and individuals’ graphicacy skills interacted with the influence of graph format. Specifically, viewers were most likely to generate inferences only when they had high graphicacy skills, the data were familiar and thus the information inferred was expected, and the format supported those inferences. Implications for multivariate data display are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether audience perception at large arena shows and music festivals could be improved by the addition of Infra-sub. Infra-sub refers to low frequency audio content below 50 Hz, and its presence might help provide a more involving and engaging audience experience at lower sound pressure levels. This paper investigates whether an increase in low frequency content (below 50 Hz), both in terms of magnitude and frequency range, affects a listener’s preferred listening level. The study was conducted in real-life situations at a number of European indoor arenas using a large <b>format</b> <b>line</b> array system with low frequency extension. The research shows that preferred listening levels were lower when low frequency content (Infra-sub) was increased. The implication of this result is that increasing Infra-sub content allows the environmental impact of large arena concerts and music festivals to be reduced whilst maintaining a positive listening experience. The study had some limitations in sample size and range of participants, nevertheless this study underlines the beneficial social, environmental and health implications of the use of Infra-sub, stemming from the overall reduction in sound pressure level at arena concerts and open-air music festivals...|$|E
40|$|Digital aerial cameras have {{replaced}} analogue aerial cameras in several countries. The development for operational aerial photogrammetry {{started with the}} line scan camera ADS 40, followed by Z/I Imaging DMC and Vexcel Imaging UltraCam. Recently the line scan camera Jena Optronik JAS- 150 was introduced. The capacity of the UltraCam was enlarged by replacing the used CCDs with 9 µm pixels over 7. 2 µm to 6 µm for the UltraCamXp, having 196 Mpix. The DMC and the UltraCam are system cameras, reaching {{the large number of}} pixels by a combination of 4, respectively 9 CCDs. Even if the large <b>format</b> <b>line</b> scan cameras have demonstrated their geometric potential, the major replacement of analogue cameras came by the digital large frame cameras, while the line scan cameras found their major field with orthoimages. In the meantime digital mid-format cameras, equipped with a single CCD-array, with approximately 39 Mpix took also a share by the replacement of the analogue aerial cameras. Their combination with GPS and inertial measurement units (IMU) compensates partially the disadvantage of handling a high number of images. The mid-format cameras are equipped with Bayer pattern, limited to 3 spectral bands opposite to the 4 spectral bands offered by the large format frame and line scan cameras. This changed by the introduction of mid-format system cameras RMK D from Z/I Imaging and UltraCamL from Vexcel Imaging. In addition now camera systems equipped with 4 mid-format cameras as the IGI Quattro DigiCAM and the Trimble Aerial Camera (TAC) (former Rolleimetric) AIC-x 4 are available. These cameras are not offering homogenous virtual images as the DMC and UltraCam...|$|E

5000|$|Formatting with WordStar {{was carried}} out before the text to be {{formatted}} - unlike many other word processors where the formatting of a paragraph is 'buried' within the usually hidden paragraph marker {{at the end of}} the paragraph. This latter method leaves the user unclear where formatting starts. In normal editing, WordStar hides formatting markers but these are easily displayed with ^OD command. Formatting information is then displayed in the normal text area displacing the actual text. It nonetheless made it absolutely clear where formatting started and finished. Page and section formatting was handled differently by the addition of <b>formatting</b> <b>lines.</b> A <b>formatting</b> <b>line</b> was indicated by the line starting with a full stop. A few examples: [...]lh (line height) [...]lm (left margin) [...]rm (right margin) - each of which was followed by a number. The number was assumed to be points (pt) but could be easily modified to inches or mm by the addition of [...] " [...] or mm after the number[...]lm and [...]rm were never equal as both values were from the left hand edge of the page. Setting [...]rm to 0 made text lines infinitely long. Margins could also be set either absolutely or relatively (by preceding the value with either - or +) when setting the value.|$|R
