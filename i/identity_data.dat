25|$|Published in February 2014 by the OpenID Foundation, {{the third}} {{generation}} of OpenID technology, OpenID Connect, is an authentication layer that sits {{on top of the}} OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of organizations, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The OpenID Connect specification is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of <b>identity</b> <b>data,</b> discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.|$|E

25|$|Race {{was asked}} {{differently}} in the Census 2000 in several other ways than previously. Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial <b>identities.</b> <b>Data</b> show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members {{of two or more}} races. Because of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a study on the project 'Teacher Educators Study Their Own Practices'. Nine teacher educators participated and conducted a self-study into their own practices. The leading question of this article is whether their self-studies contributed to the development of their professional <b>identities.</b> <b>Data</b> sources were digital logbooks, exit interviews, and follow-up questionnaires. The results show that conducting self-study research supports theoretical growth, ongoing development, the production of knowledge, and the enhancement of self-confidence. What these results could mean for the teacher educators themselves and their practices, and for the professional community of teacher educators, is discussed in the final section of this article...|$|R

Results indicate that Hmong adolescents view affective and behavioral components of ethnic pride as distinct and evaluated self and peer pride along these two dimensions. Moreover, pride was found to be defined as both an individual characteristic and a social construct, and the perception and expression of the term was informed by Hmong adolescent peer groups and collective identities...|$|R
40|$|Scholar {{studying}} {{ethnic and}} race relations often locate {{the question of}} identity and group formation as given and unaltered (Geertz 1963) while Barth (1969), Banton (1983) and Shamsul (1996) have been arguing that no group maintains itself. This article belongs to the latter academic tradition in trying also the micro levels; it analyses both the group and individual alignments, {{as well as the}} authority-defined and the everyday defined <b>identities.</b> <b>Data</b> colleted from five studies carried out in the Klang Valley and Penang between 1990 and 1988 is utilised to show that universalistic norms of self interest over-ride the concern for ethnic preference. Respondents show that they share some common values and their interactions cross ethnic borders.

40|$|This paper uses {{critical}} {{discourse analysis}} of interactions between law {{students and their}} lecturer to show how ‘Socratic’ teaching {{is used as a}} powerful technique to shape student <b>identities.</b> <b>Data</b> from a moot or simulated court in taxation law is analysed to show how students position themselves and are positioned as legal professionals. The paper argues that one student’s poor performance in the moot can be interpreted as resistance to attempts to influence her to adopt an uncongenial speaking position. This example supports the view that the difficulty law students have in learning to ‘think like a lawyer’ results not from a failure of skill but from the problems they have in assuming the speaking position of a legal professional. It is suggested that educators should consider helping students {{come to terms with the}} fragmented and contradictory subject positions associated with professionalisation...|$|R
