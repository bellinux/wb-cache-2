5|$|Further {{following}} {{his opposition to}} government intervention, Reagan cut the budgets of non-military programs including Medicaid, food stamps, federal education programs and the EPA. While he protected <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> such as Social Security and Medicare, his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the Social Security disability rolls.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E

5|$|Ryan has an {{interest}} in political economics and has been a thought leader in Congress on issues of budget reform. He helped bring the issues of the national debt and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to supply-side economics. His positions on fiscal policy have included tax cuts, cuts to <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs.</b> He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs</b> have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
40|$|The author {{examines}} the global impact of U. S. fiscal policy using the Bank of Canada's Global Economy Model (Lalonde and Muir 2007). In particular, she {{examines the}} global macroeconomic {{implications of the}} expiration of major tax cuts in the United States and of expected increases in U. S. <b>entitlement</b> <b>program</b> expenditures. The results of her analysis suggest that the expiration of previously enacted tax cuts in the United States will impose short-run costs on the U. S. economy. However, {{the rest of the}} world will benefit from an associated decline in the world real interest rate and from a redistribution of wealth linked to a partial reversal of global current account imbalances as U. S. government debt declines. The author's analysis of the expected increase in U. S. <b>entitlement</b> <b>program</b> expenditures, financed through debt, suggests that <b>entitlement</b> <b>program</b> expenditures will crowd out economic growth in the United States and {{the rest of the world}}.

5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

25|$|Regarding <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> President Bush signed Medicare Part D {{into law}} in 2003, {{significantly}} expanding that program, although without new sources of tax revenue. However, an attempt to privatize the Social Security program was unsuccessful in his second term.|$|E
25|$|Miller also {{supports}} a suspension {{of all new}} <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs</b> and a suspension of all earmarks.

2500|$|The mid-1990s was {{a period}} of welfare reform. Prior to 1996, the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), were waived for many states. [...] With the {{enactment}} of the 1996 welfare reform act, called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), AFDC, an <b>entitlement</b> <b>program,</b> was replaced that with a new block grant to states called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).|$|R

25|$|Boehner {{came into}} {{power on the}} {{momentum}} of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with social conservatives over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, prices skyrocketed {{throughout}} Russia, {{and a deep}} {{credit crunch}} shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards {{of much of the}} population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and welfare <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs.</b> Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. Hyperinflation, caused by the Central Bank of Russia's loose monetary policy, wiped out a lot of personal savings, and tens of millions of Russians were plunged into poverty.|$|E
25|$|Miller was {{appointed}} a state court magistrate for the remote village of Tok, {{as well as}} a superior court master for the Alaska's Fourth Judicial District in 1998. During his U.S. Senate campaign, Miller, who had said federal <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs</b> are unconstitutional, was criticized for having received federal assistance from Medicaid and a federally funded Alaska health care program for low income families at this time of his life. His campaign responded that Miller had not received the aid since 2002. Miller said he did not oppose the state program itself, but did oppose its expansion. In 2002, after moving to Fairbanks, Miller {{was appointed}} an acting state District Court judge for several months.|$|E
50|$|Besides the {{economic}} trends occurring during the passing {{and implementation of}} PRWORA; researcher's cannot exactly pinpoint to the exact factors {{that led to the}} decrease in enrollment in AFDC/TANF, even in times of economic downturn. Some Labor Economists argue that the continuing decline in AFDC/TANF enrollment was not due to a rise in the standard of living but offset by an exponential growth in the Earned Income Tax Credit, that by 2012 was the largest cash-benefit <b>entitlement</b> <b>program</b> in the United States.|$|R

40|$|The {{popular press}} is {{currently}} filled with articles in which words like 2 ̆ 2 block grant, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 entitlement, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 federalism, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 devolution 2 ̆ 2 figure prominently. The general plot line {{of these stories}} goes something like this: For many years {{the federal government has}} created more and more <b>entitlements</b> <b>programs.</b> Some of these programs are 2 ̆ 2 cooperative 2 ̆ 2 arrangements with the states, e. g., AFDC and Medicaid, but they are not very cooperative. Indeed, the general image of an <b>entitlement</b> <b>program</b> seems to be of a federal statute that imposes detailed and rigid standards of beneficiary eligibility in return for a federal contribution to state financing of transfers of cash, goods, or services. In the popular image, such programs empower beneficiaries and the central government {{at the expense of the}} states. Indeed, in more elaborate forms of this narrative the states are seen as powerless to change policies in programs that they substantially fund, not because the federal government is particularly good at enforcing programmatic requirements, but because the entitled beneficiaries can enforce full compliance in federal courts...|$|R
25|$|As the Senate's leading debt-hawk, Voinovich {{introduced}} the Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act in every Congress {{in which he}} served in beginning in 2006. The measure proposed {{the establishment of a}} national commission to examine the nation's tax and entitlement systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs</b> for future generations. In January 2010, Voinovich met with President Obama to relay the urgency of our nation's fiscal crisis. Four days later, Obama publicly endorsed the Conrad-Gregg statutory debt commission, which was modeled after Voinovich's SAFE Commission. Obama announced during his 2010 State of the Union address that he would create the debt commission by executive order because it had failed to pass the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Reagan's {{support for}} an {{increased}} defense budget {{at the height of}} the Cold War was supported by Congressional Democrats and Republicans. However, Congress was reluctant to follow Reagan's proposed cuts in domestic programs. In accordance with Reagan's less-government intervention views, many domestic government programs were cut or experienced periods of reduced funding during his presidency. These included Social Security, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and federal education programs. Though Reagan protected <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> such as Social Security and Medicare, in one of the most widely criticized actions of the administration, the administration attempted to purge tens of thousands of allegedly disabled people from the Social Security disability roles, who the administration alleged were not truly disabled. Funding for government organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency, were also reduced. He cut the EPA's budget by 22%, and his director of the EPA, Anne M. Burford, resigned over alleged mismanagement of funds. Tax breaks and increased military spending created a larger budget deficit, which led Reagan to approve two tax increases, aiming to preserve funding for Social Security.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 United States {{federal budget}} was {{the budget to}} fund {{government}} operations {{for the fiscal year}} 2012, which lasted from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012. [...] The original spending request was issued by President Barack Obama in February 2011. [...] That April, the Republican-held House of Representatives announced a competing plan, The Path to Prosperity, emboldened by a major victory in the 2010 Congressional elections associated with the Tea Party movement. [...] The budget plans were both intended to focus on deficit reduction, but differed in their changes to taxation, <b>entitlement</b> <b>programs,</b> defense spending, and research funding.|$|E
2500|$|Because SNAP {{is a means}} tested, <b>entitlement</b> <b>program,</b> {{participation}} rates {{are closely related to}} the number of individuals living in poverty in a given time period. In periods of economic recession, SNAP enrollment tends to increase and in periods of prosperity, SNAP participation tends to be lower. [...] Unemployment is therefore also related to SNAP participation. However, ERS data shows that poverty and SNAP participation levels have continued to rise following the 2008 recession, even though unemployment rates have leveled off. Poverty levels are the strongest correlates for program participation.|$|R
50|$|Aiming {{to address}} the barrier of cost to families, the Vaccines for Children program {{represented}} a major vaccine finance reform, working as a state-operated federal <b>entitlement</b> <b>program</b> that supplied {{both public and private}} providers with federally purchased vaccines. This integration of both the public and private sector benefitted all providers. Because private providers now had a role in the nation's immunization program, they, along with the public health sector, benefitted from the supply of vaccines at no cost, educational opportunities, and the ability to provide immunization services to patients without a need for referral.|$|R
