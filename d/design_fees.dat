2500|$|The {{school was}} {{undergoing}} renovation, which {{was completed by}} the end of April 2017. [...] The renovation cost of about $89 million includes $67.4 million for construction, plus other costs related to permits, <b>design</b> <b>fees,</b> utilities and equipment. A replica of Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello dome graces the school’s entrance, colloquially known as [...] "The Dome" [...] by students and staff. The renovation overhauls the school's aging facilities, many of which had not been updated since the school was built in 1964.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} costly, with Calatrava netting $80 million in <b>design</b> <b>fees</b> {{and the overall}} {{architectural}} design being another $405.8 million. Speeding up the pace of construction {{also contributed to the}} higher cost, with $100 million dedicated to building the National September 11 Memorial & Museum and another $24 million to speed up delivery of construction materials. The price of the station was further driven up by Calatrava's architectural decisions. [...] He wanted to import custom-made steel from a northern Italian factory, which cost $474 million, and have a columnless, aesthetically based design; skylights in the ground, instead of trees; and large, soaring [...] "wings", or rafters. Another $335 million was added to the cost overrun because the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had to build around the New York City Subway's IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line (carrying the [...] ), since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority refused to close the line for fear of inconveniencing commuters from Staten Island taking the Staten Island Ferry. The line had to be supported on a bridge over the station instead of on columns through the station. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy damaged several hundred million dollars worth of materials. Some of the additional cost and delay was due to additions and modifications to the original plan by the Port Authority. Calatrava's original entry pavilion was scaled back for security reasons, for instance.|$|E

50|$|As with Sri Guru Nanak Sat Sangh Sabha, a gurdwara in Wilkinson Road, the Malabar Mosque was {{designed}} and built by A.H. Siddique.

50|$|A common {{critique}} of green development {{is that it}} negatively affects the way real estate developers do business, as it can increase cost and create delay.

50|$|Designed by Sir Owen Williams, {{who served}} as both {{architect}} and engineer on the project, the completed two-storey concrete structure was designed to accommodate 324 men at ground level and 316 women at gallery level. The synagogue's design featured two unusual window patterns that were meant to suggest Jewish religious symbolism: a hexagon, which Williams meant to suggest the Star of David, and an inverted arch, which {{was inspired by the}} outline of a seven-candle menorah. Although the building was consecrated in 1938 as a district member of the United Synagogue, the congregation expressed displeasure with the finished structure and Williams returned a portion of his <b>design</b> <b>fee</b> in view of this dissatisfaction.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{evaluating}} <b>design</b> changes <b>fee</b> in construction projects {{often lead to}} dispute. Sometimes it leads to unacceptable claim {{because it is not}} easy for consultant engineers to justify the amount of changes they have performed. This study has been done with the aim to propose the new approach of evaluating the additional work done due to design changes by using BIM (Building information models) system. The methodologies used for this study are literature reviews and interviews with the construction professionals. In addition, a building model is simulated in “Autodesk Revit Structure” software to illustrate the process of automated system for evaluating <b>design</b> changes <b>fee.</b> The findings showed that the most current method practice in Malaysia is based on the Percentage of Construction Cost, Salary Cost Times Multiplier and Man-Hour. This study has developed an alternative method using BIM for assessing the additional <b>design</b> changes <b>fee</b> based on the construction cost which derived from BIM’s quantity take-offs automated system. The result of the benefit of the newly proposed system has been validated through interviews with expert panels. It is hope that this method will be more acceptable by Malaysian construction industry players in the future considering the benefit of this approach as establish in this study...|$|R

Despite the widespread popular belief {{that one of the most}} famous of Breuer's tubular steel chairs, the Wassily Chair was designed for Wassily Kandinsky, it was not; Kandinsky admired Breuer's finished chair design, and only then did Breuer make an additional copy for Kandinsky's use in his home.
