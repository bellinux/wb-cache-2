The {{interference pattern}} between light scattered by a sample and a defined reference wave is recorded and processed numerically. During reconstruction numerical refocusing is applied, overcoming the limitation of the focal depth and thus a uniform, diffraction limited lateral resolution over the whole measurement depth can be obtained.

40|$|A new {{scientific}} frontier exists {{at the intersection}} of the nanoscale and the ultrafast. In order to explore this frontier, new tools with unique capabilities for imaging with nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution are critical. This thesis describes the development of such a tool, combining coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) with an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high harmonic generation (HHG) light source to produce a compact, accessible, <b>high-resolution</b> <b>microscope.</b> Here, this microscope is used to demonstrate 22 nm resolution in transmission, a record for any full-field tabletop light-based microscope. Further, this microscope is used to demonstrate the most general reflection mode implementation of CDI to date, enabling image reconstruction at any angle of incidence. Chapter 2 describes the optimization of the HHG source for use with CDI. A pulse shaper is implemented to produce transform-limited pulses at 800 nm for increased HHG conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the HHG source is improved by an order of magnitude through the pointing stabilization of the kHz driving laser. Chapter 3 develops the ideas necessary for the data processing techniques that enable general reflection mode CDI. Chapter 4 describes enhancements to the microscope to produce images with record 22 nm resolution in addition to extension of the microscope to image more complex, transmissive samples. Chapter 5 presents the most general implementation of reflection mode CDI to date. In chapter 6, the route towards dynamic femtosecond imaging of complex nanosystems is outlined, which includes potential for simultaneous hyperspectral EUV imaging across multiple absorption edges...|$|E
40|$|Following the Abbe limit, {{the minimum}} {{distance}} between two point light sources {{that can be}} resolved by far-field optical methods is approximately half the wavelength of the light. Thus, for the investigation of chemical processes on a molecular level, the diffraction limit of light has to be overcome. This {{can be achieved by}} near-field optical methods, where the spatial resolving capacity is determined {{by the size of the}} structures, at which the near-field is generated. In this work a <b>high-resolution</b> <b>microscope</b> based on tip-enhanced optical processes is presented, which can be used for studies on molecular adsorbates as well as thin layers and nanostructures. The microscope provides chemical and topographic information with a resolution of a few nanometers and can be employed in ultrahigh vacuum as well as in gas phase. The construction involves a number of improvements compared to conventional instruments. The central idea is to mount, within an UHV system, an optical platform with all necessary optical elements on a rigid frame that also carries a scanning tunneling microscope unit, and to insert a parabolic mirror with high numerical aperture between the scanning probe microscope head and the sample. The parabolic mirror serves to focus the incident light and to collect a large fraction of the scattered light. The laser light transfered into the UHV system and the scattered light is guided to the spectrograph by two fiber optical wave guides. Experimental results of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopic and microscopic measurements on silicon wafers as well as brilliant cresyl blue adsorbates on single crystalline gold and platinum surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum are presented.

40|$|Fourier ptychographic (FP) imaging is a {{recently}} developed technique to get high-resolution high-throughput imaging. FP iteratively stitches together many variably illuminated, low-resolution intensity {{images in the}} Fourier space to expand the frequency passband and recover a high-resolution sample image. There are several latest developments of the Fourier ptychographic imaging scheme. FP scheme {{can be used as}} adaptive imaging method. An image-quality metric is defined as a guide star for the optimization process, and system corrections are then performed to maximize such a guide star. The adaptive FP scheme performs system correction by modifying the complex transfer function in the recovery process, which can be used to recover the unknown pupil function, perform system correction and recover unknown system parameters. To shorten the acquisition time of the FP platform, sparsely sampled FP, which uses a sparse-sampled mask to filter the captured intensity images, is developed and it reduced the acquisition time by ~ 50 %. In addition, the application of sub-sampled Fourier ptychography solved the pixel aliasing problem. State-multiplexed FP, which allows the illumination of at most 4 LEDs at the same time, is able to shorten the acquisition time and the number of frames for 2 ~ 4 times. Similar reconstruction procedure is used to decompose R/G/B data and recovery a colorful high-resolution image, which {{can also be used to}} replace spectral filter, gratings or other optical components for spectral multiplexing and demultiplexing. Pattern-illuminated FP extends the original FP from coherent imaging to incoherent imaging. Instead of using coherent light with different incident angles, pattern-illuminated FP uses different structured pattern to illuminate sample, and then recover a high resolution image. Finally, based on the FP algorithm, a field-portable <b>high-resolution</b> <b>microscope</b> using a cellphone lens was design for low-cost imaging. It uses a cellphone lens in a reverse manner and a LED array as illumination.
