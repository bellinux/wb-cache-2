5|$|Martin runs an {{official}} website and administers a lively blog {{with the assistance}} of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years.

He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.|$|E

In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon <b>his</b> <b>roots</b> of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as the sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone.
