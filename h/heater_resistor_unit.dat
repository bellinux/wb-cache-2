40|$|The {{research}} {{question that is}} addressed in this paper relates to the performance limitations of thermal flow sensors due to miniaturization. Sensor elements in current microflow sensors are mostly made by metal thin films. The problem is that thin-films reproduce poorly and that practically all material properties are subject to drift. This drift and poor reproducibility translates directly into the accuracy of thermal microflow sensors.

40|$|A {{thermal flow}} sensor has been {{realised}} {{consisting of a}} freely-suspended U-shaped microchannel. The structure is symmetrically heated by a heater {{at the top of}} the U-shape. The thermal imbalance caused by liquid flow is sensed by an integrated Al/poly-Si++ thermopile. The U-shape microchannel facilitates the integration of a large number of thermocouple junctions, resulting in a highly-sensitive calorimetric flow sensor (40 mV/μlmin− 1 at 2 mW heating power). The heating power is controlled accurately by forcing a current, while measuring the voltage over the <b>heater</b> <b>resistor.</b> Influences of thermal gradients across the chip are minimised by the freely-suspended microchannel ends being fixed to the substrate over a small distance. The inherently zero-offset of the thermopile can furthermore be exploited in a control system cancelling temperature imbalance by liquid flow using additional heaters.

40|$|Paramagnetic {{susceptibility}} thermometers used {{in fundamental}} physics experiments {{are capable of}} measuring temperature changes with a precision of a part in 2 x 10 (exp 10). However, heater controllers are only able to control open-loop power dissipation to about a part in 10 (exp 5). We used an array of rf-biased Josephson junctions to precisely control the electrical power dissipation in a <b>heater</b> <b>resistor</b> mounted on a thermally isolated cryogenic platform. Theoretically, this method is capable of controlling the electrical power dissipation to better than a part in 10 (exp 12). However, this level {{has not yet been}} demonstrated experimentally. The experiment consists of a liquid helium cell that also functions as a high-resolution PdMn thermometer, with a <b>heater</b> <b>resistor</b> mounted on it. The cell is thermally connected to a temperature-controlled cooling stage via a weak thermal link. The <b>heater</b> <b>resistor</b> is electrically connected to the array of Josephson junctions using superconducting wire. An rf-biased array of capacitively shunted Josephson junctions drives the voltage across the heater. The quantized voltage across the resistor is Vn = nf(h/ 2 e), where h is Planck's constant, f is the array biasing frequency, e is the charge of an electron, and n is the integer quantum state of the Josephson array. This results in an electrical power dissipation on the cell of Pn = (Vn) (sup 2 /R), where R is the heater resistance. The change of the quantum state of the array changes the power dissipated in the heater, which in turn, results in the change of the cell temperature. This temperature change is compared to the expected values based on the known thermal standoff resistance of the cell from the cooling stage. We will present our initial experimental results and discuss future improvements.

30|$|The {{covalent}} bonds formed {{especially in the}} case of thiol–gold are strong with a binding energy of 120  kJ mol− 1 [112]. Thus, it becomes difficult to dissociate the covalent bond without additional energy. Premise presents a challenge in terms of repeatability of devices. However, when external energy is provided {{covalent bonds}} dissociate and this may be used for refreshment of cantilever surface. Typically, these refreshment techniques are based on light and temperature. In optics-based refreshment technique, light energy incident from a light source dissociates the bond, whereas in temperature-based refreshment techniques the rise in surface temperature of device typically by an integrated <b>heater</b> <b>resistor</b> results in dissociation of covalent bonds. In piezoresistive readout-based cantilever sensors, refreshment using an integrated heater becomes a more attractive option since the piezoresistor and the heater can be realized using similar steps. In addition, an integrated method provides compactness to the device, thereby reducing device footprint. The integrated heater technique uses joule heating to increase the sensor surface temperature for refreshment. Integrating a heater element can influence the detection technique and piezoresistance properties. For instance, the sensor reported for detection of TNT vapors in [113] uses the heat generated by the in-built <b>heater</b> <b>resistor</b> for deflagration of TNT vapors, resulting in enhanced heat generation and thereby cantilever bending. The resultant cantilever bending due to the heat generated by deflagration of TNT vapors is gauged by the piezoresistor. Although integrated heater-based sensor design has several advantages, it may result in variation in piezoresistor properties due to temperature coefficient of piezoresistance, irreversible plastic deformation, and thermal drift in device output. Cleaning the device surface once the bond dissociates is performed by chemical or dry methods. The extent of cleaning and surface regeneration by subsequent chemical modification determines the immobilization efficiency and therefore biological sensitivity of devices.|$|R

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{fields of}} micro total-analysis systems (micro-TAS), micro-reactors and bio-MEMS drives {{the need for}} further miniaturisation of sensors measuring quantities such as pressure, temperature and flow. The research described in this thesis concerns the development of low-drift micro flow sensors for accurate measurement of minute amount of liquid flow in the nl⋅min- 1 range. Miniaturisation means that flow channel dimensions and flow rates become smaller. This requires thermally-isolated flow channels, where the complete fluid can be heated in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. A microchannel fabrication concept (Chap. 3) was developed, based on buried channel technology (BCT), allowing for easy fluidic interfacing and integration of transducer materials in close proximity to the fluid. This is achieved by the reliable fabrication of completely sealed microchannels directly below the substrate surface. The channel technology has found application in the fabrication of resonant flow sensors and low-drift micro flow sensors (Chap. 4 - 8) in the nl⋅min- 1 range. Additionally, the technology has been extended by the possibility to integrate nanochannels using fluidic vias. This has been used in the fabrication of nano-nozzle electrospray emitters (Chap. 9). In current micromachined thermal flow sensors the elements for temperature sensing are made by thin films. The problem is that thin films reproduce poorly and that practically all materials properties are subject to drift. This translates directly into the accuracy of thermal micro flow sensors. In this thesis low-drift micro flow sensors were investigated, using two heaters and a thermopile in order to eliminate material drift (Chap. 5). The low offset drift of thermopiles has been exploited in a feedback loop controlling the dissipated powers in the <b>heater</b> <b>resistors,</b> minimising inevitable influences of resistance drift, mismatch of thin-film metal resistors and thermopile material drift. The control system cancels the flow-induced temperature difference across the thermopile by controlling a power difference between both <b>heater</b> <b>resistors,</b> thereby giving a measure of the flow rate. Alternatively, a sensor resistor and heat waves can be used to provide for a low offset-drift error signal (Chap. 8). It was demonstrated that material drift can largely be compensated. Sensitivity can be increased by designing flow sensors with a large number of integrated thermocouple junctions (Chap. 6), however it was observed that externally applied temperature gradients over the chip can still lead to drift of the sensor output signal. A special meandering microchannel layout was used to create a fully symmetrical flow sensor, where the arrangement of thermopile junctions has resulted in low-drift micro thermal flow sensors for liquids in the nl⋅min- 1 range, with compensation for external temperature gradients (Chap. 7) ...|$|R

In this paper, by computing resistance distances between pairs of adjacent vertices in linear polyacenes, an explicit formula for the global cyclicity index of a benzenoid chain is obtained in terms of its number of hexagons...|$|R
40|$|A problem {{popularly known}} as “cold fusion ” was brought, {{although}} in an unusual way, {{to the attention of}} the scientific community. Although much discussion was (and is still) devoted to whether this effect is connected with any known nuclear reactions, the latter being widely questioned, there is no doubt that the general interest in the problem was provoked by the claim of the possibility of producing excess energy, i. e., energy surmounting the energy breakeven value. Unlike the clearly negative indications so far in terms of known nuclear processes taking place, however, careful analysis reveals that the claims in the principal negative papers published so far with respect to the existence of excess energy are in disagreement with the raw experimental data whenever such is presented in those papers. This is very surprising indeed in view of the wide publicity these negative results have been given. An example of an improper analysis of their own experimental data by the authors is Ref. 1, which we have already discussed. 2 Other examples of inappropriate method and improper interpretation of their own experimental data are Refs. 3 and 4. For convenience, denote by A the palladium/platinum (Pd/Pt) circuit working alone, that is, in the absence of a working <b>resistor</b> <b>heater,</b> and denote by B the combination of the Pd/Pt circui...|$|R
