25|$|Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, {{beginning}} {{the period of}} Hellenistic domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmoneans, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led {{to the destruction of}} the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar-Kochba revolt in 132–135 CE led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea. Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew remained in widespread use among <b>diasporic</b> <b>communities</b> as the medium of writing and liturgy, forming a vast corpus of literature which includes rabbinic, medieval, and modern literature prior to the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Persian {{has become}} {{just one of}} many Iranian blog languages. English in {{particular}} is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by <b>diasporic</b> <b>communities</b> of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.|$|E

40|$|International {{diaspora}} is {{an important}} phenomenon of international system. As a connecting link between two countries, i. e., the host country and the country of origin <b>diasporic</b> <b>community</b> can play {{significant role in the}} policy making process of both the countries and influence their interstate relation. They also share special relation with the country of their origin and can exert impact on internal matters. However, in spite of such potential of international diaspora, the concept has been underestimated in the discipline of International Relation. Mainstream theories like realism has no space for diaspora as an actor in international relation. Liberal institutionalism and constructivism can be employed to some extent to understand the role of diaspora in the international relation. But given the current practice international diaspora would take some more time to emerge as a dominant scholarly discipline.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{purpose of}} this study is to ethnographically examine {{traditionally}} prescribed notions of sons and daughters in an Indian <b>diasporic</b> <b>community</b> located on Devon Avenue in Chicago. Informed by the association between "ideal" and "actual" family building patterns, this study situates reproductive behaviors and demographic outcomes in its local context examining preferences of family size, sex composition, and the persistence of son preference in this Indian migrant community. This study applies a mixed methods approach—quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection—in answering the following research questions: (1) What are the "desired" and "actual" family size and sex composition patterns among married Asian Indian couples? (2) Do migrant Asian Indian married couples express son preference—how and why? Study findings indicate that son preference continues to persist in this <b>diasporic</b> <b>community</b> revealing three overlapping themes related to the reorientation of kinship networks, the transnational nature of patriarchy, and the dynamic relationship between modernity and tradition...|$|R

2500|$|Martí's {{writings}} on {{the concepts of}} Cuban nationalism fuelled the 1895 revolution and have continued to inform conflicting visions of the Cuban nation. The Cuban nation-state under Fidel Castro consistently claimed Martí as a crucial inspiration for its Communist revolutionary government. His nuanced, often ambivalent positions {{on the most important}} issues of his day have led Marxist interpreters to see a class conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeousie as the main theme of his works, while others, namely the Cuban <b>diasporic</b> <b>communities</b> in Miami and elsewhere have identified a liberal-capitalist emphasis. These Cuban exiles still honor Martí as a figure of hope for the Cuban nation in exile and condemn Castro's regime for manipulating his works and creating a [...] "Castroite Martí" [...] to justify its [...] "intolerance and abridgments of human rights". His writings thus remain a key ideological weapon in the battle over the fate of the Cuban nation.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{personal}} memoirs {{of coming to}} America, such as those by Loung Ung, a few books have been dedicated to studying the Cambodian American population, such as Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a <b>Diasporic</b> <b>Community</b> by Nancy J. Smith-Hefner. The book is an anthropological study of Khmer refugee families, largely {{from the perspective of}} the parental generation, residing in metropolitan Boston and eastern Massachusetts. This book was one of the early books among the few circulating that talks about this <b>diasporic</b> <b>community.</b> It exhibits some understanding of both traditional Khmer culture and contemporary American society, but it is not a historical study of Khmer Americans. A more recent book is Buddha Is Hiding, written by Aiwha Ong, an ethnographic study that tells the story of Cambodian Americans and their experiences of American citizenship. The study primarily investigated Khmer refugees in Oakland and the San Francisco Bay Area. The experiences portrayed in the book exemplify what most Cambodian refugees face when dealing with American institutions such as health care systems, welfare, law, police force, church, and school. The book reveals, through extensive ethnographic dialogues, how Cambodian refugees interpret and negotiate American culture, often at the expense of their own Theravada Buddhist cultural upbringing.|$|R
