5|$|Falafel {{plays an}} iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely {{considered}} to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals. According to Jonathan Kis-Lev, falafel and hummus are often used as symbols for peace, as well as tools for bridging <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|E

The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians</b> created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
