5|$|Robert's Sententiae, or Summa Theologica, {{was well}} known in his time, and has been {{considered}} a key connection in theology between Robert's own teachers' works and the works of Peter Lombard. Robert is the first commentator on St Paul to say that resistance to a tyrant might be vindicated by the Bible. Robert also opined that a king might be excommunicated if royal actions harmed the church. Robert used Gratian's works as sources for his own, citing the Decretum Gratiani. Although he used this work, which dealt with church law, he {{does not appear to}} have been considered a lawyer, and his training was that of a theologian. Furthermore, his years as a student predated the establishment of canon law as a distinct discipline in the European schools. Robert's views of the glossators, and their main work Glossa Ordinaria was that they had shortened their <b>glosses</b> to such a point that they made them unintelligible. Robert was also known as a logician, and John of Salisbury named him one of the leading disputatores, or a person who used rhetoric and logic to debate in public.|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} of the appearance such as <b>gloss</b> provides {{one of the most}} important information for object recognition. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms related to the perception of <b>gloss.</b> We examined whether the neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkeys are coding <b>gloss</b> of objects. We made visual stimuli which have various surface reflectance properties, and tested responses of IT neurons to these stimuli while a monkey was performing a visual fixation task. We found that there exist neurons in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus that selectively responded to specific stimuli. The selectivity was largely maintained when the object shape or illumination condition was changed. In contrast, neural selectivity was lost when the pixels of objects were randomly rearranged. In the former manipulation of the stimuli, <b>gloss</b> perceptions were maintained, whereas in the latter manipulation, <b>gloss</b> perception was dramatically changed. These results indicate that these IT neurons selectively responded to <b>gloss,</b> not to the irrelevant local image features or average luminance or color. Next, to understand how the responses of <b>gloss</b> selective neurons are related to perceived <b>gloss,</b> responses of <b>gloss</b> selective neurons were mapped in perceptual <b>gloss</b> space in which glossiness changes uniformly. I found that responses of most <b>gloss</b> selective neurons can be explained by linear combinations of two parameters that are shown to be important for <b>gloss</b> perception.

The present study examined which mode(s) of <b>gloss</b> presentation (L 2 definition, aural, and video/animation) is effective for learners’ short and long-term vocabulary learning and retention. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, 132 intermediate language learners formed one control and three experimental groups.
