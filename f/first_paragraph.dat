5|$|On March 13, the Polish {{government}} {{issued a}} threatening statement accusing Lithuania of provocation. On the following day, the Senate of the Republic of Poland {{called for the}} establishment of diplomatic relations and for the Lithuanian renunciation of claims to Vilnius. Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute. On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree on measures to avoid such incidents in the future. This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland, which responded by refusing, in the <b>first</b> <b>paragraph</b> of the ultimatum delivered three days later, to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-paragraph resolution. The <b>first</b> <b>paragraph</b> {{declared}} that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E

This paper presents our work in the Text Analysis Conference 2010 guided summarization task. We make use of Wikipedia, currently the world’s largest online encyclopedia, to catch the semantic meaning under words. Three features are extracted for sentence selection, based on disambiguated Wikipedia concepts and their <b>first</b> <b>paragraphs</b> in the corresponding Wikipedia articles. Our system ranks in the middle tier of the 43 peer systems (including 2 baselines). From the analysis of evaluation results, we get the following findings: Firstly, {{we can find a}} sufficient number of Wikipedia concepts in each topic. Secondly, it is the context representation but not the number of concepts that affects system performance for a topic. Finally, highly related <b>first</b> <b>paragraphs</b> in Wikipedia article significantly improve system performance. I...|$|R

Indeed, indigenous peoples were often recognized as sovereign peoples by states, as witnessed by the hundreds of treaties concluded between indigenous peoples and the governments of the United States, Canada, New Zealand and others.|$|E

500|$|Though not {{explicitly}} stated, it is {{implied that the}} horse is really Berlifitzing. The <b>first</b> <b>paragraph</b> of the story references metempsychosis, {{the belief that the}} soul of a person is transferred to another living being upon death. Other evidence is the tapestry, the lack of a history or recognition in the horse and, certainly, the prophecy referencing the immortality of the Berlifitzings. The story can be read as an allegory, a warning that a human soul can be overtaken by the evil it has created, though Poe himself does not suggest such a moral. Such evil can be created by a person's hatred and pride.|$|E

500|$|A {{substantial}} part of the text consists of recipes. In the Meat chapter, these begin with recipes for beef, including [...] "Baron of Beef", [...] "Sirloin (Norman-French, sur loin)", [...] "Rib of Beef", [...] "Boiled Beef with Carrots", and [...] "Oat Pudding, for Boiled Beef". Each recipe has a heading in italics; some have an illustration, drawn by Hartley, or else a quotation or proverb. There is no list of ingredients. The <b>first</b> <b>paragraph</b> often describes the dish or its ingredients. Thus for sirloin, she advises [...] "This is the best beef joint and should be roasted. Never have the undercut taken out...". The instructions are given in a few paragraphs: [...] "Let the sirloin be well hung; dust it lightly with dry mustard, pepper and brown flour to give a crisp crust; bed the fat end well under the lean undercut, and secure in place with string or carefully placed skewer. Roast carefully, basting frequently." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{disagree}} on whether discernible characters exist in Finnegans Wake. For example, Grace Eckley argues that Wakean characters are distinct from each other, and defends this with explaining the dual narrators, the [...] "us" [...] of the <b>first</b> <b>paragraph,</b> {{as well as}} Shem-Shaun distinctions while Margot Norris argues that the [...] "haracters are fluid and interchangeable". Supporting the latter stance, Van Hulle finds that the [...] "characters" [...] in Finnegans Wake are rather [...] "archetypes or character amalgams, taking different shapes", and Riquelme similarly refers to the book's cast of mutable characters as [...] "protean". As early as in 1934, {{in response to the}} recently published excerpt [...] "The Mookse and the Gripes", Ronald Symond argued that [...] "the characters in Work in Progress, in keeping with the space-time chaos in which they live, change identity at will. At one time they are persons, at another rivers or stones or trees, at another personifications of an idea, at another they are lost and hidden in the actual texture of the prose, with an ingenuity far surpassing that of crossword puzzles." [...] Such concealment of character identity has resulted in some disparity as to how critics identify the book's main protagonists; for example, while most find consensus that Festy King, who appears on trial in I.4, is a HCE type, not all analysts agree on this – for example Anthony Burgess believes him to be Shaun.|$|E
500|$|On October 13, Luce's telegraphed {{report from}} Quebec was {{received}} at the Collins New York office. The {{news of his}} survival {{was the cause of}} celebration and thanksgiving. In its <b>first</b> <b>paragraph</b> Luce informed Edward Collins that the lost passengers likely [...] "included your wife, daughter and son, with whom I took a last leave the moment the ship was going down". That day, the Baltimore Sun reported the loss of the entire Brown party. [...] Luce's account of the rushing of lifeboats, and the early departures of officers and crew, caused considerable consternation in New York, which quickly turned to anger and condemnation as it became apparent that no women or children had been saved, and that most of the survivors were from the crew. The New York Times reported [...] "an entire lack of disciplined control over the whole of the ship", and that [...] "the officers and crew did not do their best towards saving the vessel, which they left too early". Paul Grann, from Dorian's boat, reported that [...] "all order and discipline ceased on board", and that Rogers had threatened passengers with firearms. [...] Later press accounts condemned the crew in increasingly harsh terms; The New York Times referred to [...] "a ghastly desertion of duty", and condemned the [...] "cowardly and dastardly conduct of the crew". [...] Scientific American adjudged that the behavior of the crew in saving themselves before their passengers had [...] "blackened the character of our marine {{in the eyes of the}} whole world". Captain Luce, however, was largely exculpated; he had not sought to save himself, had gone down with his ship, and had survived largely by chance. When he arrived in New York by train from Quebec, on October 14, he was greeted as a hero.|$|E
