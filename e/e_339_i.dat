40|$|The {{nucleoprotein}} (NP) of the {{influenza virus}} exists as trimers, and its tail-loop binding pocket {{has been suggested}} as a potential target for antiinfluenza therapeutics. The possibility of NP as a drug target was validated by the recent reports that nucleozin and its analogs can inhibit viral replication by inducing aggregation of NP trimers. However, these inhibitors were identified by random screening, and the binding site and inhibition mechanism are unclear. We report a rational approach to target influenza virus with a new mechanism-disruption of NP-NP interaction. Consistent with recent work, <b>E</b> <b>339</b> A, R 416 A, and deletion mutant Delta 402 - 428 were unable to support viral replication {{in the absence of}} WT NP. However, only <b>E</b> <b>339</b> A and R 416 A could form hetero complex with WT NP, but the complex was unable to bind the RNA polymerase, leading to inhibition of viral replication. These results demonstrate the importance of the <b>E</b> <b>339</b> [...] . R 416 salt bridge in viral survival and establish the salt bridge as a sensitive antiinfluenza target. To provide further support, we showed that peptides encompassing R 416 can disrupt NP-NP interaction and inhibit viral replication. Finally we performed virtual screening to target <b>E</b> <b>339</b> [...] . R 416, and some small molecules identified were shown to disrupt the formation of NP trimers and inhibit replication of WT and nucleozin-resistant strains.

To explore further upstream the role played by this peptide, nonpeptidic agonists and antagonists of the apelin receptor are required. To identify such compounds that do not exist to date, we used an original fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay to screen a G-protein-coupled receptor-focused library of fluorescent compounds on the human EGFP-tagged apelin receptor. This led to isolated <b>E</b> <b>339</b> - 3 D 6 that displayed a 90 nM affinity and behaved as a partial agonist with regard to cAMP production and as a full agonist with regard to apelin receptor internalization.

40|$|Paramutation and {{transposon}} silencing are two epigenetic {{phenomena that}} have intrigued and puzzled geneticists for decades. Each involves heritable changes in gene activity without changes in DNA sequence. Here we report the cloning {{of a gene}} whose activity {{is required for the}} maintenance of both silenced transposons and paramutated color genes in maize. We show that this gene, Mop 1 (Mediator of paramutation 1) codes for a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whose activity is required for the production of small RNAs that correspond to the MuDR transposon sequence. We also demonstrate that although Mop 1 is required to maintain MuDR methylation and silencing, it is not required for the initiation of heritable silencing. In contrast, we present evidence that a reduction in the transcript level of a maize homolog of the nucleosome assembly protein 1 histone chaperone can reduce the heritability of MuDR silencing.

MutS performs {{the task of}} locating mismatched base pairs, loops and lesions and initiating MMR, and the fundamental question of how this protein targets specific sites in DNA is unresolved. To address this question, we examined the interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh 2 -Msh 6, a eukaryotic MutS homolog, and DNA in real time. The reaction kinetics reveal that Msh 2 -Msh 6 binds a variety of sites at similarly fast rates (kON ∼  107  M- 1  s- 1), and its selectivity manifests in differential dissociation rates; e. g., the protein releases a 2 -Aminopurine:T base pair approximately 90 -fold faster than a G:T mismatch. On releasing the 2 -Ap:T site, Msh 2 -Msh 6 is able to move laterally on DNA to locate a nearby G:T site. The long-lived Msh 2 -Msh 6 ·G:T complex triggers {{the next step in}} MMR—formation of an ATP-bound clamp—more effectively than the short-lived Msh 2 -Msh 6 · 2 -Ap:T complex.

40|$|Conotruncal heart defect (CTD) is {{a complex}} form of {{congenital}} heart disease and usually has a poor prognosis. ZFPM 2 /FOG 2 encodes a transcription cofactor that interacts with GATA 4 to regulate cardiac development. This regulation {{has been established in}} knockout mouse models that display a range of heart malformations, especially CTD. Although previous studies have identified several missense variants in ZFPM 2 /FOG 2 that may cause CTD, it remains unclear whether they are involved in CTD pathogenesis because the study populations were limited and the functional status was unknown. In this report, we screened a larger CTD population, which comprised 145 tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), 37 double-outlet ventricle outflow (DORV), and 18 transposition of the great artery (TGA), to investigate exon mutations as well as copy number variations in ZFPM 2 /FOG 2.

Structural analysis provided plausible explanations for the drug resistance of G 72 R and M 210 K.

The nucleoprotein is also essential for transcription and replication during the virus life cycle. In the H 5 N 1 NP structure, the tail loop region is important for NP to form oligomers. Here, by an RNP reconstitution assay, we identified eight NP mutants that had different degrees of defects in forming functional RNPs, with the RNP activities of four mutants being totally abolished (<b>E</b> <b>339</b> A, V 408 S P 410 S, R 416 A, and L 418 S P 419 S mutants) and the RNP activities of the other four mutants being more than 50 % decreased (R 267 A, I 406 S, R 422 A, and E 449 A mutants). Further characterization by static light scattering showed that the totally defective protein variants existed as monomers in vitro, deviating from the trimeric/oligomeric form of wild-type NP. The I 406 S, R 422 A, and E 449 A variants existed as a mixture of unstable oligomers, thus resulting in a reduction of RNP activity. Although the R 267 A variant existed as a monomer in vitro, it resumed an oligomeric form upon the addition of RNA and retained {{a certain degree of}} RNP activity. Our data suggest that there are three factors that govern the NP oligomerization event: (i) interaction between the tail loop and the insertion groove, (ii) maintenance of the tail loop conformation, and (iii) stabilization of the NP homo-oligomer.

The flux ratio of the green line to the sum of the two red lines is evaluated to determine the parent species of the oxygen atoms by comparison with theoretical models. This analysis confirms that, at about 1 AU, H 2 O is the main parent molecule producing oxygen atoms. At heliocentric distances > 2. 5 AU, this ratio is changing rapidly, an indication that other molecules are starting to contribute. CO and CO 2, the most abundant species after H 2 O in the coma, are good candidates and the ratio is used to estimate their abundances. We found that the CO 2 abundance relative to H 2 O in comet C/ 2001 Q 4 (NEAT) observed at 4 AU can be as high as 70...|$|R
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the high-energy emission spectra from black-hole candidates has increased enormously with missions like BeppoSAX and RossiXTE, thanks to their broad-band window. I present the main and most solid points of this current knowledge, {{both in terms of}} detailed spectral modeling of X-ray broad-band spectra, and more generally in relation to the "black-hole state paradigm", which links spectral and timing properties of accretion disks. Finally, through the discussion of recent results on two systems, XTE J 1650 - 500 and GX <b>339</b> - 4, <b>I</b> present evidence for a new view of the state paradigm.

40|$|In book XIII of his Metamorphoses Ovid {{presents}} the contest for {{the arms of}} Achilles between Ajax and Ulysses. The speeches that they address to the assembly of Greek show a judicial process according to the norms of Roman rhetoric. Through his traditional facundia Ulysses persuades his public and gains victory after a confrontation that relates to a verbal fight. I will explore the construction of Ulysses’s discursive superiority focusing especially on two key-places of his speech, exordium (128 - 139) and peroratio (<b>339</b> - 381). <b>I</b> will identify different syntactic, metrical and stylistic strategies with which Ulysses captivates his interlocutors. From a metapoetic perspective, Ovid’s tale establishes some resonances between the character’s Fama and its own textual mechanisms...|$|R

Dette er en økning på to ynglinger i forhold til i fjor. Ser vi på det nasjonale bestandsestimatet basert på minimum antall ynglinger i de tre siste år så er det en liten nedgang fra <b>339</b> voksendyr <b>i</b> 2008 til 330 i 2009. Alle rovviltregionene med fastsatt nasjonalt bestandsmål for regionen ligger over bestandsmå-let i forhold til antall ynglinger av jerv, med unntak av region 7 (Nordland) som ligger under bestandsmålet for regionen på 10 årlige ynglinger Utviklingen av antall ynglinger i de ulike rovviltregionene viser at det er i region 5 og 7 vi ser de største endringene. I region 7 er det en økning på fire ynglinger, mens det i region 5 er tre fær-re enn i fjor. De andre regionene er endret med en eller to ynglinger i forhold til fjoråret. Det nasjonale bestandsestimatet basert på minimum antall ynglinger de tre siste årene viser en liten nedgang på 9 individer; fra <b>339</b> dyr <b>i</b> fjor til 330 i år. I region 7 har man i år en økning til 11 ynglinger etter to år med kun sju årlige ynglinger. Bestandsestimatet for region 7 synker likevel fra 60 individer i fjor til 53 i år. Jerv, Gulo gulo, yngleregistrering, overvåking, nasjonalt overvåkingsprogram, bestandsutvikling, wolverine, monitoring, reproductions, {{population}} sizeA {{total of}} 53 wolverine reproductions {{were found in}} Norway in 2009. This is an increase of two reproductions compared to the previous year. The population estimate, based on the minimum number of reproductions {{over the last three}} years, indicates a small decrease from 339 animals in 2008 to 330 animals in 2009. All carnivore regions, except region 7 (Nordland), with national population level goals for wolverine reproductions have exceeded these goals. Nordland is also this year below their goal of 10 reproductions. The most pronounced changes in the number of reproductions, compared to last year, were found in regions 5 and 7. Region 7 had an increase of four reproductions, while region 5 had a decrease of three reproductions compared to the previous year. Only minor changes in the number of reproductions were found in the other regions. The national population estimate shows a small decline from 339 to 330 adult individuals compared to the estimate based on reproductions in 2006 - 2008. The population estimate for region 7 indicates a decline from 60 to 53 adult animals. © Norsk institutt for naturforskning. Publikasjonen kan siteres fritt med kildeangivelse...|$|R
