50|$|She {{was born}} in 1734 at the vicarage of White Waltham in Windsor Forest. Her father, the vicar the, was the Rev. Henry Frinsham, {{previously}} curate at Beaconsfield; {{her mother was a}} daughter of Francis Cherry of Shottesbrook House, Berkshire, who left a fortune, diminished by the South Sea Bubble, to Mrs. Frinsham and her sisters, known as <b>Duke</b> <b>Cherry,</b> Black Cherry, and Heart Cherry. Lord Bute rented Waltham Place to be near Henry Frinsham, and he frequently played cards at the vicarage. Here Eliza Berkeley passed her childhood, since her father would not accept preferment on condition of voting against his principles.|$|E
5000|$|Lambert {{developed}} {{what became}} known as the Lambert cherry, by grafting a volunteer seedling, found in 1848 under a Napoleon cherry tree to the rootstock of a May <b>Duke</b> <b>cherry.</b> The crown of the tree died in 1880 and a new tree grew from its roots that was not a May Duke, nor was it identical to the original seedling. The resulting cherry was large, richly colored, flavorful, and had a small pit, and it immediately became popular. Lambert introduced his cherry to the Oregon Horticultural Society in 1896 and it became one of the most important cherries grown in the early Oregon orchards, along with Royal Annes, Bings, and Black Republicans. In 1916, it was called the [...] "finest cherry grown in America".|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Cherry, {{along with}} {{longtime}} friend John Schneider, auditioned {{for the part}} of Bo Duke on the upcoming Dukes of Hazzard. Schneider ended up winning the part, to which he found much success. A few years later, due to merchandising conflicts, Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat walked out on the show, and Cherry, along with Christopher Mayer, were called in to replace them as Coy and Vance <b>Duke.</b> <b>Cherry</b> and Mayer both made their debuts on Dukes in September 1982. Despite fairly similar physical and behavioral resemblances to the familiar leads played by Wopat and Schneider, Cherry and Mayer's characters of Coy and Vance were not accepted by viewing audience, and ratings for the popular series began to sag during the 19 episodes in which they appeared. By {{the middle of the}} 1982-83 season, Warner Brothers came to new agreeable salary terms with Wopat and Schneider, and in February 1983, both of the original stars returned to the show. Cherry and Mayer appeared alongside Wopat and Schneider briefly in the episode of Bo and Luke's return, and then were written out of the show and never mentioned again.|$|E
25|$|Coy <b>Duke</b> (Byron <b>Cherry)</b> (1982–1983), {{is another}} blond-haired cousin who moves to Uncle Jesse's farm {{along with his}} cousin Vance after Bo and Luke left Hazzard to join the NASCAR circuit in season 5. Like his cousin Bo, he often drives the General Lee and is a bit wilder than Vance and chases women; he and Vance are only in the first 19 episodes of season 5 and Coy and Vance are in only one episode with their cousins Bo and Luke when they return from the NASCAR Circuit. Supposedly, with cousin Vance, Coy had {{previously}} lived on the Duke farm until 1976, before the series had started.|$|R
5000|$|In 1888 Robertson {{obtained}} {{leave of}} absence {{for the purpose of}} making another trip to the old country, and upon his term of office expiring in the same year he retired finally from Parliamentary work. For some years after the death of William Robertson, sen., the combined property was worked by the brothers in partnership, and the firm of Robertson Brothers became famous throughout Australia for the great annual sales of shorthorn cattle which were initiated. The herd had been commenced by Robertson, sen., at least {{a quarter of a century}} before, and he spared neither time nor money to procure some of the best strains of blood then extant. The stock had been kept perfectly pure, and in 1875 the brothers began a series of annual drafts from their herd, which were submitted at auction year by year and realised almost fabulous prices. On each occasion stock-breeders flocked to Colac from all the Australian colonies, New Zealand, and Tasmania. At one sale the prices paid aggregated upwards of £30,000, and at another the total receipts were £25,800. On one occasion the firm purchased from the estate of the late Richard Morton thirty-seven prime shorthorns, known previously as the Mount Derrimut herd, for £27,000, the sum of £2,500 being paid for one of the bulls: Oxford <b>Cherry</b> <b>Duke.</b> The last sale of the regular series took place in 1884, and in 1885 the famous [...] "F.F." [...] herd was dispersed, owing to the dissolution of the partnership which had till then subsisted between Messrs. Robertson Brothers and the executors of the late John Robertson, the surviving brothers having decided to confine their attention almost exclusively to sheep-breeding.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the phytosanitary status of sour and <b>duke</b> <b>cherry</b> genetic resources in the Iberian Peninsula, and the incidence and leaf symptoms induced by the Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), Prune dwarf virus (PDV) and Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV). Young leaf samples were taken from 204 sour and <b>duke</b> <b>cherry</b> trees belonging to ten cultivars, and were assayed by DAS-ELISA. Samples positive {{for any of the}} three viruses were also tested by RT-PCR. To associate the leaf symptoms with virus presence, 50 mature leaves from each infected tree were visually inspected during the summer. The ELISA and RT-PCR results indicated that 63 % of the cherry trees were infected by {{at least one of these}} viruses. PNRSV occurred in all cultivars sampled and presented the highest infection rate (46 %), followed by PDV (31 %) and ACLSV (6 %). Many trees, (60 to 100 %), were asymptomatic while harbouring single and mixed virus infections. The leaf symptoms associated with the viruses included chlorotic and dark brown necrotic ringspots on secondary veins and interveinal regions, for PNRSV, generalized chlorosis around the midveins, for PDV, chlorotic and reddish necrotic ringspots, for ACLSV, and generalized interveinal chlorosis, for mixed PNRSV and PDVinfections. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dehydrogenase {{polymorphism}} was {{studied in}} 36 sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.), sweet cherry (Prunus avuim L.), mahaleb (Prunus mahaleb L.), ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa Pall.), <b>duke</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus gondounii Redh.), Japanese flowering cherry (Prunus serrulata Lindl.) and four iterspecific hybrids (standard cherry rootstocks ‘Gisela 5 ’, ‘Gisela 6 ’, ‘Max Ma’ and ‘Colt’). Inner bark of one-year-old shoots, in dormant stage, {{was used for}} enzyme extraction. Vertical PAGE was used for isoenzyme analysis: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), isocitrate dehydrogenaze (IDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), and shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH). All studied systems were polymorphic at 10 loci: Adh - 1 (3 genotypes) and Adh- 2 (5 genotypes), Fdh- 1 (2 genotypes), Gdh- 1 (3 genotypes), Idh- 1 (4 genotypes) i Idh - 2 (5 genotypes), Mdh- 1 (3 genotypes), Pgd- 1 (4 genotypes), Sdh- 1 (1 genotype) i Sdh- 2 (3 genotypes). Cluster {{analysis was used to}} construct dendrogram on which four groups of similar genotypes were separated. Obtained results indicate that studied enzyme systems can be used for determination of genus Prunus, subgenus Cerasus. Among studied enzyme systems ADH, IDH and SDH were the most polymorphic and most useful to identify genetic variability. Polymorphism of FDH and GDH in genus Prunus, subgenus Cerasus was described first time in this work. First results for dehydrogenase variability of Oblačinska indicate that polymorphism of loci Idh- 2 and Sdh- 2 can be useful for discrimination of different clones...|$|E
