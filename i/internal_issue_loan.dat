Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, who Johnson calls [...] "the single most important individual architect of the Japanese economic miracle," [...] pursued a policy of heavy industrialization.

There was a shortage of capital in Japan at the time, industrial conglomerates borrowed beyond their capacity to repay, often beyond their net worth, causing city banks in turn to overborrow from the Bank of Japan. This gave the national Bank of Japan complete control over dependent local banks.|$|R
