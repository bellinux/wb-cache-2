Each dissected bee was visually scored for pollen fill of the crop, midgut, and hindgut; we also quantified the crop’s pollen capacity.

After smelting, forging, and rolling of the steel, the effects of Ti and Zr deoxidation on inclusions and steel microstructure were studied. The inclusion characteristics (size, quantity, morphology and composition) of samples were analyzed using optical microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the grain size and density were measured. The following results were found. The diameter of most inclusions is less than 3 µm. A linear relationship exists between inclusions density and Ti content when Ti content ranges from 0. 004 % to 0. 032 %.

Towards this end, MODIS multispectral imagers onboard both TERRA and AQUA platforms provides frequent images since 2000, that are relevant for snow monitoring as these sen-sors allow measurements of ground reflectance to be obtained in visible and near-infrared wave-lengths. These data are closely linked to the physical properties of the snowpack, and thus allow properties of the snowpack to be retrieved, such as snow cover fraction, albedo, and <b>grain</b> size (opti-cally <b>equivalent</b> <b>grain</b> radius).

Total physical and fertilizer energy, particularly nitrogen, significantly contributed to output level with elasticities of 0. 24 and 0. 14, respectively.

It has become possible to extract continuous curvature values of grain boundaries, {{an estimate of the}} lower bound of the stored strain energy and the dislocation density. In this contribution we give an overview on profiles of different calculated parameters related to deformation and recrystallization mechanisms. In older glaciological studies the value of the lower cut-off for grain sizes considered for calculation of a mean grain size has been arbitrary. We suggest to compare different definitions of the lower cut-off in the size. With respect to the important question which processes are dominating the grain size evolution in the late- to middle-Holocene, high sensitivity to the definition of this cut-off has been found [T. Binder et al., 2013, Materials Science Forum, 753, 481 - 484]. Between 250 m and 1000 m depth the curvature of grain boundaries steadily increases and grains become more irregularly shaped which correlates with increasing pressure of air bubbles. In the NEEM ice core the depth of the transition from air bubbles to clathrate hydrates clearly can be separated from the depth where the transition from Holocene to the last glacial takes place. In this way, we found that the shape of grains is highly influenced by air bubbles, whereas the size of the grains is more sensitive to climatic transitions...|$|R
