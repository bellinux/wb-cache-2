5|$|The quark‚Äìgluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10‚àí6 seconds after the Big Bang (the quark epoch), the universe was filled with quark‚Äìgluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> (with a charge of ‚àí). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one <b>down</b> <b>quark,</b> while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example from}} the real world is isospin symmetry, an SU(2) group {{corresponding}} to the similarity between up <b>quarks</b> and <b>down</b> <b>quarks.</b> This is an approximate symmetry: While up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> are identical in how they interact under the strong force, they have different masses and different electroweak interactions. Mathematically, there is an abstract two-dimensional vector spaceand the laws of physics are approximately invariant under applying a determinant-1 unitary transformation to this space:For example, [...] would turn all up quarks in the universe into <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> and vice versa.

25|$|The <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> is a first-generation quark with {{a charge}} of ‚àí. It is the second-lightest of all the six of quarks, the lightest being the up quark. Down quarks are most {{commonly}} found in nucleons. Its protons contains one <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> and two up quarks, while neutrons contain two down quarks and one up quark. Down quarks were theorized by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig when they discovered the quark model in 1968.|$|E

25|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{subatomic particle}} (Xi) {{is a name}} given {{to a range of}} baryons with one up or <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> and two heavier quarks. They are sometimes called the cascade particles because of their unstable state, they decay rapidly into lighter particles through a chain of decays. The first discovery of the Xi particle was at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} isospin {{symmetry}} and related {{methods such as}} the Eightfold Way come from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under {{the action of the}} Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the strong force behaves the same under the exchange of the up and <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> (and by extension the exchange of the proton and the neutron).|$|E
500|$|In the {{so-called}} beta decay of a neutron (see picture, above), a <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> within the neutron emits a virtual [...] boson and is thereby converted into an up quark, converting the neutron into a proton. Because {{of the energy}} {{involved in the process}} (i.e., the mass difference between the <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> and the up quark), the [...] boson can only be converted into an electron and an electron-antineutrino. At the quark level, the process can be represented as: ...|$|E
50|$|Since Omega baryons do {{not have}} any up or <b>down</b> <b>quarks,</b> they all have isospin 0.|$|R
25|$|Observations of {{the light}} baryons (those made of up, <b>down</b> and strange <b>quarks)</b> imply {{that some of these}} {{particles}} are so similar in terms of their strong interactions that they can be treated as different states of the same particle. In the modern understanding of quantum chromodynamics, this is because up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> are very similar in mass, and have the same strong interactions. Particles made of the same numbers of up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> have similar masses and are grouped together.|$|R
40|$|The {{first moment}} of {{longitudinal}} and transverse spin densities of quarks in the nucleon are calculated in a light-front constituent quark {{model for the}} different cases of quark and nucleon polarization. Significant distortions are found for the transverse spin densities. In particular the Sivers function is predicted with opposite sign for up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> and the Boer-Mulders function is predicted large and negative for both up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks,</b> in agreement with lattice calculations. Quite a different spin distribution is obtained for up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> {{in the cases of}} quarks and proton transversely or longitudinally polarized in the same direction.

500|$|All mesons are {{unstable}} {{because of}} weak decay. In the {{process known as}} beta decay, a <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual [...] boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino. Another example is the electron capture, a common variant of radioactive decay, wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact, and are changed to a neutron (an up quark is changed to a <b>down</b> <b>quark)</b> and an electron neutrino is emitted.|$|E
500|$|The symbols {{encountered}} in these lists are: I (isospin), J (total angular momentum), P (parity), u (up quark), d (<b>down</b> <b>quark),</b> s (strange quark), c (charm quark), b (bottom quark), Q (charge), B (baryon number), S (strangeness), C (charm), B‚Ä≤ (bottomness), {{as well as}} a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name). (See the baryon article for a detailed explanation of these symbols.) ...|$|E
500|$|All {{particles}} have {{a property}} called weak isospin (symbol T3), {{which serves as a}} quantum number and governs how that particle behaves in the weak interaction. Weak isospin plays the same role in the weak interaction as does electric charge in electromagnetism, and color charge in the strong interaction. All left-handed fermions have a weak isospin value of either + or [...] For example, the up quark has a T3 of + and the <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> [...] A quark never decays through the weak interaction into a quark of the same T3: Quarks with a T3 of + only decay into quarks with a T3 of [...] and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Isospin {{is similar}} to, but {{should not be}} {{confused}} with weak isospin. Briefly, weak isospin is the gauge symmetry of the weak interaction which connects quark and lepton doublets of left-handed particles in all generations; for example, up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks,</b> top and bottom quarks, electrons and electron neutrinos. By contrast (strong) isospin connects only up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks,</b> acts on both chiralities (left and right) and is a global (not a gauge) symmetry.|$|R
5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|R
5000|$|Charmed baryons {{composed}} of one charm quark and no up or <b>down</b> <b>quarks</b> are called charmed Omegas (...) and all have isospin 0.|$|R
500|$|Quarks, {{which make}} up {{composite}} particles like neutrons and protons, come in six [...] "flavours" [...] up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom [...] which give those composite particles their properties. The weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta minus decay, a <b>down</b> <b>quark</b> within a neutron is changed into an up quark, thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino. Also, the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity-symmetry, and similarly, {{the only one to}} break charge parity symmetry.|$|E
500|$|Quarks have {{fractional}} {{electric charge}} values ‚Äì either - or [...] times the elementary charge (e), depending on flavor. Up, charm, and top quarks (collectively {{referred to as}} up-type quarks) have a charge of +e, while down, strange, and bottom quarks (down-type quarks) have ‚àíe. Antiquarks have the opposite charge to their corresponding quarks; up-type antiquarks have charges of ‚àíe and down-type antiquarks have charges of +e. Since the electric charge of a hadron {{is the sum of}} the charges of the constituent quarks, all hadrons have integer charges: the combination of three quarks (baryons), three antiquarks (antibaryons), or a quark and an antiquark (mesons) always results in integer charges. For example, the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei, neutrons and protons, have charges of 0e and +1e respectively; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton of two up quarks and one <b>down</b> <b>quark.</b>|$|E

5000|$|When {{found in}} mesons (particles made of one quark and one antiquark) or baryons (particles made of three quarks), the '{{effective}} mass' (or 'dressed' mass) of quarks becomes greater {{because of the}} binding energy caused by the gluon field between quarks (see mass-energy equivalence).
