50|$|Billström was {{appointed}} mayor of Stockholm in 2002 by the City Council {{after winning the}} municipal election and forming a majority with the Left party and the Green party. Two of her decisions as mayor in particular were controversial, the first being the new entry toll that was introduced for vehicles entering the centre of Stockholm. The toll was decided on a state-level to ensure support by the Green Party for the newly formed Social democratic cabinet and Billström was forced to honor this agreement {{even though she had}} promised not to in the run up to the 2002 election. In 2006 a referendum was held to let the people of Stockholm determine whether they wanted the <b>entry</b> <b>tolls</b> permanented or not, with more than 51% voting yes. The <b>entry</b> <b>tolls</b> were thus enforced by the conservative majority ruling 2006-10. Billström's other decision was to turn a central building in Stockholm (Skatteskrapan på Södermalm) into student housing, which was criticised for being expensive for taxpayers.|$|E
50|$|Segment 1 will {{convert the}} 2 lane {{reversible}} roadway in Norfolk between the I-64/I-564 interchange and the I-64/I-264 interchange to HOT-2 lanes. Inner Loop traffic (eastbound from Hampton through Norfolk) would enter through the ramp {{just prior to}} the I-564 interchange, and exit through either the left exit directly to I-264 East, the slip ramp back to the Inner Loop for the interchange to I-264 West or continue straight into mainline Inner Loop {{on the other side of}} the interchange. Outer Loop (westbound from Chesapeake to Norfolk) traffic would enter the lanes at the ramp just after the I-64 Twin Bridges at the Elizabeth River, I-264 West traffic (from Virginia Beach to Downtown Norfolk) would use the flyover ramp from mainline I-264 to the Express Lanes, and I-264 East traffic (from Downtown Norfolk to Virginia Beach) would merge onto the Outer Loop and utilize the slip ramp <b>entry.</b> <b>Tolling</b> would only be operational from Monday - Friday from 5:00- 9:00 am and from 2pm to 6pm. Toll gantry installation is currently in progress, and the facility is scheduled to open in December 2017.|$|R
50|$|As all {{highways}} in Serbia also A1 is tolled. The toll {{is collected}} based on <b>entry</b> and exit <b>toll</b> stations and {{category of the}} vehicle. In 2017 it cost 11€ for a car and 70.50€ for a truck to travel {{the entire length of}} A1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expressway}} uses {{a barrier}} toll system that uses <b>toll</b> barriers at <b>entry</b> points, where motorists pay a fixed toll rate. Two large toll plazas and the Kabihasnan <b>entry</b> are the <b>toll</b> collection {{points for the}} expressway. The electronic toll collection (ETC) system on the expressway uses devices branded E-Tap or Easydrive, and collection are done on both dedicated lanes and mixed lanes at the toll barriers.|$|R
50|$|Three {{systems of}} toll roads exist: open (with {{mainline}} barrier toll plazas); closed (with entry/exit tolls) and open road (no toll booths, only {{electronic toll collection}} gantries at entrances and exits, or at strategic locations on the mainline of the road). Modern toll roads often {{use a combination of}} the three, with various <b>entry</b> and exit <b>tolls</b> supplemented by occasional mainline tolls: for example the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the New York State Thruway implement both systems in different sections.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{legislation}} {{was passed in}} Florida to index toll rates across the state to the national Consumer price index (CPI), to be enacted {{by the end of}} June, 2012. As a result, the toll rates on the HEFT were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years. In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were then raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%. Since the indexing of tolls to the national CPI, the <b>entry</b> and exit <b>toll</b> rates have risen by approximately 30 cents, in some cases more than double their pre-2012 rates.|$|R

40|$|Green {{spaces are}} the lungs of any city. Egyptian cities are {{historically}} characterized by high densities and compacted urban forms, developed through cultural, religious and climatic factors. In such arid contexts, the golden thread weaving sustainability concepts together is 'greening'. The sustainability challenge facing such cities is finding {{new and more}} appropriate ways of greening high density, compact and diverse urban environments. The main aim of this thesis is analysing the dynamics of green space, by studying both the demand and supply of green spaces in Cairo, a city suffering from bad and worsening health. Addressing the problem requires a sophisticated and realistic analysis {{of the dynamics of}} open space provision and consumption. The thesis adopts a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods and approaches to collecting and analysing data in order to achieve a deep understanding of the reasons behind the city's green space performance problems. The aim is to give a scientific diagnosis of the city's problems as a basis for further attempts to solve and tackle the problems. The idea for the research reported in this thesis starts from the observations that (a) The amount of green space in Cairo, capital of Egypt, is diminishing through urban encroachment of agricultural land; (b) Recreational green space has historically been provided at a very low level compared to other cities globally and in the region; (c) Much of the green space that is provided - by municipal government or private entrepreneurs - is provided as a club good, enclosed and charged for either by membership fee or <b>entry</b> <b>toll.</b> These observations provide both encouragement and challenge to policy makers aiming to make Cairo more sustainable. The analysis is broadly structured to understand both the supply of and the demand for green space in Cairo. Chapter Six focuses on the mechanisms of supply that have emerged at different times in the city's history. Chapters Seven and Eight explore residents' demands and requirements based on a systematic multi-stage cluster survey of the entire city, stratified for different green space supply institutional and morphological types. In a city like Cairo, where natural resources are very scarce and opportunities for spending on green infrastructure are very rare, it is pivotal for any new developments to be based on a clear understanding of the situation in the city. This thesis tries to draw the clearest picture yet achieved of urban green space provision in Cairo. It is offered to policy makers, planners, entrepreneurs and investors to help enrich the lives of the future generations of this great and ancient city...|$|R

50|$|From {{its present}} {{terminus}} at Interstate 44 near Newcastle (Exit 107 and starting/ending {{point of the}} H.E. Bailey Turnpike north section), U.S. 277 runs concurrent with U.S. 62 through Blanchard into downtown Chickasha, where U.S. 277 joins U.S. 81 for several miles to an intersection south of Chickasha near Ninnekah, where U.S. 277 turns west/southwest through the cities of Cement, Cyril, Fletcher and Elgin - crossing over I-44/H.E. Bailey east of Cement (no access), under the interstate south of Fletcher (no access) and under the interstate/turnpike {{on the west side}} of Elgin (Exit 53 - tolls charged northbound exit/southbound <b>entry</b> and no <b>tolls</b> southbound exit/northbound <b>entry).</b> About five miles west of Elgin, U.S. 277 rejoins U.S. 62 (and U.S. 281, whose concurrency with U.S. 277 to Wichita Falls, Texas begins) for the next 10 miles with the triplex 62-277-281 route joining Interstate 44 at the starting/ending point of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike north section (Exit 46) near Medicine Park south through Fort Sill to I-44 Exit 40A, where U.S. 62 diverts from the interstate. U.S. 277 and 281 continue their concurrent route with I-44 through the Lawton-Fort Sill area to a point six miles south of Lawton where I-44 becomes the H.E. Bailey Turnpike south to Randlett. At this interchange (Exit 30) which also includes Oklahoma 36 west/southwest to Chattanooga and Grandfield, U.S. 277-281 diverts east and then curve south to parallel the interstate past Geronimo, OK and 10 miles later joins Oklahoma 5 about 5 miles west of Walters for three miles west crossing over I-44/H.E. Bailey Turnpike at the Walters exit and toll plaza (Exit 21). West of I-44, U.S. 277-281 turns south from Oklahoma 5 and continues south, crossing under I-44 (with no access) south of Cookietown and then joins U.S. 70 at Randlett, from where the triplex U.S. 70-277-281 continues 3 miles west to an interchange with I-44 at the beginning/ending points of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike (Exit 6). At this interchange, U.S. 277-281 joins I-44 for the last 6 miles in Oklahoma before crossing the Red River into Texas.|$|R
40|$|U radu se analiziraju pojedini dijelovi arhivske građe velikog fonda HR-DAOS 476 koji se odnose na vrijeme u kojem je nastajala Priručna knjiga 2 s popisom dnevnog ubiranja mostarine na valpovačkom mostu od 1. siječnja 1731. do 31. kolovoza 1737. godine. Autorica opisuje i analizira nove izvore koji pokazuju da je vlastelin barun P. A. Hilleprand von Prandau sa svojim provizorom Wenzelom Anneisom izravno provodio kontrolu prolaza roba, dobara i ljudi koji su se kretali ovim dijelom Slavonije ili prelazili u Ugarsku koristeći skelu kod Miholjca. Četiri krivulje izrađene na temelju podataka iz popisa mostarine pokazuju bogatstvo podataka prikupljenih tijekom 80 mjeseci svakodnevnog bilježenja naplaćene mostarine. Koristeći sadržaje barunovih pisama iz Bečkih protokola ocrtavaju se svakodnevne prilike na vlastelinskim cestama i strahote koje su se povremeno događale u selima i oko njih. Baron P. A. Hilleprand of Prandau, who was {{the owner}} of the Valpovo Manor since 1722, left us a wealth of {{valuable}} archive materials in form of letters he wrote to a number of persons and transcripts of letters he received from his supervisors of the Valpovo Manor, known as the Viennese Protocols. He also left manuscripts of annual supervisor reports, containing lists of all revenues and expenditures incurred in course of the business year, which started on May 1 st and ended on April 30 th next year. The manuscript books, consisting of thread-bound folio-format papers with covers, are supplemented by the Reference Book 2 from January 1 st, 1731 to August 31 st, 1737. The first page of the manuscript book, in addition to the title, contains four straps covered in seal wax and imprinted with the official seal of the Valpovo Manor. Each page contains <b>entries</b> about bridge <b>toll</b> collected in course of a month, divided by days. The accuracy of the sum {{at the end of the}} page is confirmed by the signature of the supervisor of Valpovo. The Viennese Protocols contain a transcript of the regulations on the duties of the official collecting the toll. There is a description, a valid price list, and a price list for the use of the ferry near Miholjac. The transcripts provide all kinds of information about the passage of goods and persons. Brief records of events described by passengers, for instance, records of troubles, such as thefts and robberies that occurred on the roads or in the villages, have been recognized as extraordinary historical sources. It is also interesting to read how some people caused trouble on the bridge or tried to get away without paying the toll. Supervisors’ records about the special costs of restoring safety to the Manor’s roads and villages in this period are extraordinary testimonies to the cruelty of the outlaws, rebels, and bandits. The Manor’s efforts to catch the transgressors by organizing a militia, offering rewards to informants, and putting prices on the bandits’ heads give us an even better idea of the troubles they faced in their everyday life. The records about numerous costs of special military interventions, pursuits, executions, and treatment of the wounded add to our knowledge of how difficult and insecure life had been back then...|$|R
