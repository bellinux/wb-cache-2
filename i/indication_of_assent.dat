40|$|New {{guidance}} on consent for England and Wales, which has positive consent at its core, {{has implications for}} the UK-wide BASCD coordinated dental epidemiology programme. This paper describes a method used in Wales for obtaining consent from older children which is believed {{to comply with the}} new guidance. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to establish a more robust approach to gaining consent from 12 and 14 year olds taking part in the surveys, by building on existing "negative consent" practice and supplementing it with Gillick competent child consent. DESIGN AND SETTING: Questionnaire data from the 2002 - 03 survey of 6, 393 13 - 14 year-old children and the 2004 - 05 survey of 6, 749 11 - 12 year olds were used in this analysis. Questions specifically designed to establish competency to consent were asked of participating children. These ascertained whether children were happy to proceed and if so, whether they understood the nature and the purpose of the survey and whether they were happy with the outcome. RESULTS: Ninety-nine percent of those taking part in both survey years were happy to proceed with the examination and questionnaire. Whilst the majority of children, agreeing to take part, indicated that they had understood what was proposed and were happy with the outcome, approximately 15 % of these age groups gave answers after the event which indicated that they had not understood either the nature or purpose of the survey. CONCLUSION: Use of "Gillick competent" consent in Wales did not affect participation rates adversely. The authors would suggest that <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>assent</b> as used in Wales in these two surveys is appropriate and would only exclude 1 % of children. The alternative, of examining only those children who answered questions on whether they understood the nature and purpose of what is proposed prior to assenting, would exclude 15 % of children...|$|E

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1970. Bibliography: leaves 166 - 173. viii, 173 l graphs, tablesThis {{study was}} an attempt to find an answer to the question: What are the {{specific}} treatment conditions which will effectively induce academic achievement behavior among male high school underachievers? It was aimed at the attainment of four specific objectives: (1) to improve the subjects' academic motivation to achieve, (2) to improve the subjects' study habits and skills, (3) to improve the subjects' grade-point average, and (4) to improve the subjects' school attendance. The subjects of this study were male eleventh and twelfth grade students whose grade-point average in the tenth and eleventh grades, respectively, was more than one standard error of estimate below their predicted grade-point average using their score on a standardized test of academic ability as predictor. The subjects were assigned to three treatment groups, Le., the counseled group, the aware group, and the unaware group. The counseled group was composed of subjects who were informed of their academic potential, were invited to counseling, and were given group counseling using verbal reinforcement. The aware group was composed of subjects who were informed of their academic potential, were invited to counseling, but were not provided counseling since they declined to participate in the group counseling program. The unaware group was composed of subjects who were neither informed of their academic potential nor invited to counseling nor given group counseling. The subjects in the unaware group were the first to be selected at random from the identified population of male high school underachievers. Seventeen counseling sessions were held in a classroom furnished with movable arm chairs which were arranged in a circle with a portable tape recorder placed at the center. The sessions were held twice a week for eight and a half weeks. The topics for the counseling sessions were planned in advance and were related to motivation to achieve and effective study habits and skills. Achievement-oriented responses were elicited by the counselor using general and specific verbal cues in the form of questions. The counselor administered verbal reinforcement contingent on the production of achievement-oriented responses by the subjects. Achievement-oriented responses were defined as verbal utterances or statements expressing a favorable attitude toward education, improved academic performance, effective study habits and skills, and improved school attendance. Verbal reinforcement consisted of praise, agreement, reflection of the subject IS statement, or a verbal utterance such as "uh-hum" or a nonverbal <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>assent</b> or attention such as a nod, forward posture, or smile. The results revealed that the counseled group performed significantly better than either the aware group or the unaware group on the criterion measures of academic motivation to achieve and effective study habits and skills. The counseled group was significantly superior to the unaware group, but not to the aware group, in academic performance as measured by grade-point average. There were no significant differences among the three groups on the school attendance criterion. There {{were no significant differences between}} the aware group and the unaware group on all the criterion measures. The results indicate that planned group-reinforcement counseling is a viable technique for improving the motivation to achieve, study habits and skills, and grade-point average of male high school underachievers...|$|E
