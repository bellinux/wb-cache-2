40|$|There are two {{possible}} {{ways of looking}} at the Spanish Presidency and Eastern enlargement. One can approach it from the perspective of EU enlargement policy and, hence, evaluate what has been the impact of the Presidency on <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> and the <b>enlargement</b> process. But one can also see it from the more general angle of how do Presidencies perform and what are their potentials, limits and possibilities. Focusing only on the results of Presidency, it is evident that the Presidency failed to obtain a common position on the most decisive issues of <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> and that, as a result, the 2004 enlargement deadline was put in danger. In contrast, focusing on the performance of Presidency, we can easily conclude that, contrary to the expectations, {{when it came to the}} management of the enlargement dossier, Spain performed rather well both as Presidency and as a Member State. Obviously, explaining why good performance did not translate into good results deserves a detailed analysis. Despite the positive evaluation of the Presidency which President Aznar presented to the European Parliament on 2 July 2002, the failure of the Fifteen to reach a common position on the agricultural and budgetary chapters of <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> during the semester of th...|$|R

40|$|The 2004 <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{smoothly}} {{tackled the}} European Common Fisheries Policy. The reason is mainly {{to be found}} in the geographical transformation of ocean governance. The provisions regulating ‘who should fish what and where’, underwent a substantial change by means of temporal derogations. On the one hand the equal access principle eroded, as fishing in waters within 12 miles off the baselines - where most commercial fish stock are situated - became reserved towards the nationals of the coastal State. On the other hand the competence to adopt conservation measures has followed this geographical appropriation of fishing grounds, as the exclusive Community competence in this field is pushed out beyond the coastal waters. A return to the original provisions seems utopian, as evidenced again by the outcome of the 2004 <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations.</b> This paper analyses the process which led towards the re-nationalisation of EU maritime waters...|$|R

In 1969 the six {{member states}} of the EC decided at the Hague to {{initiate}} both <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the four applicants (UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway) {{and the process of}} foreign policy cooperation known as European Political Cooperation (EPC). There has always been a certain ambiguity about this decision, which can be seen either as a determination to match enlargement - widening - with a parallel decision to deepen or as an intergovernmentalist challenge to the Community method along the lines initially proposed by De Gaulle and Fouchet in the early 1960 s...|$|R

Five of the ten applicant countries produce electrical power for their own and export use with Soviet-designed nuclear power plants whose design and operational safety characteristics are vigorously debated. The scheduled closing of "non-upgradeable units" was an EU Agenda 2000 goal and a key dispute in <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations,</b> with important economic and political repercussions for the countries covered. This paper reviews the nuclear power plant status and commitments of EU aspirant countries and EU intervention in this regard, arguing {{that the issue is}} likely to remain volatile for some time to come, despite agreements at Copenhagen in 2002 and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Why did EC <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Spain take so long? This thesis {{argues that}} {{agricultural}} issues dominated negotiations despite {{the political and}} strategic aims of stabilizing Western Europe's southern flank that underpinned the raison d'être of this enlargement. The framework of Historical New Institutionalism is used to argue that several 'biases' operating at three levels account for the length and nature of these negotiations. At the first level, the 'bilateral' format of the negotiation procedure between Spain and the EC favoured existing EC members and protected the acquis communautaire. The Community's negotiating positions, as bargains in themselves, tended to be inflexible, and reduced Spain's input in the discussions and in the agenda-setting process. At the EC level, the CAP exhibited an unusual capacity to withstand the changes required by enlargement. This was because the EC's decisionmaking structure was fragmented into sectors and levels which allowed a closely knit 'policy community' to run the CAP {{in a way that}} was relatively insulated from other issue-areas. Change in the CAP occurred to cope with enlargement, but in a path-dependent way, passing the cost of adaptation on to Spain. At the national level, member states' so-called national interests with regard to enlargement were mixed, with no clear priority, and conflicting sectoral views. This resulted from the mechanisms of interest intermediation and inter-departmental co-ordination, which shaped the formulation and representation of national views in Brussels. Spain's accession was finally made possible when new redistributive policies for the Mediterranean and fresh budgetary resources were agreed. These were approved as part the wider package-deals surrounding the Single Market project and the Single European Act. HNI provides a new and persuasive framework with which to understand the difficulties of institutional change associated with <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|As the {{leadership}} of the European Union hands over the baton to a new management this autumn, will the winds of change blow also through the cobwebs of the EU’s enlargement agenda? Jean-Claude Juncker – the incoming President of the European Commission – has already promised to put the gearbox of further EU widening in neutral {{for the next five years}} of his mandate, and has designated the Austrian Johannes Hahn as Commissioner for the re-baptised portfolio of now European Neighbourhood Policy and <b>Enlargement</b> <b>Negotiations,</b> instructing him to focus on the Union’s political and economic ties with Southern and Eastern Europe, and in particular with the Balkans. Such an approach in the field of enlargement – once crowned the jewel of EU foreign policy – has all the appeal of a damp rag but does not necessarily depart from the festina lente strategy of the recent past. Inside the Union, political appetite and public support for expansion have been fizzling since Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, and were then severely curbed in the context of the on-going crisis by growing fears of importing organised crime and migrants from the Balkans. Juncker’s logic of consolidation sounds depressingly similar to what it supposedly replaces and incidentally, it also fits neatly with the unambitious and inward-looking mantra favoured at present in discussions at all levels on the future of European integration, more generally. With the 28 -member block determined to catch its breath in the immediate time period, and given that even the forerunner countries in the Balkans – that is, Montenegro and Serbia – will realistically need more than five years to complete their accession talks, what priorities should guide Commissioner Hahn, soon to be Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and <b>Enlargement</b> <b>Negotiations</b> – when they get down to business on 1 November...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{uses the}} {{agriculture}} {{chapter of the}} EEC's third <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> to examine two related topics: negotiation, {{and the ability of}} single states (Spain and Portugal) to negotiate with collective entities (the EEC). In doing so, it fills two gaps in the current literature. Firstly, by focusing on the Iberian side of accession, it covers aspects of the negotiations hitherto only cursorily examined by other studies of the enlargement. Secondly, it exposes the weaknesses of prevailing theories of negotiation. Furthermore, it shows that no theory yet exists which takes account of single state-collective entity negotiations. This justifies the use of the descriptive process approach to examine the third enlargement as a case. The use of the descriptive process approach provides a means of organizing, interpreting and evaluating the complex phenomenon called negotiation. It enables the use of techniques from other approaches without sacrificing details for the sake of theoretical consistency. Secondly, it enables an examination of the internal constraints facing parties to any negotiation. Finally, it gives a sense of the bargaining dynamics present in all" negotiations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Accession to the European Union {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} foreign policy tools exercised within the European arena and <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> have been a major stimulus to reform in Central and Eastern Europe. Conditionality has evolved as over time into a dynamic instrument used to ensure that new members are sufficiently prepared to take on the responsibilities of EU membership, whilst also satisfying existing member states that new members will not prove too burdensome. This paper aims to examine some of the lessons learnt from the first stage of the Fifth Enlargement and the stricter use of conditionality mechanisms for Romania, Bulgaria and beyond. Design/methodology/approach – The article is based on interviews with EU officials involved in the enlargement process. Findings – The article finds that the use of conditionality in the 2004 enlargement has had a far from uniform effect on candidates and policy areas and that the commission has learnt much from this experience. The integration of Bulgaria and Romania will offer more significant challenges and conditionality has evolved as a mechanism to address these. Originality/value – The article offersboth an empirical as well as theoretical evaluation of the use of conditionality in the context of the EU enlargement process...|$|R

The author presents a detailed analysis of the domestic and external events that impacted on Dublin’s failed 1961 and 1967 bids for membership. Geary explores, for the first time, the successful 1970 - 2 <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> and evaluates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} Ireland’s negotiating team, led by Patrick Hillery. The book provides an important analysis of the May 1972 Irish referendum, examining the ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ campaigns. The Epilogue delves into the controversial Treaty of Lisbon debate after Irish voters decisively rejected the treaty in June 2008. Is this just another crisis to affect the European integration process or is it something bigger? Where did the Irish government go wrong with Lisbon? How can they get it right? The book attempts to offer timely suggestions to practitioners and the general public. This book is an exploration in policy development and formation in a country on the verge of massive economic and political, if not social, change. It traces the changing stance of Ireland’s historically comfortable and preferred position of economic dependence, and how in the blink of an eye this course was altered by wider political imperatives and international developments...|$|R

40|$|Building {{strategies}} for continental-scale conservation is challenging due to evolutionary and geopolitical problems. How do policy choices arise from this setting? In this study, we integrate ecological research with policy analysis {{to examine the}} problem field with a case study research. We use a violet species endemic to Europe, Viola uliginosa, {{as a proxy for}} a significant European Union (EU) -Russian biodiversity pattern and its conservation. The violet's core populations locate in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, and all populations in the EU are peripheral. The species is endangered in 12 EU member states and in decline in many places elsewhere. To analyze the choices of conservation, we gathered data on its ecology, distribution, and conservation mechanisms across Europe, putting additional emphasis on the EU enlargement and long-term site histories in Finland. We found that the survival of the species in the EU depends on the <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations,</b> conflicts between the EU biodiversity and agricultural policies, selection of the species to national Red Lists and the Habitats Directive, and contingent site histories depending on the conservation activities by civic actors and the member states. While the evolutionary aspect emphasizes the genetic differentiation potential of peripheral populations, the geopolitical aspect characterizes the EU as simultaneous spaces of a monotopia, borderlands, and polycentric development. We conclude that intersections between these geopolitical spaces can be used with evolutionary perspectives to identify local, European, and network-driven policy choices of conservation...|$|R

The EU has undergone two major expansions in just three years, enlarging from 15 members (EU- 15) to 25 members in May 2004, and then adding Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007. Agriculture has {{played a central role in}} all the <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> as a result of the significant levels of government support in the EU for the sector, the sector's importance in terms of the overall EU budget, and the large number of farmers in the new member states (NMS). A major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was carried out in parallel to the first enlargement, and included changes to the way that agriculture was supported in the EU. Reform of the CAP is ongoing, with a timetable for the elimination of dairy quotas included in the latest reforms.

40|$|European Union (EU) {{recently}} {{went through}} a long and complex process of enlargement and welcomed 10 more new states. Among the 10 new comers, Poland is a crucial accession country due to its size, geographical position, and large population. In addition, it has a problematic industrial restructuring and a large agricultural sector. It is hard for the European Union to digest Poland and therefore {{the outcome of the}} negotiations with Poland had and will have a leverage effect for other countries with similar issues to tackle with the EU. Agriculture is considered {{as one of the most}} complicated issues between Poland and the EU not only due to the large and inefficient agricultural sector in Poland, but also due to the internal problems EU is facing with its policies on agriculture. This thesis will focus on the negotiations between the EU and Poland on the chapter of agriculture, which is one of the 31 chapters of the acquis communataire. <b>Enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> are the negotiations on the compliance of the candidate states with the acquis communataire of the European Community. Acquis communataire is the legislation of the European Community. It encompasses the founding treaties of the Community, subsidiary treaties, secondary legislation and decisions, opinions and general principles of European Court of Justice. Acquis is presented in 31 chapters to the candidates. The thesis aims to analyse the negotiation process between EU and Poland on the chapter of agriculture, providing an insight into the context and background of the negotiations. Each negotiation issue stated by Poland as a response to the acquis presented by the EU has been discussed thouroughly based on primary resources from the EU and Poland...|$|R
40|$|In the {{relationship}} between the European Union and the EFTA States nearly all attention has recently been drawn to the <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, which were recently successfully concluded. However, it should not be forgotten that the accession of the abovementioned EFTA States still depends on the outcome of their respective referenda relating to the enlargement issue. The agreement establishing the European Economic Area (EEA), which entered into force on 1 January 1994, is at present the zenith of cooperation between the European Union and the EFTA States and the EEA Agreement could remain of importance if the outcome of the referenda in {{one or more of the}} EFTA States is negative. It should be mentioned that, besides Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, Iceland is also among the EFTA States which are party to the EEA Agreement. Liechtenstein has postponed its ratification due to its close relations with Switzerland which was unable to ratify following its referendum in 1992. The EEA Agreement deserves further attention due to the possibility that it may serve as a model for the European Union in later negotiations with other countries, especially with Eastern European countries which most likely will not be able to accede as full members for some years to come but may like to be associated with the Community within a multilateral and institutionalized framework.

40|$|Negotiations on {{agriculture}} were successfully {{launched in the}} WTO early in 2000. In the initial phase, negotiating proposals have been submitted by member countries and are being discussed in special sessions of the WTO Committee on Agriculture. A stock-taking exercise {{will be held in}} March 2001 to establish the next steps in the process. Many developments will influence the shape and dynamics of the negotiations, particularly the possibility of a comprehensive trade round. The first part of this paper examines the policy setting for the negotiations. The ongoing integration of economies and accompanying agricultural policy reforms provide an environment for further trade liberalization. Expansion of regional trade agreements and EU <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> add urgency to the multilateral negotiating process. Newer trade issues and nontrade concerns, often connected to the food business, focus attention on the agricultural talks but may also retard them. A further factor that will add urgency is the anticipated expiry of the Peace Clause in 2003. The paper reviews the main agricultural issues for negotiation and the initial negotiating positions. Substantial progress in improving access is essential for the negotiations to succeed. The issues of export subsidies, other forms of export competition, unfair pricing practices, and dumping are receiving much attention. There are pressures to reduce or eliminate all forms of trade-distorting domestic support. Many non-trade concerns are being introduced, and legitimate trade issues will need to be addressed. The developing countries are determined to extract a better deal for their agriculture. The paper concludes that the elements for progress in further agricultural trade liberalization are coming to the negotiating table but much uncertainty remains both within and outside agriculture. agricultural negotiations, peace clause, non-trade concerns, subsidies, WTO, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} non-state actors on Polish-German relations by considering foreign policy-making towards Poland in Germany and vice versa. The approach chosen for this thesis is interdisciplinary and takes into consideration literature from domestic politics (Area Studies), Foreign Policy Analysis and International Relations (IR). The thesis argues that IR, by purely looking into the quality of inter-state relations, too often treats these relations {{as a result of}} policies emanating from the relevant governments, without considering the policies’ background. Therefore, the thesis argues {{that it is necessary to}} engage with the domestic factors which might explain where foreign policies come from. It points out that non-state actors influence governments’ choices by supplying resources, and by cooperating or competing with the government on an issue at stake. In order to determine the degree of influence that non-state actors can have on foreign policymaking two variables are examined: the institutionalisation of the state relations in question; and the domestic structures of the relevant states. Specifically, the thesis {{examines the}} institutionalisation of Polish-German relations, and examines Germany’s and Poland’s domestic structures and their effect on the two states’ foreign policy-making in general. Thereafter, the thesis uses case studies in order to unravel the influence of non-state actors on specific foreign policies. Three case studies are examined in detail: (i) Poland’s EU accession negotiations with regard to the free movement of capital chapter of the acquis communautaire; (ii) Germany’s EU 2004 Eastern <b>Enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> with regard to the free movement of workers chapter of the acquis communautaire; and (iii) Germany’s decision to establsh a permanent exhibition in Berlin that will depict the expulsions of millions of Germans from the East following WWII...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} between Spain and the EEC {{have been studied}} {{by a number of}} specialists from various disciplines and different countries. Most of them have focused on the political meaning of Spain’s European integration, interpreting it as a chapter in the country’s transition from dictatorship to democracy that began in November 1975. Historians have usually seen the European Community as a natural destiny for Spain and not as an interested party with its own interests and rules, {{different from those of the}} Governments in Madrid. In their treatment of the <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations,</b> these scholars have differentiated two stages, coincident with the successive governments of UCD and the PSOE. The former had presided over a period of problems and disappointments coming out of the then complicated relations with France. Those started to improve after the Socialist victory in the Spanish general elections of 1982, which gave way in Madrid to a cabinet of the same political colour than that ruling in Paris. Those adhering to this perspective tend also to identify the negotiations with the European Community as part of the diplomatic interactions between Spain and France, ignoring the complex nature of ever-­‐changing and complex international organizations such as the EEC. Therefore, we deem it necessary to refocus the analysis of Spain’s integration to link it to the broader history of the EU enlargement, which in turn was highly influenced by the internal situation of each Member State 1. If the social, economic and political changes Spain underwent after Franco’s death conditioned the approach, objectives and strategies of its European partners, also did the delicate international economic scenario of the 1970 s, the dialectics of the Cold War or the electoral calendars in several countries [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish EU Council Presidency {{during the}} first half of 2001 was {{generally}} perceived in positive terms by commentators and practitioners alike. While the primary memory, tragically enough, may be the riots in the streets of Göteborg during the European Council meeting (June 15 - 16), for EU development, it may well be argued that the progress in the <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations</b> was the most important accomplishment of the period. The outcome of the Göteborg summit in the enlargement sphere has been hailed as potentially very important; Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson even went as far as labelling it “a historic moment”. 1 In short, the European Council decided that membership negotiations should be concluded with the most advanced candidate countries by the end of 2002, in order for these countries to take part, as EU members, in the elections to the European Parliament in June of 2004. For a Presidency that set out to prioritise enlargement over all other issues, this outcome may well be labelled a success. At the same time, the outcome needs to be put in principal perspective, for example when it comes to questions about the room for influence of the Presidency as an institution and about the future of the enlargement process. In general terms, this paper seeks to analyse the Swedish Presidency in the enlargement area. There are two main avenues along which any given Presidency can be evaluated in the enlargement sphere: the incremental yet potentially important progress in the negotiation process, and the symbolically important outcome of the European Council summit at the end of the Presidency. This duality is also reflected in the ambitions of the Swedish Presidency as they were presented prior to the Swedish term...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine the {{evolution}} of institutions of socialdialogue and actors’ perceptions in Bulgaria within the context of the processof Europeanization. The research question addressed by the paper is how andunder what external and internal conditions the institutions of social dialoguein Bulgaria have been built and have evolved over time. The methodology isbased on previous academic research in this field, official national and EUdocuments, newspapers and semi-structured interviews with representativesfrom trade unions and employers’ organisations as well as foreign experts. The overall conclusions comprise two interrelated points. First of all, EU conditionality became the main source of change in the area of social dialogue at the national level through technical assistance and the dissemination of ideas and “best practices”. However, it didn’t have the same impact in respect of negotiations at sectoral/branch and local levels. Secondly, its role was limited to the time of <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations,</b> and above all the effects of its influence were strongly dependent on the commitment of internal actors. These findings therefore support the idea of an impact of the EU mediated primarily by internal actors. However, it is necessary to add a furtherconsideration regarding the intrinsic reasons for the limited and temporary influence of the EU. Concerning the notion of a European social model, the development of integration in this respect can in fact be considered as being only embryonic at the present moment. This becomes even more evident when we look at the secondary role played by those issues during accession. Therefore, if it is possible to draw conclusions about the more general process of Europeanization, these inevitably comprise recognising the causal link between the delay of European integration in the field of social dialogue, and the subsequently limited ability of the EU to play a role in candidate countries and even Member States. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Democratic {{values and}} basic rights in Turkey are hanging by a thread. Over the past {{eighteen}} months {{the rule of}} law, civil liberties and freedoms have been eroded which has left many Turks anxious over {{the direction in which}} their country is heading. With Turkey’s accession negotiations de facto frozen, the EU finds itself with little leverage over Ankara. Calls of concern have fallen on deaf ears as Turkey’s leadership has become increasingly belligerent, with its EU related narrative overflowing with resentment. Because Turkey’s accession negotiations are irreversibly intertwined with Turkey-EU cooperation in other areas, this has had a negative impact on the broader relationship between both sides. Recent examples include the issue of foreign fighters traveling from Europe to Syria via Turkey. Each side has accused the other of not doing enough to stem the flow. Likewise, following the decision of Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to ban the import of agricultural goods from countries that have placed sanctions on Moscow, the EU asked Turkey to demonstrate solidarity, as a “candidate country”, and not to increase exports of agricultural products to Russia. Turkey rejected this request and is reportedly working on strengthening trade ties with Moscow. Turkey remains an important partner in a number of key areas including trade, energy, foreign and security policy and migration. At a time when the EU faces crises in both its Eastern and Southern neighbourhoods, a reliable and predictable Turkey, with which it can cooperate in the Black Sea and Middle East neighbourhoods is crucial. Hence the vision and plans of the EU’s new leadership, in particular new Foreign Policy Chief, Federica Mogherini, and Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and <b>Enlargement</b> <b>Negotiations,</b> Johannes Hahn, how to shape relations with Ankara is particularly significant. The Union’s current policy is counterproductive and is further eroding trust and cooperation rather than enhancing it. It needs to be turned around...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of essays reflects on the fifth enlargement of the European Union, projected {{to take place in}} 2004. It examines the process of enlargement, its impact both on the candidate States and on the institutions and policies of the European Union. In so doing, it discusses these issues from a variety of perspectives - legal, economic, and political - reflecting the different dimensions of the enlargement. This enlargement will be unlike any other, {{not only in terms of}} its scale, and the unprecedented nature of the lengthy and complex pre-accession process, but also in its wider implications for the future direction of the European Union itself and for the whole of Europe. The contributions thus focus not only on the adjustments having to be made by the candidate States and the EU’s institutions, but also on enlargement as an interaction between the candidate States and the European Union, and between the EU and the wider world community. Policies which have developed and matured during this enlargement, such as conditionality, also have effects on regions and States which are outside the current enlargement process, such as the Balkans. A greatly enlarged EU also has implications for the EU’s trading partners and for its role within the WTO. Different chapters deal with the pre-accession process, the <b>enlargement</b> <b>negotiations,</b> the economic impact of enlargement on the candidate States, membership conditionality as applied by the European Union, the need to adapt the EU’s institutional structure to cope with enlargement, and the impact of enlargement on the external policies of both the EU and the candidate States. 1 : Introduction 2 : Marc Maresceau: Pre-Accession 3 : Phedon Nicolaides: Preparing for Accession to the European Union: How to Establish Capacity for Effective and Credible Application of EU Rules 4 : András Inotai: The 'Eastern Enlargements' of the European Union 5 : Karen E.
