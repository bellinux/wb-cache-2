50|$|In telecommunications, <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> is a {{measuring}} device which measures the signal strength {{caused by a}} transmitter.|$|E
50|$|When {{measuring}} with a <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> it {{is important}} to use a calibrated antenna such as the standard antenna supplied with the meter. For precision measurements the antenna must be at a standard height. A value of standard height frequently employed for VHF and UHF measurements is 10 m. Gain correction tables may be provided with the meter, that take into account the change of antenna gain with frequency.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Field {{strength}} meter== <b>Field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> {{is actually}} a simple receiver. After a tuner circuit, the signal is detected and fed to a microammeter, which is scaled in dBų. The frequency range of the tuner is usually within the terrestrial broadcasting bands. Some FS meters can also receive satellite (TVRO and RRO) frequencies. Most modern FS meters have AF and VF circuits {{and can be used}} as standard receivers. Some FS meters are also equipped with printers to record received field strength.|$|E
50|$|The {{existence}} of the bug was discovered accidentally by a British radio operator at the British embassy who overheard American conversations on an open radio channel as the Soviets were beaming radio waves at the ambassador's office. An American State Department employee was then able to reproduce the results using an untuned wideband receiver with a simple diode detector/demodulator, similar to some <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R
40|$|In many {{countries}} the electromagnetic <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> in {{the proximity of}} licensed amateur radio stations is limited to ensure public safety. If the station antenna(s) and/or the environmental situation are complex, only measurement results are acceptable as proof, and proper calibration of the <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meters</b> ("radiation monitors") is mandatory. A system and a procedure are described here, enabling calibration of such "radiation monitors" at a high quality level and traceable to the SI units, but with low-budget amateur equipment...|$|R
50|$|In physics, <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> {{means the}} {{magnitude}} of a vector-valued field (e.g., in volts per meter, V/m, for an electric field E). For example, electromagnetic field results in both electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> and magnetic <b>field</b> strength.As an application, in radio frequency telecommunications, the signal strength excites a receiving antenna and thereby induce a voltage at a specific frequency and polarization {{in order to provide}} an input signal to a radio receiver. <b>Field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meters</b> are used for such applications as cellular, broadcasting, wi-fi and a wide variety of other radio-related applications.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{handheld}} device known as a <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter.</b> One {{stands in front of}} the antenna (not recommended when transmitting), and measures the field strength. As one moves around, one gets a feel for the antenna radiation pattern. In theory, one could make a very accurate picture of the antenna pattern with this method, depending on how much time one spends on it. But in the quantum way of thinking, one is really constructing a probability function instead. The same is true for a cell phone. Instead of thinking of the five bars as a field strength, one may interpret them as a probability function; or more accurately, as a probability histogram.|$|E
50|$|Keneth Alden Simons (March 10, 1913 - June 11, 2004) was an American {{electrical}} engineer {{best known for}} his pioneering contributions to the technical development of cable television in the United States, for the most part as chief engineer for the Jerrold Electronics Corporation. Jerrold {{was one of the first}} manufacturers of cable television equipment and also constructed entire cable systems. Simons designed one of the first converters and the two most important pieces of the early test equipment, the Model 704 <b>Field</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Meter</b> and Model 900 Sweep Frequency Generator. He also authored a seminal technical handbook on cable television systems, and served on national and international engineering standards committees. Fellow cable engineer Archer Taylor stated that Simons was seen as the leading technical expert at Jerrold for over two decades.|$|E
5000|$|Simons {{began at}} Jerrold Electronics Corporation as a {{part-time}} consulting engineer in 1951. His first project was to design a high-to-low frequency converter. He and other Jerrold engineers worked out of Simons' personal laboratory located {{on the second floor}} of a stained glass factory in Bryn Athyn, Pa., until a new Jerrold lab was built in Hatboro, Pa., in 1955. Simons characterized his role at Jerrold in his resume: [...] "Three of us were primarily responsible for equipment design in the early years. Donald Kirk was talented in coming up with new ideas, my contribution was often in getting a system to work, and Henry Arbeiter took all the bright ideas and made them producible." [...] Other engineering colleagues included Eric Winston, Mike Jeffers, Frank Ragone, Caywood Cooley, Vic Nicholson, Len Ecker, and Bill Felsher. [...] Simons successively became chief engineer, chief test equipment engineer, vice president and director of advanced development. Some of his noteworthy designs include the Model 704B <b>Field</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Meter.</b> In a technology area based on rapid and constant change, the 704B was of note in being in production and use for more than 20 years [...] The 704 name is honored even today in a fraternal organization of its users The Loyal Order of the 704, commemorating the meter’s defining role in cable development. Simons also designed its successor, the Model 727 Field Strength Meter; the Model 900 and Model 1015 Sweep Frequency Generators, and the Model SCA 213 Distributed Amplifier.|$|E

Samples of home appliances include television, radio, electric bulb, refrigerator, microwave oven, iron, washing machine, heating jar, AC, and fan. The only samples of office equipment are computers. In addition to home appliances and office equipment, electric and magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>strength</b> were also measured in living rooms, and in office working rooms. The instrument used for the electric and magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>strength</b> measurement is Holaday portable <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meters</b> model HI 3604. Among all the household samples, television (310 V/m in 100 cm from the source), and iron (1680 V/m in 3 cm from the source) exposed the highest electric field.

40|$|Abstract—The wide {{increase}} and diffusion on telecommunication technologies {{have caused a}} huge spread of electromagnetic sources in most European Countries.

5000|$|DC {{switch gear}} is {{larger and more}} {{expensive}} to produce, since arc suppression is more difficult. When a switch or fuse first opens, current will continue to flow in an arc across the contacts. Once the contacts get far enough apart, the arc will extinguish because the electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> (volts per <b>meter)</b> is insufficient to sustain it. In AC circuits, current drops to zero twice during each AC cycle, at which time the arc extinguishes. If {{the distance between the}} contacts is still relatively small, the voltage will re-initiate an arc. Since DC is constant and these zero-crossing events do not occur, a DC switch must be designed to interrupt the full rated voltage and current, leading to larger and more expensive switching equipment. [...] The voltage required to re-initiate an extinguished arc is much greater than the voltage required to sustain an arc.|$|R

40|$|Encouraging {{users to}} create {{stronger}} passwords {{is one of}} the key issues in password-based authentication. It is particularly important as prior works have highlighted that most passwords are weak. Yet, passwords are still the most commonly used authentication method. This paper seeks to mitigate the issue of weak passwords by proposing a context-based password <b>strength</b> <b>meter.</b> We conduct a randomized experiment on Amazon MTurk and observe the change in users’ behavior. The results show that our proposed method is significantly effective. Users exposed to our password <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> are more likely to change their passwords after seeing the warning message, and those new passwords are stronger. Furthermore, users are willing to invest their time to learn about creating a stronger password, even in a traditional password <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> setting. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating contextual information to password <b>strength</b> <b>meters</b> could be an effective method in promoting more secure behaviors among end users...|$|R

40|$|NIOSH has {{developed}} an active proximity warning system called HASARD (Hazardous Area Signaling and Ranging Device) for warning workers as they approach known dangerous areas around heavy mining equipment and other dangerous work zones. HASARD is composed of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter generates a 60 -kHz magnetic field using one or more wire loop antennas. Each antenna is adjusted to establish a magnetic field pattern for each hazardous area. The receiver, worn by the worker, is a magnetic <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter.</b> The received signal is compared against preset levels which are calibrated to identify levels of danger. The receiver outputs can include visual, audible, and vibratory indicators and {{it can also be}} made to disable machine functions.

40|$|A {{pico-satellite}} formation concept, {{aimed to}} gather spatially and temporally correlated data, is analyzed: A larger nano-satellite (the Chief) contains {{a limited number}} of smaller satellites (Deputies), it deploys them and receives the transmitted data. Severe constraints come from the limited resources of the involved spacecraft: In particular, a short relative distance between the Deputy and the Chief must be kept during the operational lifetime, in order to preserve the inter-satellite communication link. Moreover, pico-satellites usually lack of active orbital control: The only way to prevent the formation from rapidly getting apart too fast consists in a wise deployment strategy. The aim is to respect the constraints of maximum permitted distance during the mission lifetime, while avoiding collisions. The factors considered as most important for the relative dynamics are the orbital environment (mainly, gravity gradient and differential drag) and the errors on Chief's orientation at pico-satellites separation, that can be large for low-cost micro attitude control systems. The paper also introduces a simple solution for the relative navigation of the formation. A <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> onboard the Chief can provide the level of received signal power, which is an observable, even if poor and inaccurate, related to the inter-satellite distance.

40|$|Formation flying {{missions}} involve relative navigation, or {{the determination}} of the relative kinematic state of the spacecraft involved. Different options do exist, both in visible and conventional radio-frequency operations, with passive and active architectures. All the solutions need {{to take into account the}} strict requirements in terms of mass, volume and power typical to spacecraft, not to forget that they are not directly part of the payload, so that the overall impact of this avionic subsystem needs to be minimized. This paper aims to discuss a simple solution for the relative navigation of a formation, especially suitable for moderate cost, moderate performance missions (like the ones exploited by cubesats). A <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>meter</b> onboard the chief-satellite can provide the level of received signal power, which is an observable related - even if with a poor quality - to the inter-satellite distance. An extended Kalman filter including a suitable dynamical model can exploit these measurements in order to estimate the formation kinematic state at a very limited cost. The combination of the two elements makes up for a technique which is accurate enough even in the phases immediately following the release from the launcher, where the spacecraft are in close proximity. The presented numerical simulation proves the valuable performance of such a simple system, also useful as a possible back-up solution at a limited cost in terms of spacecraft requirements...|$|E
