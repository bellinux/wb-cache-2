5|$|In the past, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> {{athletes to}} return to {{participation}} was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address {{a meeting at the}} University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Edwin's {{conversion}} offered by Bede turns on two events. The first, during Edwin's exile, tells how Edwin's life was saved by Paulinus of York. The second, following {{his marriage to}} Æthelburg, was the attempted assassination at York, at Easter 626, by an agent of Cwichelm of Wessex. Edwin's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the baptism of his daughter Eanfled and his subsequent promise to adopt Christianity if his campaign against Cwichelm proved successful. Apart from these events, the general character of Bede's account is one of an indecisive king, unwilling to take risks, unable {{to decide whether to}} convert or not.|$|E

5|$|The scheme has {{attracted}} criticism from various sources, and certain aspects and proposals {{have been particularly}} controversial. A planned 42-storey hotel and residential building on one block—which {{was not in the}} original plan and for which planning permission was later denied—was opposed by many local people and politicians, and was eventually rejected by a government minister on appeal. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> a large supermarket branch to be built {{in the middle of the}} development was also unpopular. A campaign group was formed to co-ordinate and raise the awareness of people's concerns.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> trading.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007. Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand. One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin. Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area. The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras. Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly. According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting.|$|E
50|$|The league {{was formed}} and {{established}} in 1998 to succeed the Liga Perdana (1994-97) after FAM <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allows</b> clubs other than state FAs {{to compete in}} the professional level league in Malaysia.

5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1952, {{when the}} {{mainland}} NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself a continuation of the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year. As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent a country, and both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team. After considerable deliberation, the IOC decided that if either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline. In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games. Brundage, president-elect when {{the decision was made to}} allow PRC athletes to compete, argued against the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.|$|E
5|$|With European teams {{constantly}} improving, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{felt their}} amateur players {{could no longer}} be competitive and pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF voted to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional players at the 1970 World Championships. The rights to host the tournament were awarded to Canada for the first time–in Montreal and Winnipeg. However, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the use of professionals was reversed in January 1970. IOC president Avery Brundage was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together and said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from International ice hockey competition. Canada's ice hockey team did not participate in the 1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics. Canada also waived their rights to host the 1970 World Championship, so it was held in Stockholm, Sweden instead.|$|E

40|$|Land {{clearing}} is {{a significant}} environmental issue in Australia and an area of active legislative reform. Despite evidence of the harm that land clearing causes to individual animals, such harm is either ignored or considered only indirectly in environmental decision-making. We argue that the harm that land clearing causes to animals ought to be identified and evaluated in decision-making relating to land clearing and consider the following three propositions in support: (1) land clearing causes deaths that are physically painful and psychologically distressing because of their traumatic and debilitating nature; (2) land clearing causes physical injuries, other pathological conditions, pain and psychological distress over a prolonged period as animals attempt {{to survive in the}} cleared environment or in the environments they are displaced to; and (3) on the basis of current clearing rates, more than 50 million mammals, birds and reptiles are likely to be killed annually because of land clearing in Queensland and New South Wales. The scientific consensus about the harm caused by land clearing means that <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> land clearing are <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> most of the animals present to be killed and, as such, frameworks for decision-making ought to include proper evaluation of the harm to be imposed...|$|R
