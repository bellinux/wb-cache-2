5|$|On May 22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CPC (CPC) {{released}} their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific {{season was}} expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16named storms, of which 6–8 were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> hurricanes, and 1–3 <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> major hurricanes. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area. They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds.

Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E

5|$|The O'Brien Brewing and Malting Company, {{also known}} as the Klondike Brewery, was a brewery founded by Thomas O'Brien in Klondike City, an {{adjoining}} settlement to Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada from 1904 to 1919. It was established during a period in which Dawson City was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of beer in 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation.|$|E
5|$|The company faced a {{difficult}} situation again in 1967 when {{the total number of}} vehicles produced was just 381 units. At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees. Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low; in 1963 just 4–5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward control model B6-76 which was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the next volume model.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more favorable. On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000UTC on October 9, about 765mi (1235km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s Massino was a Bonanno associate. He led a {{successful}} truck hijacking crew, {{with the assistance}} of his brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale and carjacker Duane Leisenheimer, while fencing the stolen goods and running numbers using the lunch wagon as a front. He also befriended another mob hijacker, future Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. Increasingly prosperous, Massino opened his own catering company, J Catering, which became another front for his activities. Massino's mentor Rastelli was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Bonanno boss upon the 1973 death of Natale Evola, but he had been convicted the previous year of loansharking and then in 1976 of extortion, leaving him imprisoned. In his absence Carmine Galante, a former consigliere and convicted drug trafficker, seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss.|$|E
5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have children of his own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.|$|E

He was promoted to colonel on 22 July 1830. In 1834 he became the Inspector-General of Police in Ulster, but was passed over for the position of Inspector-General of the Irish constabulary in 1836; the possibility of his appointment to the latter post had caused some concern among Irish Tories, who felt he was too critical of the Orange Order. He was later rumoured to {{be a candidate for}} the governorship of Dominica, in the West Indies, though this post {{does not seem to have}} materialised. In 1838 he was ordered to Canada to act as adjutant-general for the force garrisoned there after the Rebellions of 1837. When Lord Hill was retiring from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1839, Anglesey was suggested as a replacement to succeed him, although he eventually turned down the job; had he taken it up, Stovin was widely <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> his personal secretary, the same capacity he had served in Dublin.|$|E
