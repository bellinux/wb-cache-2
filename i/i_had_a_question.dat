40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to gain {{knowledge}} of how individual social students believe that ethical codes {{should be used in}} social work, and what the individual social students believe that an ethical code should contain. In this essay I have chosen to work on a qualitative approach because I am looking for subjective experiences. I have chosen to use my focused interviews as data collection method. Interviews are a good choice to find out people's experiences of a phenomenon. The result shows that some of the students felt that ethical codes should be used as support for ethical decisions in their daily work. The other students felt that ethical codes should be used in various forms of mentoring groups, which reflected on ethical dilemmas. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about what the social students felt that the ethics code should contain. The answer to this question was a rather belated response: the rights of clients, responsibilities for social workers, emphasis on what is important in social work, and what characteristics you should have as a social worker...|$|E
40|$|I was {{fortunate}} to have met Terry Beveridge early during my time in graduate school, when my advisor, Francois Morel (a geochemist), {{recognized the importance of}} my having a microbiologist on my PhD advising committee. At the time, I was studying microbial precipitation of arsenic trisulfide (As_ 2 S_ 3) by Desulfotomaculum auripigmentum and needed the help of a geomicrobiologist to take electron micrographs of my samples (Newman et al., 1997). What better person to ask than Terry Beveridge? Not knowing much about what I was doing, I naively went off to Guelph to spend a week working in Terry’s laboratory during the fall of 1994. Little did I know that this would be the start {{of one of the most}} inspirational scientific and personal relationships of my career. From that week forward, I turned to Terry whenever <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about microbiology, and looked forward to his responses: Terry had a way of making me feel like I had hit upon something profound (when in fact my questions were pretty trivial), and his answers not only were thoughtful and informed, but had the effect of getting me to think about other problems that were much more interesting. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} my research, Confidence Intervals in Inverse Regression, was {{introduced}} to me by dr. A. Di Bucchianico, who became my supervisor on this project. I {{would like to take}} some time to thank everybody who, in one way or another, helped me during my 10 months of research. First of all there is my supervisor. He helped me every time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> or problem. And always in the most patient and precise way, in spite of his very busy schedule. I {{would also like to thank}} I. Schreur-Piet from the Chemical Engeneering and Chemistry Department for the datasets that she gave me. I would love to thank my parents who made it possible for me to begin (and finish) my study. Not only financially, but also for their support and love. For this support and love I also want to thank my sister and all my friends, Erik and Wannes in particular, who helped me with some problems, and Barbara for her support. 3 Summary In most regression problems we have to determine the value of Y corresponding to a given value of x.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Dr. Laura Lavine who helped guide me through the entire process. Her patience, {{constant}} encouragement and positive attitude helped to keep me motivated and task oriented both in the classroom {{as well as in the}} field. Laura also would entertain conversations about my future plans on a regular basis as I was unsure what I would do upon completion of my degree. I would also like to thank Dr. Doug Walsh who provided insight into my research as well as suggestions and feedback on how to make my project more complete. Doug would also entertain conversations about my future and in what directions I might take once I finished my degree. I really valued both of their inputs not only in regards to my education and research, I enjoyed every conversation and all their advice. I {{would like to}} thank Dr. Dave Horton for the endless hours of help he provided for my project, especially regarding experimental design and statistical analysis.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the {{following}} individuals for their assistance with completing this project. Thanks to my co-advisor, Jim Almendinger, for his flexibility as I went back and forth with what I wanted to do with my master’s project. He was always there to help me if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> with my courses or my degree program. As I shifted into the emerging contaminants realm and farther from my original goal of groundwater/surface water interaction Jim stuck with me and was a constant pillar of support. Many thanks to my co-advisor, Kristen Nelson, for her assistance in actually making this project happen. I would not have been able to do this without her ideas and insights. Especially for her assistance in the design of the survey and methods, the selection of communities, the coding of the interviews, the analysis of the data, the writing of the final report, and on and on! I learned so much and this project has real world applications, which is something that makes all of Kristen’s projects that she does so valuable. Thank you to my committee member Melinda Erickson for her assistance in narrowing the scope of this project and encouraging me to find something focused and applicable.

I {{could not have}} done it without the support of my colleagues, friends, and family. I want to give a special thanks to my advisor, Dr. Chris Paredis. Chris challenged me to be an independent researcher, but still helped me when I was in need. The gatherings at Chris’s house are some of my fondest memories of my time at Georgia Institute of Technology. I will always admire Chris’s research passion, his competitiveness, and his drive. I’d like to thank my thesis reading committee, Dr. Bert Bras and Dr. Suresh Sitaraman for their valuable feedback with regard to this thesis. I appreciate the constant support and balance that has been provided by the SRL family.

40|$|Photoproduction of η and η ' mesons {{has been}} studied at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) using a tagged photon beam {{incident}} on a hydrogen target with photon energies from the respective production thresholds up to 2. 4 GeV. The photoproduced mesons were identified via missing mass reconstruction using recoil proton momentum and time of flight information. Data were obtained {{in a range of}} s from threshold to 2. 2 GeV for each meson. In this study, differential cross-section measurements for the γp → pη and γp → pη ' reactions are presented, and the results compared to recent data. An isobar analysis of the differential cross-sections is performed. The predicted differential cross-sections from the isobar analysis are used to predict behavior in unmeasured regions of phase space, and to infer total cross sections. For the γp → pη reaction, a value of the S 11 (1535) proton helicity amplitude also was extracted and compared to recent analyses. The data presented greatly extends the energy and angle coverage for differential cross-sections of η photoproduction, and significantly improves the accuracy with which η ' cross sections are known. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First I would like to thank my advisor Barry Ritchie.
