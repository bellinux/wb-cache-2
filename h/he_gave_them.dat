He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them,</b> he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them.</b> This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|The other {{military}} expedition moved to Paraguay, commanded by Manuel Belgrano. Following instructions from Moreno, {{he helped the}} natives at the missions in Corrientes, {{on his way to}} Paraguay. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorized commerce with the United Provinces, removed taxes for ten years, abolished any type of torture, and lifted restrictions on taking public or religious office.|$|E

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> guides and a military escort.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Horsfield {{was chosen}} Player of the Year both by Birmingham's fans {{and by his}} team-mates. His strike {{partnership}} with Stern John proved crucial in the unbeaten run which helped Birmingham reach the First Division play-offs, and he scored the equaliser against Norwich City in the play-off final, which the club {{went on to win}} on penalties to earn promotion to the Premier League. Horsfield had promised a donation to his first club, Athersley Rec, if he ever reached the Premiership; {{a few days after the}} play-off victory <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> £25,000 towards improving their facilities.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October {{the army}} stopped at Curuzú Cuatiá, where Belgrano solved an old border {{conflict}} between Corrientes and Yapeyu. He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he considered them informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E
5|$|Ramachandran {{had dreamed}} of making his own film ever since he {{attended}} a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, If I Were King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he was playing a minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished {{to make a film}} that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> suggestions about the outline of the story and urged them to watch If I Were King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi Mannan. The trio then helped make it look more Indian.|$|E

25|$|The fungi were {{originally}} treated as plants. For {{a short period}} Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon Vermes in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae.

All municipalities were required to make appropriations for schools to provide basic education and solve the illiteracy problem. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts was established during his administration. In 1862, he handed over his position to Salvador Valdés.|$|E
