40|$|AbstractAs the {{cultivated}} land reserve resources, the unutilized land should be exploited to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefits</b> {{based on its}} suitability, meanwhile the exploitation should avoid ecological destruction for the aim of ecological security. Taking of unutilized land in Ji’nan city as a case, the paper established ecological sensitivity analysis model and suitability evaluation model to calculate the exploitation potential of unutilized land. The results showed that limited by environmental factors, the unutilized land located in severely sensitive area and extremely sensitive area accounted for 39. 99 % of the total unutilized land; 65. 87 % of the unutilized land are suitable for {{cultivated land}}. From the spatial distribution, the unutilized land suitable for cultivated land is mainly distributed in the northern plain region and the south area along the Yellow River region...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. IEEE 802. 11 e is {{a fairly}} recent {{amendment}} to the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN standard that supports quality of service (QoS) (or service differentiation) based on medium-access control (MAC) and contention-based channel access. While prior {{research has been done}} regarding the performance of this enhancement, the focus here is on two novel aspects: performance of this standard in a large testbed, and energy consumption of an individual node that relies on this service differentiation. Results demonstrate that to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefits</b> of service prioritization, there should be an even distribution of nodes in each service class to prevent intra-class contention. Furthermore, results also demonstrate the high correlation between energy consumption of a node with its traffic priority class...|$|E
30|$|What {{does this}} {{scientific}} critical realism entail? Though we don’t {{have to be}} aggressive and militant, we should neither force our colleagues to follow our own agenda, nor should use one’s position to push away other agendas. The bottom-line is academic freedom—we want to maintain a wealth of competing positions co-existing with each other. As the Bandung project will continue {{to live with the}} contentious field of centripetal scientific forces, it is of utmost importance for us to be self-protective and always get prepared in order to devise a range of innovative measures and contingency plans to detect, go with and <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefits</b> from the realist-Darwinist dynamics and circumstances generated by the crisscrossing interplays of the other scientists, the administrators, the states and the transnational capitals. In other words, we have to live with them and astutely engage/disengage with/from them strategically, instead of totally rejecting them. In other words, unexpected and undesirable circumstances in scientific endeavours do not only limit and constrain us, one can still choose to go with their flows—circumstances can always be creatively used to re-make possibilities and tap new potentialities to our advantage.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{accurate}} and up-to-date information {{in the construction industry}}. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Real-Time Location Systems (RTLSs) enable tracking and visualization of resources on site and give more awareness to the construction staff in near real time. This research investigates how UWB technology can improve productivity and safety in construction projects. The requirements of the RTLSs are identified in terms of safety and productivity management. The usability of RTLSs in the construction industry is tested by the collection of data from a construction site and organizing them into useful information needed for management. It was found that UWB is an effective tool to monitor construction resources because it provides accurate information in near real time. However, good understanding of the requirements and filtering the data are necessary in order to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefit</b> of <b>the</b> technology for productivity and safety purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Coalbed gas, {{also called}} coalbed methane gas, {{is a kind}} of {{unconventional}} natural gas located in coal and rocks, coexisting with coal and its main ingredient are methane. On different levels of structure, coal bed methane’s adsorption has partition zonality. The gas-bearing of coal seams has relative concentration in different tectonic units, is known as coalbed methane (CBM) enrichment. Influenced by coal rank, coal, rock properties and various geological conditions and other factors, the enrichment has certain regularity. In the study of the coal bed gas enrichment, coal bed gas enrichment especially refers to coal bed methane enrichment. Economic evaluation is that it may analysis reserves financial feasibility and economical rationality for coal seam to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> economic <b>benefit</b> evaluation, by various stages in CBM cost and final production and income situation...|$|R
40|$|Foreword As {{regional}} trading arrangements (RTAs) have spread, enlarged and deepened {{over the}} last decade, they have posed challenges to economists on both intellectual and policy levels. On the former, do RTAs stimulate growth and investment, facilitate technology transfer, shift comparative advantage towards high value-added activities, provide credibility to reform programs, or induce political stability and cooperation? Or do they, on the other hand, divert trade in inefficient directions and undermine the multilateral trading system? The answer is probably “all of these things, in different proportions according to the particular circumstances of each RTA. ” This then poses the policy challenge of how best to manage RTAs in order to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> balance of <b>benefits</b> and costs. For example, should technical standards be harmonized and, if so, how; do direct or indirect taxes need to be equalized; how should RTAs manage their international trade policies in an outward-looking fashion? Addressing these issues is one important focus of the research program of the International Trade Division of the World Bank. It has produced a number of methodological innovations in the traditional area of trade effects of RTAs and is now starting to tackle four new areas of research: the dynamics of regionalism (e. g., convergence, growth, investment, industrial location and migration), deep integration (standards, ta...|$|R
