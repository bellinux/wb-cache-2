5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her <b>feet</b> <b>back</b> on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E
25|$|Test holes drilled during {{restoration}} work in {{the mid-1980s}} revealed that the front {{part of the building}} was built on unconsolidated ground; this was found to be 7 feet in depth and to extend 15 <b>feet</b> <b>back</b> from the High Street. Architect Jim Edleston speculates that this might represent one of the ditches of Nantwich Castle. Fabric with embroidery and leather shoe laces were recovered from the test holes.|$|E
25|$|Fast bowling puts extreme {{pressure}} on the whole body, especially the <b>feet,</b> <b>back</b> and the shoulder. It {{puts a lot of}} body parts under extreme risk of injury. There is a risk of stress fractures in the ankles because of the feet landing hard on the ground at the time of delivery, back spasms and strains because of the arching movement when the ball is delivered and torn ligaments in the shoulder because of the sudden jerk that invariably occurs just before the ball is bowled.|$|E

25|$|The nave is {{the main}} body of the church where most of the worshippers stand, and the {{sanctuary}} is the area around the altar, east of the nave. The sanctuary is usually one to three steps higher than the nave. The Iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary, but is usually set a few <b>feet</b> <b>back</b> from the edge of the top step. This forms a walkway in front of the iconostasis for the clergy, called a soleas. In the very center of the soleas is an extension (or thrust), often rounded, called the ambon, on which the deacon will stand to give litanies during the services.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 2012, {{the final}} day of the season, City and United were level on 86 points, though City had the {{superior}} goal difference by 8. City faced Queens Park Rangers and United faced Sunderland. With five minutes added to the total of 90 minutes, and QPR having a lead of 2–1 with ten men (having had Joey Barton sent off by referee Mike Dean for violent conduct), most of City fans lost their hopes since United were leading against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Manchester City won a corner on 90+2 minutes. David Silva stepped up to take the crucial set piece and as he sent the ball into the middle, Edin Džeko headed into the net to equalise the game. Two minutes passed without any kind of important goal attempts, and right before the last extra minute of added time, Sergio Agüero attempted a one-two with Mario Balotelli. After getting the ball in his <b>feet</b> <b>back</b> again, Agüero skipped past a lunging Taye Taiwo and drove the ball into the back of the net as City triumphed in their campaign. Džeko's headed goal came at 91:15 minutes, while Agüero's came at 93:20, just 13 seconds after United's match against Sunderland had concluded.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{returned}} for the 2014–15 season, his 19th {{season with the}} Lakers, who had replaced D'Antoni with Bryant's former Lakers teammate, Byron Scott. On November 30, 2014, in a 129–122 overtime victory against the Toronto Raptors, Bryant recorded his 20th career triple-double with 31 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. At age 36, he became the oldest NBA player to ever achieve 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game. On December 14, Bryant became the NBA's third all-time leading scorer, passing Jordan (32,292) in a 100–94 win against Minnesota. He played in the first 27 games of the season, averaging team-highs with 26.4 points and 35.4 minutes per game while leading the league with 22.4 shots per game. However, Scott held him out for three straight games to rest after one of his worst performances of the season, when Bryant committed nine turnovers and scored 25 points on just 8-for-30 shooting in a 108–101 loss to Sacramento. He was suffering from soreness in his knees, <b>feet,</b> <b>back,</b> and Achilles tendons, and Scott planned to reduce his workload going forward. Three times Bryant had exceeded 40 minutes in a game, and the coach blamed himself for overloading him after he started the season in such great shape. For the season, Bryant had been shooting just 37 percent from the field, and the team's record was only 8–19. In his second game back after resting, he had 23 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds in a 111–103 win over Denver, and became just the third player in league history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season at age 36 or older. On January 21, 2015, Bryant suffered a rotator cuff tear in his right shoulder while driving baseline for a two-handed dunk against the New Orleans Pelicans. Though he is right-handed, he returned {{to play in the}} game and ran the offense while shooting, dribbling, and passing almost exclusively with his left hand. Prior to the injury, Bryant had been rested in 8 of 16 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for the injury, finishing the season averaging 22.3 points but shooting a career-low 37.3 percent, well below his 45.4 percent career mark to start the season. He was expected to be sidelined for nine months with a return targeted toward the start of the 2015–16 season.|$|E

500|$|Mackinac Island {{has been}} a tourist {{destination}} since the late 19th century. The island was the country's second national park, after Yellowstone, until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park. M-185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as the Chicago Tribune, The Kansas City Star, The Saturday Evening Post, and the Toronto Star. and [...] In 2003, it was named the [...] "best scenic drive" [...] in the state by The Detroit News. In 2008, USA Today named the island one of the [...] "10 great places to get your <b>feet</b> <b>back</b> on the ground" [...] as a car-free destination, highlighting the unique status of M-185 in the process. The magazine Paraplegia News, in an article encouraging its readers to visit Mackinac Island, called the trek around the island on M-185 a [...] "high priority" [...] for visitors. The trip around the island [...] "provides a photo opportunity at every bend in the path", according to the PSA Journal, the official magazine of the Photographic Society of America.|$|E

2500|$|The site {{chosen by}} Mrs Rylands {{was in a}} central and fashionable part of the city, but was awkward in shape and {{orientation}} and surrounded by tall warehouses, derelict cottages and narrow streets. The position was criticised for its lack of surrounding space {{and the fact that}} the valuable manuscript collections were to be housed in [...] "that dirty, uncomfortable city... not enough light to read by, and the books they already have are wretchedly kept" [...] (written in 1901 about the Crawford MSS.) [...] Mrs Rylands negotiated Deeds of Agreement with her neighbours to fix the heights of future adjacent buildings. The permissible height of the building was fixed at just over 34 feet, but it was suggested that it could be taller at the centre if there was an open area around the edges, at the height of buildings that had been demolished to make way for the construction. Champneys incorporated this suggestion into his design, setting the two towers of the facade twelve <b>feet</b> <b>back</b> from the boundary and keeping the entrance block low, to allow light into the library. He designed the building in a series of tiered steps with an almost flat roof to give a 'liberal concession' to the neighbours' 'right to light'.|$|E
2500|$|Photographers find perp walks {{their second}} most-dreaded {{assignment}} after {{going to the}} home of someone who has recently died to ask for a picture. They must wait a long time for a period of a few seconds in which they will be competing with a potentially large group of other photographers and television crews. This presents the possibility that they can be trampled beneath the group, as depicted in the 1994 film The Paper, and the difficulty of photographing a defendant who may be looking downward to keep his face from view. Marty Lederhandler, an Associated Press photographer who worked for {{the last half of the}} 20th century and shot the perp walks of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as David Berkowitz, describes the perp walk as [...] "it's, 'He'll be out in 10 minutes.' You line up. He comes out and into the car, and you've got your picture. Nice." [...] When he began in the years after World War II, Lederhandler says, the media was more polite during perp walks than they are now. [...] "We all had the same lenses those days, and everybody would stand 8 or 10 <b>feet</b> <b>back,</b> and nobody was pushing or shoving." ...|$|E
