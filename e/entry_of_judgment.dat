50|$|In law, {{a motion}} to set aside {{judgment}} is an application to overturn or set aside a court's judgment, verdict or other final ruling in a case.

Generally the motion cannot be based on grounds which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment, thus the motion can only be granted in unusual circumstances, such as when the judgment was procured by fraud which could not have been discovered {{at the time of the}} trial, or if the court entering the judgment lacked the jurisdiction to do so.|$|E

Accordingly, whether or not in the past it was violative of the equal protection clause in the foregoing respect, HRS § 572-1 no longer is.
