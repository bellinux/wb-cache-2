To improve the imperceptibility of embedded data,[24] employed a hearing threshold when embedding {{data in the}} integer wavelet coefficients, while[30] avoided data <b>hiding</b> <b>in</b> silent parts of the audio signal. Even though data <b>hiding</b> <b>in</b> wavelet domain procures high embedding rate, data extraction at the receiver side might not be accurate.|$|R

5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and the warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest <b>hid</b> <b>in</b> the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E

When Gekko betrays them by leaving {{the country with the}} money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in London, capitalized by the $100 million.

40|$|Abstract — Steganography {{involves}} <b>hiding</b> information <b>in</b> another media. PVD based steganography techniques {{uses the}} difference between the pixel values of a pair directly to hide the information. The proposed steganography system modifies the difference value before being used for hiding the information. This makes extraction of <b>hidden</b> data harder <b>in</b> case the steganography system fails. The algorithm divides the cover image in the block of 2 x 3 pixels and calculates average (N) of the bits that can be <b>hidden</b> <b>in</b> five pairs of that block. Thus if the difference value allows M-bits to be <b>hidden</b> <b>in</b> the pair, then only N-bits are <b>hidden</b> <b>in</b> that pair when M>N otherwise M (if M≤N) bits are <b>hidden</b> <b>in</b> that pair. Second level of security is added by converting the secret information into gray code before embedding it in the cover image. The algorithm provides good hiding capacity and improved quality of stego image with two levels of security for the secret information...|$|R
5|$|In his Fabulae, written around 1 A.D. Hyginus {{states that}} King Cinyras of Assyria had a {{daughter}} by his wife, Cenchreis. The daughter was named Smyrna and the mother boasted that her child excelled even Venus in beauty. Angered, Venus punished the mother by cursing Smyrna {{to fall in love}} with her father. After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide, she helped her engage her father in sexual intercourse. When Smyrna became pregnant, she <b>hid</b> <b>in</b> the woods from shame. Venus pitied the girl's fate, changing her into a myrrh tree, from which was born Adonis.|$|E

Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then <b>hid</b> <b>in</b> a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the total}} number of the Robinsons who <b>hid</b> <b>in</b> the ruins of the city only a portion's names and {{locations}} are known. The recognized individuals are mostly the ones who either survived the war themselves or who came into contact with other survivors at some point. As such, the list of the known hideaways is not representative; the majority of the Robinsons died while in hiding, and hence their identities, were never recorded. The table below lists some of those who have been mentioned in the memoirs or other written works on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Other memoirs by the Robinsons include Bunkier (The Bunker) by Chaim Goldstein, Byłem ochroniarzem Karskiego (Karski's Bodyguard) by Dawid Landau, Ukrywałem się w Warszawie : styczeń 1943 – styczeń 1945 (I <b>Hid</b> <b>in</b> Warsaw: January 1943 – January 1945) by Stefan Chaskielewicz, Moje szczęśliwe życie (My Fortunate Life) by Szymon Rogoźinski, and Aniołowie bez skrzydeł (Angels Without Wings) by Czesława Fater.

5|$|Texians began {{crossing}} {{the river at}} about 7pm. Less {{than half of the}} men were mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3 am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began to fire. The noise caused one of the Texian horses to panic and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose. Moore and his men <b>hid</b> <b>in</b> the thick trees until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.|$|E
