25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> in at appropriate prices.|$|E

McNall orchestrated the plan to buy the card. In a 2005 interview, McNall stated his [...] "philosophy was, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> something that is absolutely the best in the world, you'd be okay because there is always another buyer for something at the top end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the fuel}} price at the pump is due to fuel tax. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> {{vegetable}} oil {{at the grocery store}} it does not have such high taxes. [...] So at times people have bought vegetable oil at the store for their cars because it was cheaper. [...] They did this {{in spite of the fact}} that packaging by the gallon adds to the cost and it was illegal to use in a car since no fuel tax had been paid on it.|$|E

2500|$|Officials {{said the}} {{agreement}} with Teodorin showed that the justice department's Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, {{under the auspices of}} which the probe into Teodorin had taken place, had become a key deterrent to foreign kleptocrats. [...] "These cases do send a strong message that if you bring your assets into our country, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> real estate here, we will find them. We will take them," [...] said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, then head of the justice department's criminal division. The 2014 settlement did not affect Teodorin's ability to enter the U.S., which he continued to enjoy because of his diplomatic immunity.|$|E
2500|$|Krens {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of this movement, and became a high-profile figure in the world of art museums, corporate and foundation philanthropy, and the marketing of art to the public. [...] On the subject of branding the Guggenheim, Krens said, [...] "A good brand becomes an article of faith among a consumer audience. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> a BMW or a Mercedes, or stay at a Four Seasons hotel or go the Louvre, you can be pretty much guaranteed a quality experience." [...] During his tenure, Krens has increased the Guggenheim’s endowment to $118 million from $20 million, although he has been known to dip into the endowment to cover operating costs.|$|E

60|$|In the Chinese bazaar are {{hundreds}} of small shops in which a miscellaneous collection of hardware and dry goods are to be found, and where many things are sold wonderfully cheap. You may buy gimlets at a penny each, white cotton thread at four balls for a halfpenny, and penknives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and many other articles as cheap or cheaper than you can purchase them in England. The shopkeeper is very good-natured; he will show you everything he has, and {{does not seem to}} mind <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> nothing. He bates a little, but not so much as the Klings, who almost always ask twice what they are willing to take. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> a few things from him, he will speak to you afterwards every time you pass his shop, asking you to walk in and sit down, or take a cup of tea; and you wonder how he can get a living where so many sell the same trifling articles.|$|E

Our course lay along the Valley of the Rhone; which {{is considered one of the}} least beautiful parts of Switzerland, and perhaps for this reason pleased us, as we had not been prepared to expect much. We saw, before reaching the foot of the Alpine pass at Brieg, two rather celebrated Waterfalls; the one the Pissevache, which has no more beauty than any waterfall one hundred or two hundred feet high must necessarily have: the other, near Tourtemagne, is much more pleasing, having foliage round it, and being in a secluded dell. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> a Swiss Waterfall, choose this one.|$|E
