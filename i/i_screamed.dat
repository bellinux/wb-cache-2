2500|$|On September 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress and singer-songwriter Mandy Moore had been cast as the voice of Rapunzel, and actor Zachary Levi would provide the voice of Flynn Rider. Mandy Moore approached the project through auditioning, when she heard that a film about the story of Rapunzel was being made. Moore later expressed that she had dreamed to be a Disney princess since she was young and said that with the role of Rapunzel, she had fulfilled her [...] "ultimate childhood dream". She described herself as a [...] "girly fan" [...] of Disney classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, and that it was an honor for her {{to be part of this}} [...] "legacy"—the lineage of such Disney icons. Since the film was going to be a musical, it was required that all auditionees had to read several scenes and perform a song of their choice, to ensure that the voice actors could both act and sing. For this singing section, Moore chose [...] "Help Me" [...] by Joni Mitchell, a song that she herself had covered on her fourth studio album, Coverage (2003). Moore revealed that she had to attend several audition sessions and described the experiences as [...] "pretty fun" [...] but didn't put much hope in getting the part because she believed there would be much competition for this role; she just performed her best without any anxiety. When she received a callback from Disney telling that she got the part, Moore described herself as being [...] "over the moon": [...] "I was working in New York at the time. I was with some friends and my husband—and <b>I</b> <b>screamed</b> as soon as I found out the news." ...|$|E
