It was announced on 2 April that Rangers would be de-listed from the AIM stock exchange after failing to find a Nominated adviser within the required period. The SPFL courted controversy with the final day fixtures by moving the Rangers v Hearts match from Saturday to Sunday, {{with the rest of the}} matches proceeding on the Saturday. This could have given Rangers a possible advantage in the chase for second place, however, the SPFL performed a u-turn with all matches being scheduled for early Saturday afternoon As it was, the team failed to be automatically promoted to the Premiership, drawing the final two league matches and finishing a disappointing third in the league. This meant the club faced at least six play-off matches in order to gain promotion. The ticket pricing of these matches attracted controversy. Following a precedent set by Hibernian the previous season, Rangers stated they would allow season ticket holders entry to home matches for free, however, this was rejected by the SPFL. Not to be deterred, Rangers then announced a blanket £5 ticket price offer for all seats. The side successfully negotiated two play-off rounds before crashing to a 6-1 aggregate defeat to Premiership team. The second leg of the play-off final ended in controversy as Rangers Bilel Mohsni and Motherwell's Lee Erwin brawled on the pitch after the match as Motherwell fans invade the pitch to goad the Rangers fans.|$|E

To enhance component-based accounting and charging, the service composition information {{is used to}} match with the corresponding charging structure of a service session.

The study also explores whether the value relevance of annual and interim financial statements {{has changed over}} time. Aim: It explores whether the value relevance of interim financial statements {{is higher than the}} value relevance of annual financial statements. Finally, it investigates whether accounting information published in interim and annual financial statements has incremental value relevance. Setting: Data for the period from 1999 to 2012 were collected from a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Method: The Ohlson model to investigate the value relevance of accounting information was used for the study. Results: The results show that interim book value of equity is value relevant while interim earnings are not. Interim financial statements appear to have higher value relevance than annual financial statements. The value relevance of <b>interim</b> and annual <b>accounting</b> information has remained fairly constant over the sample period. Incremental comparisons provide evidence that additional book value of equity and earnings that accrue to a company between interim and annual reporting dates are value relevant. Conclusion: The study was conducted over a long sample period (1999 – 2012), in an era when a technology-driven economy and more timely reporting media could have had an effect on the value relevance of published accounting information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare the value relevance of published interim and annual financial statements...|$|R

Since industries often have common reporting standards, we also identify the degrees of industry-wide accounting bias that maximize the expected investor payoffs.

The investigation consisted of 31 archaeological interventions in four Sectors inside and adjacent to St. Colman's Church at Portmahomack on Tarbat Ness in Easter Ross, north-east Scotland. Eighteen major structures and eight church buildings were defined and assigned to six Periods, Period 0 (prehistoric), Period 1 (late Iron Age/early Pictish), Period 2 (8 th century/Late Pictish), Period 3 (9 th to 11 th century/Norse and Scottish), Period 4 (Medieval) and Period 5 (Post-Medieval). The programme of investigation ran over the twenty years between 1994 and 2014 and comprised a campaign of evaluation and design (1994 - 1996), excavation (1996 - 2007), survey on the peninsula (1996 - 2002), the restoration of the church and the construction of a museum inside it (1996 - 1999) and a period of analytical study (2008 - 2014).

Evidence is presented for a provisional working date of around 2300 BC for the construction of the Double Bluestone Circle, while it is argued that the history of the site is far more complex than has been allowed for in existing interpretations, with a multiplicity of overlapping and intercutting (though not continuous) events, including substantial late Roman, medieval and early modern activity. The excavated material, and the evidence from the surviving stones, supports the suggestion that bluestones were brought to the site because of their perceived special qualities, perhaps for their supposed healing properties, and that some knowledge of those qualities remained current in later times with the result that in excess of two-thirds of the original bluestone volume has now disappeared...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether the public release of interim financial reports in the United Kingdom conveys information that affects share prices. The major objective for reporting the financial affairs of business enterprises is assumed to be the provision of information to help investors make investment decisions. Interim reports fulfil an important role as a source of frequent information regarding the events in the business enterprise which could give investors some indication about the risks and uncertainties attached to a particular firm's cash flows. Accounting data, therefore, is assumed to be part of the broad market information set that is utilised in establishing prices. The study is carried out in the context of a semi-strong form market efficiency since the announcement of interim earnings puts the information in the announcement in the public domain. An efficient securities market impounds price relevant information into prices instantaneously and without bias. Changes in security prices therefore reflect the flow of information to the market information set utilised in establishing prices. The information in interim earnings can therefore be established if security prices change on the public release of the earnings data barring any other price sensitive information at the same time period. The major finding in the study is that <b>interim</b> <b>accounting</b> reports have information contents which affect price activity on the day of release.

40|$|Event {{studies on}} {{quarterly}} (interim) financial reports have {{found evidence that}} contradicts the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. Normative studies and regulatory body statements on interim reporting have emphasized the predictive function; estimating annual earnings, making forward projections and identifying turning points. With the growth in sophistication of financial markets many investors have abrogated their investment analysis to surrogates, investment sophisticates such as analysts and brokers. There is compelling evidence that sophisticates estimate annual earnings {{on the basis of}} interim disclosures and that individual investors, receiving investment advisory services, bring the results of professional analysis to bear on the investment decisions. ^ This study surveyed New Zealand sophisticates to identify the <b>interim</b> <b>accounting</b> stimuli which sophisticates used in their investment analysis. ^ This study was designed to make a significant contribution to a theory for interim reporting which will make subsequent event studies more meaningful. ^ New Zealand sophisticates manifest an awareness of the predictive function of interim financial reports. The respondents preferred more timely, credible and frequent interim reports prepared on a basis consistent with annual reports and with disclosure of seasonal factors. These preferences should be accorded the urgency they deserve if accounting information is to continue to be considered reliable by investors. The anachronism is that the glossy annual reports, having little significant information content, continue to draw the attention of standard setting bodies while the financial report replete with information of value [...] the interim [...] generally escapes the attention of standard setting bodies. This is alarming because analysts and brokers use interim data to re-cast projected annual earnings and perhaps this interim data has not been prepared on a consistent and comparable basis between periods and between firms. ^ The accounting profession has a duty, perhaps a fiduciary responsibility, to ensure interim reports are reliable, as the impact of investors making investment decisions based upon projections of earnings which in turn were calculated using possibly unreliable interim reports is extremely serious. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to inquire into women’s perceptions and experience of labour pain and how women cope with pain. Using the narrative inquiry methodology, five low risk pregnant Ghanaian women; two nulliparous and three multiparas were purposefully selected. Tape-recorded conversations, writing of field notes and journals were used as the main source of data collection before delivery and within one week after delivery. The women’s perception of pain before and after delivery was used to construct narrative accounts from which the findings of the study were generated. To ensure credibility of each narrative <b>account,</b> the <b>interim</b> narrative <b>accounts</b> constructed by the researcher were sent to the women to read and respond to. The findings revealed that before the labour experience, women perceived labour as a painful experience expected to be endured. Antenatal education on labour pain management was inadequate. Additionally use of pain relief methods was lacking although women expressed need for pain relief. Furthermore the findings revealed inadequate physical and emotional support for women in labour to help cope with labour pain. In conclusion the researcher recommends that midwives in consultation with clients adopt a more active method of assessing labour pain. Also antenatal education on pain relief options must be provided. A more conscious effort to provide support for women in labour should be promoted...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary: {{comments}} welcome Please do not distribute We use a multi-period {{model to}} investigate the effect of <b>interim</b> re-porting on <b>accounting</b> quality. We assume that the manager has a pref-erence for a high stock price. The manager may bias reports in each sub-period. We assume that the enforcement system ties sanctions to the detected gap between total reported earnings and total cash flows at the liquidation stage. We show {{that there are many}} circumstances where interim reporting does not improve <b>accounting</b> quality; sometimes <b>interim</b> reporting even reduces it. The result is driven by the fact that biasing an interim report instead of an annual report goes along with a lower incremental sanction but, if effective, raises the stock price by the same amount. The incentive for increased misreporting with interim re-porting is present in multiple equilibria. If there is an earnings-inflating equilibrium, the above negative effect may be offset by improved time-liness. If there is an earnings-deflating equilibrium, interim reporting unambiguously reduces accounting quality. ∗Corresponding author.

PFBR fuel cycle cost has been worked out by a committee constituted for the purpose. The cost has been worked out for a peak fuel burn-up of 1, 00, 000 MWd/t. The basic components of the PFBR fuel cycle are fabrication cost, storage cost, reprocessing cost and waste management cost. Plutonium and depleted uranium are assumed to be available free of cost.

This may be {{as a result of}} the approaches used in monitoring construction costs. The execution phase of a construction project relies on post-contract cost controlling techniques, such as cash flow monitoring, <b>interim</b> valuations, final <b>account</b> preparation, monitoring activities, site meetings and documentation of activities on site. These techniques are imperative for project success. The purpose of this paper is to assess the various techniques used in post-contract cost control in Nigeria, in terms of their effectiveness. The data was gathered from one hundred and thirty five (135) cost and project managers in Nigeria. The Kendall’s coefficient of concordance was used to test the post-contract cost controlling techniques identified, through an extensive literature review along with one sample run test. The findings reveal that monitoring material cost was the most effective and important technique with a Kendall’s W score of 1. 33 and 11. 44 respectively. Cash flow monitoring had the lowest score of 7. 85 for effectiveness, while variation management had the lowest score of 6. 88 for importance. The effectiveness of the techniques was further evaluated using one sample run test. The findings show that sixteen out of the eighteen techniques were not effective from an overall point of view. The cost controlling techniques used in the Nigerian construction industry are deficient and generally ineffective. Therefore, there is a need to research alternative post-contract cost controlling techniques for the construction industry in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{presents}} an output control approach {{for a class}} of nonlinear MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems. Quadrocopter is chosen to illustrate proposed adaptive control approach based on the high-gain principle, the so-called, “consecutive compensator”. Basic Concepts. The dynamic properties of quadrocopter can be described by a non-linear multi-channel system. Accordingly, {{the first step is}} accomplished by its decomposition, whereby the model is divided into two parts: static conversion and several dynamical channels with one input and one output). After the decomposition, a derivation of the simplified mathematical model of the quadrocopter is carried out; and, in addition to the absolute coordinate system, the local system rigidly connected with the robot is introduced. The appropriate coordinate transformation is taken into <b>account.</b> <b>Interim</b> Results. Decomposition of the mathematical model gives the possibility to create control system in two steps. Firstly, the law is applied; in accordance with it the so-called virtual control actions for each model channel of the quadrocopter are generated. A well-known method of robust control, "consecutive compensator", is used here, successfully well-accepted as the most easily implemented one from an engineering point of view. This method gives the possibility to control an object output under its uncertainty quantification. Secondly, the inverse transformation is performed, resulting in real control actions distributed between the system actuators. We assume that wind disturbance affects each channel of the object. What is more, the values and directions of these disturbances are changed negligibly slow. Thus, we can treat them as unknown constants, subject to compensation. Main Result. We have developed a multi-channel control system for the quadrocopter by different methods (decomposition of the mathematical model and the output of its simplified analogue, coordinate transformation, "consecutive compensator"). The obtained closed-loop system has been successfully simulated and corresponding results have been received...|$|R
40|$|The {{budget process}} in the {{municipal}} organization is a complex institution in which administrations should follow the framework that the municipal council and city council has produced. Administrations then {{have the ability to}} internally distribute the framework how they want in their businesses and can determine their own internal budget process. If there are no clear rules on budget implementation process of the administration this could create differences between the administrations, since the decision makers internally in the administrations may have different views on the budget and budget process. Based on this reasoning, the research questions developed: how can the budget process in a municipality look like and what similarities and differences may exist between various levels of municipal administrations budget process in a local government. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify how the budget process in a municipal administration might look like and also identify how the budget process in a municipality can look like. The purpose of this study also wanted to investigate whether there are any similarities and differences in process between different administrations. To get as good overall picture as possible of the administrations' budget process, this study focused on the financial responsibility of each administration. Interviews were conducted with each budget manager to identify similarities and differences between them. The results from this study are summarized; the first operation in the actual submission of the framework for administrations is the same between them. Differences can then occur in how the internal administrations decide to work out a plan, the setting and action plans within businesses. There have also been differences in both the monitoring and execution. Similarities between administrations have been traced to hierarchism-building activities, <b>interim</b> reports and <b>accounting</b> systems. Differences that emerged have been traced to various administrations of activity, size and responsibilities in the operations. Differences have also been traced to what type of control each municipal administration chosen to use. Validerat; 20110627 (anonymous...|$|R
