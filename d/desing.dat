50|$|The Shashti Poorthi {{celebration in}} this temple is {{associated}} with a legend of <b>Desing</b> Raja. This temple was his tutelary deity (Kuldev). As per local ballads on the legend, Raja Desingh sought the God's blessings before his battle against Sadatullah Khan, the Arcot Nawab, in 1714 AD. But the deity turned his head aside marking his disapproval. However, Raja Desigh in haste proceeded with his war plans and was killed. Dumont notes Raja Desingh had his own loyal Muslim ally, while Sadatullah Khan had Hindu advisors. In the legend and ballads, God Ranganatha worried at the raja's plans to proceed with the battle, appears in front of Desingh's young wife who then seeks his permission for Sati. He tries to dissuade her at first but agrees at her insistence and blesses her and her deceased husband with boons.|$|E
