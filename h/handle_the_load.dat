In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks. Even this was not enough to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance.

5|$|Throughout the 1990s {{there was}} high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units {{lead to the}} {{creation}} of regional, and even local, level groups to help <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> For example, the British National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various regional police forces (the unit was folded into the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in 2006).|$|E
25|$|In July, 2011, GoDaddy {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} blocking DNS queries from some outside DNS servers, {{in order to prevent}} other DNS queries from being too slow. Among other things, this prevents some bots from visiting websites, forcing some search engines to exclude domains hosted with GoDaddy. This policy affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. GoDaddy has refused to comment on the policy or the perception that their servers cannot <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> or they are giving preference to their platinum level customers. It has also interfered with projects that collect Internet statistics.|$|E

[...] MTV commented that it took Ocean [...] "some time to warm up to the crowd" [...] at his debut New Orleans performance, though they noted the performance started the tour to a [...] "promising start". MTV later {{reviewed the}} New York performance on the 27th and called Ocean [...] "an audience charmer". The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica gave a positive review to the same New York performance, calling Ocean a [...] "versatile singer" [...] and writing that [...] "in his elegant, savvy, slightly crooked postsoul, he shifts sneakily between the two topics, singing about love as a byproduct of music and using the subject of music to dig deep about love." ...|$|E

5000|$|Unfortunately an Earth-to-orbit {{rotovator}} {{cannot be}} built from currently available materials since the thickness and tether mass to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> on <b>the</b> rotovator would be uneconomically large.

50|$|The soil's {{capacity}} to retain phosphorus is usually {{large enough to}} <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when septic drain fields are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphates. Phosphates will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of eutrophication to surface waters.|$|E
50|$|Initially, Dreamwidth {{accounts}} {{could only}} be created with an invite code. In December 2011, invite codes were turned off, originally as an experimental temporary measure.

It was decided that Nash would do the GUI work for the editor while Strawn continued to handle the back-end work (such as file reading and course construction).|$|E

Producer Lee decided to create a spin-off series to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> of clips. Sidewalks: Video Nite was born.

The Government of Pakistan decided to build a brand new airport, which opened in 1962. The airport had a specifically built runway and apron to handle aircraft up to the Boeing 747.
