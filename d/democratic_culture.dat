As a setting for <b>democratic</b> <b>culture,</b> Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions, including {{the question of what}} a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a <b>democratic</b> <b>culture.</b> He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
2500|$|After Tiananmen, Deng {{maintained}} his hardline stance, and became increasingly {{critical of the}} reformist wing of the party, accusing them of pursuing an essentially capitalist line. During Deng Xiaoping's [...] "southern tour of 1992", which called for increased economic liberalization, Deng Liqun hit back at the party establishment with a scathing article entitled [...] "Uphold the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." [...] Deng {{was also one of}} the foremost critics of the [...] "Peaceful Evolution theory," [...] the idea that the spread of liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>culture</b> and ideas seen in Western countries will lead to the peaceful and gradual dismantling of the Communist power structure in China. Beginning in 1997, Deng Liqun became increasingly critical of the leadership of Jiang Zemin. In 2001, the 85-year-old Deng published an open letter denouncing the so-called [...] "Three Represents", Jiang's theoretical contribution to Communist ideology which essentially allowed private businesspeople to join the Communist Party.|$|E

2500|$|The Constitution {{begins with}} a preamble, that {{severely}} criticizes the Chadian past, arguing that [...] "years of dictatorship and single party rule have prevented the blossoming of any <b>democratic</b> <b>culture</b> and of multi-party politics", and has favoured the diffusion of [...] "tribalism" [...] and violations of human rights, thus generating [...] "war, political violence, hatred, intolerance and suspicion between the different communities {{that make up the}} Chadian nation." [...] To {{put an end to the}} [...] "institutional and political crisis which has been shaking Chad for more than three decades", the preamble states that the Chadian people are committed [...] "to build a state of law and a united nation founded on public liberties and fundamental human rights, dignity of the human person, and political pluralism, on the African values of solidarity and brotherhood", and also to seek to reach the goal of African unity. In the preamble the right of revolution is provided for: the individuals have not only the right, but also the duty to oppose [...] "any state body that would assume power by force or would exercise it in violation of the present Constitution".|$|E
2500|$|Initially U.S. President Eisenhower was not {{surprised}} by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7s capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts. The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive. Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., {{would be the first}} to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights. Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down. To set a precedent for [...] "freedom of space" [...] before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites, the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own [...] "civilian" [...] satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year. Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind. One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of [...] "impact" [...] upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and <b>democratic</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
60|$|Here was an {{instance}} of a <b>democratic</b> <b>culture</b> growing in isolation, resentful of all external interference. To millions of Americans--especially in our middle western and western states--bent upon social reforms, the European War appeared as an arresting influence. American participation meant {{the triumph of the}} forces of reaction. Colour was lent to this belief because the conservative element which had opposed social reforms was loudest in its demand for intervention. The wealthy and travelled classes organized preparedness parades and distributed propaganda. In short, those who had apparently done their utmost to oppose democracy at home were most insistent that we should embark upon a war for democracy across the seas. Again, what kind of democracy? Obviously a status quo, commercially imperialistic democracy, which the awakening liberal was bent upon abolishing.|$|E
40|$|From my {{previous}} community work, I {{had a sense}} that recognizing the pattern {{of how and why}} public stories emerge in public dialogue was an important part of understanding and strengthening a <b>democratic</b> public <b>culture.</b> I studied the public dialogue of the University of Arizona Faculty Senate in part because I belong to this community. I observed six public meetings of the faculty senate, developed field notes, analytical memos, listened to and transcribed the audiotapes of the faculty meetings, and analyzed the sixteen public stories from those meetings. I developed a new research methodology for understanding public stories in public dialogue which uses combined perspectives of ethnographic, conversational and narrative analysis. I analyzed the research through the lens and audiophone of a critical ethnographer in order to see and hear the public stories in public dialogue and understand the faculty senate's <b>democratic</b> public <b>culture.</b> The results of my research show that the UA faculty senate's public speech is partially demonstrated by public speech which includes public stories in public dialogue. The results show that the <b>democratic</b> public <b>culture</b> of the UA faculty senate is functional, fragile and fragmented. This juxtaposition of characteristics is, to some degree, mediated by public stories which develop as trigger stories. Trigger stories are produced when one of Grice's conversational maxims [...] functioning as norms of interaction [...] quality or quantity is violated. In this research, other norms of interpretation, specifically, equality as moral power or relationship building do not generate trigger stories. This research is important for understanding and strengthening the public speech of the UA faculty senate and its <b>democratic</b> public <b>culture.</b> Also, the method of story and dialogue analysis developed in this research can be applied to other <b>democratic</b> public <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

6000|$|The foreign capitalists {{appealed to}} their governments; {{commercial}} imperialism responded by dispatching military forces {{to protect the}} lives and [...] "property" [...] of its citizens, in some instances {{going so far as}} to take possession of the country. A classic case, as cited by Hobson, is Britain's South African War, in which the blood and treasure of the people of the United Kingdom were expended because British capitalists had found the Boers recalcitrant, bent on retaining their own country for themselves. To be sure, South Africa, like Mexico is rich in resources for which advancing civilization continually makes demands. And, in the case of Mexico, the products of the tropics, such as rubber, are increasingly necessary to the industrial powers of the temperate zone. On the other hand, if the exploiting nation aspire to self-government, the imperialistic method of obtaining these products by the selfish exploitation of the natural and human resources of the backward countries reacts so powerfully on the growth of democracy at home--and hence on the growth of democracy throughout the world--as to threaten the very future of civilization. The British Liberals, when they came into power, perceived this, and at once did their best to make amends to South Africa by granting her autonomy and virtual independence, linking her to Britain by the silken thread of Anglo-Saxon <b>democratic</b> <b>culture.</b> How strong this thread has proved is shown by the action of those of Dutch blood in the Dominion during the present war.|$|E

5000|$|Balkin's {{work on the}} First Amendment {{argues that}} the purpose of the free speech {{principle}} is to promote what he calls a <b>democratic</b> <b>culture.</b> The idea of <b>democratic</b> <b>culture</b> is broader than a concern with democratic deliberation or democratic self-government, and emphasizes individual freedom, cultural participation and mutual influence. A <b>democratic</b> <b>culture</b> is one in which ordinary individuals can participate in the forms of culture that in turn help shape and constitute them as persons. Balkin argues that free speech on the Internet is characterized by two features: [...] "routing around" [...] media gatekeepers, and [...] "glomming on"—non-exclusive appropriation of cultural content that is melded with other sources to create new forms of culture. These distinctive features of Internet speech, he argues, are actually features of speech in general and thus lead to a focus on democratic participation in culture.|$|E

30|$|The {{interpersonal}} power {{relationships between}} marginalised {{students and their}} educators often reinforce the broader societal patterns of exclusion and discrimination (Cummins, 2001). Smyth’s (2006) framework asserts that effective student engagement develops in classrooms with inclusive, compassionate and <b>democratic</b> <b>cultures</b> (and educators). The implementation of the digital storytelling approach aligned with Smyth’s (2006) prescriptions for engagement because it privileged students’ voices and perspectives. The students responded by engaging in critical conversations and completing set tasks on time, behaviours that were reportedly uncharacteristic for this student cohort. These observations {{are consistent with the}} findings of Sleeter’s (2011) review of the outcomes of culturally responsive education programs in the USA.

40|$|This article aims {{to think}} the {{relationship}} {{between public and private}} space from the standpoint of John Locke, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls, in order to show the ambivalence of the value of citizens as members of a liberal community. Since Locke, there is a principle that, in the typically English bourgeois cultural milieu, regulates social laws and behaviors, by praising the adequation of practices of the private forum to those of the public forum. Thus, the basis for thinking about legislation, ethics, and morals are established. This trend of thought culminates in significant variations which, however, always express the dualism of external / internal that is supposedly inherent to ordinary life.

However, we should not gulp any of this foreign material down uncritically, but must treat it as we do our food—first chewing it, then submitting it to the working of the stomach and intestines with their juices and secretions, and separating it into nutriments to be absorbed and waste matter to be discarded—before it can nourish us. To advocate “wholesale westernization” is wrong. China has suffered a great deal from the mechanical absorption of foreign material (Mao 1986, 397).|$|R
