40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of the Joule effect on the non-linear behavior of the transport I-V curves in polycrystalline samples of the manganite Pr 0. 8 Ca 0. 2 MnO 3 by using the crystalline unit cell parameters as an <b>internal</b> <b>thermometer</b> in X-ray and neutron diffraction. We develop a simple analytical model to estimate the temperature profile in the samples. Under the actual experimental conditions we show that the internal temperature gradient or the difference between the temperature of the sample and that of the thermal bath are at the origin of the non-linearity observed in the I-V curves. Consequences on other compounds with colossal magnetoresistance are also discussed. Comment: accepted in Journal of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a forecasting method, with {{the application of}} statistical models Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and a heat conduction model to forecast the temperature field in a buttress block of Itaipu dam. Monthly temperature series in 2010 - 2014 of surface thermometers to block were fitted with cubic splines and the series, now daily, were used as inputs for specific ARIMA models to produce forecasts as outputs. These outputs were used as boundary conditions to the thermal model of the block and this solved by the Finite Element Method (FEM). Obtained thus predicted temperature fields of block. The error MAPE between the values obtained by MEF and the real, in a test point, (where is an <b>internal</b> <b>thermometer)</b> measured {{the performance of the}} forecast of ARIMA models, and this was satisfactory, achieving near 15...|$|E
40|$|The {{intramolecular}} and intermolecular {{vibrational energy}} flow in a polyproline peptide {{with a total}} number of nine amino acids in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide is investigated using time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Azobenzene covalently bound to a proline sequence containing nitrophenylalanine as a local sensor for vibrational excess energy serves as a heat source. Information on through-space distances in the polyproline peptides is obtained by independent Förster resonance energy transfer measurements. Photoexcitation of the azobenzene and subsequent internal conversion yield strong vibrational excitation of the molecule acting as a local heat source. The relaxation of excess heat, its transfer along the peptide and to the solvent is monitored by {{the response of the}} nitro-group in nitrophenylalanine acting as <b>internal</b> <b>thermometer.</b> After optical excitation, vibrational excess energy is observed via changes in the IR absorption spectra of the peptide. The nitrophenylalanine bands reveal that the vibrational excess energy flows in the peptide over distances of more than 20 Å and arrives delayed by up to 7 ps at the outer positions of the peptide. The vibrational excess energy is transferred to the surrounding solvent on a time scale of 10 - 20 ps. The experimental observations are analyzed by different heat conduction models. Isotropic heat conduction in three dimensions away from the azobenzene heat source is not able to describe the observations. One-dimensional heat dissipation along the polyproline peptide combined with a slower transversal heat transfer to the solvent surrounding well reproduces the observation...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{spread of}} {{invasive}} species after their initial introduction is often facilitated by human actions. In some cases, invaders only become established in habitats where dominant native {{species have been}} displaced {{as a result of}} human actions or where humans inadvertently provide essential resources such as food, water or shelter. We investigated if dams that provide water for livestock have facilitated the cane toad 2 ̆ 7 s (Rhinella marina) invasion of a hot semi-arid landscape by providing toads with a resource subsidy and hence refuge from extreme heat and aridity. To determine the relationship between the presence of surface water and habitat occupancy by toads, we surveyed natural and artificial water features for cane toads during the annual dry season. We used radiotracking and acoustic tags to determine whether movement patterns and shelter use of cane toads were focussed around dams. To determine whether dams provide toads with refuge from extreme heat and aridity, we deployed plaster models with <b>internal</b> <b>thermometers</b> to estimate ambient temperatures and toad desiccation rates in shelter sites. To determine whether dams alleviate the stress experienced by toads, we measured plasma corticosterone levels of toads that sheltered in and away from dams. Toads were present in sites with standing water and absent from waterless sites. Most radiotracked toads sheltered within 1 m of water. Toad movements were focussed around water. Toads tracked with passive acoustic telemetry over a 6 -month dry season were highly resident at dams. Plaster models placed in toad shelter sites away from the water lost 27...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{functions}} {{are governed by}} thermodynamics, and animals regulate their body temperature to optimise cellular performance and to avoid harmful extremes. The capacity to sense environmental and internal temperatures {{is a prerequisite for}} the evolution of thermoregulation. However, the mechanisms that enable ectothermic vertebrates to sense heat remain unknown. The recently discovered thermal characteristics of transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP) render these proteins suitable to act as temperature sensors. Here we test the hypothesis that TRPs are present in reptiles and function to control thermoregulatory behaviour. We show that the hot-sensing TRPV 1 is expressed in a crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), an agamid (Amphibolurus muricatus) and a scincid (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii) lizard, {{as well as in the}} quail and zebrafinch (Coturnix chinensis and Poephila guttata). The TRPV 1 genes from all reptiles form a unique clade that is delineated from the mammalian and the ancestral Xenopus sequences by an insertion of two amino acids. TRPV 1 and the cool-sensing TRPM 8 are expressed in liver, muscle (transversospinalis complex), and heart tissues of the crocodile, and have the potential to act as <b>internal</b> <b>thermometer</b> and as external temperatures sensors. Inhibition of TRPV 1 and TRPM 8 in C. porosus abolishes the typically reptilian shuttling behaviour between cooling and heating environments, and leads to significantly altered body temperature patterns. Our results provide the proximate mechanism of thermal selection in terrestrial ectotherms, which heralds a fundamental change in interpretation, because TRPs provide the mechanism for a tissue-specific input into the animals ’ thermoregulatory response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The SRD 1000 device {{supports}} 9 reference temperatures on the PLTS- 2000 using superconductive {{to normal}} transitions of various metals. The evaluation of prototypes by several European metrological institutes {{showed that the}} SRD 1000 concept is convenient and reliable for transferring the scale. Currently a pilot production series is being developed with improved quality for the superconductive transitions of W, Be, Zn and Cd compared to the prototypes. To achieve this we apply better techniques for preparing the metals and add EMI filters to the electrical leads of the devices. We report on technological improvements and present results of calibrations of the devices on the PLTS- 2000. For interpolation between the reference points the sensor will be provided with an <b>internal</b> magnetic <b>thermometer...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rare earth}} vanadates {{have long been}} studied for their {{interesting}} magnetic properties and cooperative Jahn{Teller distortions. In the main, most of this work {{has been carried out}} at temperatures down to 1 K or so (e. g. Gehring and Gehring 1975). In this review NMRON, and other low temperature experiments in the mK regime, are presented and discussed. It will be argued that the low temperature properties of these compounds are just as interesting as their high temperature counterparts. In general, the nuclear and electronic wavefunctions become intermixed, leading to a variety of interesting physical efiects, such as enhanced nuclear magnetism, quadrupolar induced intermediate state re-orientation etc. These efiects have, in turn, spawned new methods for the investigation of magnetic structures, and thermometric detection of NMR both by <b>internal</b> and external <b>thermometers.</b> Several experiments are suggested, including magnetic refrigeration, Mõssbauer, EPR in the … 30 GHz range, in addition to thermometric NMR and NMRON. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence {{of food safety}} practices among food staff working in food establishments in Manitoba is underrepresented {{and has not been}} adequately reviewed and researched. Uncertified food staff are at higher risk of not following food safety practices that can cause contamination of food and result in foodborne illness. The purpose of this quantitative {{study was to determine the}} prevalence of food safety practices among food staff in Manitoba and to determine the relationship between food safety certification and routine health inspections. Pender 2 ̆ 7 s health promotion model and Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s social cognitive theory were used to explain the relationships and associations between variables. Archived data dating from 2012 to 2014 of health inspection reports on 558 food establishments were collected and analyzed using the Manitoba Health Hedgehog database. Chi Square, Pearson Correlation Coefficients, and Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact Tests revealed the association of food safety practices, routine health inspections, and food safety certification. Results indicated no statistical difference between food safety practices and routine health inspections. Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s r analysis revealed a weak relation between routine inspections, <b>internal</b> temperature, <b>thermometer</b> use, and food storage/food protection noncompliance. Logistic regression analysis revealed that food safety certification was not a predictor of food safety practice compliance. This study can provide a bridge to reevaluate current health policies pertaining to food safety practices in Manitoba. This study adheres to the need for social change in establishing and creating prevention programs for food staff. Food safety programs can safeguard the food industry and protect public health from foodborne illnesses...|$|R
40|$|Two studies, first {{qualitative}} and then quantitative, {{were conducted to}} investigate cognitive correlates of racial prejudice in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Bangladesh - home to the decades-long interracial conflicts between indigenous Chakmas and settler Bengalis. The studies were guided by a theoretical framework comprised of cognitive behavioral perspective, indigenous psychology and grounded theory methodology. The first study employed a grounded theory approach to examine cognitive factors, especially thinking patterns and perceptions, likely {{to be associated with}} racial prejudice. In-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with 26 respondents (12 Chakmas, 14 Bengalis), of which 16 had high and 10 had low level of prejudice. Participants were recruited from two districts of CHT through a theoretical sampling strategy. Four key-informants were also interviewed to triangulate the IDI findings. The interview data, analyzed using the qualitative software NVivo, revealed 31 types of race-related thoughts and perceptions of which 24 were associated with racial prejudice (e. g., dehumanization, disapproving contact, apprehension of negative, and victim thinking). The qualitative findings were used to generate empirical hypotheses that were tested in the quantitative study. Thirty-one cognitive factors derived from the qualitative study were reduced to 28 by a number of mergers and divisions. Three contact-related and one emotional factor were later added, making a total of 32 constructs. Thirty-three brief instruments, specific to the CHT, were developed to assess racial prejudice and all those constructs. All instruments demonstrated adequate face validity and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha =. 503 -. 919; inter-item correlation r =. 353 -. 633) except for three (i. e., perception that opposite race is ethnocentric, apprehension of negative, and anchoring). Particularly notable was the 12 -item racial prejudice scale that had high concurrent validity (r = -. 791 with feeling <b>thermometer),</b> <b>internal</b> consistency (Cronbach’s alpha. 916; corrected item-total r =. 471 -. 789), and test-retest reliability (r =. 979, two weeks gap). The quantitative study was conducted on 393 respondents, conveniently recruited from a number of suburban and rural locations of the Khagrachari district in CHT, almost equally represented by the two races (50. 6 % Chakmas, 49. 4 % Bengalis). With an age range of 18 - 87 years (average 37), the participants were mostly male (68. 2 %). Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed ten significant predictors explaining 86 % of the variance in racial prejudice scores (F 11, 381 = 203. 86, p <. 01). Contact disapproval appeared to be the strongest predictor followed by dehumanization, progressive orientation, perspective taking, infrahumanization, overgeneralization, maximization-minimization, emotion towards other race, rumor susceptibility, and perceiving administration as biased. Of these ten factors, three (progressive orientation, rumor susceptibility, and perceiving administration as biased) were found to be quite novel as they were never studied before. Contrary to our general expectation, contact factors (direct-, extended-, and negative contact) failed to predict racial prejudice in the CHT context. This research provides an in-depth examination of race-related attitudes and thoughts within the context of CHT. The four-tiered indigenization model used here should be considered as a methodological approach for future research, as should the large set of contextualized instruments. The results suggest practical implications for prejudice reduction strategies appropriate to the CHT...|$|R
