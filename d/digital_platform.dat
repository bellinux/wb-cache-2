40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> {{has changed the}} way in which Asia-Pacific firms conduct {{international}} transactions, condensing time and geographic distance (Manyika, Lund, & Bughin, 2016). However, the impact of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> on firms’ internationalisation strategy, and in particular entry strategy, is under-researched in current International Business literature. This study aims to explore how <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> in China, and specifically the <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> of Alibaba Group, impact New Zealand small and medium-sized (SMEs) companies’ entry strategies in the Chinese market. Empirical data were collected from four New Zealand companies through semi-structured in-depth interviews. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> impact these firms’ entry strategies through easing entry barriers to some extent, particularly in helping overcome resource constraints and obtain access to networks. However, the participating firms still required local staff as a key part of successful market entry. Therefore, it is concluded that while <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> can help alleviate some entry barriers traditionally faced by SMEs, limitations in human resources still impose challenges on firms in seeking internationalisation in China...|$|R

This paper argues that abstract models of platforms used in current research {{remove some of the}} most important features underlying the inherent complexity of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms.</b> This insight is illustrated with a small study of platforms and their evolving complexity in the music industry. The exploration highlights salient phenomena that a more comprehensive theory of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> should encompass.

40|$|Organizations {{are under}} {{increasing}} pressure to communicate {{their position on}} social responsibility in a changing environment whereby more critical demanding citizens are using <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> to express their opinions about the actions of corporations. These changes, demand a corporate culture of listening, management commitment, responsible action and more effective forms of CSR communication with stakeholders. The emergence of <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> such as Facebook or Twitter provide managers with a mechanism for a dialogue with stakeholders to communicate their CSR initiatives and policies. While these <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> {{have the potential for}} corporations to listen and respond to stakeholder concerns in an open and honest discourse, frequently CSR communication are perceived as serving instrumental goals. This chapter argues that CSR communication through <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> grounded in the ethical premise of responsibility and the concept of dialogue could change this perception. The implications for organizations are that they can enact an ethical premise of CSR using <b>digital</b> <b>platforms</b> if managers adopt a dialogic mindset, and listen and respond to the views of stakeholders. The chapter makes recommendations for an implementation process of the ethical premise of CSR. Finally, our critical reflection provides researchers with a conceptual lens for future empirical studies...|$|R
