40|$|The general aim of our {{discussion}} is to analyze {{what has been}} changed in design process according to introducing the computers technology. For the {{better understanding of the}} design process evolution, we should precisely define start point - the traditional design process. Let's treat it as an iteration game between a designer and user. If we assume that the designing base is a reductive strategy, we can define six stages of it: 1.) To define a need, 2.) To formulate a task, 3.) To synthesize a design proposals, 4.) To analyze and optimize, 5.) To make a presentation. The last stage - the presentation of designing proposals is the main factor of using computers in design process and creating definition of CAD as Computer Aided Drafting. According to this interpretation CAD has included four groups of activities: A.) Geometrical modelling, B.) Analysis, C.) Revision and estimation of design proposals, D.) Technical <b>drawing</b> <b>preparing.</b> Unfortunately it has no connections with another meaning of CAD - Computer Aided Design because concerns every stage of design process except of creation of architectural form. On the other hand, computer enables us to improve the design process by permanent perception of designing forms and dynamic control over the transforming structure. Nowadays thanks to full-function sketching workstation and software like Fractal Design Painter a computer can be useful from the moment when the first line is drawing. It is possible, that the new generation of CAD software - CAD with Personality which connects computer models with picture transformation will enable CAD to be Computer Aided Design...|$|E

50|$|During 1970, a {{group of}} {{recreational}} divers {{under the direction of}} Robert Sexton, an amateur maritime historian, unsuccessfully searched for the wreck site at Moorundie. In 1981, the Society for Underwater Historical Research (SUHR) conducted desktop research followed by underwater searches also without any success. Later in 1982, the SUHR revisited the problem after the discovery of a <b>drawing</b> <b>prepared</b> by Edward Charles Frome in March 1842 showing a vessel moored at Moorundie. The depicted vessel was considered to Water Witch on the basis of research showing that she was the only vessel known to have sailed on the River Murray at the time. In August 1982, the location of the scene drawn by Frome was confirmed on site and a subsequent underwater search of the mooring location revealed a mound of ballast, loose timber and other artefacts.|$|R

Passenger Bryant Allen claims he was manhandled, kicked, stomped, taunted, and threatened. Freddie Helms was hit in the head while lying on the ground. Helms was treated for a laceration {{on the top of his}} head. His bloody baseball cap was turned over to police. King remained in the car. When he finally did emerge, he was reported to have been gagged, to have patted the ground, and waved to the police helicopter overhead. King grabbed his buttocks, which Officer Melanie Singer took to mean King was reaching for a weapon, though he was later found to be unarmed. She drew her pistol and pointed it at King, ordering him to lie on the ground. Singer approached, gun <b>drawn,</b> <b>preparing</b> to effect an arrest.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{description}} and <b>drawing</b> <b>prepared</b> in 1857 on the minaret of Érd. The k. k. Central-Commission zur Erforschung und Erhaltung der Baudenkmale was established on {{the territory of the}} Habsburg Monarchy in 1850. The conservers, the correspondents and the engineers of the k. k. Baubehörde surveyed and pictured several architectural and archaeological monuments and reported on them to Vienna. In this study a drawing and descriptions of the minaret standing at the border of Érd are published. The survey was made for the order of Florian Menapace, Landesbaudirektor, who sent the drawing and the attached remarks to Vienna. Only the drawing can be found nowadays in the Archiv of the Central-Commission, today the Planarchiv of the Bundesdenkmalamt. The drawing was made by Wenzl Kansky. Fortunately, the description prepared by the engineer Alajos Zalay and the Menapace report based on it remained in Hungarian State Archiv in Budapest. They are important sources on the minaret built in the 17 th century and the autor gives an evaluation on it in the study. ...|$|R

5000|$|Adi Shankara, {{in verse}} 1.25 to 1.26, discourages ritual worship and oblations to Deva (God), because that assumes the Self within is {{different}} than Brahman. The [...] "doctrine of difference" [...] is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, [...] "he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman". However, prior to this declaration, Shankara asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by observation of Yamas (ethical precepts) such Ahimsa (non-injury, non-violence to others in body, mind and thoughts). Rituals and rites such as yajna (a fire ritual) can help <b>draw</b> and <b>prepare</b> the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge.|$|R

RIB 311, 1280, CIL XIII 3162). As the text follows almost exactly his earlier inscription from Britain (RIB 311) and it contaminates a Pannonian funerary text from Sárisáp (RIU 769), it is highly likely that the drawing is a 20 th -century forgery. ...|$|R
