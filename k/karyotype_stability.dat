40|$|SummaryWe have {{investigated}} the role of pairing centers (PCs), cis-acting sites required for accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in C. elegans. We find that these sites play two distinct roles that contribute to proper segregation. Chromosomes lacking PCs usually fail to synapse and also lack a synapsis-independent stabilization activity. The presence of a PC on just one copy of a chromosome pair promotes synapsis but does not support synapsis-independent pairing stabilization, indicating that these functions are separable. Once initiated, synapsis is highly processive, even between nonhomologous chromosomes of disparate lengths, elucidating how translocations suppress meiotic recombination in C. elegans. These findings suggest a multistep pathway for chromosome synapsis in which PCs impart selectivity and efficiency through a “kinetic proofreading” mechanism. We speculate that concentration of these activities at one region per chromosome may have coevolved {{with the loss of}} a point centromere to safeguard <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} isolate undifferentiated human induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (UD-hiPSCs) as colonies from contaminating non-pluripotent cells is a crucial step in the stem cell field to maintain hiPSC survival, purity, and <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability.</b> Here we demonstrate significant differences in ‘adhesive signature ’ among UD-hiPSCs, parental cells, partially reprogrammed cells, and differentiated progeny. The distinct adhesive signature of hiPSCs was exploited to rapidly (~ 10 min) and efficiently isolate fully reprogrammed bona fide hiPSCs as intact colonies from heterogeneous reprogramming cultures and differentiated progeny using microfluidics. hiPSCs were isolated in a label-free fashion and enriched to> 95 – 99 % purity and survival without adversely affecting the transcriptional profile, differentiation potential or karyotype of the pluripotent cells. This rapid and label-free strategy is applicable to isolate UD-hPSCs (hiPSCs, hESCs) from heterogeneous cultures during reprogramming and routine cultures and can be expanded to purify stem cells of specific lineages, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes...|$|E
40|$|Actinopterygian fishes {{exhibit the}} {{greatest}} taxonomical diversity of all vertebrates, making this group attractive to address numerous evolutionary questions. The role of molecular cytogenetics and cytogenomics further increase because {{recent advances in}} these fields provide more comprehensive view of fish genome organization and evolutionary dynamics, responsible for this amazing diversity. My Thesis investigates the genome organization of selected fish lineages, namely basal lineages of Actinopterygians (Lepisosteidae and Amiidae) and Teleosts (Pantodontidae), together with "modern" fishes Cobitidae and Coregonidae. I have integrated conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques together with phylogenetic and statistical approaches. Publications included into the Thesis describe e. g. the cytogenetic variability and dynamics in closely related fish species of the genus Coregonus {{and the impact of}} repetitive sequences on the ecological speciation. In contrast to the recent cytotaxonomical diversity of Coregonids, we have detected a <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> associated with asexual reproduction in spined loaches of the genus Cobitis. In the subsequent publication, we describe a surprising AT/GC genome organization in gars (Atractosteus and Lepisosteus) and summarize the knowledge of genome [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Reports differ as {{to whether}} {{reconstitution}} of telomerase activity alone is sufficient for immortalization {{of different types of}} human somatic cells or whether additional activities encoded by other “immortalizing” genes are also required. Here we show that ectopic expression of either the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) or a temperature-sensitive mutant (U 19 tsA 58) of simian virus 40 large-tumor antigen alone was not sufficient for immortalization of freshly isolated normal adult human mammary fibroblasts and endothelial cells. However, a combination of both genes resulted in the efficient generation of immortal cell lines irrespective of the order in which they were introduced or whether they were introduced early or late in the normal proliferative lifespan of the cultures. The order and timing of transduction, however, did influence genomic <b>stability.</b> <b>Karyotype</b> analysis indicated that introduction of both transgenes at early passage, with hTERT first, yielded diploid cell lines. Temperature-shift experiments revealed that maintenance of the immortalized state depended on continued expression of functional U 19 tsA 58 large-tumor antigen, with hTERT alone unable to maintain growth at nonpermissive temperatures for U 19 tsA 58 large-tumor antigen. Such conditional diploid lines may provide a useful resource for both cell engineering and for studies on immortalization and in vitro transformation...|$|R
40|$|Blood {{vessels and}} {{adjacent}} cells form perivascular stem cell niches in adult tissues. In this perivascular niche, a stem cell with mesenchymal characteristics was recently identified in some adult somatic tissues. These cells are pericytes {{that line the}} microvasculature, express mesenchymal markers and differentiate into mesodermal lineages but might even {{have the capacity to}} generate tissue-specific cell types. Here, we isolated, purified and characterized a previously unrecognized progenitor population from two different regions in the adult human brain, the ventricular wall and the neocortex. We show that these cells co-express markers for mesenchymal stem cells and pericytes in vivo and in vitro, but do not express glial, neuronal progenitor, hematopoietic, endothelial or microglial markers in their native state. Furthermore, we demonstrate at a clonal level that these progenitors have true multilineage potential towards both, the mesodermal and neuroectodermal phenotype. They can be epigenetically induced in vitro into adipocytes, chondroblasts and osteoblasts but also into glial cells and immature neurons. This progenitor population exhibits long-term proliferation, <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> and retention o...|$|E
40|$|Allozyme genetic {{distances}} and variability were studied by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis in 6 species of marsupials from North and South America representing 4 different genera. Twenty-one presumptive loci were assessed {{in a total}} of 151 specimens. Only 1 of 21 loci was found to be monomorphic in the whole sample. Phenetic and cladistic interspecific analysis coincided in rendering two sharply dif-ferentiated subgroups: one comprising species of the genus Didelphis Linnaeus, 1758 (. D. marsupialis Linnaeus, 1758, D. virginiana Kerr, 1792 and D. albiventris Lund, 1840), and the other comprising Monodelphis dimidiata (Wagner, 1847), Lestodelphys halli (Thomas, 1921) and Lutreolina crassicaudata (Desmarest, 1804). No relationships between the bradytelic condition, the <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> of this group, and genetic variability were found. On the other hand, the existence of species with brief life span such as Lestodelphys halli and Monodelphis dimidiata (Marmosini tribe) and species with long life span (Didelphini tribe) allowed us to test the hypothesis which correlates generation-time with genetic variability. We conclude that a general explanation for genetic variability must involve more than just generation-time...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work we studied the <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> during {{long-term}} in vitro maintenance in 3 cloned strains of Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and a hybrid between both species. Only the L. (V.) peruviana strain showed an unstable karyotype, even after subcloning. Four chromosomes were studied in detail, {{each of them}} characterized by homologous chromosomes of different size (heteromorphy). Variations in chromosome patterns during in vitro maintenance were rapid and discrete, involving loss of heteromorphy or appearance of additional chromosome size variants. The resulting pattern {{was not the same}} according to experimental conditions (subinoculation rate or incubation temperature), and interestingly, this was associated with differences in growth behaviour of the respective parasites. No change in total ploidy of the cells was observed by flow cytometry. We discuss several mechanisms that might account for this variation of chromosome patterns, but we favour the occurrence of aneuploidy, caused by aberrant chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our results provide insight into the generation of karyotype diversity in natural conditions and highlight the relativity of the clone concept in parasitology...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{karyotype}} {{description of the}} agro-predatory ant species Megalomyrmex incisus Smith, 1947 (Myrmicinae, Formicidae), and chromosome counts of its host Mycetophylax conformis (Mayr, 1884) (Myrmicinae, Formicidae) from geographically distinct populations. Colonies of both species were sampled from coastal areas of Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil, and transferred to the laboratory. Metaphase spreads were prepared from the cerebral ganglia of defecated larvae. The slides were examined and pictures of the best metaphases were taken. The chromosome number for M. incisus was 2 n= 50 and n= 25. The karyotype of this species consists of 20 metacentric and 5 submetacentric pairs. Thus, the karyotype formula of the diploid set was 2 K= 40 M + 10 SM and a fundamental number FN= 100. The host species M. conformis has 2 n= 30 and the karyotype consisting of 11 metacentric and 4 submetacentric pairs. The karyotype formula was 2 K= 22 M + 8 SM, and a fundamental number FN= 60. M. incisus showed a slightly higher chromosome number, placed at the marginal range of the known distribution of haploid karyotypes of the Myrmicinae. The chromosome number and chromosomal morphology of M. conformis corresponded to those of previously studied populations, suggesting its <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{taxonomy}} of Cyperaceae is complex, with genera like Cyperus harboring species complexes. We analyzed the genetic similarity between Cyperus ligularis L. and C. odoratus L. based on DNA fingerprinting and cytogenetics. Significative genetic differentiation (G ST = 0. 363) and low gene flow (N m = 0. 877) indicated a clear genetic {{distinction between the}} two species. Moreover, the clustering analysis showed two distinct genetic groups, suggesting a lack of evidence for hybridization. The phenogram revealed two different lineages, and although all individuals of C. odoratus were collected from plots close to each other, they possessed greater genetic diversity than that observed among individuals of C. ligularis, which were sampled over a wider geographic range. Variation in chromosome number within the two species exhibited the opposite pattern, indicating greater <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> in C. odoratus with 2 n = 72 and 2 n = 76, while the diploid number for C. ligularis varied from 2 n = 66 to 88. The lower genetic variation in C. ligularis may be a result of the founder effect associated with seed dispersion and clonal reproduction. Field observations and analysis of reproductive biology should enrich the understanding of the genetic structure of the investigated populations and their role in successional processes...|$|E
40|$|The African gerbils of {{the genus}} Tatera are {{widespread}} and abundant throughout sub-Saharan Africa. There is still today a certain controversy concerning the taxonomy of these rodents and very few {{attempts have been made}} to assess their systematic relationships. The present paper introduces findings based on the partial sequences of cytochrome b (495 bp) and the 16 S rRNA (469 bp) mitochondrial genes of six (T robusta, T nigricanda, T vicina. T leucogaster. T valida, and T kempi) species together with two additional taxa. We also report the karyotypes of T vicina and T leucogaster. We propose that T ricina should be considered as a valid species and show the monophyly of the rabusta species group, with the exclusion of T leucoguster, Our results show there is a different chromosomal evolutionary pattern within the two major lineages, which is recognizable through molecular phylogenetics. One is characterized by <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> and the other by a considerable number of chromosomal rearrangements. The lineage divergence coincides with the formation of the East African Rift, The processes that led to the origin of the East African species seem to be related to the subsequent climatic changes, which caused cyclic contraction and expansion of the savannah biomes. Furthermore, geological activities that characterized East Africa during Plio- Pleistocene may also have contributed to lineage divergence. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of human {{pluripotent stem cells}} (hPSCs) needed for therapeutic applications can be grown in scalable suspended microcarrier cultures. These microcarriers are coated with animal or human extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to promote cell growth and maintain pluripotency. However, the coating is costly for large-scale cultures and it presents safety risks. This study demonstrates that hPSCs can be propagated on noncoated positively charged cellulose microcarriers in a serum-free medium containing the ROCK inhibitor, (Y 27632) or myosin inhibitor, Blebbistatin. In {{the presence of these}} two inhibitors, myosin phosphatase 1 and myosin light chain 2 were dephosphorylated suggesting that reduced myosin contractility is responsible for hPSC survival and growth on ECM coating-free microcarriers. Cells propagated on the noncoated microcarriers for 12 passages maintained their pluripotency and <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability.</b> Scalability was demonstrated by achieving a cell concentration of 2. 3 × 106 cells/mL with 11. 5 -fold expansion (HES- 3) in a 100 -mL spinner flask. The differentiation capability of these cells toward three primary lineages is demonstrated via in vitro embryoid bodies and in vivo teratoma formations. Moreover, the directed differentiation to polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule-positive (PSA-NCAM+) neural progenitors produced high cell concentrations (9. 1 ± 1. 2 × 10 6 cells/mL) with a cell yield of 412 ± 77 neural progenitor cells per seeded HES- 3 and a PSA-NCAM expression level of 91 ± 1. 1 %. This defined serum- and coating-free scalable microcarrier culturing system is a safer and less expensive method for generating large amounts of hPSCs for cell therapies...|$|E
40|$|The intra-S phase {{checkpoint}} protein complex Tof 1 /Csm 3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae antagonizes Rrm 3 helicase {{to modulate}} replication fork arrest {{not only at}} the replication termini of rDNA but also at strong nonhistone protein binding sites throughout the genome. We investigated whether these checkpoint proteins acted either antagonistically or synergistically with Rrm 3 in mediating other important functions such as maintenance of genome stability. High retromobility of a normally quiescent retrovirus-like transposable element Ty 1 of S. cerevisiae is a form of genome instability, because the transposition events induce mutations. We measured the transposition of Ty 1 in various genetic backgrounds and discovered that Tof 1 suppressed excessive retromobility in collaboration with either Rrm 3 or the F-box protein Dia 2. Although both Rrm 3 and Dia 2 are believed to facilitate fork movement, fork stalling at DNA-protein complexes {{did not appear to be}} a major contributor to enhancement of retromobility. Absence of the aforementioned proteins either individually or in pair-wise combinations caused karyotype changes as revealed by the altered migrations of the individual chromosomes in pulsed field gels. The mobility changes were RNase H-resistant and therefore, unlikely to have been caused by extensive R loop formation. These mutations also resulted in alterations of telomere lengths. However, the latter changes could not fully account for the magnitude of the observed karyotypic alterations. We conclude that unlike other checkpoint proteins that are known to be required for elevated retromobility, Tof 1 suppressed high frequency retrotransposition and maintained <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> in collaboration with the aforementioned proteins...|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [40306023, 40576064]The orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial fish species in Southeast Asia. Although it has been widely cultured in China, basic cytogenetic information on this species is limited. In this study, we used Giemsa-staining, C-banding, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs), and repetitive sequencing (including 5 S, 18 S, and (TTAGGG) (n)) techniques to analyze the cytogenetics of the orange-spotted grouper. Our results showed that the karyotypic formula of the orange-spotted grouper was 2 n = 2 SM + 46 A, NF = 50. C-banding patterns indicated that centromeric regions of all chromosomes were C-band positive except in pair no. 12. Heterochromatin was detected at the subcentromeric regions of both pair no. 5 and no. 12. In the smallest chromosome pair, no. 24, either the entire short arm or the end of the short arm was C-band positive. After Ag-NORs staining, one pair of nucleolar organizer regions was observed on the short arm of pair no. 24. FISH results showed that 5 S rDNA was located at a pair of A-type chromosomes, while 18 S rDNA appeared at the same location in the short arm of pair no. 24 where Ag-NORs were detected. The telomeric sequence (TTAGGG) (n) detected by FISH was located at both ends of each chromosome. Some of these chromosomal markers showed species-specific variations. Thus, despite the apparent <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> (2 n = 48), several microstructural chromosome changes must have occurred during chromosomal evolution, resulting in significant changes in the karyotype structure during the evolutionary diversification of the genus Epinephelus...|$|E
40|$|Karyotypes {{of natural}} and {{synthesized}} Aegilops species were analyzed. Feulgen's squash method was used to stain somatic chromosomes in root tips. Relative chromosome length, arm ratio, and centromeric index were used as quantitative characteristics in identifying chromosomes. In order to compare karyotypes of species at different ploidy levels, the relative length (A) of a chromosome is defined as follows: A_d=(100) /(2) (L_i^) /(Σ__iL_i^) : 2 x A_t= 100 (L_i^) /(Σ__iL_i^ +Σ__iL_i^) : 4 x A_h=(300) /(2) (L_i^) /(Σ__iL_i^ +Σ__iL_i^ +Σ__iL_i^) : 6 x {{in the case of}} Σ__iL_i^ 〓Σ__iL_i^ (j≠k). While, the modified relative length (A´) is given by A´=(100) /(2) (L_i^) /(Σ__iL_i^), j=X and Y, in the case of Σ__iL_i^ ≫Σ__iL_i^ (or Σ__iL_i^ ≪Σ__iL_i^). Thus, the numerical value of the relative length of chromosome i of the X or Y genome is the same for diploid and tetraploid taxa. In general our results agree with those of Chennaveeraiah and confirm those of Kihara. Karyotypes of synthesized species resemble those of natural species with the same genome constitution. Since the reciprocal combinations C^uC^uS^lS^l-S^lS^lC^uC^u and C^uC^uM^uM^u-M^uM^uC^uC^u have similar karyotypes, it is concluded that the invisible tendency of the satellites on sat-chromosomes of the S^l and M^u genomes is not cytoplasmically controlled. <b>Karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> may be expressed as follows: D>C, D>M, C^u>S, C^u>M, C^u≧C, C^u≧D. There are many modified genomes in the M group, namely, M, M^u, M^o, M^c etc. Their karyotypes differ slightly from other. These modified genomes are divided into two groups according to their karyotypes. The first group is the M type, which consists of M^o, M^b, M^c, M^t, M^cr and M^j.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that human umbilical cord stromal stem cells (UCSSCs) are bio-equivalent to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. However, {{little is known about}} their tissue origin or in vivo functions, and data on their expansion properties are limited due to early senescence in the culture methods described to date. Methods: UC sections and cultured UCSSCs were analyzed with a panel of 12 antibodies. UCSSCs were grown in low-FCS containing medium at 5 % or 21 % oxygen and were assayed for their clonogenic properties, <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability,</b> expression of specific cellular markers, and multi-lineage potential. UCSSC contractile properties were evaluated by using collagen gel contraction assays under cytokine stimulus. Results: Immunohistochemistry studies showed that the UCSSCs were derived from the Wharton's jelly and not from the vascular smooth muscle sheath of the blood vessels. UCSSC growth properties were increased in a 5 % oxygen atmosphere in comparison to normoxic culture conditions. In both culture conditions, UCSSCs were CD 14 -, CD 34 -, and CD 45 -negative while expressing high levels of CD 73, CD 90 and CD 105 and maintaining their differentiation potentialities. UCSSCs expressed alpha smooth muscle actin and behaved as functional myofibroblasts when cellular contraction was challenged with appropriate stimuli. Conclusions: UCSCs are mesenchymal stem cells that reside in the perivascular area of Wharton's jelly and are phenotypically and functionally related to myofibroblasts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{rates and}} {{patterns}} at which nucleotide substitutions occur vary significantly across the genome sequence of vertebrates. A prominent {{example is the}} difference in the rate of evolution of functional sequences versus nonfunctional (neutrally evolving) sequences, which is explained by the influence of natural selection on functional sequences. However, even within neutrally evolving sequences there is striking variation in the rates and patterns of nucleotide substitutions. Unraveling the underlying processes that induce this variation is necessary to understand the basic principles of variation in neutral substitution profiles, which in turn is crucial for the identification of regions in the genome where natural selection acts. This research question builds the main focus of the present thesis. I have studied the causes and consequences of variation in different patterns of nucleotide substitutions. In particular, I have investigated substitutional strand asymmetries in mammalian genes and could show that they result from the asymmetric nature of DNA replication and transcription. Comparative analysis of substitutional asymmetries then suggested that the organization of DNA replication and the level of transcription are conserved among mammals. Further, I have examined the variation in CpG mutation rate among human genes and could show that beside DNA methylation also GC content plays a decisive role in CpG mutability. In addition, I have studied the signatures of GC-biased gene conversion {{and its impact on the}} evolution of the GC isochore structure in chicken. By comparison of the results in chicken to previous results in human I found evidence that <b>karyotype</b> <b>stability</b> is critical for the evolution of GC isochores. Finally, beside the empirical studies, I have performed theoretical investigations of substitution rates in functional sequences. More precisely, I have explored the temporal dynamics of estimates of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates dN/dS in a phylogentic-population genetic framework. ...|$|E
