500|$|Biographer David Henderson {{describes}} Hendrix's guitar tone as [...] "at {{the razor}} edge of distort". [...] However, individual notes are still clear, {{as well as}} the harmonically more complex chords, even with the use of extreme overdrive for the time. [...] The tension is maintained until the guitar solo, which [...] "arrives as something of a release rather than a further racking up of the atmosphere." [...] It is also when Hendrix first introduces the Octavia, coupled with a Fuzz Face distortion unit. [...] Whitehill describes the solo as [...] "almost sound likes he's playing a blues raga. [...] He starts out playing in the Mixolydian mode and then he goes right into the blues side. [...] The Octavia has the effect of a sitar, kind of like Ravi Shankar meets B.B. King." [...] During the song's outro, the guitar part recorded at 7½ <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (ips) played back at 15 ips, is combined with the Octavia, further extending the guitar's upper frequency range. [...] Henderson describes it as [...] "an uncanny piercing tone that takes off, Eastern-sounding beyond the range of the guitar" [...] and, according to Shadwick, [...] "gives the impression that the guitar notes are flying off into the ether." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{floating}} portion is then retracted {{under the}} O'ahu {{side of the}} fixed bridge {{at a rate of}} 14 <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> to create a 650ft navigation channel. [...] The entire process takes 25 minutes to complete. [...] Retraction of the movable span is accomplished by two hydraulic winches located on the control pier on the southeast side of the bridge. Two-inch steel cables are used to connect each winch to the pontoon: one is connected to the far and the other to the near end of the pontoon. [...] The opening sequence consists of activating the warning lights and bells, lowering the warning gates and barriers, lifting the transition spans on both sides, and operating the winches. [...] During the opening, winch connected to the west end pulls while the winch on the east end pays out. [...] As the span nears fully open, the winch speeds are slowed to allow the pontoon to stop without snapping a cable. [...] This entire operation is operated from a control room on the east section of the bridge at the highest point and monitored from wireless cameras. [...] 36 post-tensioned straddle bents span 60-ft under the elevated span to form a pocket for the movable span to rest while the bridge is open.|$|E

50|$|A common {{misunderstanding}} is that (a) the quanta of {{the fields}} act {{in the same manner}} as (b) the charged particles that generate the fields. In our everyday world, charged particles, such as electrons, move slowly through matter with a drift velocity of a fraction of a centimeter (or <b>inch)</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> but fields propagate at the speed of light - approximately 300 thousand kilometers (or 186 thousand miles) a second. The mundane speed difference between charged particles and field quanta is on the order of one to a million, more or less. Maxwell's equations relate (a) the presence and movement of charged particles with (b) the generation of fields. Those fields can then affect the force on, and can then move other slowly moving charged particles. Charged particles can move at relativistic speeds nearing field propagation speeds, but, as Einstein showed, this requires enormous field energies, which are not present in our everyday experiences with electricity, magnetism, matter, and time and space.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. The wide signal {{bandwidth}} attainable with the 960 <b>inch</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> longitudinal tape transport, combined with {{high density recording}} at about 20, 000 bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> provide a multichannel 20 Megabit/second recorder with a 64 : 1 time expansion capability. The tape transport mechanism consists of two solid, flangeless tape packs placed {{in direct contact with}} a large capstan. Stability of the tape movement is achieved by use of a control system which provides instantaneous adjustment of the pack contact forces as a function of direction, velocity, acceleration and pack diameter. This results in full versatility when programming the transport motion. The high density digital signal is phase encoded and processed through the recorder as an analog signal, then is demodulated using a phase lock loop to recover the clock. The sample and hold phase comparator controls a VCO at a fixed nominal frequency, followed by a divider. This configuration permits operation at all bit frequencies in a 128 : 1 range and allows the clock to coast through a 50 bit dropout without bit slip. Demonstrated bit error rate is 10 ⁻⁶ maximum...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{contraction}} ratio and chamber {{pressure on the}} combustion performance of a gaseous-hydrogen-liquid-oxygen combustor was investigated analytically and experimentally. The experiment was conducted with a "two-dimensional" gaseous-hydrogen-liquid-oxygen engine of about 150 -pound thrust. The contraction ratio was varied from 1. 5 to 6 by changing the nozzle throat area. This variation resulted in a chamber pressure variation of about 25 to 120 pounds <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b> The experimental results were corrected for heat transfer to the engine walls and momentum pressure losses. The experimental performance, as evaluated in terms of characteristic exhaust velocity, was 98 percent of theoretical at contraction ratios greater than 3 but decreased very rapidly at smaller contraction ratios. The heat-transfer rate increased with increasing contraction ratio and chamber pressure; it was about 1 Btu <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> at a contraction ratio of 1. 5 and increased to about 3 at a contraction ratio of 6. The combined effects of contraction-ratio and chamber-pressure changes on performance were investigated analytically with a mixing model and a vaporization model. The mixing model predicted very poor mixing at contraction ratios below 3 and almost perfect mixing at higher contraction ratios. The performance predicted by the vaporization model {{was very close to}} 100 percent for all contraction ratios. From these results, it was concluded that the performance was limited by poor mixing at low contraction ratios and chamber pressures...|$|R
