5000|$|Linear plasma railguns place extreme {{demands on}} their insulators, as {{they must be}} an <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating,</b> plasma-facing vacuum <b>component</b> which can {{withstand}} both thermal and acoustic shocks. Additionally, a complex triple joint seal may exist at the breech of the bore, which can often pose an extreme engineering challenge. Coaxial accelerators require insulators only at the breech, but the plasma armature in that case {{is subject to the}} [...] "blow-by" [...] instability. This is an instability in which the magnetic pressure front can out-run or [...] "blow-by" [...] the plasma armature due to the radial dependence of acceleration current density, drastically reducing device efficiency. Coaxial accelerators use various techniques to mitigate this instability. In either design, a plasma armature is formed at the breech. As plasma railguns are an open area of research, the method of armature formation varies. However, techniques including exploding foils, gas cell burst disk injection, neutral gas injection via fast gas valve, and plasma capillary injection have been employed.|$|R

However, so far {{most of the}} preparation methods for polymer/BN nanocomposites have usually caused difficulties in the material post processing. Here, an in situ grafting approach is designed to fabricate thermally conductive, <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> and post-melt processable polystyrene (PS) /BN nanosphere (BNNS) nanocomposites by initiating styrene (St) on the surface functionalized BNNSs via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. For example, at a St/BN feeding ratio of 5 : 1, an enhancement ratio of 1375 % is achieved in comparison with pure PS. Moreover, the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites show a desirable weak dependence on frequency, and the dielectric loss tangent of the nanocomposites remains at a very low level. More importantly, the nanocomposites can be subjected to multiple melt processing to form different shapes.

40|$|In present electronics, {{mostly the}} charge of {{electrons}} {{is used as a}} carrier of information. However, {{the charge of}} electrons is not the only property of electrons; each electron also carries angular momentum, called spin. In the past decades, the possibility of using the spin of electrons as a carrier of information has been studied in the research-field called spintronics (abbreviated from spin-based electronics). These investigations lead to first applications, for example magnetic memory (MRAM), where the processing of information is based on spintronic phenomena. Recently, researchers have shown that spin-information also can be transported and stored by an <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> material. This is not possible when using the charge of electrons. Employing an <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> material for spintronic devices opens up the possibility to study purely spin-related phenomena, as charge transport in these materials is prohibited. Eventually this may lead to the development of faster and more energy-efficient devices. The work presented in this thesis shows experimental results on the read-out of magnetic information from an <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> magnetic material, here yttrium iron garnet. Different methods for read-out have been studied, varying from externally exciting the magnetic state (called spin pumping) to full electrical detection, by making use of a newly discovered phenomenon called spin-Hall magnetoresistance. Also a thermal effect, the spin-Seebeck effect (the spin-analogue of the Seebeck effect), is detected.
