40|$|AbstractThe Human Proteome Organisation — Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) {{has been}} working for ten years on the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>standardised</b> <b>formats</b> that facilitate data sharing and public database deposition. In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards — mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, {{which can be used}} to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from [URL] This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Computational Proteomics in the Post-Identification Era.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the Earth’s global gravity field {{is one of the}} main tasks of Geodesy: it serves as a reference for geodesy itself, and it provides important information about the Earth, its interior and its fluid envelope for all geosciences. Thus, it is important to make the models of the global gravity field available to the public as products of geodesy. This becomes increasingly important as time variations of the global gravity field can be measured with better and better spatial and temporal resolution. The calculation of the different functionals of the geopotential (e. g. : geoid, gravity anomaly, gravity disturbance, equivalent water height) from a defined global model, on a specified grid and with respect to a defined reference system, is far from being trivial and a responsibility of geodesy too. Additionally, it is important to make the spatial structure and temporal variability of the global gravity field available to the general public in a graphic vivid manner. In particular for temporal gravity models, aspects of consistency in processing, reference frame, and parameterization are becoming more and more important. ICGEM has been established in 2003 as a new service under the umbrella of the new International Gravity Field Service (IGFS) as one of six centres.

40|$|Representing {{annotated}} spoken corpora The annotation {{of linguistic}} resources has long-standing traditions (see Cole et al., 2010). The other chapters {{of this book}} make clear that the production of annotated resources is a laborious, time-consuming, andexpensive task.

40|$|With {{the growing}} ubiquity of mobile devices, {{new ways of}} sensing context and the {{emergence}} of the mobile Web, digital storytelling is escaping the confines of the desktop and intertwinging in new and interesting ways with the phys- ical world. Mobile, location aware, narrative systems are being applied to a range of areas including tour guides, educational tools and interactive fiction. Despite this there is little understanding of how these applications are related or how they link with existing hypertext models and theory. We argue that location aware narrative systems tend to follow three patterns (canyons, deltas and plains) and {{that it is possible to}} represent all of these patterns in a conceptual sculptural hypertext model. Our model builds on a general sculptural mechansim (of pre-conditions and behaviours) to include locality and narrative transitions as first class elements, opening the possibility <b>of</b> <b>standardised</b> viewers, <b>formats,</b> and hybrid stories. We show how existing structures can be mapped onto this conceptual sculptural model, and how narratives defined in the model can take advantage of open data sources and sensed contextual data.

40|$|Open source {{technologies}} {{for geospatial data}} have dramatically expanded over the last decade. A new mapping application for the Gazetteer for Scotland (GfS) was created by following the Open Web Mapping approach, which describes how the combination of geospatial Open Standards and open source software (OSS) allows to create powerful and sophisticated map mashups. The study of {{the pros and cons}} of Open Web Mapping revealed the benefits of this approach for the GfS’s mapping application. The use of OpenLayers as the client-side technology proved to have several advantages which are discussed in this paper. The paper also focuses on the development of a modern and appropriate User Interface (UI) design for the GfS. User surveys and a critical evaluation of both the old and new map interface helped to develop a mapping application which combines important UI design principles and the implementation of new map layers and functionality. An analysis of the interests and browsing behaviours of the GfS users enabled the creation of a customised set of information and functionality.

In Australia, health organisations have promoted an absolute risk approach, thereby raising the question <b>of</b> suitable <b>standardised</b> <b>formats</b> for risk communication. Methods Sixteen formats of risk representation were prepared including statements, icons, graphical formats, alone or in combination, and with variable use of colours. All presented the same risk, i. e., the absolute risk for a 55 year old woman, 16 % risk of CVD in five years. Preferences for a five or ten-year timeframe were explored. Australian GPs and consumers were recruited for participation in focus groups, with the data analysed thematically and preferred formats tallied. Results Three focus groups with health consumers and three with GPs were held, involving 19 consumers and 18 GPs. Consumers and GPs had similar views on which formats were more easily comprehended and which conveyed 16 % risk as a high risk. A simple summation of preferences resulted in three graphical formats (thermometers, vertical bar chart) and one statement format as the top choices. The use of colour to distinguish risk (red, yellow, green) and comparative information (age, sex, smoking status) were important ingredients. Consumers found formats which combined information helpful, such as colour, effect of changing behaviour on risk, or comparison with a healthy older person. GPs preferred formats that helped them relate the information about risk of CVD to their patients, and {{could be used to}} motivate patients to change behaviour. Several formats were reported as confusing, such as a percentage risk with no contextual information, line graphs, and icons, particularly those with larger numbers. Whilst consumers and GPs shared preferences, the use of one format for all situations was not recommended. Overall, people across groups felt that risk expressed over five years was preferable to a ten-year risk, the latter being too remote. Conclusions Consumers and GPs shared preferences for risk representation formats. Both groups liked the option to combine formats and tailor the risk information to reflect a specific individual's risk, to maximise understanding and provide a good basis for discussion. </p...|$|R
