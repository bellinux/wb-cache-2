25|$|In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health {{stated that}} meprobamate, glutethimide, <b>ethinamate,</b> ethchlorvynol, {{methyprylon}} and chlordiazepoxide as drugs whose usefulness {{can hardly be}} questioned. However, Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction, like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ethinamate</b> (Valamin, Valmid) is a short-acting carbamate-derivative sedative-hypnotic {{medication}} used {{to treat}} insomnia. Regular use leads to drug tolerance, and it is usually not effective for more than 7 days. Prolonged use can lead to dependency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethinamate</b> (1-ethynylcyclohexanone carbamate) is {{synthesized}} {{by combining}} acetylene with cyclohexanone and then transforming the resulting methanol into a carbamate by the subsequent reaction with phosgene, and later with ammonia. Some lithium metal or similar {{is used to}} make the acetylene react with the cyclohexanone in the first step.|$|E
