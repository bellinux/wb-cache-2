The antiparallel deoxyribose all-purine <b>duplexes</b> associate specifically through Watson-Crick pairing, violating the nucleobase size-complementarity pairing convention found in Nature. Sequence-specific recognition displayed by these structures makes the <b>duplexes</b> suitable, in principle, for information storage and replication fundamental to molecular evolution in all living organisms. All-purine <b>duplexes</b> can be formed through association of purines found in natural ribonucleosides.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{determine}} the ability of <b>duplex</b> sonography to intraoperatively detect technical problems with renal artery reconstructions. Design: retrospective evaluation of a standard protocol. Patients and methods: the outcome of intraoperative <b>duplex</b> was compared with postoperative angiography, surface <b>duplex,</b> MRA, echo or direct inspection in case of re-exploration in 77 renal artery reconstructions in 62 patients. These included six extracorporeal reconstructions, eight and 17 reconstructions with an artery and autogenous vein respectively, 10 renal artery re-implantations in the aorta (prosthesis), 32 endarterectomies and four reconstructions of kidney transplant vessels. Results: intraoperative <b>duplex</b> was normal in 67 / 73 reconstructions with sufficient data. In six cases technical problems were revealed by intraoperative <b>duplex</b> and the reconstruction was re-explored. After re-exploration intraoperative <b>duplex</b> was normal in all cases. Confirmatory studies demonstrated normal results in 61 / 64 reconstructions with normal intraoperative <b>duplex</b> and abnormal results in 6 / 6 reconstructions with technical problems revealed by intraoperative <b>duplex.</b> Three reconstructions with normal intraoperative <b>duplex</b> occluded as demonstrated by angiography less than 2 weeks after surgery. Conclusions: renal <b>duplex</b> sonography is a valuable method available for intraoperative detection of technical problems.
