25|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Jaypaw and Leafpool must go to WindClan to take Onestar {{a message}} from Firestar about not {{shedding}} unnecessary blood in a battle over something that may never happen, while Hollypaw convinces Mousefur and Firestar to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> RiverClan. When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk about the future and how they want things to go.|$|E

But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E

Williams made benefit appearances to support literacy and women's rights, along with appearing at benefits for veterans. He was a regular on the USO circuit, where he traveled to 13 countries and performed to approximately 100,000 troops. After his death, the USO thanked him [...] "for all he did for {{the men and women of}} our armed forces." ...|$|E
2500|$|Booth was, of course, enlisted on {{the side}} of the Union, and longing to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the cause in which she so ardently believed. She did not feel herself {{qualified}} to act as a nurse in the military hospitals, not only having that inherent antipathy to the sight of sickness and suffering common to many poetic natures, although willing to endure all that such sight and association could bring, but being, through her life among books, too inexperienced in such work to venture assuming its tasks with their consequent risk of life. Still something she must do. That she had sent her brother to the front, scarcely more than a boy, as he was, seemed not half enough and, when, while burning with eagerness she received an advance copy of Count Agenor de Gasparin's [...] "Uprising of a Great People," [...] she at once saw her opportunity in bringing heartening words to those in the terrible struggle.|$|E

60|$|If I {{had been}} in a state of mind to attend to trifles, this would have {{explained}} the reason why the cook had heard Miss Jillgall crying.

With infinite difficulty I assumed a momentary appearance of composure, and suggested that Miss Jillgall's foreign friends might have <b>done</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her.|$|R
60|$|And then, {{simultaneously}} with her conviction {{that he was}} a criminal, came the certainty that he was the man she loved.

Once there, she found that {{there was nothing to do}} and nothing to say. She put her hand on his, and stood waiting helplessly for she knew not what.|$|R

6000|$|Thus, I {{conceive}} that I {{have shown}} {{cause for the}} {427} opinion that Dr. Wace's challenge touching the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's Prayer, and the Passion was more valorous than discreet. After all this discussion, I am still at the agnostic point. Tell me, first, what Jesus can be proved to have been, said, and done, and I will say whether I believe him, or in him,[115] or not. As Dr. Wace admits that I have dissipated his lingering shade of unbelief about the bedevilment of the Gadarene pigs, he might have <b>done</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> mine.

The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from [...] "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" [...] to [...] "Do unto others as they do unto you" [...] so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. The Book of Lucifer also contains a list of [...] "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" [...] (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven [...] "Infernal Names", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.|$|R
