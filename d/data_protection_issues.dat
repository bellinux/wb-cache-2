At the same time, the absolute confidentiality of the 'seal of the confessional' is upheld.|$|E

Currently any search done on an Irish-registered vehicle will not reveal if the vehicle has been reported stolen. Around 10,000 cars are stolen every year in Ireland and about 2,000 of these are never recovered. Currently buyers of used cars have no way to check against theft records, and hundreds of buyers a year lose an average of from €10,000 to €20,000 after buying stolen cars which are then discovered and returned to their original owner.
