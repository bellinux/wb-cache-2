5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines.

As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E

Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E

25|$|Physical water {{scarcity}} results from inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic {{water scarcity}} results from poor {{management of the}} sufficient available water resources. According to the United Nations Development Programme, the latter is found more often to {{be the cause of}} countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.|$|E
25|$|The wild pig (Sus scrofa) {{can take}} {{advantage}} of any forage resources. Therefore, it can live in virtually any productive habitat that can provide <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> sustain large mammals such as pigs. If there is increased foraging of wild pigs in certain areas, it can cause a nutritional shortage which can cause the pig population to decrease. If the nutritional state returns to normal, the pig population will most likely rise due to the pigs' naturally increased reproduction rate.|$|E
25|$|Another measurement, {{calculated}} {{as part of}} a wider assessment of water management in 2007, aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. Physical water scarcity is where there is not <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.|$|E

25|$|A dam which impounds a large {{reservoir}} {{can store}} and release a correspondingly {{large amount of}} energy, by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters. Limitations do apply to dam operation, their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers. For example, there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants, nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night, dams are still required to release <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> maintain adequate river levels, whether electricity is generated or not. Conversely there's a limit to peak capacity, which if excessive could cause a river to flood {{for a few hours}} each day.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scenarios}} {{suppose that}} geological changes diverted the Sutlej towards the Indus and the Yamuna towards the Ganges, following which the river {{did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> reach the sea any more and dried up in the Thar desert. Active faults {{are present in the}} region, and lateral and vertical tectonic movements have frequently diverted streams in the past. The Saraswati may have migrated westward due to such uplift of the Aravallis. According to geologists Puri and Verma a major seismic activity in the Himalayan region caused the rising of the Bata-Markanda Divide. This resulted in the blockage of the westward flow of Sarasvati forcing the water back. Since the Yamunā Tear opening was not far off, the blocked water exited from the opening into the Yamunā system.|$|E
25|$|SL-1 was {{constructed}} with a main central control rod that {{was capable of}} producing a very large excess reactivity if it were completely removed. The extra rod worth was {{in part due to}} the decision to load only 40 of the 59 fuel assemblies with nuclear fuel, thus making the prototype reactor core more active in the center. In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor prompt critical within a time estimated at 3.6 milliseconds. That was too fast for the heat from the fuel to get through the aluminum cladding and boil <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> fully stop the power growth {{in all parts of the}} core via negative moderator temperature and void feedback.|$|E

25|$|Officials in {{neighbouring}} countries accused Indonesian {{officials of}} doing {{nothing to stop}} the fires, though forestry ministry {{officials said they had}} firefighters working to douse the blazes on state-controlled land. However, they conceded, most of the fires were on private land. Indonesia planned to deploy its military to aid fire fighting effort. To recruit more people to man the fire line, the government offered two days off for civil servants who volunteered for fire duty. But the country lacked equipment for fighting forest fires, having aeroplanes that were too small to carry <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> douse the fires. In a bid to obtain bigger aircraft, the government leased two Beriev Be-200 aircraft from Russia, which are capable of skimming over water and taking on loads for sustained firefighting efforts. The planes, which will be flown by Russians and maintained by Russian technicians, were due to begin operations on 1 November.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation canals are {{classified}} into principal canals (Rayah), main canals (first level canals), branch canals (second level canals), distribution canals (Mesqas, or third level canals) and irrigation ditches (Merwas). Flow in {{the principal and}} main canals is continuous; in the branch and distribution canals it is on a rotation basis. However, the government supports a process of converting some of the lower-level canals gradually to continuous flow. Farmers pump water from the mesqas to irrigate fields (lift: about 0.5-1.5 m). A Mesqa typically serves an area of 50 to 200 feddan (20 to 80 hectares). In areas {{where there is no}} formal operational structure for proper water distribution, the tail-end users usually are not getting <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> maintain crops. Water user associations have been formed beginning in the 1990s to better distribute water among farmers on a mesqa and to rationalize pumping, with the aim of reducing water abstraction, pumping costs and to increase yields.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E
