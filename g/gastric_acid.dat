5|$|<b>Gastric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{secretions}} of the stomach. It consists mainly of hydrochloric acid and acidifies the stomach content to a pH of 1 to 2.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{produces}} <b>gastric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{a strongly}} acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction {{of the upper}} and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. In addition, the acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm helps this sphincteric action.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Many metal sulfides are so {{insoluble}} {{in water}} that they are probably not very toxic. Some metal sulfides, when exposed to a strong mineral <b>acid,</b> including <b>gastric</b> <b>acids,</b> will release toxic hydrogen sulfide.|$|R
25|$|B12 {{taken in}} a low-solubility, non-chewable {{supplement}} pill form may bypass the mouth and stomach and not mix with <b>gastric</b> <b>acids,</b> but acids are not necessary for the absorption of free B12 not bound to protein; acid is necessary only to recover naturally-occurring vitamin B12 from foods.|$|R
50|$|Should the {{organism}} pass the mouth, the stomach {{is the next}} line of defense. The vertebrate stomach contains hydrochloric <b>acid</b> and <b>gastric</b> <b>acids,</b> which makes its pH level around 2. In this environment, the acidity of the stomach helps kill most microorganisms that try to invade the body through the gastric intestinal tract.|$|R
5|$|<b>Gastric</b> <b>acid</b> acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
5|$|With major {{production}} {{starting in}} the Industrial Revolution, hydrochloric acid {{is used in the}} chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, and MDI/TDI for polyurethane. It has numerous smaller-scale applications, including household cleaning, production of gelatin and other food additives, descaling, and leather processing. About 20 million tonnes of hydrochloric acid are produced worldwide annually. It is also found naturally in <b>gastric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> production.|$|E
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a {{condition}} in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the esophagus. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as heartburn. Long-term contact between <b>gastric</b> <b>acids</b> and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus minimizing their effect on the esophagus.|$|R
50|$|Secretory {{components}} {{wrap around}} two IgA units {{joined by a}} J chain protein fragment, resulting in a >--< configuration, {{with each of the}} two antigen binding regions of the two constituent y-shaped antibodies exposed. One identified function of secretory components is to protect IgA antibodies from degradation by the <b>gastric</b> <b>acids</b> and enzymes of the digestive system. This property is especially important in the transfer of immune system components during breastfeeding.|$|R
50|$|Unlike erythromycin, {{clarithromycin}} is acid-stable, so can {{be taken}} orally without having {{to be protected from}} <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> It is readily absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, clarithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of clarithromycin are released; its concentration in the tissues can be over 10 times higher than in plasma. Highest concentrations are found in liver, lung tissue, and stool.|$|R
5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
25|$|After {{night time}} {{administration}} of bromazepam a highly significant reduction of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> secretion occurs during sleep {{followed by a}} highly significant rebound in <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> production the following day.|$|E
25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Reduced secretion of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> and pepsin {{produced by}} H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. <b>Gastric</b> <b>acid</b> is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely {{if the person is}} rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E
500|$|Inflammation of the {{esophagus}} {{is known as}} esophagitis. Reflux of <b>gastric</b> <b>acids</b> from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications (such as bisphosphonates), and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis. Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the yeast candida albicans that may occur {{when a person is}} immunocompromised. [...] the cause of some forms of esophagitis, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, is not known. Esophagitis can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection.|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{aspiration}} of enteral feedings: A {{model for}} prevention As a cost-saving measure, more adults now receive complex {{home health care}} services each year. One such service is the safe administration of enteral feedings through a gastrostomy tube for adults with significant neurologic impairments. These adults {{are at high risk}} for pulmonary aspiration caused by gastroesophageal reflux of formula and <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> Analysis of the etiol-ogy and pathophysiology of pulmonary aspiration, pneumonitis, and pneumonia helps to estab-lish a care plan for prevention.

40|$|Chemical erosion is {{the loss}} of {{superficial}} tooth structure by chemical action in the continued presence of demineralizing agents. This can be prominent in patients with oral habits such as constant citrus ingestion (like lemon chewing), chlorinated swimming pool water or gastrointestinal problems that produce repeated exposure of teeth to <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> In this case report, a multidisciplinary approach to restore the severe wear due to dental erosion by proper techniques and materials was presented. (Eur J Dent 2008; 2 : 110 - 114) Key words: Dental erosion; Citric acid; Non-carious cervical lesion...|$|R
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): The PPIs include {{omeprazole}} (Prilosec, Losec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix, Pantoloc), and esomeprazole (Nexium). The reduced secretion of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> and pepsin {{produced by}} PPIs can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, but not supplemental vitamin B12. <b>Gastric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is needed to}} release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Reduced vitamin B12 levels may be more common with PPIs than with H2 antagonists, {{because they are more}} likely to produce achlorhydria (complete absence of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> secretion). Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely, unless PPI therapy is prolonged (2 years or more) or dietary vitamin intake is low. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of PPIs for prolonged periods.|$|E
25|$|Secretion of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> or {{alkaline}} {{pancreatic juice}} from the ectopic mucosa leads to ulceration {{in the adjacent}} ileal mucosa i.e. peptic or pancreatic ulcer.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{relationship}} has been stated between the degree and duration of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> inhibition, as measured by monitoring of the 24-hour intragastric pH in pharmacodynamic studies, {{and the rate of}} healing and symptom relief reported.|$|E

50|$|The metacercariae are eaten {{along with}} raw or undercooked fish. The cysts of the metacercariae are {{gradually}} digested {{by the human}} <b>gastric</b> <b>acids,</b> and upon reaching the small intestines, the entire cyst is lost. The free metacercariae penetrate the intestinal mucosa and enters the bile ducts. It takes 1-2 day for migration into the bile ducts. They start feeding on the bile secreted from the liver, and gradually grow. They become adult in about a month, and start laying eggs. The average lifespan of an adult fluke is 30 years. An individual fluke can produce 4,000 eggs in a day.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Altered gastric {{physiology}} in albino rats {{fed with}} aqueous extract of Gnetum africana and Talinum triangulare (water leaf) {{was investigated in}} <b>gastric</b> hydrochloric <b>acid</b> secretion {{for the period of}} 7, 21 and 28 days. The results of mean acid output in the test group that received Gnetum Africana extract alone was significantly increased P < 0. 05 on day 7 as compared with control group which was same on days 21 and 28. However, the mean acid output was significantly de-creased, P < 0. 05 when compared with control on day 7 and 21 respectively. In the test group that received Gnetum afri-cana and Talinum triangulare extract there was significant decrease in <b>gastric</b> Hydrochloric <b>acid</b> after days 7 and 21 and more significantly decreased in 28 days, P < 0. 01 as compared with control. But there was decrease mean hydrochloric acid output in Gnetum africana and Talinum triangulare mixture than Gnetum africana alone. It is concluded that increase consumption of Gnetum africana has the tendency of increasing <b>gastric</b> Hydrochloric <b>acid</b> secretion and likely associated pathology; gastric ulcer...|$|R
25|$|Increasing {{rates of}} community-acquired CDI are {{associated}} with the use of medication to suppress <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> production: H2-receptor antagonists increased the risk 1.5-fold, and proton pump inhibitors by 1.7 with once-daily use and 2.4 with more than once-daily use.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{block the}} gastric {{hydrogen}} potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) and inhibit <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> secretion. These drugs {{have emerged as}} the treatment of choice for acid-related diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease.|$|E
25|$|Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a {{group of}} drugs whose main action is a {{pronounced}} and long-lasting reduction of <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> production. Within the class of medications, {{there is no clear}} evidence that one agent works better than another.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of ascorbic <b>acid</b> in <b>gastric</b> juice may protect against gastric carcinoma and peptic ulceration. This {{study examined the}} effect of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) on the secretion of ascorbic <b>acid</b> into <b>gastric</b> juice by measuring fasting plasma and <b>gastric</b> juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations in patients with and without the infection and also before and after its eradication. <b>Gastric</b> juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations in 19 H pylori positive patients were significantly lower (median 2. 8, range 0 - 28. 8 micrograms/ml) than those in 10 H pylori negative controls (median 17. 8, range 5. 6 - 155. 4 micrograms/ml) (p < 0. 0005) despite similar plasma ascorbic acid concentrations in both groups. The median <b>gastric</b> juice:plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> ratio in the H pylori positive patients was only 1. 16 (range 0. 02 - 6. 67), compared with a median ratio of 4. 87 (range 0. 76 - 21. 33) in H pylori negative controls (p < 0. 01). In the patients with H pylori infection {{there was a significant}} negative correlation between the severity of the antral polymorphonuclear infiltrate and <b>gastric</b> juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations (correlation coefficient - 0. 52, p = 0. 02). After eradication of H pylori in 11 patients, <b>gastric</b> juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations rose from 2. 4 (0 - 12. 8 micrograms/ml) to 11. 2 (0 - 50 micrograms/ml) (p = 0. 01). The median gastric juice: plasma ascorbic acid ratio also increased from 1. 33 (0. 05 - 6. 67) to 2. 89 (0. 01 - 166) (p = 0. 01). In conclusion, the high <b>gastric</b> juice:plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> ratio in H pylori negative subjects shows active secretion of ascorbic <b>acid</b> into <b>gastric</b> juice. Secondly, H pylori infection causes a reversible lowering of <b>gastric</b> juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations, which may predispose to gastric carcinoma and peptic ulceration...|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} {{exactly how the}} graphic scenes in the video were produced. Many people believe that the {{apparent}} feces is composed of a mixture of food substances such as chocolate, coffee cream, peanut butter. One theory states that the woman cleaned her bowels before introducing the substance. Her rectum then instantly rejected it, creating the appearance of defecation. Some speculate that the vomit is real, but was regurgitated before reaching the stomach and does not contain any <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> In the video, {{the majority of the}} vomit does not enter the mouths. However, some believe that all of these scenes were created with advanced computer graphics.|$|R
5000|$|William Broadhurst Brierley studied spore {{germination}} in the 1910s. He {{determined that}} fully grown ("ripe") ascospores can be germinated {{after a lengthy}} resting period, but a pretreatment with <b>gastric</b> <b>acids</b> reduced the time required. The time that mature spores need to germinate is correlated to the thickness and color of the spore wall. Treating [...] "unripe" [...] ascospores and chlamydospores with gastric juice did not decrease their germination time, and decreased their viability the longer they were treated. These observations confirmed and extended those already published by Ward; taken together, {{the results indicate that}} the spores need to pass through the digestive tract of a cow to be viable.|$|R
25|$|Esophageal bezoars in the nasogastrically fed {{patients}} on mechanical ventilation and sedation {{have been reported}} to be due to precipitation of certain food types rich in casein, which get precipitated with <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> reflux to form esophageal bezoars.|$|E
25|$|When {{the stomach}} is empty, ghrelin is secreted. When the stomach is stretched, {{secretion}} stops. It acts on hypothalamic brain cells both to increase hunger, {{and to increase}} <b>gastric</b> <b>acid</b> secretion and gastrointestinal motility to prepare the body for food intake.|$|E
25|$|Jīnyė are {{ultimately}} extracted from food and drink, and constitute {{the raw material}} {{for the production of}} xuě; conversely, xuě can also be transformed into jīnyė.

25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|R
50|$|Ulcers of the {{duodenum}} commonly {{occur because}} of infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. These bacteria, {{through a number}} of mechanisms, erode the protective mucosa of the duodenum, predisposing it to damage from <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> The first part of the duodenum is the most common location of ulcers as it is where the acidic chyme meets the duodenal mucosa before mixing with the alkaline secretions of the duodenum. Duodenal ulcers may cause recurrent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and are often investigated using a urea breath test to test for the bacteria, and endoscopy to confirm ulceration and take a biopsy. If managed, these are often managed through antibiotics that aim to eradicate the bacteria, and PPIs and antacids to reduce the gastric acidity.|$|R
25|$|Unlike erythromycin, telithromycin is acid-stable and can {{therefore}} be taken orally while being protected from <b>gastric</b> <b>acids.</b> It is fairly rapidly absorbed, and diffused into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, telithromycin is actively transported {{to the site of}} infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of telithromycin is released. The concentration of telithromycin in the tissues is much higher than in plasma.Telithromycin fulfills a role that has arisen due to the rise of microbial resistance to existing macrolides and appears to be effective against macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The defining differentiating characteristic of the ketolides as opposed to other macrolides is the removal of the neutral sugar, L-cladinose from the 3 position of the macrolide ring and the subsequent oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl to a 3-keto functional group.|$|R
