5|$|From 1749, iron from Pentyrch was {{initially}} {{transported to the}} works using pack-horses, then tub boats were used on the Taff passing onto the <b>feeder</b> via a lock at Radyr Weir. Parts of this lock can still be seen beside the <b>feeder</b> sluice. In 1815 the tub boats were discontinued and a tramway built along the Taff. There is a public picnic site by the Radyr weir.|$|E
50|$|Bottom <b>feeders</b> are not {{necessarily}} detritivores, {{although there are many}} that are. Some bottom <b>feeders</b> graze along the bottom, feeding on plant material. Other bottom <b>feeders</b> may feed on other bottom <b>feeders,</b> and thus are carnivores.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there is}} {{a vast array of}} bird <b>feeders,</b> <b>feeders</b> are {{typically}} placed into three categories: tube, hopper, and platform. [...] Tube <b>feeders</b> are long and slender and are typically constructed of plastic. Hopper <b>feeders</b> resemble small houses, and are made of a combination of metal, wood, and plastic. Platform <b>feeders</b> are large trays that are often covered and are typically made of wood or plastic.|$|R

5|$|The {{fossil record}} in this member shows the base was {{dominated}} by deposit <b>feeders,</b> while the upper layers were dominated by filter <b>feeders.</b> This can be correlated to the lithology: the finer sediments of the shales {{at the base of}} this member would contain abundant adherent organic matter for deposit <b>feeders,</b> but would tend to foul the gills of filter <b>feeders</b> when suspended; the coarser sediments of the sandstones at the top would have contained less organic matter to support deposit <b>feeders.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electronic}} <b>feeders</b> on performance of growing boars and gilts was evaluated. Yorkshire boars and gilts (n= 475) {{were randomly assigned}} to pens with single-space FIRE (electronic) <b>feeders</b> and pens with fivespace SMIDLEY <b>feeders.</b> Pigs began and ended test at an average body weight of 39 and 116 kg. Over the whole test period, pigs on electronic <b>feeders</b> did not differ significantly in growth rate, backfat thickness, and loin muscle area from pigs on commercial <b>feeders.</b> They did, however, use less feed and converted this more efficiently. Further inspection of growth and feed intake curves revealed that gilts on electronic <b>feeders</b> used less feed and grew slightly slower, in particular during early growth, but no differences were found for boars. Results indicate that electronic <b>feeders</b> may cause a genotype by environment interaction for gilts but not for boars...|$|R
40|$|Supplementary {{feeding of}} garden birds {{generally}} has benefits for both bird populations and human wellbeing. Birds have excellent colour vision, and show preferences for food items of particular colours, but research into colour preferences associated with artificial <b>feeders</b> {{is limited to}} hummingbirds. Here, we investigated the colour preferences of common UK garden birds foraging at seed-dispensing artificial <b>feeders</b> containing identical food. We presented birds simultaneously {{with an array of}} eight differently coloured <b>feeders,</b> and recorded the number of visits made to each colour over 370 30 -minute observation periods in the winter of 2014 / 15. In addition, we surveyed visitors to a garden centre and science festival to determine the colour preferences of likely purchasers of seed <b>feeders.</b> Our results suggest that silver and green <b>feeders</b> were visited by higher numbers of individuals of several common garden bird species, while red and yellow <b>feeders</b> received fewer visits. In contrast, people preferred red, yellow, blue and green <b>feeders.</b> We suggest that green <b>feeders</b> may be simultaneously marketable and attractive to foraging birds...|$|R
30|$|Now that socio-demographic {{data has}} been incorporated, higher {{potential}} peaks are exhibited at certain <b>feeders</b> than previously predicted.

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of <b>feeder</b> lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro <b>feeder</b> lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E

5|$|After Ma-on {{attained}} {{tropical storm}} status, the Tiyan, Guam National Weather Service office issued {{a tropical storm}} watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan. It was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning after Ma-on became a typhoon, which was canceled after the storm passed the islands to the north. The typhoon produced high waves in Guam, as well as gusty winds and precipitation in an outer <b>feeder</b> band.|$|E
50|$|In {{the high}} shore, the {{substrate}} is dry with more leaf litter accumulation; however, deposit <b>feeders</b> are abundant.

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} and parasite faunas of 464 specimens of demersal fishes in 14 species were examined from the Carson Canyon {{region of the}} upper continental slope of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. Individual species tended to feed either primarily on benthic invertebrates or on pelagic food items. Most pelagic predators also fed on benthopelagic organisms. Prevalence of parasites was 46 percent, {{with an average of}} 5. 5 worms per fish. Prevalence of parasites was higher in benthic <b>feeders</b> (53. 1 %) than in pelagic fedders (28. 9 %). Relative abundance by group among benthic <b>feeders</b> was: Digenetic Trematoda 5. 8 %. Nematoda 53. 1 % and Acanthocephala 40. 9 %. Percent occurrence by group among pelagic <b>feeders</b> was: Digenetic Trematoda 27. 8 %, Nematoda 72. 2 % and Acanthocephala 0 %. There were more species of benthic <b>feeders</b> (5) than pelagic <b>feeders</b> (3), but pelagic <b>feeders</b> were more abundant (pelagic 70. 9 %, benthic 20. 5 %). Benthic <b>feeders</b> were on average larger (x̄ = 270. 6 g) than pelagic (x̄ = 130. 6), but pelagic <b>feeders</b> represented a larger proportion of the biomass (pelagic 43. 3 %, benthic 25. 94 %) ...|$|R
5000|$|Oriole <b>feeders</b> {{usually have}} nectar {{containers}} {{made of glass}} or plastic, which are designed to attract the orioles.

40|$|Accounts of {{the diverse}} views {{expressed}} on the food of the grey mullets by various authors have been discussed {{in the works of}} Sarojini (1951), Pillay (1953) and Thomson (1954). The grey mullets have been described as plankton <b>feeders,</b> herbivores, omnivores, slime <b>feeders,</b> foul <b>feeders,</b> bottom <b>feeders,</b> etc. Despite the extensive records on the subject, in this group of fishes, there are very few accounts based on studies {{for an extended period of}} time in respect of different size-groups from different environs...|$|R
40|$|Nectar {{concentration}} and composition varies widely between plant species. Nectarivorous birds that associate floral characteristics with nectar quality {{may be able}} to avoid less rewarding flowers and therefore forage more efficiently. We assessed the abilities of amethyst sunbirds (Chalcomitra amethystina) to utilize color cues to discriminate between concentrated (1 M) and dilute (0. 25 M) sucrose solutions. In an outdoor aviary, birds were presented with three rich <b>feeders</b> among six poor <b>feeders</b> on a feeding board. Following the assessment of baseline performance with optically identical <b>feeders,</b> color cues were added to the <b>feeders</b> for a 6 h training period. To assess the retention of learnt visual cues, birds were tested 1 and 7 days following the training. Observations lasted for 3 h, with <b>feeders</b> being re-arranged every 30 min to minimize spatial learning. In the absence of color cues, birds selected <b>feeders</b> randomly, but when color cues were available visited more rich than poor <b>feeders.</b> This more rapid identification of rich <b>feeders</b> resulted in a decrease in feeding duration and feeding frequency, compared to the baseline performance. Energy uptake from rich <b>feeders,</b> and therefore the rate of energy gain, increased when birds foraged with color cues. No differences were found between days 1 and 7 after training. Total energy intake decreased with visual cues, which may indicate a reduction in foraging costs when cues allow for location of rewarding <b>feeders.</b> Our findings demonstrate that sunbirds forage more efficiently with cues, which may lead to increased fitness.
