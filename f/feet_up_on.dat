5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
25|$|Noble {{likes to}} have {{spontaneous}} material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages heckling and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the Edinburgh Playhouse during Noble's 2005 Randomist tour, {{a member of the}} audience put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the stage, and later removed his shoes {{and put them on the}} stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.|$|E
25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E

6000|$|This {{morning he}} {{was in front of}} his house, {{inspecting}} the grass parking between the curb and the broad cement sidewalk. Babbitt stopped his car and leaned out to shout [...] "Mornin'!" [...] Littlefield lumbered over and stood with one <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the running-board.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is too bad, too bad," [...] said he, {{drawing the}} {{remnant of the}} shroud about him and leaning his jaw pensively on his hand. Then he put his left <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his knee and fell to {{scratching}} his anklebone absently with a rusty nail which {{he got out of}} his coffin.|$|R
500|$|... "The Box" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Salon.com {{gave the}} episode an A-, explaining [...] "this week's episode was {{chock full of}} good stuff. We get some more fun nuggets about how Earth 2 differs from Earth 1... Your Bose headphones cannot protect you from the awesome sonic power of [...] "The Box". UGO Networks' Alex Zalben wrote [...] "Two weeks in, Fringe {{is still the best}} damn show currently on TV". Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it was a terrific episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was {{a good example of how}} far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology. Now, Fringe is a seamless whole".|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of5, and {{commented that}} the [...] "irreverently funny" [...] film had [...] "a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> {{the seat next to}} you," [...] and praising {{director}} Gondry's [...] "sense of humor and acute visual skill" [...] even while calling the movie [...] "cheerfully unfocused". Rogen proclaimed the film was a [...] "nightmare", chalking it up to studio executives paying little attention to the most expensive portions of the film and its inflated budget.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stiles looked shocked, and, time pressing, Mr. Burton, {{breathing}} so {{hard that}} it impeded his utterance, purchased a first-class ticket and conducted him to the carriage. Mr. Stiles took a seat by the window and lolling back put his <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the cushions opposite. A large bell rang and the carriage-doors were slammed.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Red Rock Canyon showing flute rock {{formations}} and two travelers, Death Valley, California, ca. 1900 / 1950. At {{the bottom of the}} photo, one man to the left props his <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a rock with {{what appears to be a}} canteen at his side, while a second man sits on a stool a little to the right of him. Behind him, a rock face fills the background with column-like erosive patterns that taper as they rise. The rest of the ground below appears to be sandy and littered with small rocks and sparse vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} {{of a man with}} a pack horse in the mountains, ca. 1930. In the center, a man is standing on {{what seems to be the}} edge of a mountain, with one <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a rock. He is wearing a hat and a long-sleeved buttoned shirt over long trousers. He is holding a rope which is attached to one of the straps around the head of a horse behind him. The horse has heavy baggage on its back which is tied up by thick ropes. The foreground is filled with rocks with seem to be sitting on an elevated area. A panoramic view of mountains is observable in the background and trees are partially visible downhill...|$|R

5000|$|John D. Luerssen of Allmusic {{gave the}} album three stars. He noted its more melodic approach, writing [...] "while the band's {{forceful}} attack still won't land {{it in the}} pop survey, Bendeth's input does manage to give the band a <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> other alternative metal acts in the run for airplay in the [...] "active rock" [...] format." [...] Luerssen also criticized the track [...] "Breathless", stating that it [...] "finds the outfit capably shifting into pop ballad mode à la Creed." [...] He goes on to write [...] "That momentary lapse in direction is soon corrected, however, and as The Mourning After unfolds, tracks like the cathartic [...] "F.E." [...] and the spooky [...] "A Season in Hell" [...] right the wrongs for 40 Below Summer's ballooning headbanger clientele." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the club}} to which I belong, in a quiet corner where the {{sunlight}} falls in sideways, there may be seen sitting of an afternoon my good friend of thirty years' standing, Mr. Edward Sims. Being somewhat afflicted with gout, he generally sits with one <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a chair. On a brass table beside him are such things as Mr. Sims needs. But they are few. Wealthy as he is, the needs of Mr. Sims reach scarcely further than Martini cocktails and Egyptian cigarettes. Such poor comforts as these, brought by a deferential waiter, with, let us say, a folded newspaper at five o'clock, suffice for all his wants. Here sits Mr. Sims till the shadows fall in the street outside, when a limousine motor trundles up to the club and rolls him home.|$|R
60|$|Anderson {{leaped to}} get {{one hand on the}} car door, the other on Nash. He almost pulled the driver out of his seat.

5000|$|Meanwhile, Ted {{is having}} trouble conversing with Janet {{without the use of}} the Internet during their date. Despite initial {{attempts}} to resist everyone's insistence that he should look her <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Internet, he gives in and learns that she is extremely accomplished, highly altruistic, and very wealthy. Ted becomes nervous and Janet leaves him, recognizing that his sudden change in behavior means that he has learned about all her achievements and he has become intimidated, as has happened with all her previous dating encounters. After he rejoins his friends, Ted tells them that he regrets giving in and that he would rather have [...] "mystery" [...] over [...] "history" [...] for his future dates. When Ted puts his <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a stool, Marshall notices that the card he threw out the window had stuck to Ted's shoe; he and Lily learn that their baby will be a boy.|$|R

60|$|Hank was not {{the sort}} of man who makes {{universal}} appeal. Also, he was no ladies' man. He was long and lean and hard-bitten, and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non-existent. To get the best out of Hank, as has been said, you had to let him take his coat off and put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the back of a second chair and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected.|$|E
60|$|He extracted, meantime, {{from the}} Dutchman, that the Englishman {{had been very}} ill with violent bleedings at the lungs, but was {{somewhat}} better; and thus we were in some degree prepared, when we had mounted up many, many stairs, to find our Eustace sitting in his cloak, {{though it was a}} warm summer day, with his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a wooden chair in front of him, and looking white, wasted, weak, as I had never seen him.|$|E
