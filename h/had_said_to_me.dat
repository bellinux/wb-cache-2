500|$|Becky {{is not an}} {{aspirational}} character, she {{strives to}} be normal, satisfied with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Canham later {{denied that}} Elliott was [...] "eased out" [...] of his job. [...] In an {{interview}} with Joe Falls, Canham said: [...] "Bump and I are close personal friends. [...] Bump is not naïve – he knows that when you work at a place for 10 years and you’re not winning consistently, it doesn’t become fun for anybody – the coach, the alumni, the players or anybody else. [...] We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E

5000|$|Harold Begbie, author, {{journalist}} and playwright, {{who was then}} in Russia, said of Williams: [...] "More than one Russian <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ‘Williams knows Russia better than we do.’" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deeply sincere. He <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{the most}} appreciative, the most charming things about her. He would say them to you, {{if he were}} sure you would listen to him--gently." ...|$|R
60|$|And I {{repeated}} {{word for}} word what Lorenzo <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and, as far as I could, I reproduced his accent and gesture.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{remembered what}} old Zikali <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> years before {{to the effect}} that Saduko was living with a ghost which would kill him.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you must}} do it, Hughie, I suppose you must," [...] he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I'll see you through, of course. But don't blame me afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, miss, I--a--the fact is--you know a gal named Nora Jones, don't you? Anyhow, {{she knows}} you, an' <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{so often that}} you was a parfect angel, that--that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guy, then," [...] she continued, with {{something}} {{very much like}} a blush, [...] "forget all that you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> at any rate for the present. Perhaps later on, when this is all over--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I halmost faintid with himotion. 'Ho, Jeames!' (she <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> subsquintly) 'mortial mann {{never looked}} so bewtifle {{as you did}} when you arrived {{on the day of}} the Levy. You were no longer mortial, you were diwine!' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{heard her}} breath quickening--I felt her hand growing cold. In {{spite of what}} she <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when we were alone, I began {{to be afraid of}} her. I was wrong.|$|E
60|$|I at once {{related the}} {{circumstances}} under which I had met the woman in white, exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what she <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about Mrs. Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused for}} a moment, {{and looked at me}} intently and suspiciously; then asked if I {{believed}} all he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so far. My instant reply in the affirmative seemed to satisfy his doubts, and he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "In what way?" [...] she demanded. [...] "I judge {{only by the}} facts, {{the things}} you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> your accusations against Captain Granet. Why should you go {{out of your way}} to {{investigate}} cases of suspected espionage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't feel up <b>to</b> it," [...] <b>said</b> Dorian, listlessly. [...] "But I am awfully {{obliged to}} you for all that you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You are {{certainly}} my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will be very}} angry, for he {{has nothing}} to eat. But he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> many times that the Bhils are his children. By {{sunlight}} I believe this, but--by moonlight I am not so sure. What folly have ye Satpura pigs compassed that ye should need him at all?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{sentence}} by sentence I repeated to him {{all that}} Zikali <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{when he called}} me back after bidding me farewell, which doubtless he did because he wished to cut his message more deeply into the tablets of my mind.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{was only}} half awake. He {{looked up at the}} boss drowsily, and began to talk about brigands, and Dick and Ted and Alfred, the same as he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> There wasn't a sound till he had finished. Then the boss spoke.|$|E
60|$|Confronted by {{the serious}} {{responsibility}} {{that he had}} undertaken, he justified what he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Still pale, still distressed, he was now nevertheless master of himself. I turned {{to the door to}} leave him alone with the Prisoner. She called me back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, mamma, why anybody should {{judge him}} yet; and as <b>to</b> what he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I'm {{sure no one}} has a right to judge him unkindly. Dolly has been very angry with me because she saw <b>me</b> {{speaking}} <b>to</b> him in the churchyard, and <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that I was--hiding." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "And rhythm is important," [...] Brodsky told book {{reviewer}} Ella Johnson, in a 2011 interview. [...] "Each of {{my books}} started as a poem. What I like about poetry is that it's very succinct. Each character in my books comes from either something someone <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or something I’ve seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will be very}} angry, for he {{has nothing}} to eat. But he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> many times that the Bhils are his children. By {{sunlight}} I believe this, but - by moonlight I am not so sure. What folly have ye Satpura pigs compassed that ye should need him at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Throughout {{all this}} my lord {{was like a}} cold, kind spectator with his wits about him. At the first cry, which was indeed enough to call the house about us, he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> over his shoulder, [...] "Close the door." [...] And now he nodded to himself.|$|E
60|$|There {{was such}} a shock of {{apprehension}} in his face, and he knew Richard so perfectly, and I too had seen {{so much of his}} gradual decay, that what my dear girl <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the fullness of her foreboding love sounded like a knell in my ears.|$|E
60|$|So I {{turned and}} beckoned to my captains, and Kari beckoned to his. They came, {{and in the}} hearing of all, very clearly and quietly as was his fashion, he {{repeated}} every word that he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> adding to them others of like meaning. While he spoke I thought, not listening over-much.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Well, I'm not sure; many {{travellers}} wot {{has stayed}} here <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> they've seed 'em, particklerly {{in the old}} part o' the buildin', but they seems to be quite harmless, and never hurts any one as lets 'em alone. I never seed 'em myself, an' there's cer'nly not more nor half-a-dozen on 'em--hallo!--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's sheer nonsense," [...] said Beam, {{turning away}} from the window and {{throwing}} himself into a chair; [...] "why should an old fellow like Tippengray take up all the spare time of that girl? She doesn't need to learn anything. From what she <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I judge that she knows too much already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{knew all}} that she knew;--all that I knew. You knew all that her mother knew. No, Lord Scroope. It cannot be {{that you should be}} so unutterably a villain. You are your own masther. Unsay what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and her ears shall never be wounded or her heart broken by a hint of it." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{spoke the}} old {{carpenter}} {{with a voice}} which trembled with earnestness, {{and went to work}} upon his plank once more, while I, with a few words of gratitude, went on my way pondering over what he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I had not gone far, however, before the hoarse voice of Solomon Sprent broke in upon my meditations.|$|E
60|$|Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, I didn't quite know myself. It was what the {{magistrate}} <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on the occasion when I stood in the dock as Eustace Plimsoll, of The Laburnums: and as it had impressed me a good deal at the time, I just bunged it in now by way of giving the conversation a tone.|$|E
6000|$|The {{show was}} very good, but {{to tell the}} truth I did not take much notice of it, for I had seen similar things before and was engaged in {{thoughts}} much excited by what Harût <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> At length the pair paused amidst the clapping of the audience, and Marût began to pack up the properties as though all were done. Then Harût observed casually: ...|$|E
60|$|Waster Lunny <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{more than}} once that the great {{surprise}} of his life was when Elspeth {{was willing to take}} him. Many a time, however, I have seen that in him which might have made any weaver's daughter proud of such a man, and I saw it again when we came to the river side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take care, Mrs. Glenarm!" [...] she said, still {{struggling}} with herself. [...] "I am not naturally a patient woman. Trouble has done much to tame my temper--but endurance has its limits. You have reached the limits of mine. I have a claim to be heard--and after what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I will be heard!" ...|$|R
60|$|Benjamin started. My {{question}} {{was certainly a}} strange one, after what he <b>had</b> just <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
