5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the <b>droplet</b> in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the <b>droplet</b> and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat <b>droplet</b> in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the <b>droplet</b> finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten <b>droplet,</b> the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E

40|$|Two <b>droplets</b> are {{typically}} expected to coalesce upon contact {{due to the}} minimization of surface energy. However, when <b>droplets</b> are placed under an electric field, the presence of electric stress can lead to even more intriguing dynamics. For example, in a significantly strong electric field, the <b>droplets</b> bounce {{away from each other}} upon contact instead of coalescing. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of two oppositely charged <b>droplets.</b> We characterize the dynamics of emulsion <b>droplets</b> by a state diagram using an electrocapillary number and relative separation number. A phenomenon of periodic contact and separation of two oppositely charged <b>droplets,</b> which we term periodic contact, is demonstrated and studied. Two qualitatively different types of periodic contact are identified: “fuse-and-split ” and periodic non-coalescence. In regime of “fuse-and-split”, the <b>droplets</b> first coalesce into a jet that remains stable for tens of milliseconds; afterwards, it breaks up into <b>droplets</b> again. In regime of “periodic non-coalescence”, the <b>droplets</b> contact periodically without coalescence.

5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water <b>droplet</b> will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the <b>droplet</b> has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the <b>droplet.</b> Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles.

5|$|Once a <b>droplet</b> has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The <b>droplet</b> then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.

In the present study, we investigate the effect of size differences between suspended components on the segregation behavior, by a two-dimensional numerical simulation for binary dispersed suspensions of fluid <b>droplets</b> of two different sizes subjected to a plane Poiseuille channel flow. The small and large <b>droplets</b> are assumed to have equal surface tensions and equal viscosity ratios of internal to external fluids. The time evolutions of the lateral positions of large and small <b>droplets</b> relative to the channel centerline were computed by changing the area fraction of the small <b>droplets</b> in a mixture with a constant total area fraction.

This segregation behavior as well as the margination of small <b>droplets</b> are enhanced when the size difference between large and small <b>droplets</b> is increased and the area fraction of large <b>droplets</b> is increased.
