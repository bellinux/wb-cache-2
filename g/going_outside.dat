5|$|Roosevelt had {{withdrawn}} much {{land from the}} public domain, including some in Alaska thought rich in coal. In 1902, Clarence Cunningham, an Idaho entrepreneur, had found coal deposits in Alaska, and made mining claims, and the government investigated their legality. This dragged on {{for the remainder of}} the Roosevelt administration, including during the year (1907–1908) when Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office. A special agent for the Land Office, Louis Glavis, investigated the Cunningham claims, and when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them, Glavis broke governmental protocol by <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot.|$|E
5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the State of Connecticut paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt toilets, swimmers <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E

25|$|Without <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> his door, {{one understands}} (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking {{out from his}} window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. Therefore the sages got their {{knowledge}} without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.|$|E
25|$|Restrictions upon {{smoking in}} offices and other {{enclosed}} public places often result in smokers <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> to smoke, frequently congregating outside doorways. This {{can result in}} non-smokers passing through these doorways getting exposed to more secondhand smoke rather than less. Many jurisdictions that have restricted smoking in enclosed public places have extended provisions to cover areas within a fixed distance of entrances to buildings.|$|E

25|$|The small synagogue is lit by windows {{overlooking}} the courtyard. The courtyard location concealed within a residential building {{is typical of}} synagogues built in pre-modern Italy. It was a precautionary measure taken so {{that none of the}} sounds of Jewish worship should reach Christian ears and possibly provoke a pogrom or repressive anti-Jewish measures. This location also permitted Jews to enter the synagogue without <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> the ghetto.|$|E
25|$|The sufferers can {{sometimes}} {{go to great}} lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder. Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also cause agoraphobia. Essentially, any irrational fear that keeps one from <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> can cause the syndrome.|$|E

It is not just the simple act of <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> their culture that is {{upsetting}} to Native Americans, but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture (their images are shadows of the true Indian style). Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone can simply claim to be a spokesperson for the Native American experience.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1972 total {{production}} of bicycles was 250,000 and mopeds 60,000 a year. Of these, 60,000 bicycles and 27,000 mopeds went abroad. Sales were strong in West Germany and Switzerland. Iran, Israel, Belgium and Greece were also important. In Turkey, Batavus mopeds {{began to be}} manufactured under license in 1972. In 1977, Batavus made more bicycles and mopeds than any other company in the Netherlands. It was the biggest Dutch exporter of machines, with 55 percent of production <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> the Netherlands to accommodate interest for fuel-efficient transport in the USA during the 1970s. Batavus set up its USA headquarters in Atlanta, GA.|$|E
25|$|The camera {{manages to}} capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, {{flickering}} lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches {{and there is}} a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before <b>going</b> <b>outside.</b> Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.|$|E
25|$|In 1841, he {{was made}} surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary, but this {{appointment}} did not give him any experience in the graver operations of surgery. He was appointed lecturer on general anatomy (microscopic anatomy) and physiology at the hospital in 1843, and warden of the hospital college then founded. For the next eight years, he lived {{within the walls of}} the hospital, in charge of about 30 students resident in the little college. Besides his lectures and his superintendence of the resident students, he had to enter all new students, to advise them how to work, and to manage the finances and the general affairs of the school. Thus, he was constantly occupied with the business of the school, and often passed a week, or more, without <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> the hospital gates.|$|E

500|$|The Æsir {{begin to}} grow grey and {{old at the}} {{disappearance}} of Idunn. The Æsir assemble at a thing where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that {{the last time that}} Iðunn was seen was when she was <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the thing. Loki is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that if the goddess Freyja will lend him her [...] "falcon shape" [...] he will search for Iðunn in the land of Jötunheimr. Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr. One day later, Loki arrives at Þjazi's home. There he finds that Þjazi is out at sea in a boat, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a nut, holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.|$|E
500|$|... {{women in}} Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of {{movement}} and in practice {{are not allowed to}} drive motor vehicles. In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests.

500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support."

500|$|Literary critic Richard Erlich {{wrote in}} 2006 that the {{depiction}} of the religious cult of Bliss was influenced by Le Guin's interest in Taoist thought, and an example of Le Guin's critique of Christianity. The angels use of the phrase [...] "the planetary hypothesis" [...] to refer to their terrestrial origin was a gentle dig at Christian fundamentalism in the United States, with its insistence that evolution is [...] "merely a theory." [...] The story also refers {{to the success of}} Christian fundamentalists in taking over school boards in the US. A more direct criticism of Christianity comes in Le Guin's depiction of the cult of Bliss being disrespectful of women, as well as of believing in a nuclear, patriarchal family. Bliss is portrayed as a closed system; members reinforce manipulate the ship's data banks to remove references to Earth and their destination, because they value stability {{even to the point of}} denying some of their own knowledge. A reference to Christianity is also present in Le Guin's word to describe activity outside the ship: the real-world term [...] "extravehicular activity" [...] or EVA is used as a single word [...] "Eva," [...] in reference to the biblical [...] "Eve": angels in the story see <b>going</b> <b>outside</b> the ship as an act of transgression associated with death.|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support."
