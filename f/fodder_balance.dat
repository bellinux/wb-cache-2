40|$|African {{farmers have}} always been exposed to climatic and {{economic}} variability and have developed a range of coping strategies. Such strategies form part of flexible farm management, an ability that may prove very valuable {{in the face of}} future climate change and market dynamics. The generally low productivity of African smallholder farming systems is usually addressed by research and development institutions by a variety of solutions for improving farm performance. However, changes to the system may affect the flexibility of farms and thus their ability to cope with variability. We quantified the added value of being flexible and how this flexibility is affected by technical changes, such as composting and cattle fattening recurrently proposed and promoted by research and development institutions and projects. The study was conducted in two villages of the agro-pastoral area of Burkina Faso, where livestock, cereals and cotton are the main farming activities. A whole-farm simulation model was developed based on information gathered during focus group meetings with farmers and detailed individual monitoring of farmers' practices. The model simulates farmers' decision rules governing the management of the cropping and livestock farm components, as well as crop and livestock production and farm gross margin. Using the existing decision rules, current farm performance was simulated by assessing the cereal balance, the <b>fodder</b> <b>balance</b> and the whole farm gross margin. Then, by comparing the mean and the coefficient of variation of these indicators resulting from (a) the existing decision rules (baseline scenario) and (b) a set of less flexible rules (rigid scenario), the added value of flexible management was revealed. The adoption of composting practices allowed a slight increase in gross margin associated with a decrease in its between-year variability in comparison with conventional practices. Cattle fattening only led to a higher gross margin in the years with high rainfall and low input prices when no management practices were used to limit dependence on external input. This kind of technical change thus requires increased management agility by farmers to deal with climatic and economic variability. We conclude that assessing the impact of technical interventions {{not only in terms of}} productivity but also in terms of changes in flexibility is useful for a better understanding of potential adoption of technical change...|$|E
30|$|In ALUAM, {{decisions}} at the parcel, {{farm and}} regional level are optimized {{in such a}} way that aggregated land rent is maximized. At the parcel level, decisions concern land-use activities such as crop production, grassland intensity or timber production. Farm-level decisions relate to animal husbandry and flows of fodder and nutrients. Land use links the parcel level with livestock activities through <b>fodder</b> and nutrient <b>balances.</b> At the regional level, resources such as hirable workforce and number of animals available for grazing on summer pastures are only available to a limited extent and are therefore balanced over the whole region. Resource demands of activities at lower levels have to be evaluated to calculate these regional balances. A comparative static approach was used to assess the impact of our four scenarios in 2050 and 2080. We would refer to Briner et al. (2012, 2013 a) for details regarding validation and sensitivity analysis of the model simulation.|$|R
40|$|Winter cereals and {{legume crops}} {{may be used}} in early spring as forages. The {{surpluses}} of produced mixtures are ensilaged. Under dry land conditions some mixtures are dried for hay, or used for grain production after physiological maturity. The early cultivars of fodder rapeseed (Perko and Starška) were cut as early as in the middle of April, winter rye at the end of April, triticale at the beginning of May, while winter wheat cutting time {{was in the middle of}} May. Winter fodder pea can be used from the beginning of May and by the middle of June. The mixture of winter rye and fodder pea yielded 32. 5 %, 26. 3 %, 56. 0 % and 26. 0 % more green mass yield, dry matter yield, digestible crude protein and starch units, respectively, compared to pure winter rye crop. Generally, the advantages of winter cereals and legume mixtures are in higher and more stable yields, <b>balanced</b> <b>fodder,</b> easy cut, and decreased yield losses...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and modernization of our country’s agriculture {{is related to}} the revitalization of the animal breeding sector along with the implementation of new genotypes of animals and diversification of <b>fodder</b> production, <b>balanced</b> in terms of quantity and quality throughout the year, suitable for the physiological requirements of animals, and qualitative products as required in the market. Scientific research conducted in the Botanical Garden (Institute) of the ASM over decades was aimed at mobilization, improvement and implementation of new non-traditional plant species that use efficiently photosynthetic active radiation and land resources to obtain fodder {{with a high level of}} vegetable protein, the fodder leguminous grasses (fam. Fabaceae Lindl.) play an important role. We have studied the biological peculiarities, productivity, chemical composition and nutritional value of new fodder leguminous plant species Astragalus galegiformis, Onobrychis inermis and Medicago tianschanica of the collection of non-traditional fodder plants of the Botanical Garden (Institute) of the ASM, the traditional forage crop alfalfa served as control variant. The nutritional value of fresh mass accounts: the Astragalus galegiformis - 0. 27 nutritive units, 3. 26 MJ metabolizable energy and 146 g digestible protein/nutritive unit; Onobrychis inermis - 0. 25 nutritive units, 2. 56 MJ metabolizable energy and 154 g digestible protein/nutritive unit; Medicago tianschanica - 0. 24 nutritive units, 2. 86 MJ metabolizable energy and 173 g digestible protein/nutritive unit and alfalfa - 0. 21 nutritive units, 2. 28 MJ metabolizable energy and 164 g digestible protein/nutritive unit. Due to the productivity and high and stable quality of fodder, use of the plantation for a long period of time, capacity of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, the new fodder leguminous species Astragalus galegiformis, Onobrychis inermis and Medicago tianschanica can serve as initial material for enriching the range of forage crops...|$|R
40|$|The study {{pointed out}} the major sources for {{clinical}} and subclinical intoxications with nitrates/nitrites (drinking water and nitrates containing fertilizers), circumstances that determine fertilizers to became sources of intoxication (excessive fertilization/consecutive high level of nitrates in fodders, free access of animals to the fertilizers, administration into the diet instead of natrium chloride), factors that determine high nitrates accumulation in fodders despite optimal fertilization (factors related to the plants, soil, clime, harvest methods, storage, agrotechnical measures), nitrates/nitrites toxicity (over 45 ppm nitrates in drinking water, over 0. 5 g nitrate/ 100 g D. M fodder/diet), {{the factors that influence}} nitrates/nitrites toxicity (species, age, rate of feeding, diet balance especially energetically), pathological effects and symptoms (irritation and congestions on digestive tract, resulting diarrhoea, transformation of hemoglobin into methemoglobin determining severe respiratory insufficiency, vascular collapse, low blood pressure inthe acute nitrates intoxication; hypotiroidism, hypovitaminosis A, reproductive disturbances(abortion, low rate of fertility, dead born offspring), diarrhoea and/or respiratory insufficiency in new born e. g. calves), immunosuppression, decrease of milk production in chronic intoxication. There were presented some suggestions concerning management practices to limit nitrate intoxication (analyze of nitrates/nitrites in water and fodders, good management of the situation of risk,e. g. dilution of the diet with low nitrate content <b>fodders,</b> feeding with <b>balanced</b> diet in energy, protein, minerals and vitamins, accommodation to high nitrate level diet, avoid grazing one week after a frost period, avoid feeding chop green fodders stored a couple of days, monitoring of health status of animals fed with fodders containing nitrates at risk level, a. o.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main reason}} of the {{developmental}} delay of the RF livestock sector {{below the level of}} its inherent potential capacity is a detrimental alteration in methodological procedure of livestock and poultry management, occurring due to shortage of traditional feeds. As a result, a necessity to develop the yearlong production of additional <b>fodders,</b> allowing for <b>balanced</b> feeding throughout the year, arose. The method of hydroponic green fodder (HGF) cultivation meets these requirements. Analysis of HGF production methods and labor saver mechanisms makes possible to claim that existing systems are characterized by high costs and difficulties in fabrication, and require a number of additional mechanical devices to work. In the FSBEI HE “KSMTU”, a one-tier hydroponic system has been developed, fitted with curved (arched) guideways and rigid elastic load-carrying components, where loading of seeds and takeout of grown HGF occur by gravity without additional devices of labour input. Based on analysis performed on design features of the proposed system, it has been established that emergence of parametric resonances in the system under consideration is possible; and the study of tray dynamical stability has been carried out with the aim to prevent them. The motion of the hydroponic system tray under consideration is described by the classical Mathieu equation, including two parameters a and q. The further studies of sets of stable and unstable solutions in the plane of a and q parameters are presented by the Ince-Strutt diagram. As a result of the performed calculations, the diameter of the loadcarrying component was identified (d= 5 mm), which should ensure reliable working capacity and stability of the hydroponic system in whol...|$|R
