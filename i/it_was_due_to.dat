5|$|A large Tesco {{supermarket}} {{was constructed}} {{on the outskirts}} of Chatteris at a cost of £22 million. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> be opened in November 2014, but has been left unopened and empty following the company's decision to halt the opening of 49 out-of-town supermarkets following poor financial results. As of April 2016, Tesco are looking for another retailer to take over the store, which remains mothballed.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to {{the abolition of the}} NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E
50|$|Hypouricemia is not {{a medical}} {{condition}} itself (i.e., <b>it</b> <b>is</b> benign), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a useful medical sign. Usually hypouricemia <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> drugs and toxic agents, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> diet or genetics, and rarely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an underlying medical condition. When one of these causal medical conditions is present, hypouricemia is a common sign.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, Cameron {{announced}} {{he would be the}} host of the film Unstoppable slated to premiere September 24, 2013. A trailer for the film was blocked on Facebook, with Cameron speculating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the film's religious content.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an epidemic, {{it was difficult to}} ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E

5|$|To provide forward {{protection}} for the railway construction workers and the infrastructure, the 5th Mounted Brigade was ordered to move to Katia.

5|$|A fire on {{the night}} of 6November 1995 {{destroyed}} or damaged all the structures within the Rova complex shortly before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> be inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Although officially declared an accident, rumours persist that politically motivated arson may have been the actual cause of the fire. The chapel and tombs, as well as Besakana and Mahitsielafanjaka, have since been fully restored with bilateral government donations, state funds and grants from intergovernmental and private donors. Completion of the reconstruction of the Manjakamiadana exterior is estimated for 2012, while interior restoration work will continue until at least 2013. Once the building is fully restored, Manjakamiadana will serve as a museum showcasing royal artefacts saved from destruction in the fire.|$|E
5|$|At age 19 (two {{years before}} he won the tournament), Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major, the 1995 Masters, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, {{he became the first}} golfer to win three {{consecutive}} U.S. Amateur titles and won the NCAA individual golf championship. In winning the silver medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship, he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281. He left college after two years and turned professional. In 1996, Woods moved out of California, stating in 2013 that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the state's tax rate.|$|E
5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E

5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern.

The episode was still being animated three weeks before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that they did not want it to be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Nerpa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Komsomolsk-on-Amur {{shipyard}} in 1993, but its completion was delayed {{for nearly a decade}} {{due to a lack of}} funds caused by the economic crisis of the early 1990s. The partly constructed vessel was mothballed until 2004, when Rosprom (the Federal Agency for Industry) signed an agreement with the Indian government to complete the submarine and lease it to the Indian Navy. The vessel was intended to be completed by 2007, but underwent further delays. In 2007, it was transferred to the Vostok shipyard in the closed city of Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai, for fitting-out. It was launched in October 2008 for sea trials, following which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> be handed over to the Russian Defence Ministry. Reports in the Indian media suggest that the resumption of construction was underwritten with Indian funding.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, near Givenchy, {{during a}} night attack, Lt. Bruce was {{in command of}} a small party which {{captured}} one of the enemy's trenches. In spite of being severely wounded in the neck, he {{walked up and down}} the trench, encouraging his men to hold on against several counter-attacks for some hours until killed. The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all day, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when the trench was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E

However, on 3 February 2012, just a week before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> join the alliance, Kingfisher Airlines' entry was put on hold to give it more time to strengthen its financial position.

5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> this lukewarmness that Władysław {{was never able to}} inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
