50|$|The violin, viola, and cello {{were first}} {{made in the}} early 16th century, in Italy. The {{earliest}} evidence for their existence is in paintings by Gaudenzio Ferrari from the 1530s, though Ferrari's instruments had only three strings.

2500|$|Despite {{similarities}} to the viola da gamba, the cello is actually {{part of the}} viola da braccio family, meaning [...] "viol of the arm", which includes, among others, the violin and viola. Though paintings like Bruegel's [...] "The Rustic Wedding", and <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Fer in his Epitome Musical suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic a gamba position eventually replaced them entirely.|$|R
2500|$|The violin in {{its present}} form emerged in early 16th-century {{northern}} Italy. The earliest pictures of violins, albeit with three strings, are seen in northern Italy around 1530, at around {{the same time as the}} words [...] "violino" [...] and [...] "vyollon" [...] are seen in Italian and French documents. One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, is from the Epitome musical by <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Fer, published in Lyon in 1556. By this time, the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe.|$|R
50|$|The bass violin was {{developed}} in Italy {{in the first half}} of the sixteenth century, to be in consort with the violin and viola. The first builder was possibly Andrea Amati, as early as 1538. The first specific reference to the instrument was probably made by <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Fer in his treatise Epitome Musical (1556). One of the first known instances of a composer explicitly calling for the bass violin ("basso da brazzo") was Monteverdi in Orfeo (1607) (the first was possibly Giovanni Gabrieli in Sacrae symphoniae, 1597).|$|R
50|$|In the 16th century, the structure, repertoire, and {{performing}} {{practice of the}} recorder is better documented than in prior epochs. The recorder {{was one of the}} most important wind instruments of the Renaissance, and many instruments dating to the 16th century survive, including some matched consorts. This period also produced the first extant books describing the recorder, including the treatises of Virdung (1511), Agricola (1529), Ganassi (1535), Cardano (c1546), <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Fer (1556), and Praetorius (1619). Nonetheless, understanding of the instrument and its practice in this period is still developing.|$|R
50|$|The modern European violin {{evolved from}} various bowed {{stringed}} instruments from the Middle East4 the Byzantine Empire.56 It {{is most likely}} that the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments: the rebec, in use since the 10th century (itself derived from the Byzantine lyra7 and the Arabic rebab), the Renaissance fiddle, and the lira da braccio8 (derived5 from the Byzantine lira). One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, was in the Epitome musical by <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Fer, published in Lyon in 1556.9 By this time, the violin {{had already begun to}} spread throughout Europe.|$|R

50|$|The French pirate François le Clerc (also {{known as}} <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Bois, {{due to his}} wooden leg) {{frequently}} visited Saint Lucia in the 1550s. It was not until around 1600 that the first European camp was started by the Dutch at what is now Vieux Fort. In 1605 an English vessel called the Olive Branch was blown off-course {{on its way to}} Guyana, and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia. After five weeks only 19 survived due to disease and conflict with the Caribs, so they fled the island. The French officially claimed the island in 1635. The English attempted the next European settlement in 1639, and that too was wiped out by Caribs.|$|R

40|$|The leg of truth. On a {{painting}} by Tiepolo. This article analyzes Giambattista Tiepolo's rococo allegory Time unveiling Truth, long known as Time ravishing Beauty. Its ambiguity of gestures and positions reveals the eroticisation of a theme which had until then signified the triumph of a spiritual Truth over the terrestrial world. This study tries to show, through {{an analysis of the}} incestuous relationship between Time and Truth and of the role of Cupid, situated between Truth's legs, that Tiepolo's painting suggests a specifically 18 th-century conception of time as "occasion", or desire's moment of "truth".

5000|$|Composer {{and singer}} Philibert <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> Fer ( [...] 1515 - [...] 1566) {{was the only}} French author of the 16th century {{to write about the}} recorder, in his Epitome musical. He {{complains}} of the French name for the instrument, fleutte à neuf trouz ("flute with nine holes") as, in practice, one of the lowermost holes must be plugged, leaving only eight open holes. He prefers fleute d'Italien or the Italian flauto. His fingering chart is notable for two reasons, first for describing fingerings with the 15th produced as a variant on the 14th, and for using the third finger of the lower hand as a buttress finger, although only for three notes in the lower octave.

5000|$|According to old mountain-dwellers, {{the source}} of the Fave was worshipped at Fouillepré {{upstream}} of Lubine. According to this cultural model, all the modest tributaries upstream of Lubine, which come from Climont, les Osières, la <b>Jambe</b> <b>de</b> fer and other slopes or small valleys, were referred to as [...] "petites Faves" [...] (little Faves). Their confluence created the Fave. A probable etymology of the word Fave is from the Old French meaning water which digs or searches. This bears resemblance to the Gaulish [...] "murta" [...] meaning to dig, gully or laugh, which gave rise to the Meurthe river, to the Morte (a tributary of the Fave which joins in the channels of the low grassland between Neuvillers and Vanifosse), and to the Mortagne, which flows into the Meurthe further downstream.|$|R

2500|$|These German {{officers}} were most often unsuited for combat and were thus posted to the camps. In effect, {{they were either}} too old: “Saw the general commanding the camp: old fogey with black red-striped pants [...] and a big iron cross, he limps” or unfit due to alcoholism or war wounds. Starting with the camp director, a very strict hierarchy was in place. The director gave orders to the sub-officers, who were often young. The prisoners dreaded the latter: “Finally the fourth German corporal, the youngest, Red Baby, a worthy student who did honour to Savage and Steel Mouth, only sought to do harm, always provoking, having several acts of savagery to his name”. For their part, the prisoners had fun giving them nicknames such as Gueule d’Acier (“Steel Mouth” – lit. “Stainless Steel Trap”), <b>Jambes</b> <b>de</b> laine (“Woolen Legs”), Je sais tout (“Know-it-all” – lit. “I know everything”), [...] Rabiot des tripes' (“Tripe leftovers”), or even La Galoche (“The Clog”) and Sourire d’Avril (“April Smile”).|$|R
