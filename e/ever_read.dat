From Mr. Burns' office, he watches {{surveillance}} footage of his plant. When Marge appears, however, he is infatuated and attempts to win her affection. He begins to take her advice on ways to cheer everyone up around the plant by playing the music of Tom Jones over the plant's speakers, which further depresses the employees.|$|E

However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, Mit brennender Sorge (With Burning Anxiety), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the Concordat between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the novel}} won no awards upon release, it has {{remained}} in print and is seen {{as one of the}} most significant American novels of the 20th century. Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he <b>ever</b> <b>read</b> about the military. Since its release in 1961, the book has sold 10 million copies.|$|E
25|$|From infancy, Rabbi Chaim Ozer {{was weak}} and sickly. However, he was gifted with a {{tremendous}} memory, never forgetting anything he had <b>ever</b> <b>read</b> or heard. He was also a deep thinker who developed clear explanations for every Torah topic he studied. At the age of 9, he was tested by Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, who asked the boy a question in halakha along with his own answer. The little Chaim Ozer refuted the Rav's thesis and cited a different one from the sources, astounding the Rav.|$|E

25|$|The {{revision}} of her fame and {{status as an}} author {{began in the early}} decades of the 18th century and led to manifest defamations in the 19th and early 20th centuries: she became seen as a scandalous female author who, some critics audaciously asserted, did not deserve to be <b>ever</b> <b>read</b> again. Later critics, however, looked back on the conclusions of Richetti and others were short-sighted and perhaps even outright misogynistic and more reflective of their era than of general historic scholarship on the author as an important political satirist.|$|E
25|$|The Strauss and Howe {{retelling of}} history through a generational lens has {{received}} mixed reviews. Many reviewers have praised the authors' books and theory for their ambition, erudition and accessibility. Former U.S Vice President Al Gore (who graduated from Harvard University with Mr. Strauss) called Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 the most stimulating book on American history he'd <b>ever</b> <b>read.</b> He even sent a copy to {{each member of}} Congress. The theory has been influential {{in the fields of}} generational studies, marketing, and business management literature. However, it has also been criticized by several historians and some political scientists and journalists, as being overly-deterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence.|$|E
25|$|Ferris in {{his book}} {{explains}} the dynamism {{of the universe and}} the origins of chemical elements. He further examines the mystery of the clumping together of the stars within galaxies. He gives an excerpt of the search for a Darwin type theory and explanation {{of the history of the}} universe. His research in how quantum mechanics works gives rise to why there may be many universes, not just one. While some may shun away from what appears to be difficult scientific material, journalist Charles Krauthammer encourages non-technical people to read the book because it is as intuitive an account of its essential idea– the curvature of space– as I have <b>ever</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{the dual}} roles of Arctor and Fred, Linklater thought of Keanu Reeves, but figured that the actor would be burnt out from making another science fiction film after making The Matrix trilogy. Robert Downey, Jr. was {{attracted}} to the film when he heard Reeves was going to star and Linklater to direct. He thought that the script was the strangest one he had <b>ever</b> <b>read.</b> Linklater wrote the role of Freck with Rory Cochrane in mind. The actor was interested but {{did not want to}} recreate his role in Dazed and Confused. Both Woody Harrelson and Winona Ryder agreed to appear in the film based on the script. Reeves and Ryder agreed to work for the Screen Actors Guild scale rate plus any back-end profits. As with Linklater's earlier Waking Life, syndicated radio host Alex Jones has a small cameo as himself.|$|E

Bashimilah was subsequently beaten and threatened by the General Intelligence Department until he finally agreed several days later to sign a confession without <b>ever</b> <b>reading</b> it. On the morning of October 26 he was transferred to the CIA, which chained and hooded him, and then flew him to Kabul, Afghanistan.|$|R
5000|$|Jordan also {{automatically}} {{became a}} member of the Green Lantern Corps, a galactic [...] "police" [...] force which bears some similarities to the [...] "Lensmen" [...] from the science fiction series written by E.E. Smith, although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied <b>ever</b> <b>reading</b> Smith's stories. Nevertheless, the early 1980s miniseries [...] "Green Lantern Corps" [...] honors the similarity with two characters in the corps: Eddore of Tront and Arisia. A different interpretation of Jordan and the Corps appears in Superman: Red Son.|$|R
500|$|Despite such criticism, the {{reception}} that met She was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic Andrew Lang before the story's first publication: [...] "I think She {{is one of}} the most astonishing romances I <b>ever</b> <b>read.</b> The more impossible it is, the better you do it, till it seems like a story from the literature of another planet".|$|E
500|$|Fischer and Spassky gave ten press {{conferences}} during the match.

Seirawan later wrote: [...] "After September 23 , I threw most of what I'd <b>ever</b> <b>read</b> about Bobby out of my head. Sheer garbage. Bobby is the most misunderstood, misquoted celebrity walking {{the face of the}} earth." [...] He added that Fischer was not camera shy, smiled and laughed easily, was [...] "a fine wit" [...] and [...] "wholly enjoyable conversationalist".|$|E

5000|$|His {{most recent}} book The Leadership Contract claims the {{majority}} of employees accept leadership positions without [...] "reading the fine print." [...] He draws on an analogy of web site users who accept the terms of service of the site without <b>ever</b> <b>reading</b> them.

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Boucher {{wrote that}} the book belongs [...] "pretty much to the private-eye school" [...] of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming [...] "manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and {{produced}} as exciting a gambling sequence as I've <b>ever</b> <b>read.</b> But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader {{through a set of}} tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over." ...|$|E

It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which {{is one of my favorite}} quotes I've <b>ever</b> <b>read,</b> so we decided to put it in the video. It's vivid." ...|$|E
