40|$|Agency theorists {{consider}} a firm as a nexus of contractual relationships. Contracting parties such as shareholders, debt <b>holders,</b> <b>managers,</b> input suppliers, advertising agencies and retailers may have information superior to outsiders concerning the firm’s quality. In this paper, {{we show that}} the duration of contractual relationship within a firm has important implications on {{the dynamics of the}} price and trading volume of the firm’s stock. If the duration of information asymmetry corresponds to that of contractual relationship, insiders with long-term relationship is shown to marginally prefer less aggressive strategies of trading than those who can only access superior information temporarily. Such behavior makes it more difficult for the market maker to infer the existence of informed traders. The market maker will henceforth provide smaller bid-ask spreads, which attract discretionary liquidity traders to gather their trades in that period. With the long-term contractual relationship, uncertainty is resolved more slowly because the informed trader trades on his information advantage gradually. This strategy enlarges the liquidity traders’ loss and discourages them from holding the firm’s stock. We conclude that a firm’s fundamental value will be influenced by its choice between changing partners regularly and committing to a partner. From the viewpoints of the firm and uninformed traders, changing partners regularly is always an optimal policy under the topics of market efficiency and information asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{problem of}} {{recruiting}} and retaining a qualified rural and remote health workforce is well recognised {{and a number}} of strategies have been put in place to address this issue, including the use of bonded scholarship programs. However there is a paucity of evidence regarding the impact of scholarships on workforce outcomes particularly in relation to allied health professionals. This project involved a review of the Queensland Health Rural Scholarship Scheme (Allied Health) (QHRSS-AH) including impacts on those engaged with the scholarship program and for the funding organisation. Specifically this study aimed to examine the profile of the QHRSS-AH recipients from 2000 to 2010 including graduate recruitment outcomes and retention within the scholarship program. It also explored the influence of the QHRSS-AH on early career practice location decisions and the features of the scheme that influenced motivation to be involved as either a scholarship <b>holder</b> or <b>manager,</b> perceived barriers to employment of scholarship holders in rural or remote services, experiences of scholarship holders as new graduates in rural and remote services and views on support requirements. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted involving quantitative analysis of existing Queensland Health scholarship data and a qualitative study that used one-on-one, in-depth telephone interviews with 17 past or current scholarship <b>holders</b> and 11 <b>managers</b> of scholarship <b>holders.</b> Results: Of the 146 participants, 69. 2...|$|R

40|$|A {{problem of}} {{corporate}} liquidation policy is studied {{in a real}} option setting incorporating taxation, risky debt and conflict of interest between equity holders and debt holders or equity <b>holders</b> and <b>manager.</b> The critical liquidation threshold is derived {{as a function of}} four tax schedules and interest expenses. It is shown that the adoption of a progressive tax schedule can slow down or speed up the closure policy, while any flat tax plan does not interfere with the firm's liquidation policy. Moreover, the conflict of interest between shareholders and manager affects the liquidation trigger only under a progressive tax. This paper contributes to the debate on progressive vs proportional tax, employing a rigorous real option methodology which has never been used to study both liquidation policy and taxation. ...|$|R

40|$|Executive summary: The prestigious Mary Seacole Awards aim {{to develop}} senior nurses, {{midwives}} and health visitors as future leaders with the enhanced leadership {{skills necessary to}} tackle health inequalities in black and minority ethnic (BME) communities. The {{primary purpose of the}} current evaluation, which was completed between May and August 2012, was to examine the impact that Mary Seacole Award holders’ projects have had on their personal and professional development, service design and delivery, and on patient/service user care. Building on the two previous evaluations in 2000 and 2010, it explored the ‘added value’ and impact that the Awards have had in order to gather evidence to support the continued funding of the Awards. The evaluation was undertaken in four stages and included both quantitative and qualitative elements. Stage 1 : an online questionnaire was used to gather core data from as many of Mary Seacole Award holders as possible. Information was gathered on what each individual’s project has achieved, where they are now professionally and the support they received. Stage 2 : The data from the online questionnaire were used to select and invite Award holders to take part in an in-depth interview. This explored in more detail impact on policy and on service design and delivery, influence on others, benefits for the BME community and suggestions for ways to support future Award winners to maximise the benefits of the experience. Stage 3 : Managers of the 2010 cohort of Award holders were invited for interview which focused on the Award <b>holder</b> <b>manager’s</b> perceptions of the key benefits of the Award, the impact of the Award holder’s work on practice, policy and personal/professional development, and any plans to develop the work further.

40|$|Conservatism, {{through the}} timelier {{recognition}} of {{losses in the}} income statement, {{is expected to increase}} firm investment efficiency through three main channels: (1) by decreasing the adverse effect of information asymmetries between outside equity <b>holders</b> and <b>managers,</b> facilitating the monitoring of managerial investment decisions; (2) by increasing managerial incentives to abandon poorly performing projects earlier and to undertake fewer negative net present-value investments; and (3) by facilitating the access to external financing at lower cost. Using a large US sample for the period 1990 - 2007 we find a negative association between conservatism and measures of over- and under- investment, and a positive association between conservatism and future profitability. This is consistent with firms reporting more conservative numbers investing more efficiently and in more profitable projects. Our results add to a growing stream of literature suggesting that eliminating conservatism from accounting regulatory frameworks may lead to undesirable economic consequences...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} degree to which American workers are treated like second-class parties by {{corporate}} leaders. When business firms do well, share <b>holders</b> and <b>managers</b> obtain significant financial gains, but rank-and-file workers do not usually share in those gains. On the other hand, when firms do poorly, thousands of employees are laid off, while managers obtain bonuses for their forthright actions designed to curtail labor costs. These developments correspond directly to the decline of labor organizations in the United States. When unions represented 35 percent of private sector workers in the late 1950 s and 1960 s, wages and benefits were increased annually. Once union membership began to decline, employers decided they no longer had to consider employee interests. Today, with fewer than 8 percent of private sector employees in labor organizations, managers exercise complete control over their employees. If this trend is to be reversed, either unions have to develop new methods to appeal to new-age workers in the white-collar and service sectors or Congress will have to enact laws requiring corporate managers to consider the interests of regular employees when they make business decisions...|$|R

The study covers a period of 5 years from 1997 through 2001. The study is based on the 100 blue-chip stocks, majority of which are derived from CI components. The findings suggest a positive and significant association between level of level of risk at lower level and managerial ownership while a negative and significant association is also evidenced between risk at higher level and managerial ownership concentration. While debt policy which serves as positive monitoring substitute for agency conflict is found to be positive and significant explaining the level of ownership concentration. Furthermore, dividend policies, which also serve as monitoring, substitute to reduce agency conflict between manager and external shareholders do not appear to have any significant impact on managerial ownership. On the other hand, the level of institutional ownership, which serves as external monitoring force, is found to have inverse impact on level of managerial ownership concentration. This is marginally significant at 10 level (p=. 12). The findings, in part explain the argument that the managerial ownership help reduce agency conflict between outside equity <b>holders</b> and <b>managers.</b> <br /...|$|R
