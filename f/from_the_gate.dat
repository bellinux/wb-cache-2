5|$|Constructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is {{situated}} westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, {{built at the}} same period, leads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> to St. John Fortress. The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century when the sewage system was completed, and building houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed.|$|E
5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate)</b> is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from clogging up with snow.|$|E

5|$|The jet, already {{several hours}} behind schedule, then {{suffered}} further delays taxiing to the runway. The weather had created heavy ground traffic at LaGuardia, {{and it was}} reported that there were queues of aircraft waiting for permission for takeoff.

5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer a few feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|Five weeks later, Oxbow {{was entered}} in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) Risen Star Stakes. Ridden {{for the third time}} by Jon Court, Oxbow was {{assigned}} the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first turn. In the stretch, Oxbow took the lead but could not hold it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other in a blanket finish. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. Oxbow again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more points toward Derby qualification.|$|E

5|$|The Meridian Gate has two {{protruding}} wings forming {{three sides}} of a square (Wumen, or Meridian Gate, Square) before it. The gate has five gateways. The central gateway {{is part of the}} Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, and leads all the way <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of China in the south to Jingshan in the north. Only the Emperor may walk or ride on the Imperial Way, except for the Empress on the occasion of her wedding, and successful students after the Imperial Examination.|$|E
5|$|The National Register of Historic Places listing for Hebron Church {{includes}} the brick church and cemetery. They are accessible from WV 259 by a semicircular asphalt driveway, {{separated from the}} church and cemetery by a wrought iron fence and lined with large, old-growth maple trees along the property's northwestern perimeter. A paved brick walkway leads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to the northwestern façade and two main entrances of the church. The church is surrounded on its northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern sides by a cemetery which is still in use. The cemetery contains over 600 gravestones, several yuccas, a hemlock tree, and a boxwood. A modern brick community building, within the historic boundary south {{of the church and}} cemetery, is used for church activities.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{appears in}} his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend Winry Rockbell, who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris {{military}} manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers {{with the help}} of Roy Mustang. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> and killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal the Gate and follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah, intending to close the gate and destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack. They enjoy their new lives together as they leave Germany with Noah, while on the Elric brothers homeworld, their friends go back to their normal lives.|$|E

5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E
