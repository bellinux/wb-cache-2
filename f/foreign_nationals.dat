5|$|This placed {{restrictions}} on the caretaker government of Fraser. Until {{the results of the}} 13 December election were known any action required approval from both political parties and the Governor General. On 4 December 1975 Australia unsuccessfully sought a UN resolution to determine the independence of East Timor, the Australian Government evacuated Australians and other <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from Dili.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of bank, lender or {{mortgage}} company, to offer <b>Foreign</b> <b>National</b> Mortgage loans are those in and around major cities. These lenders are situated where there is a large <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> population base due to high immigration rates. The lenders in new immigration hubs {{are more likely to have}} <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> mortgage loan programs so they can serve their local community.|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} were attracted to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. As {{with the majority of}} towns and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> mostly of Eastern European origin, in recent years and these now make up just over 10% of the population.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1794, Congress {{approved}} {{an amendment}} to the United States Constitution clarifying judicial power over <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> and limiting the ability of citizens to sue states in federal courts and under federal law, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification. The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified by the requisite number of states (then 12) on February 7, 1795, {{to become part of the}} Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Ireland in {{particular}} has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> as of 2006, about 10% of the population. A quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside Ireland. Chinese and Nigerians, along with people from other African countries, have accounted for {{a large proportion of}} the non–European Union migrants to Ireland. Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> is {{a person}} who is not a citizen of the host country in which he or she is {{residing}} or temporarily sojourning. For example, a <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> in Canada is someone who is neither a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident of Canada. However, in the European Union, a <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> is a third country national, i.e. someone who is not a citizen of any of the member states of the European Union.|$|R
50|$|The only American {{currently}} coaching a <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> team is Thomas Dooley, former {{captain of}} the U.S. national team, who {{was hired by the}} Philippines in 2014.

5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war. As {{part of the}} Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, the ships were awarded to the victorious powers as war prizes. Kolberg was {{allocated}} to France, where she was commissioned into the French Navy as Colmar. Augsburg was transferred to Japanese control; having no use for her, they sold the ship for scrapping. Colmar saw one tour on colonial duty in Asia in 1924, where she participated in a multinational operation to protect <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from Chinese unrest in Shanghai. She was subsequently stricken in 1927 and broken up for scrap in Brest, France.|$|E
5|$|Extradition {{requests}} {{had been}} granted in the past (For example, in 2002 Murad Garabayev has been handed to Turkmenistan., Garabayev's extradition was later found unlawful by the Russian courts and he was awarded 20,000 Euros in damages to be paid by the Russian government by the European Court of Human Rights.) Article 63 does not explicitly mention Russian citizens, and therefore {{does not apply to}} them, but only to <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> living in Russia. Article 61 supersedes it for the people holding the Russian citizenship.|$|E

5|$|Following the surrender, IX Corps was {{assigned}} command of occupation {{forces on the}} northern island of Hokkaidō. IX Corps transferred its headquarters in October 1945 to Sapporo for occupation duties. The next few years were a period during which {{the terms of the}} surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.|$|E
5|$|For the JATO project, {{they were}} joined by Caltech {{mathematician}} Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.|$|E

Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> would be protected and to request against French military intervention. In Paris, President Charles de Gaulle decided against the plea.|$|E

5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was {{a citizen of the}} United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> of non-Chinese descent.|$|E
5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals)</b> and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} hostilities, I Corps was {{assigned}} to occupation duty in Japan. On 19 September 1945 the corps, with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division, sailed from Lingayen Gulf for Japan, landing {{on the island of}} Honshū on 25 September, three weeks after Japan's formal surrender. The next few years were a period during which the terms of the surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.|$|E
5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and {{at least twice as}} many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1940, Himmler {{opened up}} Waffen-SS {{recruiting}} to ethnic Germans {{that were not}} German citizens. In March 1941, the SS Main Office established the Germanische Leitstelle (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish Waffen-SS recruiting offices in Nazi-occupied Europe. The majority of the resulting foreign Waffen-SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the SS-Wiking and SS-Nordland. Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the SS-Nederland legion, and their Walloon compatriots joined the SS-Wallonien. By the end of 1943 {{about a quarter of}} the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe, and by June 1944, half the Waffen-SS were <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b>|$|E
