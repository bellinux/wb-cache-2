5|$|From {{the start}} of the liturgical year on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in Advent, Bach {{composed}} prolifically. He wrote works for three consecutive Sundays in Advent, prompted probably by the death of the Kapellmeister Johann Samuel Drese on 1 December 1716.

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata at a decisive {{turning point in}} his career. Moving from posts {{in the service of}} churches and courts to the town of Leipzig on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity, 30 May 1723, he began the project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year. He began his first annual cycle of cantatas ambitiously with , in an unusual layout of 14 movements in two symmetrical parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. , performed a week later, has the same structure.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{followed}} a specific structure {{for most of}} the cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle, especially the 40 he presented consecutively from the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity of 1724 to Palm Sunday of 1725. In this chorale cantata format he retained the original text and melody of the chorale on which the cantata was based in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, usually with music independent of the chorale tune.|$|E

Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping.

5|$|In {{his second}} year in Leipzig, Bach {{composed}} chorale cantatas between the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, this one being {{the first of the}} series especially written for Bach. He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the St John Passion.|$|E
