5|$|Additional <b>diacritics</b> are {{provided}} by the Extensions to the IPA for speech pathology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diacritics</b> {{are used}} for phonetic detail. They are added to IPA letters to {{indicate}} a modification or specification of that letter's normal pronunciation.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{letters or}} <b>diacritics</b> are added, removed or {{modified}} by the International Phonetic Association. As {{of the most}} recent change in 2005, there are 107 letters, 52 <b>diacritics</b> and four prosodic marks in the IPA. These are shown in the current IPA chart, posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA.|$|E
500|$|Vowels {{come in two}} shapes: {{independent}} and <b>diacritic.</b> The independent shape is used when a vowel does not follow a consonant, e.g. {{at the beginning of}} a word. The <b>diacritic</b> shape is used when a vowel follows a consonant. Depending on the vowel, the <b>diacritic</b> can attach at several places. The <b>diacritic</b> for [...] attaches above the consonant, the <b>diacritic</b> for [...] attaches below, the <b>diacritic</b> for [...] follows, while the <b>diacritic</b> for [...] precedes. [...] finally is marked by the combination of preceding [...] and following [...]|$|R
50|$|Compose <b>diacritic</b> marked graphemes from letter {{characters}} {{and one or}} more separate combining <b>diacritic</b> marks.|$|R
50|$|The {{half ring}} as a <b>diacritic</b> mark {{should not be}} {{confused}} with the comma or ogonek <b>diacritic</b> marks.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} a single letter for the coronal places of {{articulation}} for all consonants but fricatives, when dealing with a particular language, the letters may be treated as specifically dental, alveolar, or post-alveolar, as appropriate for that language, without <b>diacritics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed {{ligatures}} and abbreviations for nomina sacra, including <b>diacritics</b> called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing {{materials such as}} vellum were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The breathings (rough {{and smooth}} breathing) and accents (see e.g. Greek <b>diacritics)</b> are given fully and usually correctly. The breathings are {{indicated}} by sigla ⊢ and ⊣, {{often used in}} codices from the 9th and 10th century. In some cases breathings are given incorrectly (e.g. Matthew 9,7.16).|$|E
5000|$|Words spelled with a {{consonant}} {{modified by}} a <b>diacritic</b> follow words spelled {{with the same}} consonant and dependent vowel symbol but without the <b>diacritic.</b> [...] However, words spelled with [...] (a bâ converted to a p sound by a <b>diacritic)</b> follow all words with unmodified [...] bâ (without <b>diacritic</b> and without subscript). [...] Sometimes words in which [...] is pronounced p are ordered as if the letter were written [...]|$|R
5000|$|Also, in some instances, a <b>diacritic</b> will {{be written}} like a macron, {{although}} it represents another <b>diacritic</b> whose standard form is different: ...|$|R
2500|$|... : Adding two {{vertical}} dots (sh'va) [...] to the [...] "short-vowel" [...] <b>diacritic</b> {{produces the}} <b>diacritic</b> for [...] "very short vowel" [...] ( [...] ).|$|R
5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either <b>diacritics</b> (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which {{was used in the}} Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. ISO 15919 is an international standard for the transliteration of Tamil and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses <b>diacritics</b> to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. Tamil can be transliterated into English by using ISO 15919, since English language uses the Latin script for writing.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of <b>diacritics</b> were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E
5000|$|The ring as a <b>diacritic</b> mark {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the dot or [...] <b>diacritic</b> marks, or with the degree sign °.|$|R
50|$|A tittle or {{superscript}} dot {{is a small}} distinguishing mark, such as a <b>diacritic</b> or the dot on a lowercase i or j. The tittle is {{an integral}} part of the glyph of i and j, but <b>diacritic</b> dots can appear over other letters in various languages. In most languages, the tittle of i or j is omitted when a <b>diacritic</b> is placed in the tittle's usual position (as í or ĵ), but not when the <b>diacritic</b> appears elsewhere (as į, ɉ).|$|R
5000|$|... 2 : Adding two {{vertical}} dots (sh'va) [...] to the [...] "short-vowel" [...] <b>diacritic</b> {{produces the}} <b>diacritic</b> for [...] "very short vowel" [...] (חטף [...] ).|$|R
5|$|Georgian scripts {{are unique}} in their {{appearance}} and their exact origin {{has never been}} established; however, in strictly structural terms, their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet, {{with the exception of}} letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end. Originally consisting of 38 letters, Georgian is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are currently obsolete in that language. The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies. The Mingrelian language uses 36, 33 of which are current Georgian letters, one obsolete Georgian letter, and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and Svan. That same obsolete letter, plus a letter borrowed from Greek (making 35 letters total), are used in writing the Laz language. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but when it is, it uses Georgian letters as utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional obsolete Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by <b>diacritics</b> for its many vowels.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from {{a small number of}} trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without <b>diacritics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other than common <b>diacritics,</b> Urdu {{also has}} special <b>diacritics,</b> {{which are often}} found only in {{dictionaries}} for the clarification of irregular pronunciation. These <b>diacritics</b> include Kasrah-e-Majhool, Fathah-e-Majhool, Dammah-e-Majhool, Maghnoona, Ulta Jazam, Alif-e-Wavi and some other very rare <b>diacritics.</b> Among these, only Maghnoona is used commonly in dictionaries and has a unicode representation at u0658. Other <b>diacritics</b> are only rarely written in printed form mainly in some advance dictionaries.|$|E
50|$|Icelandic sorts {{some special}} letters at the end, {{as well as}} one letter with <b>diacritic,</b> while others with <b>diacritic</b> are sorted behind the {{corresponding}} non-diacritic letter.|$|R
40|$|In Greek orthography, stress {{position}} is {{marked with a}} <b>diacritic.</b> We investigated the developmental course of processing the stress <b>diacritic</b> in Grades 2 to 4. Ninety children read 108 pseudowords presented without or with a <b>diacritic</b> either in the same or in a different position relative to the source word. Half of the pseudowords resembled the words they were derived from. Results showed that lexical sources of stress assignment were active in Grade 2 and remained stronger than the <b>diacritic</b> through Grade 4. The effect of the <b>diacritic</b> increased more rapidly and approached the lexical effect with increasing grade. In a second experiment, 90 children read 54 words and 54 pseudowords. The pattern of results for words {{was similar to that}} for nonwords suggesting that findings regarding stress assignment using nonwords may generalize to word reading. Decoding of the <b>diacritic</b> {{does not appear to be}} the preferred option for developing readers...|$|R
5000|$|In English, {{the name}} is {{normally}} spelled [...] "Maori", without the <b>diacritic.</b> Most major news outlets (for example, Stuff and the New Zealand Herald) all omit the <b>diacritic.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Diacritics</b> {{are widely}} used in Americanist {{notation}}. Unlike the IPA, which seeks to use as few <b>diacritics</b> as possible, the Americanist notation uses a narrow set of symbols and then relies on <b>diacritics</b> to indicate a sound's phonetic value.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} languages have {{letters that}} contain <b>diacritics</b> {{that are considered}} independent letters distinct from those without <b>diacritics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{superscript}} rhotic <b>diacritics</b> were {{no longer}} mentioned, though they were still available, as they follow from the general principals of <b>diacritics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The voiceless denti-alveolar {{sibilant}} is {{the only}} sibilant fricative in some dialects of Andalusian Spanish. It has no official symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet, though its features would be transcribed [...] or [...] (using the , the <b>diacritic</b> marking a laminal consonant, and , the <b>diacritic</b> marking a dental consonant). It is usually represented by an ad-hoc symbol such as , , or [...] (advanced <b>diacritic).</b>|$|R
25|$|A tone <b>diacritic</b> {{is placed}} above some {{consonant}} letters to cover sounds {{not found in}} Manding, such as gb-dot for /g/ (a different <b>diacritic</b> produces /ɣ/) and f-dot for /v/.|$|R
5000|$|Linguolabial consonants are {{transcribed}} in the International Phonetic Alphabet {{by adding}} the [...] "seagull" [...] <b>diacritic,</b> , to the corresponding alveolar consonant, or with the apical <b>diacritic,</b> , on the corresponding bilabial consonant.|$|R
25|$|Urdu {{uses the}} same subset of <b>diacritics</b> used in Arabic based on Persian conventions. Urdu also uses Persian names of the <b>diacritics</b> instead of Arabic names. Commonly used <b>diacritics</b> are Zabar (Arabic Fatḥah), Zer (Arabic Kasrah), Pesh (Arabic Ḍammah) which are used to clarify the {{pronunciation}} of vowels. Jazam (Arabic Sukun) is used to indicate a Consonant Cluster and Shad (Arabic Tashdid) {{which is used to}} indicate a Gemination. Other <b>diacritics</b> include Khari Zabar (Arabic Dagger alif), Do Zabar (Arabic Fathatan) which are found in some common Arabic loan words. Other Arabic <b>diacritics</b> are also sometimes used though very rarely in loan words from Arabic. Zer-e-Izafat and Hamza-e-Izafat are described in next section.|$|E
25|$|Unassimilated foreign loanwords, or {{borrowed}} words, are spelled as {{in their}} language of origin. Their spelling may contain <b>diacritics,</b> or accent marks. If the <b>diacritics</b> do not affect pronunciation, they are removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest and}} largest is the Brahmic family of India and Southeast Asia, in which vowels are marked with <b>diacritics</b> and syllable-final consonants, when they occur, are {{indicated}} with ligatures, <b>diacritics,</b> or with a special vowel-canceling mark.|$|E
50|$|The IPA {{and many}} other phonetic alphabets use two systems to {{indicate}} tone: a <b>diacritic</b> system and an adscript system. In the <b>diacritic</b> system, the double acute represents an extra high tone.|$|R
2500|$|The non-syllabic <b>diacritic</b> is {{only used}} when necessary. It is {{typically}} omitted {{when there is}} no ambiguity, as in [...] No words in English have the vowel sequences , so the non-syllabic <b>diacritic</b> is unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|Virama, a zero-vowel <b>diacritic</b> in many abugidas, such as Hindi Devanagari. The virama {{marks the}} absence of a vowel; {{the absence of}} a virama or vowel <b>diacritic</b> implies an {{inherent}} vowel such as schwa.|$|R
