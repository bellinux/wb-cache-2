25|$|Performance of cross <b>interleaver</b> : As {{shown in}} the above <b>interleaver</b> figure, the output is nothing but the {{diagonal}} symbols generated {{at the end of}} each delay line. In this case, when the input multiplexer switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half message at receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also reduced by half which is good improvement over the block <b>interleaver.</b> Thus, the total <b>interleaver</b> memory is split between transmitter and receiver.|$|E

25|$|Drawbacks of block <b>interleaver</b> : As it {{is clear}} from the figure, the columns are read sequentially, the {{receiver}} can interpret single row only after it receives complete message and not before that. Also, the receiver requires a considerable amount of memory in order to store the received symbols and has to store the complete message. Thus, these factors give rise to two drawbacks, one is the latency and other is the storage (fairly large amount of memory). These drawbacks can be avoided by using the convolutional <b>interleaver</b> described below.|$|E

25|$|Without error {{correcting}} codes, {{digital audio}} {{would not be}} technically feasible. The Reed–Solomon codes can correct a corrupted symbol with a single bit error just as easily as it can correct a symbol with all bits wrong. This makes the RS codes particularly suitable for correcting burst errors. By far, the most common application of RS codes is in compact discs. In addition to basic error correction provided by RS codes, protection against burst errors due to scratches on the disc is provided by a cross <b>interleaver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interleaving is used {{to convert}} {{convolutional}} codes from random error correctors to burst error correctors. The basic idea behind the use of interleaved codes is to jumble symbols at the receiver. This leads to randomization of bursts of received errors which are closely located and we can then apply the analysis for random channel. Thus, the main function performed by the <b>interleaver</b> at transmitter is to alter the input symbol sequence. At the receiver, the deinterleaver will alter the received sequence to get back the original unaltered sequence at the transmitter.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional {{interleaving}} schemes with repetitions are considered. These schemes {{are required}} for the correction of two-dimensional bursts (or clusters) of errors in applications such as optical recording and holographic storage. We assume that a cluster of errors may have an arbitrary shape, and is characterized solely by its area l. Thus, an interleaving scheme A(l, r) of strength l with r repetitions is an (infinite) array of integers defined by the property that every integer appears no more than r times in any connected component of area t. The problem is to minimize, for a given l and r, the interleaving degree deg A(l, r), which is {{the total number of}} distinct integers contained in the array. Optimal interleaving schemes for r = 1 (no repetitions) have been devised in earlier work. Here, we consider interleaving schemes for r &ge; 2. Such schemes reduce the overall redundancy, yet are considerably more difficult to construct and analyze. To this end, we generalize the concept of L_ 1 -distance and introduce the notions of tristance, quadristance, and more generally r-dispersion. We focus on the special class of interleaving schemes, called lattice <b>interleavers,</b> that is akin to the class of linear codes in coding theory.
