Their problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause inflationary pressure.|$|E

25|$|Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield {{featuring}} {{a number of}} local landmarks and associations. The lions flanking the shield came from the Northumberland family (of which Harry Hotspur was a member). The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards {{from the ground and}} the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto Audere Est Facere (to dare <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do).</b>|$|E

25|$|Very recently, {{there has}} been a rise in {{scientific}} investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult may gain stereopsis, it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with infantile esotropia are still under study.|$|E
25|$|What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{the same}} work as a man, will require {{the same amount of}} food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given {{insufficient}} food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.|$|E
25|$|When managed {{according}} to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally mulesed {{a few weeks after}} birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as ear marking, tail docking, and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.|$|E
5000|$|Another construction, [...] "to be to", {{also has}} similar denotations in some constructions, e.g. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> see the Queen the next day." [...] However, its use <b>is</b> {{restricted}} <b>to</b> simple finite {{forms of the}} copula, namely the present indicative ("I <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it"), the past indicative ("I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it"), and the past subjunctive ("if I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it" [...] or [...] "were I <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it"; these last have somewhat different implications, as described at English conditional sentences).|$|R

25|$|Tubal {{ligation}} can predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) {{carries a}} risk for ectopic pregnancy. This is higher if more destructive methods of tubal ligation (tubal cautery, partial {{removal of the}} tubes) have been used than less destructive methods (tubal clipping). A history of a tubal pregnancy {{increases the risk of}} future occurrences to about 10%. This risk is not reduced by removing the affected tube, even if the other tube appears normal. The best method for diagnosing this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an early ultrasound.|$|E

500|$|Alexander [...] "Sandy" [...] Stoddart (born 1959) is a Scottish sculptor, who, since 2008, {{has been}} the Queen's Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland. He works {{primarily}} on figurative sculpture in clay within the neoclassical tradition. Stoddart {{is best known for}} his civic monuments, including [...] bronze statues of David Hume and Adam Smith, philosophers during the Scottish Enlightenment, on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, and others of James Clerk Maxwell, William Henry Playfair and John Witherspoon. Stoddart says of his own motivation, [...] "My great ambition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> sculpture for Scotland", primarily through large civic monuments to figures from the country's past.|$|E

500|$|Paul Birchard {{was cast}} as Libby McCall because the {{producers}} believed he {{acted like a}} [...] "dinosaur" [...] from the former Bush administration. Child actor Luke Tzortzis was cast as Nico since they were impressed with his intelligence and the fact he is a [...] "strong" [...] actor; children are often hard to work with in the series, but in Tzortzis' case, he would ask the production crew several questions between takes {{in order to do}} understand what he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the episode. It was also Tzortzis' first performance as an actor, having no past experiences.|$|E
500|$|Wang was {{enthusiastic}} {{about his new}} role, describing Kim's background by saying that [...] "I had a stellar Starfleet Academy career and am basically the rookie on the bridge. I'm an Asian-American. There's the professional competence, but also the inner fear, 'Oh my God, are these britches too big for me?' His heritage is one of focus, of Zen and martial arts". Of the casting, he said that [...] "My goal now <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the best job possible playing Harry Kim and to begin repaying my parents for the unaccountable financial support they have given me throughout the years."

500|$|Starved and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia were {{developed}} for FX {{under the auspices}} of FX president John Landgraf, who sought to expand the network's viewership by providing a wider variety of programming. The shows were the network's first attempts at sitcoms following the short-lived 2003 series Lucky. FX at the time was known primarily for its edgy dramatic series. Bruce Lefkowitz, then executive vice president of Fox Cable Entertainment, outlined the strategy: [...] "We kind of staked out a unique space in dramas that are very different from everybody else’s, so the next natural evolution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something in the comedy space." [...] The network ordered seven episodes of each series.|$|E

500|$|A {{flexible}} {{search strategy}} tunes SIM Lite's mass sensitivity at each star {{to a desired}} level in the habitable planet search. [...] The value of ηEarth (Eta_Earth), the fraction of stars carrying Earth-analog planets, will be estimated by the Kepler Mission some time before SIM Lite launches. One strategy for a habitable planet search <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a 'deeper' search (i.e. to lower mass sensitivity in the habitable zone) of {{a smaller number of}} targets if Earth analogs are common. A 'shallower' search of a larger number of targets could have been done if Earth analogs are rarer. For example, assuming that 40% of mission time is allocated for the planet search, SIM Lite could have surveyed: ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fourth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson was delighted with his performance, saying, [...] "The {{truth of it}} <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that's never been done in this sport -- to love the sport like I do and respect it like I do -- and the greats: Petty, Earnhardt, Gordon ... to do something they've never done is so awesome. To win four championships in eight years, what this team has done ... I don't know where to start. It's unbelievable." [...] Burton, who finished second, commended Johnson's achievements saying, [...] "It’s hard to say he’s the best when you’re out there racing against him, {{but you have to}} put him on the list.” Martin, who finished second in points, said, ...|$|E
500|$|By June 1971, some Democratic {{senators}} {{opposed to}} the war wanted to limit the renewal to a one-year extension, while others wanted to end it immediately; Gravel reiterated {{that he was one}} of the latter, saying, [...] "It's a senseless war, and one way to do away with it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away with the draft." [...] A Senate vote on June 4 indicated majority support for the two-year extension. On June 18 Gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation, defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation. The first filibuster attempt failed on June 23 when, by three votes, the Senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since 1927.|$|E

500|$|Kahn {{also said}} that instead of taking the song's lyrics and being [...] "pretentious" [...] about it, {{he wanted to show}} the {{audience}} exactly what Brown was singing about, commenting, [...] "What if we just got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics? The trick <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in a creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time." [...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown {{in the middle of a}} squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.|$|E
500|$|In February 2005, Griffin {{was asked}} {{to take part in}} a debate on {{multiculturalism}} at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said [...] "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in public in a debate." [...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." [...] The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Jeff Simon described Hoffman as [...] "probably {{the most}} in-demand character actor of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never {{to take it}} for granted that he would be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, [...] "I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out." [...] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in [...] "a school-of-hard-knocks way", remarking that [...] "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, [...] "ultimately my main goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." [...] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.|$|E
