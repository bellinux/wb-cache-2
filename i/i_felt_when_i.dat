500|$|After {{the start}} of the 21st century, Buckles {{continued}} living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency". He has also stated that, [...] "If your country needs you, you should be right there, that is the way <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young, and that's the way I feel today." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{explained}} that the song's theme was [...] "complete loneliness," [...] going on to state: [...] "It {{was important to me}} that that there'd be something searingly poetic about it, in a lyrical sense, and yet jubilant at the same time." [...] Goddard described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness [...] a shattering left-hook of self-loathing, loss and desperation". Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special." [...] The singer said he was particularly proud of the song's second verse, which included the lines [...] "Though we may be hidden by rags/We have something they'll never have." [...] Morrissey {{explained that}} the verse described [...] "how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> couldn't afford clothes and used to dress in rags but I didn't really feel mentally impoverished." ...|$|E

6000|$|His wife {{remained}} serious. [...] "It was a {{very fine}} point,--a very little thing to reject a man for. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first read her letter about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel bright," [...] said Jim. [...] "For one thing, I've got up, {{and then}} you have been here some time. You brace one. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was very sick." ...|$|R
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{picked him}} for the first Test, and on the very first {{occasion}} he touched a ball in Test rugby he found himself opposed one-on-one by Stu Wilson, then widely rated the number-one winger in the world, in the middle of Lancaster Park. Campese stood Wilson up and ran around him so easily that he might have been playing Test Rugby for years. He did it once or twice again before the match was over and on one occasion scored a try. I was enthused, and so was the media. They wrote of him in glowing terms next day... I don't believe I have ever lost the sense of wonder at his ability which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw him run around Stu Wilson on Lancaster Park." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another storyline Nancy became romantically {{involved}} with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox {{said that when}} series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy [...] "would go well together" [...] but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be {{involved with}} Ravi {{at the same time}} she was [...] "quite shocked". She expanded on this, saying: [...] "Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to have a lot of fun with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and times when you don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would [...] "be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts". She added that Nancy is [...] "speechless" [...] which is different for her as [...] "she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything". Fox said that Nancy has [...] "no right" [...] to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: [...] "No words could describe how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read it for the first time!" [...] The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with [...] "someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long".|$|E
60|$|Those words {{seemed to}} awaken in her {{something}} of the hope which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> uttered them. She replied to my questions with more than docility--she exerted her intelligence; she willingly opened her whole mind to me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The passion <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> Martin, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{dared not}} do this,' he said, 'was in the blow I struck just now. Why did we ever part! How could we ever part! How could you ever fly {{from me to}} him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|She added after a pause--"There {{has been}} a time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> could {{understand}} him. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> knew what was in his mind better than he knew it himself. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> him. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> held him. [...] . And now he has escaped." ...|$|R
60|$|With these {{pleasant}} anticipations, I {{opened the}} letter. Judge what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found {{what it really}} contained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very, Ralph! I {{would rather}} go through twenty battles, again, than feel as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw you start, {{and thought that}} I should never see you again, alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposing--I {{only say}} supposing--I felt now, as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{traveled}} to London with Armadale; and when I saw {{my way to}} his life as plainly as I saw the man himself all through the journey...? ...|$|E
5000|$|To quote {{an excerpt}} from his book: [...] "Einstein once wrote of America that its people were “always becoming, never being,” {{but it was in}} India now that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that sense of newness, of {{perpetual}} reinvention and forward momentum that <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first moved to America".|$|R
60|$|All the {{particulars}} of the fatal duel which I had gleaned from the French newspaper in Monkton's room at Naples recurred vividly to my memory. The suspicion that <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> looked into the outhouse became a certainty as I listened to the old monk's last words.|$|R
60|$|She ceased abruptly, {{and grew}} pale, while <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> ashamed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw {{the cause of}} it. My hands had been reddened from {{clearing}} my eyes, and glove and wrist were foul with crimson stains. Courageous as she was, the girl had sickened {{at the sight of}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, lady, you do {{not know}} the grief <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was made acquainted with your terrible loss. I knew your dear husband in Rome, and I always felt for him a most {{profound}} affection and esteem.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Wasn't it extraordinary? <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw my cloak in Scotland Yard: There, I KNEW I should recover you. And I always feel, as I say, {{that there}} is some higher power which helps me. Do you feel the same?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little bit}} excited about it, aren't you?" [...] he smilingly said. [...] "I {{remember}} how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to Chicago the first time. I suppose {{this seems like}} Chicago to you. How did you leave {{the people in the}} coulé, all well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} what agony <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when,</b> as <b>I</b> entered the open space, I saw a surging mass of Sepoys, and no sign of any of you; and how I cursed my own folly, and what delight <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> as on cutting our way through we found that you were still on your feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very bad}} poetry, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote it, one day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was very lonely, {{and had a}} good cry on a rag bag. I {{never thought it would}} go where it could tell tales," [...] said Jo, tearing up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.|$|R
60|$|Ned was a lank, tow-headed {{youth of}} about fourteen, with shifty, {{twinkling}} eyes {{that could never}} look you straight in the face. His appearance was anything but prepossessing, and <b>I</b> always <b>felt,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> looked at him, that if anyone {{wanted to do a}} piece of shady work by proxy, Ned Brooke would be the very lad for the business.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you ought}} to break {{yourself}} in at once. Just break the ice and you'll have no further trouble. I remember just how bad <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first came to New York to look for work. But I'm over it now, thank goodness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Father John, av {{you could}} feel all <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first knew the man was dead--when my own sisther spurned me--and when {{my father told me}} I was a murdherer, you wouldn't wonder at my flying, av it were only for an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what he told me then; but I know that I told him that I was engaged; and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> told him so that my {{engagement}} was a sorrow to me. And it has been a sorrow from that day to this." ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{few moments}} Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of latent sensuousness: [...] "I've got him to care for me: yes! But I want him to more than care for me; I want him to have me--to marry me! I must have him. I can't do without him. He's {{the sort of man}} I long for. I shall go mad if I can't give myself to him altogether! <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> should <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first saw him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not till}} after dinner {{that the story}} was told about Crocker. [...] "Think what <b>I</b> must have <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was told that a clerk from the Post Office wanted to see me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't. But I {{always thought}} of her as little Elsie--she was a girl <b>when</b> <b>I</b> left home. I can {{understand}} what struck your brother: <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first saw her, after I came back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That was it, you know,' {{interposed}} {{the same}} small quiet voice that had spoken once before. 'I was quite abroad, mother, quite desolate, {{and to think}} that the sea was between us--oh, I never shall forget what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first thought that the sea was between us!' ...|$|E
60|$|The day which {{followed}} {{the day of}} Mr. Playmore's visit brought me news from Spain, in a letter from my mother-in-law. To describe what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> broke the seal and read the first lines is simply impossible. Let Mrs. Macallan be heard on this occasion in my place.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{remember}} now how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first understood we were shut in for ever. Shut in Surprise Valley where Venters had lived so long. I was glad. The Mormons {{would never get}} me. I was {{seven or eight years}} old then. From that time all is clear in my mind.|$|E
60|$|Guert was a {{thoroughly}} manly fellow, {{and he did}} us the justice to enter the parlour first. Poor fellow! I can feel for him, even at this distance of time, when his eye first fell on Mary Wallace's pallid and distressed countenance. It could scarcely be less than <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first beheld Anneke's flushed features, and the look of offended propriety that I fancied to be sparkling in her estranged eye.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} missing. <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was speaking. To me my voice {{had had no}} ring of conviction. And then I saw what it was. There was no mystery. We knew each other too well. Friendship kills love.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{a letter}} from Mr. Ford, Mistress Blythe, {{and he says the}} life-book is {{accepted}} and is going to be published next fall. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> fair uplifted <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got the news. To think that I'm to see it in print at last." ...|$|R
