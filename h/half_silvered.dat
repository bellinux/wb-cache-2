This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90° to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a <b>half</b> <b>silvered</b> or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining {{the image of an}} offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 [...] "Bazooka" [...] featured the D7161556 folding [...] "Reflecting Sight Assembly".|$|E

40|$|Virtual Tomographic Reflection (VTR) {{is a new}} {{augmented}} reality technique that allows users to view volumetric image data using an interaction paradigm based on medical ultrasound. VTR is essentially a “virtual ” version of the Sonic Flashlight, a a device that permits real-time in situ visualization of ultrasound images by reflecting calibrated images displayed on a flat-panel monitor from a partially transparent <b>half</b> <b>silvered</b> mirror [13], where the actual ultrasound scanner is replaced by an optical tracking / computer system capable of generating cross-sections through stored image data. The design of this system was motivated {{by the need to}} conduct psychophysical and accuracy analysis of the real Sonic Flashlight in a highly controlled artificial environment [12]. Here we present the fully developed version of our Virtual Tomographic Reflection (VTR) device and describe the overall system architecture as well as a highly accurate method for calibrating the system. In addition, we describe proposed psychophysical studies and the utility of VTR as a tool to explore very large medical image datasets derived from the National Library of Medicine Visible Human project. {{augmented reality}}, medicine, psychology, visualiza...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a silicon retina that measures image sharpness. The {{idea is to}} use this sensor in the image plane of an autofocusing camera system [3]. The chip has 25 x 26 pixels, each (60 m) 2, is fabricated on a (2. 2 mm) 2 1. 2 m CMOS process, and consumes 100 A with 5 V supply. 1. ALGORITHM Image defocus corresponds to a filtering operation on the image with a circular cookie-cutter kernel whose diameter {{is proportional to the}} distance the image is away from the plane of focus and to the lens f number [...] the ratio of focal length to lens aperture.

40|$|Augmented reality systems show {{great promise}} for {{improving}} the ability of medical personnel to incorporate image guidance into {{a wider variety of}} procedures than they are currently able. In its present form, medical image guidance often requires that patients be moved to a specialized interventional radiology suite and that specially trained personnel conduct the image guided therapy. Much of the difficulty in medical image guidance centers on mentally fusing the medical image with the patient’s body. Augmented reality systems can alleviate this difficulty be visually fusing the medical image with the patient’s body, allowing much more natural guidance. Among the questions that can be asked about augmented reality systems in medicine are A) “Do these systems actually improve the ability of medical personnel to treat patient? ” and B) “How do these systems affect perception of the medical image information?” This dissertation focuses on the Sonic Flashlight, an augmented reality device that provides realtime in situ visualization of ultrasound images by reflecting calibrated images displayed on a flat-panel monitor from a partially transparent <b>half</b> <b>silvered</b> mirror. Quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of the Sonic Flashlight versus conventional ultrasound guidance is difficult {{because of the lack of}} a real-world “gold-standard ” reference frame in which to report results.

40|$|In 1986, H. Berber and Hooper {{examined}} the signals {{that could be}} detected by an airborne lidar flying above the marine boundary layer (MBL). One signal (aureole) formed from laser light returned to the receiver after a reflect off the ocean and forward scatter off the aerosol particles appeared to be both detectable and related to the optical depth of the MBL. Now, research has been directed towards developing a practical instrument to measure the aureole and finding an algorithm to use the information. Unlike the lidar backscatter which typically requires a telescope with a narrow field of view (0. 5 mrad), the aureole signal occurs over a wide field of view (50 mrad). To accommodate the totally different needs, a standard commercial Cassegrainian telescope was modified to yield a telescope with two focal planes. The secondary mirror {{was replaced by a}} lens, whose front surface was <b>half</b> <b>silvered</b> and curved to match the replaced mirror. Light reflecting off the lens focused behind the primary mirror. The back lens surface was curved to allow unreflected light to focus at the natural focus of the primary mirror. This focal plane which is behind the lens has a wide field of view. To calculate an extinction profile, the aureole optical depth estimate is combined with the lidar backscatter profile...|$|E

40|$|Medical {{ultrasound}} typically {{deals with}} {{the interior of the}} patient, with the exterior left to the original medical imaging modality, direct human vision. For the human operator scanning the patient, the view of the external anatomy is essential for correctly locating the ultrasound probe on the body and making sense of the resulting ultrasound images in their proper anatomical context. The operator, after all, is not expected to perform the scan with his eyes shut. Over the past decade, our laboratory has developed a method of fusing these two information streams {{in the mind of the}} operator, the Sonic Flashlight, which uses a <b>half</b> <b>silvered</b> mirror and miniature display mounted on an ultrasound probe to produce a virtual image within the patient at its proper location. We are now interested in developing a similar data fusion approach within the ultrasound machine itself, by, in effect, giving vision to the transducer. Our embodiment of this concept consists of an ultrasound probe with two small video cameras mounted on it, with software capable of locating the surface of an ultrasound phantom using stereo disparity between the two video images. We report its first successful operation, demonstrating a 3 D rendering of the phantom’s surface with the ultrasound data superimposed at its correct relative location. Eventually, automated analysis of these registered data sets may permit the scanner and its associated computational apparatus to interpret the ultrasound data within its anatomical context, much as the human operator does today...|$|E
