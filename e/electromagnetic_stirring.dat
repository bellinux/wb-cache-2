40|$|To {{produce a}} high quality semisolid slurry that {{consists}} of fine primary particles uniformly suspended in the liquid matrix for rheoforming, chemical refining and <b>electromagnetic</b> or mechanical <b>stirring</b> are the two methods commonly used. But these two methods either contaminate the melt or incur high cost. In this study, the damper cooling tube (DCT) method was designed to prepare semisolid slurry of A 356 aluminum alloy, and was compared with the low superheat casting (LSC) method - a conventional process used to produce casting slab with equiaxed dendrite microstructure for thixoforming route. A series of comparative experiments were performed at the pouring temperatures of 650 °C, 638 °C and 622 °C. Metallographic observations of the casting samples were carried out using an optical electron microscope with image analysis software. Results show that the microstructure of semisolid slurry produced by the DCT process consists of spherical primary α-Al grains, while equiaxed grains microstructure {{is found in the}} LSC process. The lower the pouring temperature, the smaller the grain size and the rounder the grain morphology in both methods. The copious nucleation, which could be generated in the DCT, owing to the cooling and stirring effect, is the key to producing high quality semisolid slurry.

30|$|Note {{that the}} forced {{convection}} induced by normal <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>stirring</b> does not suppress the channel segregates but controls their location {{according to the}} liquid flow patterns in this example. Figure  2 demonstrates the improving effect of modulated traveling <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>stirring</b> on macrosegregation. It is shown that modulated <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>stirring</b> may suppress the segregated channels if the modulation period, Tm, is chosen properly. If the value of Tm is too short, the flow is not sensitive to Lorentz forces, and the segregation pattern {{is similar to that}} obtained in the natural convection case. The concentration maps illustrated in Fig.  2 a show such a behavior. For a long modulation period, channels begin to form alternatively in the center and near the lateral walls, as in the steady stirring case illustrated in Fig.  2 b, c. The corresponding segregation pattern keeps the memory of the channel formations and disappearances, and the lateral segregations are almost suppressed. The latter result may be interpreted by considering both the required flow establishment time and the transit time of the flow inside the mushy zone. Note that the normal segregation is also slightly reduced by the modulation when the optimal period is used. If the value of Tm is too long, macrosegregation is recreated, as shown in Fig.  2 d.|$|E
