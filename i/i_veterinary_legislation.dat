40|$|Summary: Compliance {{with animal}} welfare and {{environmental}} health principles and <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> {{has an impact on}} {{the quantity and quality of}} the animal products produced. The quantity and quality of livestock and livestock products influences demand and prices and has an effect on income from the livestock industry and ultimately on gross domestic product (GDP) and food security. Environmental health on the other hand influences either negatively (in poor) or positively (in good) environmental health situations thereby has impact on the quantity and quality of livestock and livestock products and the level of contribution to GDP and food security. Both animal welfare {{and environmental health}} principles are well adhered to when adequate <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> provisions are implemented and enforced. Good, enforceable <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> and good <b>veterinary</b> governance are prerequisites for ensuring secure sanitary conditions and food safety and preventing the spread of animal diseases, and ultimately they enhance incomes and ensure the availability of wholesome food, thereby contributing to GDP and food security. It is therefore important to integrate these three components, namely animal welfare, environmental health and <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation,</b> in livestock production and marketin...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the Law on the {{veterinary}} activities from 2005 and its amendments 2006 - 2016 In {{the second part}} of the report an analysis is made of the philosophic nature and the main principles regulated by the Law on the {{veterinary activities}} from 2005 in their antiepizootic part. The pros and cons of the approaches used in European and world practice in <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> drafting are highlighted. One of the approaches includes only basic and constant principles of <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation,</b> while the other presents all regulatory norms with dynamic character that require periodic updating of the legislative basis. An analysis also is made of the dynamics of the amendments and additions of certain articles and paragraphs of the Law on the veterinary activities for the period 2006 - 2016 and their adequacy to the antiepizootic activities is assessed. An attempt is made to analyze the interrelationship and interdependence between the legal regulations of additions and amendments to the LVA and the material-technical, organizational and structural conditions for their practical implementation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{scientific}} analysis is to trace the genesis and development of <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> from 1881 to 2015, focusing on its anti-epizootic aspects. For this study the historical and dialectical and systematic approach and analysis were applied. The {{first part of the}} analysis covers the period until 2005 – the stage before the accession of the country to EU. There the first legislative acts from the post-liberation period 1897 - 1906 are analyzed, which {{marked the beginning of the}} regulated anti-epizootic activity, delegated as a primary duty of the state institutions. Special attention is paid to the Law on sanitary-veterinary service from 1924, elaborated by Prof. G. Pavlov, which laid down the foundations of the Public Veterinary Medicine in Bulgaria. An analysis is made of the basic principles in the legislative basis in the period of centralized planning (1945 - 1990) and the period of transition to market economy (1990 - 2004) before the accession of Bulgaria to the EU. The retrospective analysis of all laws from this 120 -year period shows that <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> has developed in line with the socio-political and economic conditions in the country, but it has always been in accordance with the international legal norms. The second part of the analysis, which includes the period following the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the EU, will interpret the organizational and legal, structural, professional, deontological, financial economic aspects and problems which occurred after the establishment of Bulgarian Food Safety Agency in order to improve the system related to animal health and food safety...|$|R

40|$|After {{the signing}} of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union and its {{ratification}} by all member states, Albania has made serious efforts towards the harmonization and approximation of its legislation, to align it more with the standards of the member countries. Setting of new game rules makes Albanian society walk safer in a process of integration, where the EU principles are inserted even better in domestic laws. Core legislation, food safety and veterinary fields, are some prerequisites that Albania should meet in its way towards full membership in the EU. For a long time now, Albania has been establishing new food and feed standards and all its actions are in full compliance with EU regulations and directives. In addition to adequate policies to enforce better the current legislation in respect with an effective consumer protection, it is worth mentioning full reforming and streamlining of functioning institutions in the framework of food safety. The <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> is a main discipline of veterinary medicine regulating veterinary service relations with food business operators. It establishes legal criteria and standards for animal health and welfare protection, public health, food safety and other related areas. ‘Acquis communautaire’ refers to the EU’s total body of legislation, i. e. everything from treaties to directives, the case-law of the Court of Justice, declarations and international agreements, etc. When a new member country is to be admitted to the EU, the point of departure is that it must satisfy the entire body of rules and regulations, i. e. the ‘acquis communautaire’ or the ‘acquis’ as it is also known, from the first day of membership.

40|$|The South African {{food safety}} and animal food control systems are {{developed}} and enforced by three government departments: Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Animal health relies heavily on veterinary drugs for controlling pests and diseases. Movement of animals and animal products, is also a potential method of transmission of pests and diseases within and between countries. Human health is inextricably linked to animal health and production through zoonotic and foodborne hazards. By eating animal products (meat, milk, eggs, etc.), humans are exposed to microbiological hazards and chemical residues. This paper will describe and critically review the relevant legislation and regulations {{as well as their}} implementation, highlighting discrepancies and overlaps. Four working groups of eight key informants performed a gap analysis and defined actions and steps to remedy the gaps for: 1) Legislation for the registration for veterinary drugs and pesticides in animal feeds; 2) Animal health <b>legislation,</b> including <b>veterinary</b> public health, biosecurity and animal diseases; 3) Microbiological hazards and chemical residues in food of animal origin; and 4) Laboratory capacity for residues and animal diseases surveillance and monitoring. There is a shortage of academic institutions devoted to teach applied regulatory toxicology and aquatic animal health. Furthermore, due to duplication of activities from two authorities regulating the registration of veterinary medicines and stock remedies, there is poor utilization of scare skills for surveillance, monitoring and evaluators responsible for human food safety evaluation of drugs intended for food animals. Food safety of animal products is fragmented as a result of it not being under only one Ministry. Different aspects of legislations fall under the three departments. Lines of responsibility are not always well understood as they sometimes overlap and inconsistently applied. There are also a number of stakeholders involved at local, regional and international level. International standards in line with Codex, World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), are followed, in line with international obligations. National governments and private sector standards are applied by producers and processors of animal derived food. At local level there are provincial and municipal regulations for implementation of National directives, as well as private standards of supermarkets, butchers, dairies and other retailers of animal derived foods. In conclusion, South Africa needs to have one broad <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> which covers animal disease control, registration and control of veterinary drugs (including insecticides manufactured for administration to animals), food safety including food protection, prevention and elimination of zoonoses and aspects of laboratory animal facilities and diagnostic laboratories, health education and extension...|$|R
40|$|Footrot is a widespread, {{infectious}} {{cause of}} lameness in sheep, with major economic and welfare costs. The aims {{of this research}} were: (i) to quantify how veterinary surgeons' beliefs regarding the efficacy of two treatments for footrot changed following {{a review of the}} evidence (ii) to obtain a consensus opinion following group discussions (iii) to capture complementary qualitative data to place their beliefs within a broader clinical context. Grounded in a Bayesian statistical framework, probabilistic elicitation (roulette method) was used to quantify the beliefs of eleven veterinary surgeons during two one-day workshops. There was considerable heterogeneity in veterinary surgeons' beliefs before they listened to a review of the evidence. After hearing the evidence, seven participants quantifiably changed their beliefs. In particular, two participants who initially believed that foot trimming with topical oxytetracycline was the better treatment, changed to entirely favour systemic and topical oxytetracycline instead. The results suggest that a substantial amount of the variation in beliefs related to differences in veterinary surgeons' knowledge of the evidence. Although considerable differences in opinion still remained after the evidence review, with several participants having non-overlapping 95 % credible intervals, both groups did achieve a consensus opinion. Two key findings from the qualitative data were: (<b>i)</b> <b>veterinary</b> surgeons believed that farmers are unlikely to actively seek advice on lameness, suggesting a proactive veterinary approach is required (ii) more attention could be given to improving the way in which veterinary advice is delivered to farmers. In summary this study has: (i) demonstrated a practical method for probabilistically quantifying how veterinary surgeons' beliefs change (ii) revealed that the evidence that currently exists is capable of changing veterinary opinion (iii) suggested that improved transfer of research knowledge into veterinary practice is needed (iv) identified some potential obstacles to the implementation of veterinary advice by farmers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceVeterinary pharmaceuticals, {{widely used}} in {{intensive}} livestock production, may contaminate surface waters. Identifying their sources and pathways in watersheds is difficult because <b>i)</b> most <b>veterinary</b> pharmaceuticals are used in human medicine as well and ii) septic or sewer wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) can release pharmaceuticals into surface water, even in agricultural headwater watersheds. This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of animal-specific, mixed-use, and human-specific pharmaceuticals, from agricultural headwaters with intensive livestock production and a WWTP to a watershed used for Water Framework Directive monitoring. Grab sampling was performed during one hydrological year upstream and downstream from a WWTP and at three dates in seven nested watersheds with areas of 1. 9 - 84. 1 km 2. Twenty pharmaceuticals were analyzed. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected at all sampling dates upstream and downstream from the WWTP and at concentrations {{higher than those of}} human-specific pharmaceuticals. The predominance of animal-specific and mixed-use pharmaceuticals vs. human-specific pharmaceuticals observed at these sampling points was confirmed at the other sampling points. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected mainly during runoff events and periods of manure spreading. A large percentage of mixed-use pharmaceuticals could come from animal sources, but it was difficult to determine. Mixed-use and human-specific pharmaceuticals predominated in the largest watersheds when runoff decreased. In areas of intensive livestock production, mitigation actions should focus on agricultural headwater watersheds to decrease the number of pathways and the transfer volume of veterinary pharmaceuticals, which can be the main contaminant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The global dairy industry, the {{predominant}} pathogens causing mastitis, {{our understanding of}} mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. This paper aims to discuss changes {{in each of these}} aspects. Globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. In many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis and an increase in the relative impact of Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli mastitis. In some countries, Klebsiella spp. or Streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. Differences between countries in <b>legislation,</b> <b>veterinary</b> and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. For pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. For pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. The genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. Genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. These developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} and introduction of antimicrobial agents to clinical medicine {{was one of}} the greatest medical triumphs of the 20 th century that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. However, the gradual emergence of populations of antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic bacteria resulting from use, misuse and abuse of antimicrobials has today become a major global health concern. Antimicrobial resistance genes have been suggested to originate from environmental bacteria, as clinically relevant resistance genes have been detected on the chromosome of environmental bacteria. As only a few new antimicrobials have been developed in the last decade, the further evolution of resistance poses a serious threat to public health. Urgent measures are required not only to minimize the use of antimicrobials for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes but also to look for alternative strategies for the control of bacterial infections. This review examines the global picture of antibacterial resistance, factors that favor its spread, strategies and limitations for its control and the need for continuous training of all stake-holders <b>i.</b> e. medical, <b>veterinary,</b> public health and other relevant professionals as well as human consumers of antibiotic drugs, in the appropriate use of antimicrobials...|$|R

The research conducted {{in the year of}} 2015 - 2016 was to design the optimum condition of food safety consideration for feed industries in Indonesia. Feed for livestock was formulated by using corn meal, soya protein, fish meals, rice bran, veterinary drugs, steam, and other ingredients. Growth promotor materials were formulated from vitamin, antibiotics, amino acid, methylene blue, and other trace elements also were added in the formulation. The feed ingredients are potential sources of food safety hazard in feed products. Result of model analysis found the major sources of food safety risks, <b>i.</b> e. 1) <b>veterinary</b> drugs residues (X 1); 2) aflatoxin potential in humid corn meals (X 2), and 3) alfatoxin potential in humid soya meal (X 3).

40|$|A user {{intervention}} free electrochemical immunosensor {{is developed}} {{that allows a}} direct detection of small molecules (<b>i.</b> e., <b>veterinary</b> drug residue, namely enrofloxacin) in complex matrices, with no washing or rinsing steps via a displacement assay. This is achieved using an interface comprised of a mixed layer of oligo(phenylethynylene) molecular wire (MW), to allow electrochemical communication and oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) to control the interaction of proteins and electroactive species with the electrode surface. The mixed layer is formed from in situ-generated aryl diazonium cations. To the distal end of the MW, a redox probe 1, 1 &# 146;-di(aminomethyl) ferrocene is attached followed by an epitope (the structural feature the antibody selectively recognises) to which an antibody would specifically bind (current suppression). When placed in a sample containing the small target analyte, transduction is achieved by antibody leaving the electrode surface due to the competition for the antibody between the surface bound epitope and the small analyte (current increase). This type of assay {{is referred to as}} a displacement assay. In a displacement assay, the ratio of the surface components (MW/OEG) and the use of electric field both are shown to have strong impact on sensor sensitivity enhancement. The former controls the antibody-epitope specific binding whilst the latter perturbs the thermodynamic equilibrium and hence enhances the effectiveness of antibody-epitope dissociation. In addition, the apparent affinity of the antibody to the surface bound epitope is shown to be another important key factor to have direct influence on sensor sensitivity. The magnitude of current being suppressed (after the antibody-epitope complexation) has strong impact on the magnitude of the possible current increase (analytical signal) in a displacement assay. A compromise between these two variables is shown crucial to achieve optimum sensor performance. To control the antibody-epitope affinity, the strategy used was by electrode surface modification. Six different analogues of enrofloxacin which have different affinities to antibody were employed as the surface bound epitopes. Interestingly with this strategy, not only the sensor sensitivity can be enhanced, also the sensor specificity can be in control. Besides experiments, modelling of a displacement assay was performed based on a simple equilibrium theoretical model to determine the optimum conditions. The experimental results were shown similar trends and were consistent to the simulated plots for the calibration curves obtained for six different epitopes. The trend from small to large according to binding strength was ofloxacin 88 %) with little loss of analyte attributed to binding with humic substances...|$|R
40|$|Antineoplastic {{drugs are}} {{pharmaceuticals}} {{commonly used to}} treat cancer (and some non-neoplastic diseases), which are generally referred to as 'chemotherapy'. Oncology nurses are exposed to these drugs via the skin of hands during daily nursing activities, even when protective gloves are being used. Results of tests on bulk and surface contamination samples confirmed that patients intravenously treated with cyclophosphamide excrete the unmetabolized drug. The introduction of new guidelines and regulations on working with antineoplastic drugs, the use of more closed preparation- and infusion-systems and the consequent growing awareness of nurses working with antineoplastic drugs has decreased exposure to antineoplastic drugs considerably. Due {{to an increase in}} number of chemotherapy treatments and centralisation of chemotherapy to specialised departments in hospitals, the average weekly exposure level of an oncology nurse has not markedly changed over time, while low and high exposures occur less frequent. The identification of the patient as a source of contamination and exposure makes it very complicated to further reduce exposure to antineoplastic drugs of nurses. Based on current dermal exposure levels to antineoplastic drugs approximately 50 % of the population of oncology nurses have an increased risk of a prolonged time to pregnancy compared with non-exposed nurses, and around 10 % of Dutch oncology nurses have an increased risk of a premature delivery and delivering a child with a low birth weight. Other effects on reproduction like spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, gender of offspring, and congenital malformations were not related to exposure to antineoplastic drugs. The risk of non-lymphocytic leukaemia among oncology nurses after being exposed for 40 years to current dermal exposure levels of cyclophosphamide was estimated to be well below the target risk (one extra cancer case per 10 million per year) and the maximum tolerable risk (one extra cancer case per 100, 000 per year) in the Netherlands. However, this estimate is for cyclophosphamide only and in a worst-case exposure scenario the estimated leukaemia risk exceeded the target risk, so the cancer risk among oncology nurses exposed to antineoplastic drugs should not be ignored. The identification of occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs in sectors outside the hospital environment (<b>i.</b> e. <b>veterinary</b> medicine, home care, nursing homes and industrial laundries) showed that the number of workers potentially exposed to antineoplastic drugs is larger than previously estimated. Exposure levels in these sectors can potentially be higher than in the hospital environment, because exposure routes are complex and awareness of the hazard (and therefore use of protective measures) is limited...|$|R
40|$|When {{graduating from}} {{veterinary}} school, veterinary professionals {{must be ready}} to enter the complex veterinary profession. Therefore, one of the major responsibilities of any veterinary school is to develop training programmes that support students’ competency development on the trajectory from novice student to veterinary professional. The integration of learning and assessment in the clinical workplace to foster this competency development in undergraduate veterinary education is the central topic of this thesis. Competency-based education is an approach to prepare students for clinical practice oriented to outcome abilities and organised around competencies. Based on these competencies performance-related information can be provided to enhance and evaluate students’ learning. A theory-based programmatic assessment model could allow integration of learning and assessment in the clinical workplace. The need to enhance our understanding on how this integrative programmatic approach to learning and assessment interacts with practice leads up to the central research questions of this thesis. First, what overarching competency structure provides a solid foundation for competency-based education in veterinary medicine? Second, how does theory interact with practice when implementing a competency-based assessment programme in undergraduate veterinary education? And third, which underlying mechanisms affect the exchange of performance-relevant information in competency-based workplace learning and assessment? We used a design-based research approach to advance the interaction between theory and educational practice. Within competency-based veterinary education, educational strategies need to be aligned and based on an agreed competency framework. An overarching competency structure for competency-based education in veterinary medicine could be the VetPro-competency framework, that consists of one more technical, specific domain, <b>i.</b> e. <b>Veterinary</b> Expertise, and six more generic non-technical domains, i. e. Communication, Collaboration, Entrepreneurship, Health and Welfare, Scholarship, and Personal Development. To perform adequately in the complex workplace of the veterinary profession the ability to integrate all the competencies described within these domains is essential. The VetPro competency framework seems to provide a firm basis for reflective and developmental activities on all relevant competencies for the veterinary professional. The implementation and evaluation of the competency-based assessment programme, aiming both to support and evaluate students’ competency development, pointed out a number of challenges. These challenges interfered with the two main objectives of the design, namely using formative assessments to maximally enhance student’ competency development and including performance-relevant information from formative assessment instruments in high-stakes assessment procedures. One of the main stumbling blocks {{turned out to be the}} provision of high-quality, meaningful feedback on students’ performance within the complex clinical environment. Furthermore, the objective of the theoretical model for programmatic assessment to use formative information in longitudinal high-stakes assessments seemed to corrupt the other main goal of providing and documenting meaningful feedback in order to maximally enhance students’ competency development. Finally, we explored the underlying mechanisms affecting the exchange of performance-relevant information, and identified three main categories of interrelated factors that influenced students’ feedback-seeking behaviour and teachers’ feedback-giving behaviour in the veterinary clinical workplace...|$|R

The collection and analysis of statistics in respect of the industry is, however, inadequate. The main product at the present time is fertile eggs for hatching, and the main market the USA. The inflated price paid for eggs - an egg for export is worth as much as a 14 -month old bird on the local market - is an incentive to increase production of eggs alone as rapidly as possible. The market for eggs will not, however, be unlimited and their export is helping create a situation whereby the purchasing countries will soon be able to provide their own stock. The inflated market for eggs is detrimental to the long-term future of the ostrich industry in Namibia. The ostrich industry is currently growing much faster than would be possible without egg exports, but it is developing without the equipment and expertise for incubating and rearing large numbers of chicks on which a long-term industry will need to be based. This concentration on the export of reproductive material has severely curtailed the operation of secondary industries and the development of product marketing. On the other hand, Namibia can anticipate a significant share of a long-term market if the industry in the country develops correctly in the next few years. It must, however, be ready to face competition from many other countries. Moreover, a collapse in prices, due to a falling demand for reproductive material, would have a severe effect on production, unless measures are taken to promote investment in long-term capacity for the production and processing of slaughter birds. The immediate challenge is to provide for the transition between egg export and such production. It is therefore recommended that your Government recognise the ostrich industry as part of a broader agricultural sector and allocate resources, particularly in the research and <b>veterinary</b> areas, accordingly. <b>Legislation</b> should be enacted to replace the present ad hoc arrangement of exemptions to laws and regulations, and a Species Management Plan needs to be prepared in order to avoid any problems with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is recommended that a policy be adopted to promote the gradual passage from the live export market to a rearing and processing industry, by the imposition of an export quota linked to the industry's annual reproductive capacity, thereby encouraging investment in incubation and rearing technology for the birds that are not exported. Great care needs to be taken in establishing the quota level...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antimicrobials for common mastitis pathogens from dairy cows in New Zealand; {{and to assess}} the effect of source of the isolates, <b>i.</b> e. commercial <b>veterinary</b> laboratories or collected as part of research studies; the clinical status of the cow, i. e. subclinical or clinical mastitis; cow age and herd {{on the distribution of}} the MIC. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations for Staphylococcus aureus (n= 364), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (n= 65) and Streptococcus uberis (n= 102) isolated from milk samples from dairy cows were determined for a variety of antimicrobials using broth microdilution. Isolates of S. aureus were sourced from research studies from both subclinically (n= 161) and clinically (n= 104) affected cows, as well as from commercial veterinary laboratories (n= 101); while all the streptococcal isolates were from commercial laboratories. Resistance was defined using the cut-points provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULTS: The distribution of MIC varied among the bacterial species for every antimicrobial tested (p< 0. 001). Of the S. aureus isolates, 28, 2 and 0. 5 % were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis isolates, 17 and 13 % were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. One isolate (1 %) of S. uberis was resistant to penicillin. The distribution of MIC of S. aureus varied with clinical status, between herds, and with age of cow (p< 0. 05). The distribution of MIC for S. aureus for penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cloxacillin and ampicillin were lower from clinical than subclinical cases, and those for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and oxytetracycline from isolates from veterinary laboratories were lower than for those from research studies. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to some beta-lactam antimicrobials and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were found in isolates from cases of bovine mastitis. The distribution of MIC for isolates of S. aureus varied with clinical status of the cow, the age of the cow, the herd and with the source of isolate. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Resistance to penicillin was found in a quarter of S. aureus isolates, but in virtually no Streptococcus isolates; therefore microbial identification and sensitivity testing would be beneficial when assessing treatment options. The source of the isolates affected the estimated MIC, suggesting that selection of isolates for monitoring of resistance requires care and that use of routine submissions to commercial laboratories to assess antimicrobial resistance patterns may result in biased estimates of prevalence of resistance.

40|$|Comparative Medicine - OneHealth and Comparative Medicine Poster SessionTicks {{transmit}} {{the majority of}} vector-borne diseases of human beings in the USA and of domestic animals worldwide. Among these, tick-borne rickettsial pathogens cause at least four important tick-borne zoonoses in the USA, {{and two of the}} five major vector- borne diseases of cattle worldwide. Notably, five of the aforementioned zoonotic and bovine diseases are endemic to Missouri. Tick-borne diseases of humans are zoonotic, and dogs are also naturally exposed to most of the etiologic agents of such maladies, suggesting potential roles of canine sentinels, reservoirs and models for tick-borne zoonoses. Our group utilizes canine ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis and E. chaffeensis) and bovine anaplasmosis (Anaplasma marginale) models to better understand mechanisms of rickettsial infection of both acarine and mammalian hosts. Ticks used for these projects include Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor variabilis, D. andersoni, Amblyomma americanum, A. maculatum and Ixodes scapularis. Projects currently underway include mechanisms responsible for rickettsial manipulation of host cell actin, and strategies that could lead to interference with tick acquisition and transmission of infections. In addition to the infectious cycles of these agents, we are also interested in pathogen interactions with the mammalian host, including the immunology and pathology of anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis. These studies are expected to lead to better understanding of immune responses associated with different phases of ehrlichiosis, influence of vector feeding on biological and clinical outcomes of infection, immunoprophylaxis, and risk factors for exacerbation of clinical disease. The University of Missouri provides an optimal environment for this work, because <b>i)</b> MU has <b>Veterinary,</b> Medical and Agricultural colleges on the same campus; ii) MU has outstanding nucleic acid, proteomics, flow cytomety and microscopy (both fluorescence and electron) core facilities; iii) almost every tick-borne disease enzootic to the USA is in Missouri, thus allowing local access to diagnostic specimens from naturally infected hosts; iv) MU has established graduate programs in infectious disease research, pathobiology and comparative medicine; v) MU has BSL 2 facilities to investigate tick-borne infections of dogs and cattle, which will soon be expanded with construction of a new Animal Resource Center; and vi) MU is home to the Missouri Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, for which an expansion of facilities is anticipated for investigation of tick-transmission of zoonotic BSL 3 agents among dogs (e. g., Rickettsia rickettsii, Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis). Our current capabilities center on large animal transmission, infection and disease models for anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis. Mouse, guinea pig and rabbit models are also possible for certain tick and pathogen species. Technical skills include tick infestation of dogs and cattle, qualitative and quantitative PCR assay development and implementation, monitoring of clinical and hematologic parameters, and characterization of protective and pathogenic mechanisms with immunological and molecular methods. We are interested in opportunities to test new products designed to interfere with tick-pathogen-host interactions, and opportunities to investigate novel approaches for diagnosis or alleviation of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis...|$|R
