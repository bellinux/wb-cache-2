5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee <b>farm—in</b> 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E

Since 2005, Bt maize crops have been grown in different regions—either in small or large <b>farms—in</b> compliance with a law that envisages coexistence procedures for either individual farmers or groups of farmers that agree to establish the so called “production zones. ” The monitoring of Bt maize crops is annually run and reported by the Ministry of Agriculture. Here we report on the first quinquennium of coexistence in Portugal, bearing down on regional distribution and evolution, farm sizes, coexistence measures, GM farmers' profile and their assessment of Bt crops and coexistence rules, and Bt maize destination.

40|$|What really happened? A {{meaningless}} question. But one I {{keep trying}} to answer, knowing there is no answer. 1 Storytelling, narrative, seems to be hardwired into humans {{as a way of}} comprehending emotional truths about ourselves and others, our history and our cultures. Through the stories we tell, over and over, circling through different kinds of truths, we make our approaches to the question of 2 ̆ 2 what really happened, 2 ̆ 2 and somehow we find a few answers that suit our private and public nows. The conference on literatures of the Great Plains, presented by the Center for Great Plains Studies in Lincoln, Nebraska, 3 - 5 April 1997, showcased a number of ways stories and songs can enlighten us about the mores of our region. Four papers, covering a variety of approaches, are published in this special symposium issue of Great Plains Quarterly. P. Jane Hafen explores Zitkala Ša 2 ̆ 7 s delicate cultural negotiations as the Native American activist collaborated with Utah music teacher William Hanson on The Sun Dance Opera. On one hand, the opera allowed Ute and Lakota actors to perform outlawed religious ceremonies in a dignified manner as part of what the dominant culture saw as its highest art form. On the other hand, the secularized and, in the most literal sense, vulgarized version of the Sun Dance was a breach of its spirituality, while Hanson 2 ̆ 7 s belief in a 2 ̆ 2 vanishing American 2 ̆ 2 allowed for a good deal of cultural appropriation on his part. If Zitkala Ša wrestled with the presentation of Siouan and Ute materials in a European context, Becky Faber strives to find a literature of the Plains and Prairies that acknowledges the kind of drudgery and boredom she found growing up as a farm girl in Iowa. Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s radiant Alexandra says nothing to her of her own life, while Cather 2 ̆ 7 s Antonia is for the most part swallowed up in the telling of her tale by Jim Burden, the neighbor boy who persists in seeing Nebraska in terms of the dime novels he had read as a child. Lesser known writers, such as Ruth Suckow and Dorothy Thomas, and the more recent Jane Smiley, present Faber with a picture that she recognizes as a more meaningful consideration of the emotional and physical challenges of the lives of women on the farms of the midcontinent. Anne Nothof, writing about Canadian prairie drama (which is far more rich and extensive than the very slender corpus of US plains drama) is, like Hafen, dealing with a form of storytelling that is aural and visual, not primarily written. One of Nothof 2 ̆ 7 s concerns in her essay is with the depiction of the prairie, the vast immensity of space filled with nothing but earth and sky-and thus resistant to representation in the closed space of a theatre. She points out that early writers of the prairie- before about 1970 -tended to depict opposition between man (almost always man, specifically, and not woman) and land, but that her prairie playwrights, all women, instead focus on the synergism of humans and place, even though the wtiters are hampered by the difficulty of showing such a place on a stage. In the fourth paper, John Lauck shows how fiction can serve as a 2 ̆ 2 primary document, 2 ̆ 2 using Douglas Unger 2 ̆ 7 s novel Leaving the Land to frame the debate about corporate farming after World War II, a debate still hotly contested on the field of hog confinement operations-or factory <b>farms-in</b> Nebraska, Iowa, Alberta, and other plains and prairie states and provinces. Although the main body of Lauck 2 ̆ 7 s articles deals with history, not literature, his use of the novel demonstrates how fiction, far from 2 ̆ 2 fictionalizing 2 ̆ 2 history, aims at the emotional core, the down-home gut response, to any policy issue or public crisis, the human-scale power that always. energizes political debate...|$|R

50|$|The Denver Relief Green Team is the {{volunteer}} wing of Denver Relief co-founded by Khalatbari and Seeb. Starting its mission for social {{action in the}} cannabis industry in 2009, the Denver Relief Green Team focuses on the ethical framework of cannabis business professionals working towards the overall benefit of society. Often referred to as simply the “Green Team,” Khalatbari began his volunteer work with the philanthropy wing by cleaning up after public cannabis rallies and events, raising money for charitable causes, repairing wheelchairs and bikes, and donating harvest food for the less fortunate at a local organic urban farm—EKAR: Jewish Urban and Garden <b>Farm—in</b> Denver. As of 2014, Khalatbari and Seeb have helped the Denver Relief Green Team to collect over 250 active volunteers in Colorado that help the organization through community service to improve the once very negative public perception of medical cannabis. In 2013 alone, these two co-founders worked to bring in approximately 900 hours of logged volunteer time spent helping to improve the community.|$|E
50|$|Madagascar Oil {{focuses on}} the development, {{exploration}} and production of petroleum. In 2008, Madagascar Oil held the largest licensed onshore acreage in Madagascar. Madagascar Oil holds the large heavy oil fields of Tsimiroro and Bemolanga, which are their primary oil fields. The company operates the Tsimiroro field, while Total S.A., its <b>farm-in</b> partner, operates the Bemolanga field. In 2008, a business agreement granted Total S.A. the operating license for and sixty percent interest in the Bemolanga oil sands. In 2010, it raised £50 million in its IPO to finance a pilot project in the Tsimiroro Field. On 15 April 2015, the government granted to the company a 25-year license on the oil production at the Tsimiroro block 3104. 1.7 billion barrels of proven heavy oil reserves exists at Tsimiroro, {{at a depth of}} between 100m to 200m. Due to the remoteness of Tsimiroro, the company usually flies employees to the site from Antanarivo, the capital of Madagascar, using small planes.|$|E

50|$|At {{least one}} company, Paramount Mining Corporation Ltd., {{explored}} for diamond at two properties in Ghana in 2006. In February 2006, the company {{entered into a}} joint-venture agreement with Leo Shield Exploration Ghana Ltd. to earn interest in the Osenase project, which covers an area of 330 square kilometers (km²) located about 25 kilometers (km) south of the Akwatia Diamond Project. Field work began in March 2006. A number of pits were dug in both alluvial and hard rock deposits. A total of 83 diamonds, which together weighed more than 3.3 carat mg and the largest of which was 0.56 carat mg, were recovered from the gravel of alluvial deposits. The project area also contained gold and columbite-tantalite minerals in the alluvial material. The other property, which was known as Ochinso, covers an area of 37 km² within the Birim Diamond Field of southern Ghana. Paramount, through a <b>farm-in</b> arrangement with Aurion Resources Ltd. of Ghana, would be entitled to acquire 85% of the equity interest in the concession. At least 72 diamonds and 325 small gold grains from 20 small test pits were recovered from the property in 2006. The pits were situated {{in a number of}} different river systems throughout the Ochinso project area. Most of the diamonds recovered were reportedly of commercial size ranging between 1 and 2 millimeters (mm), with an average stone size of 0.036 carat mg.|$|E
