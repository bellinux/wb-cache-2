Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new software-defined networking products.

5|$|The {{previous}} state <b>internet</b> <b>traffic</b> are {{routed through}} a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E

Video streaming is continuously acquiring a larger share of <b>Internet’s</b> <b>traffic</b> resulting in a need to have a reliable video traffic model. In this paper, we analyze several video streams compressed for mobile streaming and develop their optimal Seasonal ARIMA models. Although these optimal models are very different, we find that a simple model, which we call Simplified Seasonal ARIMA Model (SAM), represents all of the streams very well. This model is ideally suitable for video generation in mobile video simulation studies. We also present the parameter values suitable for such studies. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model of TCP flows suited to <b>Internet</b> {{backbone}} <b>traffic,</b> where links are usually not congested. We characterize the traffic using information on flows, i. e., arrival time, size, and duration. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} a model capturing the variation of the transmission rate during a TCP flow solely based on the above flow parameters. This model accounts for the dynamics of TCP congestion window and for the Timeout mechanism. It is independent of the packet loss rate and the round-trip time of the connection. We then model the traffic on a backbone link by aggregating TCP flows. Our model is easy to compute, and we show via simulatio- ns that it gives a good approximation of <b>Internet</b> backbone <b>traffic...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a quantitative {{study on the}} energy-traffic tradeoff problem {{from the perspective of}} entire Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). We propose a novel Energy-Efficient Cooperative Offloading Model (E 2 COM) for energy-traffic tradeoff, which can ensure the fairness of energy consumption of mobile devices and reduce the computation repetition and eliminate the <b>Internet</b> data <b>traffic</b> redundancy through cooperative execution and sharing computation results. We design an Online Task Scheduling Algorithm (OTS) based on a pricing mechanism and Lyapunov optimization to address the problem without predicting future information on task arrivals, transmission rates and so on. OTS can achieve a desirable trade-off between the energy consumption and <b>Internet</b> data <b>traffic</b> by appropriately setting the tradeoff coefficient.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Loss of Self-Similarity (LoSS) detection accuracy using parameter's adjustment {{which includes}} different values of sampling level and correlation lag. This is important when considering exact and asymptotic self-similar models concurrently in the self-similarity parameter estimation method. Due {{to the needs}} of high accuracy and fast estimation, the Optimization Method (OM) based on Second Order Self-similarity (SOSS) statistical model was proposed in the previous works to estimate self-similarity parameter. Consequently, Curve Fitting Error (CFE) value estimated from OM is used to detect LoSS efficiently. This work investigates the effect of the parameter's adjustment for improving the CFE accuracy and estimation time speed. We have tested the method with real <b>Internet</b> <b>traffics</b> simulation that consists of normal and malicious packets traffic.
