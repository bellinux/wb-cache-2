5000|$|Arizona {{follows the}} prior {{appropriation}} doctrine for determining water rights. There are {{three categories of}} tradable rights in Arizona: surface water rights under Common Law Rights, surface water rights under Statutory Rights, and groundwater rights created by Arizona’s 1980 Groundwater Code. [...] The former two surface water rights pertain to any surface water in Arizona excluding flows in the Colorado River (Colorado River water rights are governed extraneously, by the Colorado River Compact). Specifically, appropriated surface water can be: [...] "Waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or other natural channels, or in definite underground channels, whether perennial or intermittent, floodwaters, wastewater, or surplus water, and of lakes, ponds and springs on the surface" [...] (A.R.S. §45-101). Common Law Rights apply to surface water diversions appropriated prior {{to the creation of}} Arizona’s 1919 Public Water Code and are senior rights. Statutory Rights apply to any appropriation claimed after 1919, in which case the claimant must apply for and receive a permit from the Arizona Department of Water Resource (ADWR) before diverting claimed surface water. Rights holders must apply appropriated water to beneficial use (recognized as domestic, municipal, irrigation, stockwatering, power, mining, recreation, wildlife and fish, or groundwater recharge) or risk <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> (which occurs if water is not applied to beneficial use for 5 or more consecutive years). Arizona permits transfer of surface water rights, however there are maximum limits to the amount of water transferred and temporal duration of the transfer (A.R.S. §45-1002), and transfers are subject to review and approval by the ADWR. In the case of transfers to instream flows to benefit fish, wildlife, or recreation, rights holders may follow a [...] "sever and transfer" [...] process, by which the holder permanently transfers the water right to the State of Arizona or a political subdivision (as trustees of instream flows), pending approval of the ADWR. This type of transfer will preserve the priority status of the water right, so that if the right transferred is a senior right, the benefiting instream flow will receive its water allocation before junior rights holders {{in the case of a}} water shortage. This transfer process is boon to ecosystem health and recreational value because wildlife and fish were not recognized as beneficial uses until 1941 and 1962, respectively. Groundwater rights transfers are more restricted relative to surface water. The 1980 Arizona Groundwater Code created jurisdictions called [...] "Active Management Areas" [...] (AMA) in parts of the state with high water demand, such as Phoenix, Tucson, and Prescott. Groundwater rights owners living in places outside of AMAs are entitled to a [...] "reasonable" [...] quantity of pumped groundwater that can be applied to beneficial use without waste. Groundwater rights holders outside of AMAs may transfer rights under certain conditions and are rarely permitted to transfer groundwater outside the hydrologic basin. Groundwater transfers within AMAs are also permissible, but are even more restricted, and groundwater regulation in AMAs is different and much stricter than regulation outside of AMAs. Legal rules governing water exchanges in Arizona are codified in Title 45, Chapter 4, of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Water transfers within Arizona are most common in the Phoenix AMA.|$|E
40|$|Concurrent Sessions 11 (5) In “The Permissibility of Punishment”, Daniel McDermott {{offered an}} {{original}} version of retributive theory of punishment.

I wish to critically assess McDermott’s theory in my paper.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the appropriateness}} of disenfranchising convicted adult citizens from comparative and international human rights perspectives. Chapter One explores the transition from direct democracy to representative government, and the subsequent increased importance of elections. It highlights the paradigm shift that the perception of voting has undergone, from being seen as a privilege, granted {{to a handful of}} society members, to being viewed as an entitlement. Today, electoral systems are commonly based on universal suffrage, and voting eligibility is normally qualified by (only) two criteria: community membership and competence. It is suggested that these criteria should be used for scrutinising convicts’ disenfranchisement. Chapter Two traces the transformation that the treatment of convicts underwent, with notions of <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and ‘civil death’ gradually giving way to ideas of 'residual liberty' and of convicts as rights-holders. Subsequently, regulatory and penal justifications for convicts' disenfranchisement are assessed. The analysis concludes that disenfranchisement should be classified as a form of punishment, and that, due to its adverse effects on individuals as well as collectives disenfranchisement should cease to be imposed. Chapter Three offers comparative perspectives on current challenges to disenfranchisement legislation. It examines American disenfranchisement jurisprudence alongside recent judgments from Canada, South Africa, the European Court of Human Rights and Australia. It is concluded that the non-American judgments exhibit an identifiable global trend towards enfranchising (some) convicts which can be partially attributed to a transnational judicial discourse. Chapter Four examines the human rights treaty regime's perspective. Interpreting Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees the right-to-vote, it is posited that the provision does not proscribe disenfranchisement as such. Rather, disenfranchisement is subjected to balancing/proportionality analysis. Building on Chapter Two's normative contentions, and on the notion that voting eligibility constitutes the essence of the right-to-vote, the thesis advocates the adoption of an optional protocol to the ICCPR proscribing disenfranchisement. It is submitted that the facilitative nature of the right-to-vote makes it less vulnerable to cultural relativity, deference and margin of appreciation objections. Analogies are drawn between the proposed protocol and the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|E

40|$|In {{liability}} insurance, {{the duty}} to defend is broader than {{the duty to}} cover. Thus {{it is possible that}} an insurer that has a duty to defend a suit may not have the duty to cover the policyholder 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities in the suit. However, if the penalty for a breach of the duty to defend is limited to actual legal costs spent by the defendant, the insurer may have an incentive to refuse to defend, even when the duty to defend is clear. This occurs because the insurer will not internalize the consequences of an inadequate defense when it ultimately can avoid covering the claim. If the penalty for a breach of the duty to defend also includes a <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to contest coverage of the claim, the insurer will never refuse to defend when the duty to defend is clear, but such a penalty could induce an insurer to defend even when it has a good legal argument against the duty to defend.

40|$|The {{decision}} of Greppo v Jam-Cal Bundaberg Pty Ltd [2015] QCA 131 illustrates a defect in s 128 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) which gives {{a right to}} a lessee to apply for relief against <b>forfeiture</b> against loss <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> to exercise an option to renew. The defect arises because the legislation does not adequately deal with breaches that occur after the exercise of the option but before the expiry of the lease. Most commercial leases of all kinds have a standard provisions, as the lease in this case, as a conditions of the exercise of the option to renew that the lessee will have given notice of exercise within the time specified to the lessor and will have up to the date of expiry of the lease paid all rent and observed all lessee’s covenants. The difficulties occur because invariably an option must be exercised before the expiry of the lease when a lessee may not be in breach of the lease but may later prior to the expiry of the lease fall into breach. As this decision indicates,at least in Queensland, that the lessee who desires to challenge the lessor’s right to enforce those conditions can neither seek relief under s 128 against <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to exercise the option,or indeed, under s 124 of the Property Law Act 1974 to preserve the agreement for lease brought about by the otherwise regular exercise of the option to renew.
