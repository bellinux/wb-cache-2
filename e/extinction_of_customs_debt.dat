40|$|Legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> duty The aim of my diploma {{thesis is}} {{to define the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> duty, {{describe}} and analyze the current legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> duty in the Czech Republic and European Union, to explain the process <b>of</b> determining the <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> and {{to answer the question}} if customs duties and customs authorities are important today or not. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is divided into three subchapters, which are focused on the characteristics and definition <b>of</b> <b>custom</b> duty, its functions and its types from a theoretical perspective. The second chapter deals with the history <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> duty and presents a brief description of its development in the present Czech Republic. It is divided into two subchapters; the first is dedicated to the development <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> duty until the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the second focuses on its development until the establishment of the independent Czech Republic. The third chapter focuses on the current customs legislation and also mentions some legislation that will become applicable in the future. It is divided into three subchapters. The first subchapter is devoted to the sources <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> law at the international level and also mentions some major international organizations.

40|$|The Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on Community customs union and {{relations}} with third countries, regarding particularly customs procedure during foreign transit operations. It is aimed to summarize basic knowledge regarding TIR system operation with emphasis on its current development and modernization. At present, TIR regime is experiencing a very dynamic progress, and it is related both to its computerization {{and changes in the}} European Union, which tends to enhance safety standards on the international level when shipping the goods. Therefore, the means of communication are improved by the interconnection of main actors engaged in business transactions, such as national customs authorities and associations, traders and international organisations. The first part of the thesis deals with customs union and common trade policy of European Union. It defines the term <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> union and European customs union territory, specifies both internal and external aspects <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> union existence, and shortly describes the process <b>of</b> European <b>customs</b> union creation. The two following chapters are concerned with the customs administration, legislation and basic documentation forming <b>customs</b> legislation <b>of</b> European Union. The fourth chapter describes the development and customs union improvement with its new strategy and modernized customs union codex. The second part concentrates on the analysis <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> procedure in general and international customs regimes. It describes the basic terms used in customs administration, specifies the ways <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> calculation and factors which may lead to the <b>customs</b> <b>debt.</b> The closing chapter is devoted to transit regimes functioning not only on the territory of the European Union, but in third countries as well. The third part addresses the TIR transit regime. At the beginning, the foundation and historical development of the regime is described, followed by its mission, principles and territorial scope. In the next chapter the basic conditions of membership are identified. The following chapter is reserved for description and explanation of international guarantee system, mutual relations of its participants and forms of guarantee provision. In the last chapter the carnet TIR - main document used for customs purposes when shipping - is highlighted. The last chapter {{is focused on}} TIR system computerization, its innovation and improvement, and development mainly in recent years. The forth part of the thesis emphasizes membership advantages, particularly benefits of TIR system, and outlines the fields of the European Union and TIR system cooperation. The conclusion then summarizes important parts and key elements of the paper. When putting together the thesis, the latest available data on the TIR system progress regarding cooperation with the European Union were used, as the main aim of the thesis was to provide detailed information on the current situation and modernization of TIR regime...|$|R

50|$|Article 5 <b>of</b> {{the current}} <b>customs</b> code (Council Regulation 2913/1992) deals with representation, a key concept. This {{provision}} allows an importer or exporter {{to appoint a}} third party to act on their behalf. The importer or exporter can appoint the third party to act in two capacities, i.e., as a direct representative or as an indirect representative. A direct representative will act {{on behalf of the}} importer/exporter but will have no responsibility for the <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> arising from their actions, whereas an indirect representative will have a joint and several liability for the <b>customs</b> <b>debt.</b> In almost all cases, the third party will elect to provide brokerage services on a direct representation basis.

40|$|In {{the present}} article author {{analyzes}} the institutional framework <b>of</b> the <b>Customs</b> Union <b>of</b> the EU and the modernized <b>Customs</b> Code <b>of</b> the EU. Since {{the establishment of the}} European Economic Community in 1957 the Customs Union became the main aim of proximal development of the integration process, because without the customs union was not possible to form a common market, establishment of which was at that time the main task of the European Economic Community. The EU Customs Union formed gradually with the deepening integration, so all the difficulties of the European integration process have left their imprint on the formation <b>of</b> the <b>customs</b> union. In the study author notes that issues related to the decision-making mechanism in the field <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> cooperation defined in acts of primary EU law, because the order of the ordinary legislative procedure prescribed in detail in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Author also notes that the special position among the rules to modernize the EU Customs Code occupies rules aimed at regulating the <b>customs</b> <b>debt</b> and guarantees. The provisions <b>of</b> the new <b>Customs</b> Code (Section 3 <b>of</b> the modernized <b>Customs</b> Code EU) cover the following stages of the free movement of goods within the European Union. In conclusion, author notes that all matters relating to <b>customs</b> policy <b>of</b> the European Union are regulated in the founding treaties and the rules <b>of</b> the <b>Customs</b> Code only detail the provisions of the EU founding treaties. Author also concludes that the application <b>of</b> the modernized <b>Customs</b> Code <b>of</b> the European Union outside the context of the founding treaties of the European Union is impossible...|$|R

40|$|Because most {{rewarding}} events are probabilistic and changing, the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards {{is important for}} survival. It has been proposed that the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards depends on arousal {{and the amount of}} learning of reward values. Midbrain dopamine neurons were suggested {{to play a role in}} both arousal and learning reward values. Despite extensive research on modeling dopaminergic activity in reward learning (e. g. temporal difference models), few studies have been done on modeling its role in arousal. Although temporal difference models capture key characteristics of dopaminergic activity during the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> deterministic rewards, they have been less successful at simulating the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards. By adding an arousal signal to a temporal difference model, we were able to simulate the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> probabilistic rewards and its dependence on the amount of learning. Our simulations propose that arousal allows the probability of reward to have lasting effects on the updating of reward value, which slows the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> low probability rewards. Using this model, we predicted that, by signaling the prediction error, dopamine determines the learned reward value that has to be extinguished during extinction and participates in regulating the size of the arousal signal that controls the learning rate. These predictions were supported by pharmacological experiments in rats...|$|R
