40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} language use in the Maltese bilingual classroom on the one hand, and in the societal context within which the classroom is embedded, on the other. The use of Maltese and English as media of instruction {{is a reflection of}} the functions of each language in society. At the same time, their functional distribution in the school context continues to shape the linguistic practices of Maltese students and adults. The employment of code-switching in the classroom is largely caused and shaped by factors like textbooks and technical terminology in English within a Maltese-speaking environment. It, in turn, continues to condition at least one type of bilingual behaviour in society: terminology switching. The other major distinction in the functional allocation of the two languages is the spoken-written contrast that often corresponds to the Maltese-English distribution respectively, both in the classroom and in most other domains. The analyses of bilingual classroom practices illustrate, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> discursive and literacy events taking place are a reflection of societal values and identities.

But it would take another four months before the Russian leadership would undertake to carry out its program of economic transformations. Such sluggishness and indecisiveness are understandable. The government, basing itself on the powers of the president of Russia and with the consent of most members of parliament, chose a strategy that could not and did not receive broad support among the public. Even the new entrepreneurs and the directors of state enterprises, who were oriented toward vigorous economic activity, began to express dissatisfaction with a number of elements of the new program, particularly with the tax policy. However, an analysis of the normative acts that were adopted starting in November of last year and of the first practical steps undertaken by the Russian government confirms that its intention is to stimulate private enterprise at the cost of a decline in the standard of living and a curtailment of the working people's consumption.

40|$|Not {{only in the}} Arctic, {{but also}} well outside the Arctic, icebergs can be a danger to buried {{offshore}} pipelines due to seabed gouging. As it is not economically feasible to bury these pipelines at depths where soil deformations are small, these pipelines are buried at sub-gouge depths where the soil experiences significant plastic deformations. Before considering the sub-gouge soil deformations that are vital to determine optimal pipeline burial depths, {{a better understanding of}} dynamic iceberg-soil interaction during seabed gouging is required. In the past, several models have been developed to describe the interaction forces between an iceberg and the soil in front of the iceberg keel based on static soil failure theory or from experimental observations. These models do not fully account for the dynamic behaviour of the iceberg, nor do they consider the corresponding response of the sub-gouge soil. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> extent of sub-gouge deformations depends on the geotechnical parameters of the seabed is not at all well understood.

30|$|As 3 D DIC {{provided}} a high-resolution full field analysis, {{data of the}} whole tendon at sub-pixel level were provided. This enabled us to visualise the regional inhomogeneity in strain distribution that is typical for biological tissue. This regional inhomogeneity {{stresses the importance of}} doing such a full field analysis. Classic strain gauges are not able to provide these data unless an infinite number of them would be used. This is <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> 3 D DIC technique should be looked at. It was shown that regional strain could be quite different from the overall strain in a specimen. To capture all the data provided by the strain map, the cumulative strain distribution was introduced (Figure  8). In contrast to Young’s modulus, this tool is independent of the volume of the clamped tendon and might therefore shed a new light over failure patterns in tendon tissue. It is frequently observed in strain experiments that maximum mid-substance strains are smaller than the grip-to-grip strain [[19]]. This phenomenon is well documented in the literature [[29]], and is likely the result of higher strains arising near the site of tissue clamping and slip at the grip-tendon interface. Therefore, instead of defining tendon failure by a certain grip-to-grip strain during a loading experiment (e.g. 10 %), it could be more appropriate to state that tendon failure occurred when a certain percentage its surface area (e.g. 30 %) reached a certain threshold of strain (e.g. 8 %). This cumulative failure strain will in fact be lower then the corresponding grip-to-grip strain due to the regional inhomogeneity in strain distribution. As relative surface area (%) is used in this measure, it becomes independent of tendon volume. This cumulative distribution can thus provide important insight in the displacement energy absorption within the tendon and might show better correlation with damage accumulation and failure patterns. Part of our further research will therefore focus on the validation of the cumulative strain distribution and the determination of the cumulative damage and failure thresholds in different tendon tissues.|$|E

The structural aspect of our model comes from the fact that the electricity spot prices depend on the dynamics of the electricity demand at the maturity $T$, and on the random available capacity of each production means. Our model explains, <b>in</b> a stylized <b>fact,</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> prices of different fuels together with the demand combine to produce electricity prices. This modeling methodology allows one to transfer to electricity prices the risk-neutral probabilities of the market of fuels and under the hypothesis of independence between demand and outages on one hand, and prices of fuels on the other hand, it provides a regression-type relation between electricity forward prices and forward prices of fuels. Moreover, the model produces, by nature, the well-known peaks observed on electricity market data.

Despite the huge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual answer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how they may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell inequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for a very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual principle, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our notion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell inequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It applies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers not only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly applied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There is much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach directly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very general notion of contextuality. There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without inequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a sense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On the hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach reconciles these aspects, and <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> shows <b>how</b> <b>the</b> logical robustness can be converted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable violations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality exhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown to lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities.

40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{origins of}} the stylized facts of financial returns have been addressed in {{a growing body of}} agent-based models of financial markets. While the traditional efficient market viewpoint explains all statistical properties of returns by similar features of the news arrival process, the more recent behavioral finance models explain them as imprints of universal patterns of interaction among investors. In this thesis, we contribute to this literature by introducing a very simple agent-based model in which the ubiquitous stylized facts (fat tails, volatility clustering) are emergent properties of the interaction among traders. The simplicity of the model allows us to estimate the underlying parameters, since it is possible to derive a closed form solution for the distribution of returns. The big advantage of our model with respect to the models proposed in the financial econometrics is the ability to explain the origin of the randomness present in the market. It is <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> very clear <b>how</b> <b>the</b> interactions based on herding among agents play the crucial rule in the emergence of the market fluctuations. We can precisely identify the source of the aggregate regularities of the returns in terms of the agents behavioral assumptions...|$|R
