40|$|A new anionic biosurfactant protein (SP 16) {{capable of}} tuning <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> by pH or salt has been designed. This biosurfactant {{exhibits}} unique <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> with high sensitivity to pH. A good level of foaming {{was observed at}} pH 2 but not at pH 3. A further increase by one pH unit to pH 4 restored good foaming. At pH 5 – 8, SP 16 again showed low foaming propensity, whereas the presence of salt (NaCl) was able to restore foaming again. Interfacial tension and circular dichroism investigations revealed the foaming control mechanism. The high negative charge (− 16. 6) at pH 6 and above restricted the ability of SP 16 to fold into an α-helical conformation and also restricted surface activity. For pH 5 (− 13. 6), even though SP 16 folds in bulk to give α-helical structure, the high charge inhibited adsorption at the air–water interface, resulting in a significant lag time of about 150 – 200 sec to achieve a decrease in interfacial tension. In contrast to its low <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> at pH 5 – 8, the presence of salt (NaCl) was found to effectively screen negative charge, thus leading to its folding and a decrease of interfacial tension. This new design offers a new strategy to control <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and elaborates a clear link between charge, structure and interfacial activity for biosurfactants.

40|$|Improving {{the melt}} {{strength}} of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is of continuing strategic research interest since a low melt strength results in poor processability of foaming and blowing film. PLA was modified {{in various ways}} including crosslinking, chain extension, grafting, blending, plasticizing and nucleation to improve its melt strength. This work focuses {{on the effect of}} melt strength after various modifications on <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> and cell structures of PLA foam. Cell density was increased and cell structure became more uniform with increasing melt strength, in particular when the melt strain was also increased after modification. With increasing melt strength the phenomenon of open and ruptured cells was decreased. The foaming window was widened with increasing melt strength, in particular after crosslinking, chain extension and blending with elastomer.

40|$|Today, foam {{extrusion}} {{is a well}} established polymer processing technology. Generally oil-based polystyrene (PS) is one standard material used for producing thermoformable extruded foam sheets with physical blowing agents (PBA). PS is non-biodegradable polymer based on non-renewable resources. Contrary, cellulose acetate (CA) is biodegradable and bio-based polymer which exhibits similar properties to PS. This contribution presents recent results of {{foam extrusion}} of externally (physically) plasticized CA using different types of PBAs and different amount of talc as nucleating agent. Generally, the density of CA decreased of about 12 -times. The PBA {{as well as the}} talc have a significant influence on the <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour,</b> the physical foam properties and consequently on the foam morphology.

English Sparkling Wine (ESW) {{has gained a}} good international reputation for quality, and maintaining this standard {{is critical to the}} UK wine industry. Effervescence and foamability are key features used to assess ESW quality. A critical, yet understudied, area of research is the potential for dosage to influence <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour</b> via associated changes in wine viscosity. In this project, dosage treatments of increasing levels of sucrose (5 g/L, 10 g/L, 20 g/L, and 50 g/L,) were added to commercially produced ESW, using commercial dosage practices. After storage for two months, bottles were opened and the foamability attributes of different treatments analyses via two novel foam assessment methods; an adapted Mosalux method and a novel image analysis method, designed to simulate more accurately ‘real world’ serving conditions when assessing <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour.</b> General wine chemical parameters as well as the wine dynamic viscosity were also measured. Results indicated that increasing sucrose concentration at dosage resulted in an improved foam formation, but reduced foam stability. As expected, sucrose increased wine viscosity and we hypothesised that this change could be the major driver for the observed alterations in <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour.</b> These results give an important insight into the impact that dosage treatments can have on the quality of foam produced upon pouring, and therefore have the potential to inform future sparkling winemaking practice...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{nanoparticles}} as foam stabilisers {{has gained}} increasing attention in recent years, for applications {{in a number of}} process industries, such as food colloids, metal and ceramics production and mineral flotation. Here we consider the <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of 270 nm silica particle suspensions, hydrophobised to varying extents via esterification with butanol, octanol and dodecanol. The <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> was related to the compressed two-dimensional monolayer behaviour from Langmuir–Blodgett trough and SEM studies. The octanol esterified species performed best as both dynamic and static foaming agents, indicating particles of moderate hydrophobicity may work best as stabilisers. Dynamic foam stability results were linked to the balancing of interfilm drainage and steric stabilisation mechanisms. No firm conclusions could be drawn on the total effect of hydrophobicity on static foams, as particles esterified in dodecanol shear-flocculated under the stresses of foam production. Foam stability correlated well to compressed monolayer behaviour, with two-dimensional stability being influenced by the competing effects of a more disordered network structure and higher interfacial strength, as particle hydrophobicity was increased. It is noted that even with the best performing particles, less than 10 % of a given dispersion interacted under shaking to form bulk foam...|$|E

Especially for In and for 3 micrometer-Al 2 O 3 -particles, significant improvements of the <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> as expressed by the maximum expansion levels obtainable could be observed. In contrast, no major variation of compression strength was substantiated by the experimental data, {{the exception to the}} rule being Sn additions, which led to a deterioration of strength as consequence of unfavourable microstructural characteristics. Pore sizes, however, have invariably been found to decrease irrespective of nature and concentration of additions. Thus the study suggests that the use of additives of the kind evaluated here should be motivated by requirements regarding expansion performance rather than maximum strength. However, given the limited number of samples available, the influence of the observed structural changes on the scatter of mechanical properties could not be judged. Therefore, a continuation of the present study to verify the influence of mesostructural features on property variation at given densities may be considered worthwhile...|$|E
40|$|Miscible gas injection, as an Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method, {{can improve}} the {{recovery}} factor by swelling the residual oil and phasing out the interfacial tension. However, the sweep efficiency of miscible gas injection is not satisfactory because of conformance problems, such as viscous fingering, channelling and gravity override. Foam can solve {{the problems associated with}} gas injection by reducing the mobility of gas and therefore sustaining a stable displacement front. It is known that under immiscible conditions, the presence of oil can damage foam stability through different mechanisms. However, it is not fully understood how interactions between gas and oil under miscible conditions may affect <b>foam</b> flow <b>behaviour.</b> In this study, the effects of oil on <b>foam</b> flow <b>behaviour</b> under miscible conditions are investigated. To this end, several foam flooding experiments have been conducted using CO 2 and decane, as a model gas and a model oil, respectively, under miscible conditions. These core-flooding experiments have been conducted with different molar fractions of CO 2 and decane. Through these experiments, it has been found that both supercritical CO 2 foam and decane emulsion display a low-quality regime and a high-quality regime, whereas, in the presence of oil under miscible conditions, CO 2 -decane-surfactant floods do not show low and high-quality regimes. Based on CO 2 molar fraction in CO 2 -decane mixture and its effects on <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour,</b> three different regimes have been observed. Regime 1 (CO 2 molar fraction in CO 2 -decane mixture is larger than 0. 8) has the highest apparent viscosity among the three regimes. In regime 2 (CO 2 molar fraction in CO 2 -decane mixture is below 0. 2), the apparent viscosity is still high, although lower than that of regime 1. Finally, within regime 3 (CO 2 molar fraction in CO 2 -decane mixture ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 8), the apparent viscosity is the lowest (around 50 cP) among the three regimes and does not experience significant changes. Furthermore, through a set of shear-thinning experiments, {{it has been shown that}} both supercritical CO 2 foam and decane emulsion, as well as CO 2 -decane-surfactant floods in regime 3, all exhibit shear-thinning rheology. Moreover, in regime 1 and regime 2, there is a transition at shear rates from 10 s- 1 to 100 s- 1, where the apparent viscosity is increased by one order of magnitude. In regime 3, however, the apparent viscosity is at its largest value already (up to 560 cP) when shear rate is even lower than 20 s- 1. Finally, in order to examine the capability of the STARS foam model to capture the oil effects on <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour</b> under miscible conditions, the experimental foam-scan data has been used to estimate the STARS foam model parameters.

Iron sulfide, hydrocarbon and sodium chloride are the impurities which apparently contributed to the high foaming tendency of the solutions.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{cellulose}} acetate (CA) is a bio-based polymer with optical, mechanical and thermal properties {{comparable to those}} of polystyrene (PS). The substitution of the predominant petrol-based PS in applications like foamed food trays can lead to a more sustainable economic practice. However, CA is also suitable for more durable applications as the biodegradability rate can be controlled by adjusting the degree of substitutions. The extrusion foaming of CA still has to overcome certain challenges. CA is highly hydrophilic and can suffer from hydrolytic degradation if not dried properly. Therefore, the influence of residual moisture on the melt viscosity is rather high. Beyond, the surface quality of foam CA sheets is below those of PS due to the particular <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This paper presents results of a recent study on extrusion foamed CA, using a two-component physical blowing agent system compromising HFO 1234 ze as blowing agent and organic solvents as co-propellant.

In particular, {{it focuses on}} the drainage of the liquid, and thus {{the evolution of the}} liquid content, within the growing or collapsing foam. By assuming that the films fail when they are subjected to a pressure above a certain critical pressure, the collapse of the foam is modelled. The model predicts that the growing <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be divided into two regimes: at low gas rates, the foams will asymptote towards an equilibrium height, while above a certain critical gas rate, the foams will continue to grow indefinitely. This behaviour was found experimentally as well. At the higher gas rates, there is a change in the slope of the foam height versus time plot, though {{with the exception of a}} transition region, this relationship remains a linear relationship one. The difference between these slopes can be used to estimate the pressure exerted on the films at the top surface of the foam.

LOPE-PP and HOPE-PP blends were prepared in a batch mixer with and without compatibilising agents, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) and ethylene-propylene (EP) copolymer. Several mixing conditions (temperature, time, rotor speed) were used to modify the morphology and the flow behaviour of the blend systems. In shear flow diverse pseudoplastic index, zero shear rate viscosity and the extensional viscosities, whilst, in uniaxial extensional flow the effects of process conditions on strain energy density, elongation at break and melt modulus were detected. The melt strength of uncompatibilised LOPE-rich systems is generally higher. The use of small quantities of EPR, 2. 5 and 5. 0...|$|E
40|$|Foams {{from high}} {{performance}} polymers find {{more and more}} interest. The processes to generate them can be difficult, however. It is shown how physical foaming with CO(2) {{can be used as}} a first step to assess the potentials of such materials. For investigations of such kind an autoclave on a laboratory scale which allows pressure variations up to 300 bars and temperatures up to 300 degrees C was set up. The samples are saturated with supercritical carbon dioxide (s. c. CO(2)) which acts as a foaming agent. Depending on the process and material parameters different foam characteristics and cell morphologies were obtained and characterised. The potential of this method is demonstrated for two different classes of advanced polymer materials, thermoplastic fluoropolymers (PEP), and a silicone resin. In the case of the fluoropolymer, previously prepared films were foamed and the effects of various process parameters on the foam characteristics were investigated. Besides the general potential of foams from fluoropolymers, they are candidates for polymeric piezoelectric materials with a relatively high temperature stability. Silicone polymers possess some properties superior to common organic polymers. First results on the <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a silicone resin are presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} <b>foaming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of mixed protein/anionic polysaccharide solutions, we investigated the effect of beta-lactoglobulin/pectin interaction in the bulk on beta-lactoglobulin adsorption to the air-water interface. Adsorption kinetics were evaluated by following surface pressure development in time of several pure protein solutions and of mixed protein/polysaccharide solutions using an automated drop tensiometer (ADT). It was found that complexation of proteins with polysaccharides can slow down the kinetics of surface pressure development by at least a factor 100; and greatly diminish foam formation. In contrast, a five times acceleration in the increase of surface pressure was observed in other cases. We propose a mechanism for protein adsorption from mixed protein/polysaccharide solutions. Effects of ionic strength, pH and mixing ratio on this mechanism were studied for mixtures of beta-lactoglobulin and low methoxyl pectin, whereas other proteins and anionic polysaccharides were used to explore the role of protein and polysaccharide charge density and distribution. Whereas the possibilities to change system parameters like ionic strength or pH are limited in food related systems, selecting a suitable combination of protein and polysaccharide offers a broad opportunity to control protein adsorption kinetics and with that foam formation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{are still}} many open {{questions}} and problems in both fundamental research and practical applications of foams. Despite the fact that foams have been extensively studied, many aspects of foam physics and chemistry still remain unclear. Experiments on foams performed under microgravity allow studying wet foams, such as those obtained early during the foaming process. On Earth, wet foams evolve too quickly due to gravity drainage and only dry foams can be studied. This paper reviews the foam and foam film studies that we have performed in gravity-free conditions. It {{highlights the importance of}} surface rheology as well as of confinement effects in foams and <b>foam</b> films <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe final {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the mechanical behaviour of composite sandwich structures under dynamic loading (impact or crash). Cellular materials are often used as core in sandwich structures and their behaviour has a significant influence on the response of the sandwich under impact. Syntactic foams are widely used in many impact-absorbing applications and can be employed as sandwich core. To optimize their mechanical performance requires the characterisation of the <b>foam</b> <b>behaviour</b> at high strain rates and identification of the underlying mechanisms. Mechanical tests were conducted on syntactic foams under quasi-static and high strain rate compression loading. The material behaviour has been determined as a function of two parameters, density and strain rate. These tests were complemented by experiments on a new device installed on a flywheel. This device was designed in order to achieve compression tests on foam at intermediate strain rates. With these test machines, the dynamic compressive behaviour has been evaluated in the strain rate range up [6. 7 · 10 − 4 s− 1, 100 s− 1]. Impact tests were conducted on syntactic foam plates with varying volume fractions of microspheres and impact conditions. A Design of Experiment tool was employed to identify the influence of the three parameters (microsphere volume fraction, projectile mass and height of fall) on the energy response. Microtomography was employed to visualize in 3 D the deformation of the structure of hollow spheres to obtain a better understanding of the micromechanisms involved in energy absorption...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe cyclic {{behaviour}} of 400 mu m pore size replicated aluminium foam is assessed in tension-tension fatigue with a stress ratio equal to 0. 1, keeping the load amplitude constant, for relative density values comprised between 0. 175 and 0. 220. The {{number of cycles}} to failure ranges from 6 x 10 (2) (lowest relative density) to 5 x 10 (6) (highest relative density). The foams display cyclic creep coupled with a strong influence of relative density on their general fatigue performance.
