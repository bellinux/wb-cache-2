The properties of cements based on prepared powders evaluated are: setting time, <b>injectability</b> and cohesion. The compressive strength of selected cement samples was determined.

40|$|The ai m of {{the present}} work was to analyze the {{influence}} of the setting reaction on the <b>injectability</b> of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) pastes. Even if the injection was performed early after mixing powder and liquid, powder reactivity was shown to play a significan t role in the <b>injectability</b> of TCP pastes. Significant differences were observed between the injection behavior of non - hardening β - TCP pastes and that of self - hardening α - TCP pastes. The differences were more marked at low liquid - to - powder ratios, using fi ne powders and injecting through thin needles. α - TCP was in general less injectable than β - TCP and required higher injection loads. Moreover, clogging was identified as a mechanism hindering or even preventing <b>injectability,</b> different and clearly distingui shable from the filter - pressing phenomenon. α - TCP pastes presented transient clogging episodes, which were not observed in β - TCP pastes with equivalent particle size distribution. Different parameters affecting powder reactivity were shown to affect also p aste <b>injectability.</b> Thus, whereas powder calcination resulted in an increased <b>injectability</b> due to lower particle reactivity, the addition of setting accelerants, such as hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, tended to reduce the <b>injectability</b> of the TCP pastes, e specially if adjoined simultaneously with a Na 2 HPO 4 solution. Although as a general trend faster setting pastes were less injectable, some exceptions were found to this rule.

The varied experimental parameters included: (i) the heat treatment temperature within the range of 800 – 1100 C; (ii) different milling extents of calcined powders; (iii) the liquid-to-powder ratio (LPR); (iv) the use of powder blends with different particle sizes (PS) and particle size distributions (PSD); (v) the partial replacement of fine powders by large spherical dense granules prepared via freeze granulation method to simulate coarse individual particles.

40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of solvent, as well as needle length and thickness (gauge) on the <b>injectability</b> of PEO solutions. Background. To abuse drugs such as tablets intravenously, the products are first crushed and then dissolved in a small amounts of liquid. This mixture is then filtered and drawn into a syringe to extract the drug before being injected. High viscosifying agents such as PEO have been incorporated into abusable medications to deter this abuse. It is assumed that the more viscous a solution, the more difficult it would be drawing into and out (<b>injectability)</b> of a syringe. This was tested using solutions of PEO in common extraction solvents ejected through various needle configurations. Methods. Water, normal saline, pH 3, and 40 % ethanol were solvents used to make 2. 5 % w/v concentrations of PEO (Polyox™ WSR Coagulant NF). A texture analyzer was used to measure ease of <b>injectability</b> of solutions through a 19 G, 22 G or 25 gauge needed attached to a 3 mL syringe at a rate of 0. 5 mm/sec. Resistance or Dynamic Gliding Force (DGF) was quantified as the average force obtained over the syringe distance using Texture Pro CT Software. Results.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of DGF as a quantitative measurement in estimating the level of abuse deterrence to intravenous injection. Background. In developing solid oral medications resistant to various forms of recreational abuse, proper selection of inactive ingredients that can resist common tampering methods is critical. Of particular concern is preventing abuse by injecting the drug extract intravenously or intramuscularly. Given the fact that there is no standards which to measure <b>injectability</b> of drug solutions extracted from abuse-deterrent medications, the <b>injectability</b> of such extracts needs to be performed using reliable and reproducible methods. As such, this study suggests the use of DGF as a standard measurement of <b>injectability</b> for quantitative and qualitative purposes related to parenteral resistance. Methods. Using a common abuse deterrent ingredient (Polyox™ WSR Coagulant NF), 2. 5 % w/v of Polyox solutions were prepared in water, normal saline, pH 3 and 40 % ethanol solvents. These solutions were loaded into 3 mL syringes with an attached needle (19 G X 1. 5 ”), and the DGF of each solution measured at four rates (0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 mm/sec) using a texture analyzer equipped with a syringe fixture. Results. DGF increased gradually when rate of injection was increased for all solvents excluding 40 % ethanol. DGF increased rapidly with increasing rate for 40 % ethanol. Conclusion.

40|$|Liquid Avonex® (Interferon beta- 1 a) {{manufactured}} by Biogen, Inc. is indicated {{for the treatment}} of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) to slow the accumulation of physical disability and decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations. The recommended dosage of A vonex® {{for the treatment of}} relapsing forms of MS is 30 μg injected intramuscularly once a week. Several complications have been reported following intramuscular (IM) injections, of which pain at the injection site is the most common. Though factors such as site of injection, injection volume, concentration and nature of the drug may affect the reception of pain, one factor which has not apparently been given any attention in the published literature is the ease of <b>injectability</b> of the syringe, which is the amount of force required to expel the drug from the syringe. This factor can be expected to have a substantial effect on the discomfort experienced by patients and on the completeness of the injection (i. e. the percentage of dose delivered). An evaluation of the published literature by the author of this thesis has failed to reveal any publications dealing with the role of <b>injectability</b> as a measure for easing the pain on injection. There is a need for some objective, quantitative method for measuring the ease of <b>injectability</b> such as may be provided by use of the Instron Series 5500. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform compressive studies on the intramuscular injection, Liquid Avonex® staked and luer-slip pre-filled syringes using the Instron Series 5500. The Instrument generates an expulsion force profile from which the force required for the initial movement of the plunger into the syringe (breakout force) was calculated. An ideal syringe with good ease of <b>injectability</b> will have minimum breakout force and a smooth expulsion profile. Thus by studying the various factors affecting the expulsion force profile, the ease of <b>injectability</b> of syringes was quantified. The various factors studied were age and viscosity of silicone oil, storage temperature, addition of surfactant and the speed of expulsion. The viscosity of the silicone oil and the method of siliconization were found to be critical factors defining the expulsion force profile. The 1000 cSt silicone oil was found to give better ease of <b>injectability</b> than the 12, 500 cSt silicone oil. Increase of storage temperature, addition of surfactant and increase of expulsion speed did not have any substantial effect on the expulsion force profile of the syringe. Pain on IM injection is also related to the mechanical properties of the needle insertion, which include the maximum force required to penetrate the muscle and the penetration profile of the needle into the muscle. Needle penetration studies were conducted to examine the injection profiles of staked and non-staked needle sharps using a model intramuscular injection pad. The results showed that nonstaked needles need lesser penetration force and show linear penetration profile in comparison with staked needles and hence cause less pain on injection. In conclusion, the results reported in this study clearly indicate that compressive studies using the Instron Series 5500 are an effective and convenient way to quantify the ease of <b>injectability</b> of syringes...|$|E

The market for injectable fillers is a multibillion dollar industry worldwide, and each FDA-approved injectable filler has its own drawbacks, namely, lack of durability for temporary fillers, and difficulty in injection for semi-permanent to permanent fillers. A new material that offers solutions to the problems with the existing products will have a big market potential. The intended application of the novel filler in this study is for treating urinary incontinence. In this thesis, we present a novel injectable filler that lasts > 6 months, is easy to inject, has an elastic modulus that matches the soft tissue to fit the contour, has customizable mechanical characteristics for different application, off-the-shelf, has good biocompatibility, and the feasibility to be co-injected with cells. The novel injectable semi-permanent filler designed in this study is a hydrogel composed of an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) of random co-pHEMA-PEGMA-TEGDMA intertwined with CMC chains with various degrees of entanglement, polymer chain lengths, crosslinking and different flow properties. We name this injectable HPTC. HPTC was found to have the desirable <b>injectability</b> as a soft tissue filler only under a narrow range of optimal conditions. We studied the parameters that govern the <b>injectability</b> of HPTC using Intron <b>injectability</b> assay and rheological testing. We characterized the factors that were important for determining its force of injection, elastic and viscous moduli, oscillatory stress in response to increasing strain, viscosity change under constant shearing, and the percentage loss in elastic modulus after disruptive shearing. The effect of water content, steric hindrance introduced by the CMC pre-polymerization, CMC chain length, and the percentage of TEGDMA all have important contribution to the <b>injectability</b> of HPTC. We showed that optimal HPTC has superior <b>injectability</b> over the major permanent fillers that are FDA approved, which solved the needle-clogging problem. HPTC also showed good biocompatibility with no signs of fibrotic capsules, durability in vivo for 6 months, good tissue integration, undetectable migration to other organs, and feasibility to be co-injected with cells. It has also been evaluated for its efficacy in the treatment of urinary incontinence in an animal model for 24 weeks, and has shown significant dose-dependent improvement in urethral function by having an increased abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) compared to the incontinence model alone. Combining its superior <b>injectability,</b> customizable mechanical viscoelastic properties, biocompatibility and effectiveness of restoring the urethral function in a rat incontinence model for 6 months, HPTC is a good candidate as a semi-permanent/ permanent injectable material for soft tissue augmentation...|$|E

It was found that Si-HPMC could endow composite CPC pastes with an appealing rheological behavior at the early stage of setting, promoting its application in open bone cavities. Moreover, Si-HPMC gave the composite CPC good <b>injectability</b> and cohesion, and reduced the setting time.

Comparison of the predicted values and measured data indicates that the ANFIS model has an acceptable performance to the estimation of calcium phosphate bone cement properties. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} of an antibiotic, sodiumfusidate (SF), into the liquid phase of calcium carbonate–calcium phosphate(CaCO 3 –CaP) bone cement was evaluated, considering {{the effect of}} the liquid to powder ratio (L/P) on the composition and microstructure of the set cement and the <b>injectability</b> of the paste. In all cases, we obtained set cements composed mainly of biomimetic carbonated apatite analogous to bone mineral. With this study,we evidenced a synergistic effect of the L/P ratio and SF presence on the <b>injectability</b> (i. e., the filter-pressing phenomenon was suppressed) and the setting time of the SF-loaded cement paste compared to reference cement(without SF). In addition, the in vitro study of SF release, according to the European Pharmacopoeia recommendations, showed that, regardless of the L/P ratio, the cement allowed a sustained release of the antibiotic over 1 month in sodiumchloride isotonic solution at 37 °C and pH 7. 4; this release is discussed considering the microstructure characteristics of SF-loaded cements (i. e., porosity, pore-size distribution) before and after the release test. Finally, modelling antibiotic release kinetics with severalmodels indicated that the SF releasewas controlled by a diffusion mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Portland cement (PC) is {{generally}} {{known for its}} various applications in the construction industry. However, since mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), a PC based root filling material, obtained {{food and drug administration}} (FDA) approval in the late 1990 ’s there has been an increased interest {{in the use of the}} cement for other in vivo applications. PCs are durable, possess high compressive strengths, set in aqueous environments such as those found in vivo and have demonstrated desirable tissue responses as an endodontic sealant. The <b>injectability</b> of PC with various additives was investigated for use in clinical applications such as vertebroplasty (the stabilisation of a fractured vertebra with bone cement) using a syringe with a 2 mm aperture. Additives significantly improved cement <b>injectability,</b> decreased setting times from over 2 h to below 20 minutes while maintaining the compressive strength of the material. Cement characterisation methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD), helium pycnometry and zeta potential measurements were employed to elucidate the effect of the additives on the cement setting reaction. The biocompatibility of PC was investigated with fibroblast and bone marrow cells. The freshly mixed cement appeared cytotoxic while set cement upregulated genes associated with the osteogenic phenotype. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{additives}} {{to improve}} the quality of cement grouts is crucial for civil engineering, especially in foundation construction. This article presents experimental data concerning the compressive strength, elastic modulus, bleeding and <b>injectability</b> of microfine cement grouts modified with epoxy and acrylic resin emulsions. Strength properties were obtained at different curing ages. For further analysis and detailed discussion of properties of polymer-modified cement grouts, see “Fundamental properties of epoxy resin-modified cement grouts” (C. A. Anagnostopoulos, G. Sapidis, E.
