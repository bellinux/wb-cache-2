A specific drawing tool of small size was designed and subsequently achieved in the laboratory. The formability of a rolled and annealed 1050 A aluminum sheet (99. 5 %) was characterized and analyzed. Seeing the size of the specimen and the tool, the spacer is replaced by a central electro-discharged smaller thickness. The micro-forming press was coupled with a system for strain measurements based on image analysis with a correlation method. After experimental tests with 7 different geometries, the strains were determined {{at the beginning of the}} necking from the various images. Based on this, three methods of determination of the MFLD were proposed (white pixel emergence, polynomial method and strain profile analysis) and compared. Finally, an experimental <b>deep</b> drawing cylindrical <b>cup</b> <b>test</b> rendered it possible to validate the most accurate method for determining the micro-forming limit diagram...|$|R

40|$|A variational {{formulation}} and {{the associated}} finite element (FE) equations have been derived for general three-dimensional deformation of a planar anisotropic rigid-plastic sheet metal which obeys the strain-rate potential proposed by Barlat et al. [Int. J. Plasticity 9, 1 (1993) ]. By using the natural convected coordinate system, the effect of geometric change and the rotation of planar anisotropic axes were efficiently considered. In order to check {{the validity of the}} present formulation, a cylindrical <b>cup</b> <b>deep</b> drawing <b>test</b> was modeled for a 2008 -T 4 aluminum alloy sheet sample. Eating simulations were performed and planar anisotropic material properties were experimentally determined. Even though quantitative agreement was not fully achieved, reasonably good agreement was found between the FE simulation and the experiment in thickness strain distribution and caring. No numerical difficulty due to planar anisotropy was encountered, and the computational procedure was found to be very stable, requiring only moderate computational time. The results have shown that the present formulation for planar anisotropic deformation can provide a good basis for the analysis of sheet metal forming processes for planar anisotropic materials, especially for aluminum alloy sheets...|$|R

40|$|In this work, Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF), a {{state of}} art technique, was carried out on Aluminum AA 6061 alloy sheets and its forming limit was {{determined}} experimentally. The straight groove and <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> were carried using ball ended tool in CNC vertical milling machine.
