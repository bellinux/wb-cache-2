Basilisk, manejado sob lotação contínua. O delineamento foi em blocos casualizados, com três repetições, em esquema de parcela subdivida, considerando parcelas os locais próximos e distantes das fezes e subparcelas as categorias de perfilhos vegetativos e reprodutivos. A massa de lâmina foliar viva (LFV) por perfilho em locais próximos às fezes (0, 14 g) foi maior que nos locais distantes das fezes (0, 08 g), contrariamente ao verificado para a composição de massa de lâmina foliar morta por perfilho. A massa de LFV nos perfilhos vegetativos (0, 15 g) foi maior que nos perfilhos reprodutivos (0, 06 g). Por outro lado, a massa de colmo (0, 38 g) e de lâmina foliar morta (0, 20 g) foi maior nos perfilhos reprodutivos. O peso dos perfilhos das plantas próximas às fezes foi maior (0, 58 g) que daqueles distantes das fezes (0, 17 g). Em locais próximos das fezes, o número de perfilhos vegetativos foi menor, enquanto o de perfilhos reprodutivos foi maior. Maiores massas de colmo verde, forragem verde e forragem total do pasto foram observados nos locais próximos das fezes, quando comparadas aos distantes. Mesmo resultado foi obtido para a altura do pasto. A estrutura do pasto de Brachiaria decumbens é modificada pela localização das fezes dos bovinos em pastejo. A deposição de fezes por bovinos constitui fator de heterogeneidade espacial da vegetação em pastagem. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of the cattle feces location on the characteristics of vegetative and reproductive tillers, dry mass content in plant components, forage volumetric density and Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk pasture height managed under continuous stocking. It was used a randomized block design with three repetitions in a split-plot scheme considering the plots the sites next and far from feces and the sub-plots were the vegetative and reproductive tiller categories. Dry mass content of live foliar blade (LFB) per tiller in sites near the feces (0. 14 g) was higher than in the sites distant from the feces (0. 08 g), opposing to what was verified for composition of dry matter of dead foliar blade per tiller. Content of LFB dry mass in vegetative tillers (0. 15 g) was higher than in the reproductive tillers (0. 06 g). On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>composition</b> in stem dry matter (0. 38 g) and in dead foliar blade (0. 20 g) were higher for reproductive tillers. Tiller weight of the plants near the feces was higher (0. 58 g) than those far from the feces (0. 17 g). On sites near the feces, the number of vegetative tiller was lower, while the number of reproductive tiller was higher. Higher contents of dry matter of the green stem, green forage and total forage of the pasture were observed on sites close to feces when compared to the far ones. The same result was obtained for the pasture height. The Brachiaria decumbens pasture structure is modified by the position of the cattle feces. Cattle feces droppings are a heterogeneous spatial factor of vegetation on grazing areas...|$|E

Comments in code represent a main source for system documentation. They help software developers both to understand code for maintenance or further development but also to use code as a library or framework in other projects. Although many software developers consider comments to be important, existing approaches for software quality analysis ignore system commenting or make only quantitative claims.

The VMI architecture protects the intrusion detection system from an attacker’s malicious activity inside the monitored virtual machine and because of virtualization, it provides the intrusion detection system effective visibility of the monitored machine’s state. This thesis discusses {{the application of the}} virtual machine introspection architecture to the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and presents an implementation which provides the monitored virtual machine’s state information to the intrusion detection system.

Since products and services become more complex and consequently more knowledge intensive, companies are more and more likely to position themselves on basis of their expertise. As a result, knowledge becomes an organization’s main source of a sustainable competitive advantage allowing companies to be more successful than the competitors.
