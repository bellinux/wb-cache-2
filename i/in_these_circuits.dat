They parted, as we said, in a year or two, mutually indignant; and the Orzelska went to Avignon, to Venice and else-whither, and settled into Catholic devotion in cheap countries of agreeable climate.

50|$|The LFR is a two-port {{element that}} has the {{following}} characteristics: (1) an equivalent resistive characteristic R at the input terminals, and (2) a power source P at the output terminals. The value of P {{is determined by the}} power consumed by the equivalent resistor R. This power is supplied (by the power source P) to the bus U that powers the total system. The TVT (and TVG) can be realized by a family of switched-mode circuits. The losses, which practically occur <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>circuits,</b> can be modeled by a series and parallel resistors (r, and rp, respectively). Thus, the total circuit can be modeled by a cascade combination of those resistors and TVT (or TVG).|$|E
50|$|In modern signal processing, devices, such as {{operational}} amplifiers, {{are designed}} to have an input impedance several orders of magnitude higher than the output impedance of the source device connected to that input.

The losses due to input impedance (loading) <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>circuits</b> will be minimised and the voltage at the input of the amplifier will be close to voltage as if the amplifier circuit was not connected. When a device whose input impedance could cause significant degradation of the signal is used, oftentimes a device with a high input impedance and a low output impedance is used minimise its effects. Voltage follower or impedance-matching transformers are often used for these effects.|$|E

Our proposed technology uses engineered zinc-finger proteins and target DNA sequences as a scalable solution to implementing independent logic gates. The technology additionally attaches dimerization domains to the zinc-finger proteins to enable cooperativity and provide logic gates with nonlinear gain.
