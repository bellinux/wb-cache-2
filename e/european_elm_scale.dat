40|$|<b>European</b> <b>elms</b> (Ulmus glabra Huds., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Ulmus minor Mill.) {{have been}} {{severely}} damaged {{and are still}} endangered by an alien hypervirulent pathogen, Ophiostoma ulmi s. l., agent of the Dutch elm disease (DED). Consequently, several ex situ clone collections have been established throughout Europe for elm breeding and conservation. In this paper we summarise the studies carried out within the EU project RESGEN CT 96 - 78, which launched the EU-coordinated evaluation of these collections. Our aim was to analyse the variation in timing of bud burst and to acquire basic knowledge on the environmental control of this adaptive trait in <b>European</b> <b>elms,</b> under the hypothesis that DED susceptibility is related to spring phenology. The variation in the bud burst date of <b>European</b> <b>elms</b> among collections and years was explained by a phenological model assuming that the thermal time required for bud burst decreases exponentially with increasing chilling during winter down to a level where chilling requirement is fully met. According to the fitted curves, <b>European</b> <b>elms</b> have low dormancy and short chilling requirement for dormancy release. Although no simulation was performed, {{on the basis of}} the model applied we can hypothesise that under climate warming elms would flush earlier in most of Europe. The bud burst date was directly related to latitude and elevation in U. minor. The order of bud burst of clones from different origins was stable among years. The observed geographic trends were largely determined by differences in chilling requirements that increased with latitude and elevation. Susceptibility to DED varied greatly within U. minor and was directly correlated with geographic origin and bud burst date, southern and early flushing clones showing the least symptoms. Our results suggest that early flushing represents a mechanism of disease avoidance owing to asynchrony between host&# 8217;s susceptible period and time of natural infection by DED vectors (Scolytus). This escape mechanism, combined with true resistance and avoidance owing to unattractiveness for the vector&# 8217;s feeding, might be exploited for breeding DED-resistant clones of indigenous species...|$|R

50|$|Like other <b>European</b> <b>elms,</b> natural {{populations of}} the <b>European</b> white <b>elm</b> have little innate {{resistance}} to Dutch elm disease, although research by Irstea has isolated clones able to survive inoculation with the causal fungus, initially losing < 70% of their foliage, but regenerating strongly the following year. Moreover, the tree is not favoured by the vector bark beetles, which colonize it only {{when there are no}} other elm alternatives available, an uncommon situation in western Europe. Indeed, in a study of elm in Flanders, not one example of U. laevis was found to be afflicted by Dutch elm disease. Research in Spain has indicated that it is the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, which renders the tree bark unattractive to the beetles. Ergo: the tree's decline in western Europe is chiefly owing to woodland clearance in river valleys, not disease.|$|R

The observed geographic trends were largely determined by difference in chilling requirement for dormancy release which increased with latitude and elevation. The effects of photoperiod and temperature on dormancy release in clones of European and Asian species were studied in partially controlled conditions in Italy. Dormancy was generally low and short in all clones. There {{was no evidence that}} photoperiod influenced dormancy release in these elms. Susceptibility to DED was assessed in the Italian clone collection. Susceptibility varied greatly among taxonomic groups and within the most represented species, U. minor. In this species, DED susceptibility was directly correlated with geographic origin and date of bud burst, southern and early flushing clones showing the least symptoms.

50|$|Ulmus laevis {{is similar}} in stature to the wych elm, if rather less symmetric, with a looser branch {{structure}} and less neatly rounded crown. It typically reaches a height and breadth of > 30 m, with a trunk < 2 m d.b.h. The extensive shallow root system ultimately forms distinctive high buttresses {{around the base of}} the trunk. The bark is smooth at first, then in early maturity breaks into thin grey scales, which separate with age into a network of grey-brown scales and reddish-brown underbark, and finally is deeply fissured in old age like other elms. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple ovate with a markedly lop-sided base, < 10 cm long and < 7 cm broad, comparatively thin, often almost papery in texture and very translucent, smooth above with a downy underside. The leaves are shed earlier in autumn than other species of <b>European</b> <b>elm.</b> However, the tree is most reliably distinguished from other <b>European</b> <b>elms</b> by its long flower stems, averaging 20 mm. Moreover, the apetalous wind-pollinated flowers are distinctively cream-coloured, appearing before the leaves in early spring in clusters of 15-30; they are 3-4 mm across. The fruit is a winged samara < 15 mm long by 10 mm broad with a ciliate margin, the single round 5 mm seed maturing in late spring. The seeds have a generally high rate of germination, 45-60% for Serbian trees examined by Stilinović.|$|R
50|$|Bark beetles (family Scolytidae) are {{important}} symbiotic partners of ascomycetes. The female beetles transport fungal spores to new hosts in characteristic tucks in their skin, the mycetangia. The beetle tunnels {{into the wood}} and into large chambers in which they lay their eggs. Spores released from the mycetangia germinate into hyphae, which can break down the wood. The beetle larvae then feed on the fungal mycelium, and, on reaching maturity, carry new spores with them to renew the cycle of infection. A well-known {{example of this is}} Dutch elm disease, caused by Ophiostoma ulmi, which is carried by the <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> bark beetle, Scolytus multistriatus.|$|R
