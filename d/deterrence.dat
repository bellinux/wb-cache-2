5|$|Besides {{having a}} main {{military}} goal of <b>deterrence,</b> strategists envisioned the Swiss nuclear strike capability {{as part of}} a preemptive war against the Soviets. The Swiss Air Force Mirage III jet {{would have been able to}} carry nuclear bombs as far as Moscow. They also suggested the weapons could be used on Swiss soil against a possible invading force.|$|E
5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of the plan were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan impractical except for <b>deterrence,</b> due to security concerns.|$|E
5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} <b>deterrence</b> {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation {{and serve as a}} signal to other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of the}} colony.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and <b>deterrence</b> for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as a pest, {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through <b>deterrence</b> and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E
5|$|To {{reassure the}} Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague {{recommended that the}} plan be redesigned primarily {{as a means of}} <b>deterrence.</b> Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{successful}} contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design {{evolved from a}} straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era <b>deterrence</b> missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become {{commonly referred to as}} the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent {{through a combination of}} military <b>deterrence,</b> concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Under General Henri Guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and <b>deterrence</b> that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|In May 1957, Eisenhower tasked the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) {{to provide}} {{a report on the}} {{potential}} effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting the US population {{in the event of a}} nuclear war. Chaired by Horace Rowan Gaither, the PSAC team completed their study in September, publishing it officially on 7 November as <b>Deterrence</b> & Survival in the Nuclear Age, but today known as the Gaither Report. After ascribing an expansionist policy to the USSR, along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than the US, the Report suggested that there would be a significant gap in capability in the late 1950s due to spending levels.|$|E
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator <b>deterrence</b> and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deterrence</b> – Individual <b>deterrence</b> {{is aimed}} toward the {{specific}} offender. The {{aim is to}} impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior. General <b>deterrence</b> aims at society at large. By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses, other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer's {{first book}} Conventional <b>Deterrence</b> (1983) {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how decisions to start a war depend on the projected outcome of military conflict. In other words, how do decision makers' beliefs about the outcome of war affect {{the success or failure of}} <b>deterrence?</b> Mearsheimer's basic argument is that <b>deterrence</b> is likely to work when the potential attacker believes that a successful attack will be unlikely and costly. If the potential attacker, however, has reason to believe the attack will likely succeed and entail low costs, then <b>deterrence</b> is likely to break down. This is now widely accepted to be the way the principle of <b>deterrence</b> works. Specifically, Mearsheimer argues that the success of <b>deterrence</b> is determined by the strategy available to the potential attacker. He lays out three strategies. First, a war-of-attrition strategy, which entails a high level of uncertainty about the outcome of war and high costs for the attacker. Second, a limited-aims strategy, which entails fewer risks and lower costs. And, third, a blitzkrieg strategy, which provides a way to defeat the enemy rapidly and decisively, with relatively low costs. For Mearsheimer, failures in the modern battlefield are due mostly to the potential attacker's belief that it can successfully implement a blitzkrieg strategy in which tanks and other mechanized forces are employed swiftly to effect a deep penetration and disrupt the enemy's rear. The other two strategies are unlikely to lead to <b>deterrence</b> failures because they would entail a low probability of success accompanied by high costs (war of attrition) or limited gains and the possibility of the conflict turning into a war of attrition (limited aims). If the attacker has a coherent blitzkrieg strategy available, however, an attack is likely to ensue, as its potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks of starting a war.|$|E

25|$|Hanson {{is opposed}} to the Russian {{intervention}} in the Syrian civil war, which he argues {{is a part of}} a bid by Putin to construct an anti-American Russian-Syrian-Iranian-Iraqi alliance that will dominate the Middle East and intimidate the Gulf states. Hanson has made the claim that the primary responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War was not due to Adolf Hitler, but was rather due to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the French Premier Édouard Daladier who failed to maintain credible threats of <b>deterrence.</b> Hanson has argued Obama has likewise failed to maintain a credible threat of <b>deterrence,</b> and as such, the world {{is on the verge of}} another war comparable to the Second World War. Hanson has predicted that Putin will sometime in the near-future invade one or more of the Baltic states if the United States does not provide more <b>deterrence</b> to Russia.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Steller {{sea lions}} {{have been known}} to enter the Columbia River estuary and feed on white sturgeon, several salmon species and rainbow trout, some of which are also listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

Though not as abundant as the California sea lion, they are still a concern for those agencies charged with managing the fish populations. Since the Steller sea lions are themselves protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, managers are compelled to use nonlethal <b>deterrence</b> methods, such as rubber bullets and noisemakers. <b>Deterrence</b> by the public is strictly forbidden.|$|E
