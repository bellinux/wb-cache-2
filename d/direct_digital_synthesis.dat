Each FM-tone is generated by a digital oscillator using a form of <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>synthesis.</b> A quarter of the log-transformed sine waveform is stored as a sampled approximation in a 256-word read-only memory (ROM) table. The rest of the sine-waveform is extrapolated via its property of symmetry.

Another 256-word ROM stores the exponential function as a lookup table, used to convert the logarithmic scale signal back to linear scale when required, as the final stage where the oscillator-outputs are summed together (just prior to the DAC-output bus), with the modulator waveform always delayed by one sample before the carrier waveform.
