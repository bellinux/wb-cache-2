25|$|Meanwhile, {{the scene}} {{depicting}} a New York woman being <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> apparent death from a hotel window was filmed {{on the sound}} stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped. When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.|$|E
25|$|Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and the 1999 team {{started a}} {{revolution}} towards women's team sports in America. Arguably their most influential and memorable victory {{came in the}} 1999 World Cup when they defeated China 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extended time. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a women's sporting event {{and one of the}} largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the Rose Bowl to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4–4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees and whipped off her shirt, celebrating in her sports bra, which later made the cover of Sports Illustrated and the front pages of newspapers around the country and world. This win influenced girls to want to play soccer on a team.|$|E
500|$|A play is soon planned that {{is called}} [...] "The Marvelous Marriage" [...] that {{involves}} Olaf and Violet as the leads: a groom and a bride. Klaus's suspicions reveal that Olaf is planning {{to take advantage of}} the play to marry Violet in reality in a desperate attempt to get the fortune. Unless Violet follows her lines or finds a loophole, Sunny, who is being held hostage in a cage, will be <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mercy! mercy!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, hoarse with horror, and <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees, as {{much from}} {{inability}} to stand as with intent to petition. [...] "Monster, strike me, but spare the child!" ...|$|R

500|$|Mary Jane was {{voiced by}} Vanessa Marshall. Marshall has voice acted on several {{animated}} series and video games, {{as well as}} starring in commercials and other on-screen roles and performing stand-up comedy. Marshall was filming a Honda commercial when her agent, Cathey Lizzio, called her to confirm that she had landed the role as Mary Jane, simply saying, [...] "Hello, is this Mary Jane?" [...] Overjoyed, Marshall <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees and began hyperventilating, which worried the producers of the commercial. Marshall's mother had voiced Spider-Woman in the original 1980s Spider-Man animated series, though Marshall's interest in Spider-Man had dated back to reading the comic books in her youth. On her character, Marshall noted that she is [...] "incredibly complex:" ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

6000|$|... "And yet he {{risked his}} life to save me," [...] the girl murmured astonished; then <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees before Aziel, she touched the ground with her {{forehead}} in obeisance, giving him thanks, and praising him after the fashion of the East.|$|R
50|$|At {{the lake}} house, Kate <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees sobbing, fearing {{that she has}} arrived too late to stop Alex. After a long pause, the mailbox flag finally lowers; Alex has picked up her note. Not long afterwards, a {{familiar}} mint-green truck pulls up. She walks forward smiling as the driver, clad {{in jeans and a}} familiar tan jacket, approaches. She and Alex kiss and walk toward the lake house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing; nor am I likely to," [...] she answered, and <b>her</b> arms <b>dropped</b> limply <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sides, {{her eyes}} looked entreatingly {{up into his}} gloomy face.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly her outstretched hands <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side. Her voice became {{soft and}} low; {{her dark eyes}} were dimmed.|$|E

50|$|At {{the airport}} that evening, Lan opens the package and reads the note from Thuy {{in which she}} says that Lan is her family. The package also {{contains}} a pair of dolls (Thuy’s prized possessions). Deeply touched, Lan races out of the airport and {{through the streets of}} Saigon. On finding Thuy, she <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees and embraces her while Hai smiles down on them both, overjoyed at seeing their “family” complete.|$|R
50|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{does not}} occur, {{the disintegration of}} the corpus luteum causes a drop in BBTs that roughly coincides with the onset of the next menstruation. If pregnancy does occur, the corpus luteum continues to function (and maintain high BBTs) for the first trimester of the pregnancy. After the first trimester, the woman's body temperature <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> pre-ovulatory normal as the placenta takes over functions previously performed by the corpus luteum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Effie!" [...] cried {{her mother}} sternly; and she <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> place again, and laid hold of Colville's arm for protection. [...] "You are really very rude. I shall {{send you to}} bed." ...|$|E

6000|$|The garment {{had taken}} fifteen years off her age, and a gardenia, just where the silk crossed on her breast, seemed no whiter than her skin. He {{wondered}} whimsically {{whether it had}} <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> out of the dark! ...|$|E
50|$|She {{was born}} in Saint Petersburg as Olga Preobrazhenskaya (the final {{syllable}} of <b>her</b> surname was <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> shorten <b>her</b> name for professional purposes, and she used the French transliteration, Preobrajenska).|$|R

6000|$|Lenore had to {{overcome}} a rush of tenderness. It {{was all she could}} do <b>to</b> keep from <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees beside him and slipping her arms around his neck. In her agitation she could not decide whether that would be womanly or not; only, she must make no mistakes. A hot, sweet flush went over her when she thought that always as a last resort she could reveal her secret and use her power. What would he do when he discovered she loved him? ...|$|R
60|$|Her hand relinquished {{the rope}} {{of hair and}} <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side, and the pile of tresses, no longer supported, fell from the crown of her head about her {{shoulders}} and over the white night-gown. She made no reply.|$|E
6000|$|Kate, {{from her}} chair, always without a movement, raised {{her eyes to}} the {{unconscious}} reach of his own. Then when the latter again <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> she added a question. [...] "And won't it further depend a little on what the communication is?" ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{she turned}} her head and saw him, and he knew that she had heard of his disgrace, for her color deepened and her glance was rather hard than sympathetic. The hand that held the flowers <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side, but she waited until he came up.|$|E
6000|$|His {{amusement}} now <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> straighter. [...] "Your 'we' is awfully beautiful. It's charming to {{hear you}} speak for the whole lovely lot.

As he leaves, Jud tells Lavinia that he will be waiting for her {{at the end of the}} road. Lavinia cries out <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband, imploring him <b>to</b> stay. <b>Dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees on the now deserted road, she begs Jud to come back.|$|R
