To reduce exposure, {{authorities}} recommend avoiding mushrooms from polluted areas such as those near mines, smelters, roadways, incinerators and disposal sites.

5|$|Catalytic RNA {{molecules}} (ribozymes) {{were discovered}} in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman. In 1990, it was found in Petunia that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> result of RNA interference.|$|E

5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (in this case, the queen conch). Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> commensal and a small cardinalfish, known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his junior}} college career, two {{universities}} offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> troublemaker.|$|E

5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, was <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous {{with regard to the}} gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> misidentification.|$|E

5|$|Interplay {{announced}} in late 1999 {{that they were}} working on a title for the Dreamcast which was <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 3D simulation of gambling with traditional casino games. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino and features six card games, table games, five slot machine themes, and video game machines. Each game plays by official Caesars Palace rules and uses casino odds and payouts verified by a Ph.D in statistics. The PC version of the game received praise for its graphics and sound, but the Dreamcast version received criticism for its presentation, graphics, and slow pace.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the same}} year Henry Moseley {{provided}} additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, atomic number was not <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.|$|E
5|$|One of Berhtwald's letters {{has been}} preserved, sent to Forthhere, Bishop of Sherborne, and asking Forthhere to intercede with Beorwold, the Abbot of Glastonbury, to ransom a slave. Another letter, this one {{addressed}} to Berhtwald, from Waldhere, Bishop of London, also survives. The main {{interest in the}} second letter {{is that it is}} the oldest surviving letter close surviving in Western Europe. This second letter also relates that Waldhere and Berhtwald had attended a synod which can be dated to sometime between 703 and 705, where the kingdom of Wessex was threatened with excommunication. A charter witnessed by Berhtwald which mentions a supposed 706 council, numbered 54 by Sawyer, is now <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fake, although the witness list may be based on a legitimate 8th century charter that no longer survives. Likewise, a charter with Berhtwald as a witness and relating to the 716 Council of Clofesho is also <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 9th-century forgery, although again it may have been based on actual documents from the council.|$|E
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Pleione is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> speckle binary, {{although}} its orbital parameters {{have yet to}} be fully established. In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an angular separation between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue roundhead, is an inedible species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
