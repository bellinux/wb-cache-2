5|$|Vistulan gords, {{built from}} the mid-8th century on, were {{typically}} very large, often over 10 hectares in size. About 30 big ones are known. The 9th-century gords in Lesser Poland and in Silesia were likely {{built as a}} defense against Great Moravian military expansion. The largest one, in Stradów, Kazimierza Wielka County, had an area of 25 hectares and walls or embankments 18 meters high, but parts of this giant structure were probably built later. The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains, on hills or hillsides. The buildings inside the walls were sparsely located or altogether absent, so for the most part, {{the role of the}} gords seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> other than that of settlements or administrative centers.|$|E

25|$|Seth Howes, the church's main benefactor at {{the time}} of the building's {{original}} construction, was particularly taken with the small country churches he had seen while traveling in England, and sought to have his church in a small country town in upstate New York emulate them. The hammerbeam roof is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> he asked for; in keeping with the style the two architects relied on simplicity and sweeping lines to create beauty, avoiding later Gothic Revival ornamentation such as gargoyles, flying buttresses or columns. It is, even today, one of the few stone churches in Putnam County.|$|E

In addition, he pointed out that the 95% or higher probability of a shot from the grassy knoll referred only to random noise (which all earlier research acknowledges), while the impulse could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> else. He identifies it as speech, ignoring that the analysis that the impulse is from a shot is based on timing of echos.|$|E

25|$|Somerled was slain in 1164 at the Battle of Renfrew, amidst an {{invasion}} of mainland Scotland, commanding forces drawn from all over his kingdom. The reasons for his attack are unknown. He may have wished to nullify Scottish encroachment, but the scale of his venture suggests that he nursed greater ambitions. On his death, Somerled's vast kingdom disintegrated, although his sons retained much of the southern Hebridean portion. Compared to his immediate descendants, who associated themselves with reformed religious orders, Somerled may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a religious traditionalist. In {{the last year of}} his life, he attempted to persuade the head of the Columban monastic community, Flaithbertach Ua Brolcháin, Abbot of Derry, to relocate from Ireland to Iona, a sacred island within Somerled's sphere of influence. Unfortunately for Somerled, his demise denied him the ecclesiastical reunification he sought, and decades later his descendants oversaw the obliteration of the island's Columban monastery. Iona's oldest surviving building, St Oran's Chapel, dates to the mid-12th century, and may have been built by Somerled or his family.|$|E
25|$|From about 1160 to 1164, Somerled disappears {{from the}} {{historical}} record, and {{little is known}} of his activities. In 1164, the Annals of Ulster reveal that he attempted to persuade Flaithbertach Ua Brolcháin, Abbot of Derry (d. 1175) to relocate to Iona. As head of the Columban monastic community, a network of religious houses once centred on Iona, Flaithbertach's removal to the island would have placed the community's leadership within the heart of Somerled's sphere of influence. Although Somerled's stratagem was met with significant opposition, particularly from Muirchertach, Flaithbertach's secular overlord, the proposed move suggests that Somerled nursed ambitions beyond the Isles in northern Ireland. These ambitions came to nothing with his death later that year. Compared to his immediate descendants, who associated themselves with reformed monastic orders from the continent, Somerled appears <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> a religious traditionalist. His attempt to restore the Columban leadership to Iona starkly contrasted with the actions of his descendants, who oversaw the obliteration of the island's Columban monastery, and founded a Benedictine monastery in its place.|$|E

500|$|Shearer has {{released}} five solo comedy albums: It Must <b>Have</b> <b>Been</b> <b>Something</b> I Said (1994), Dropping Anchors (2006), Songs Pointed and Pointless (2007), Songs of the Bushmen (2008) and Greed and Fear (2010). His most recent CD, Greed and Fear is mainly about Wall Street economic issues, rather than politics like his previous albums. Shearer {{decided to make}} the album when he"started getting amused by the language of the economic meltdown – when 'toxic assets' suddenly became 'troubled assets,' going from something poisoning the system to just a bunch of delinquent youth with dirty faces that needed not removal from the system but just...understanding." [...] In May 2006, Shearer received an honorary doctorate from Goucher College.|$|E

Prince Edward, the future Prince of Wales, was then aged 15. It {{has been suggested that}} [...] "creag" [...] was an early form of cricket. However, creag could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> quite different. Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word craic here taken as an Irish word meaning fun, entertainment, or enjoyable conversation. This sense of the word crack is found in Irish English, Scottish English, and Geordie in North East England. In Ireland the spelling craic is now more common than crack.|$|E

500|$|Film scholar Peter Hames has {{summarized}} three {{themes of}} Loves of a Blonde {{that have been}} discussed repeatedly in critical writings on the film, themes that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a constant throughout Forman's career: [...] "the impermanence of young love, the confusion and despair of middle age, and the gulf between the generations". [...] Another theme that is often identified involves the awkwardness and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society. Most critics have also commented on the confluence of comedy and sadness in the film's depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state, [...] although while some consider Loves of a Blonde Forman's most pointed critique of Czech society under communism, others {{point out that the}} grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy, but that individuals create their own isolation as well.|$|E
500|$|In 1937 {{there were}} two events of huge {{importance}} in Britten's life: his mother died, and he met the tenor Peter Pears. Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted {{to his mother and}} was devastated at her death, it also seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a liberation for him. Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger. Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash. Pears quickly became Britten's musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, a setting of Emily Brontë's poem, [...] "A thousand gleaming fires", for tenor and strings.|$|E
500|$|Hatchlings {{are often}} cannibalistic. This is {{regarded}} as the main cause of death in young squids, particularly in dense populations. However, cannibalism usually happens only when eaten individuals were already weakened significantly or dead, so the actual cause of death may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> else. Subadults are usually recognisable by their size, ranging from [...] in length. They reach sexual maturity at less than 210 days in the wild. Males reach sexual maturity earlier than females. In captive populations, males mature 140 days after hatching at most. Females will begin spawning at around 156 to 196 days after hatching. Both males and females mature earlier in captivity than in the wild. Water temperature may {{play an important role in}} the earlier sexual maturation of captive specimens. High temperatures may induce shorter lifespans and smaller body sizes, while cooler temperatures favour longer lifespans and larger individuals.|$|E

In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival {{at the end of}} Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of the story.

James Oldham of NME described it as [...] "magnificent, sultry, pneumatic trip-soul ballad, which gently blooms into a magical garden of fluttering harps and shivering strings." [...] He also added that the track [...] "is no mere soundtrack" [...] for the video. AllMusic's Heather Phares gave the DVD single four out of five stars, considering it [...] "a necessary addition to the collections of dedicated Bjork fans". Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly also gave the single a positive review, commending its B-sides and writing it [...] "was hardly the most striking piece at the time—but the tune turns out to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a sleeper." ...|$|E

While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E
