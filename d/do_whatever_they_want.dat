25|$|The Godfather II {{is an open}} world action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person perspective, in which the player {{controls}} Dominic, Don of the Corleone family in New York City, and Michael Corleone's underboss. The basic gameplay and game mechanics fall into the subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones, as the player can travel throughout the game world freely, commandeer vehicles, <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish.|$|E
25|$|The Godfather {{is an open}} world action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person perspective, in which the player {{controls}} Aldo Trapani as he ascends {{through the ranks of}} the Corleone family, with his rise intersecting with the narrative of the film on numerous occasions. The basic gameplay and game mechanics are similar to most open world titles as the player can travel across the city freely, commandeer vehicles, <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the townspeople}} become {{frustrated}} by Ned's constant nagging. Bart discovers that the family's backyard contains a blind spot {{that none of}} the cameras can see, and he and Homer soon begin charging people to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> there. When Ned scolds Homer for allowing so many immoral activities to go on, Homer retorts that the situation is Ned's fault as he has abused his power and literally played God over the town. Ned apologizes to the town for his interference, and he and Homer proceed to destroy all the cameras. The final scene reveals that Bakerbutcher has been using the footage to put together a British reality television series called The American Oafs, which Queen Elizabeth II enjoys watching because Ralph Wiggum reminds her of her son, Prince Charles.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} his {{portrayal}} of Tommy, Liotta stated that [...] "it was hard work." [...] He said that [...] "you're pretty much putting yourself in game developers' hands and <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> so there's not much {{for you to do}} creatively." ...|$|R
500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. It sucks, but it's one of those things I have no control over... At this point, the record company can <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that he likes it more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C", largely criticizing the {{installment}} for its apparent randomness. He argued that [...] "being {{in a dream}} allows the writers to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> without any explanation, meaning characters and environments change suddenly and constantly, leaving the viewer as confused as Finn." [...] Sava felt that the only scenes with any pathos were to be found {{near the end of}} the episode, but even they were [...] "still more focused on bizarre imagery than emotional depth", such as the sequence wherein Finn's fears manifest themselves by emerging from his navel. Sava did compliment the episode's designs, however, writing that [...] "this episode puts the show’s off-kilter design sense on full display." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015 MIJA started Fk A Genre, a tour & {{promotion}} {{brand that}} programsdiverse genres of music {{into a single}} show.

50|$|In {{the fifth}} and final call, Rubén called Manolo again, saying {{it had all been}} prank calls from Caiste, and asking him for his {{permission}} to put them on the air. Manolo answered by telling them to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted,</b> and insulted them even more so they could have more material to work with.|$|R
500|$|The game {{is set in}} a near-future, post-apocalyptic world. The team {{wanted to}} try {{something}} different, unwilling to return to a setting that was similar to Resistance 3. Instead of depicting a world with a dark atmosphere and gritty environments, the catastrophe that occurs in the game's story line is referred to as an [...] "awesomepocalypse” that transforms the user's initial view [...] of the game's world as a [...] "playground" [...] for players to explore and <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> – [...] "emphasizing the fun of free [...] during end times." [...] The goal was to make players feel that the post-apocalyptic world in Sunset Overdrive is fun and limitless, delighting and lively, instead of a place that is dreadful and worrying. To achieve this, vibrant and vivid colors were used to create the game's world and the team hoped that by tweaking the nature of the setting, the game would be [...] "self-aware, humorous, and fun". The team also intentionally avoided creating a very serious tone because the final product needed to be entertaining and comparable to games like Crazy Taxi and Jet Grind Radio, instead of something too serious that looked like an interactive movie. The team emphasized [...] "fun trumps realism" [...] and reflected that through the [...] "Next-gen Respawn" [...] system, unrealistic weaponry, and the game's visual style.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E

5000|$|After it was closed, the Halifax Zoo Bar {{incident}} {{became an}} international lightning rod in Europe, as one paper cited it as a [...] "notorious kiddie boozer" [...] where [...] "legless" [...] youths could <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> The nightclub was identified in an American study regarding youths and alcohol, {{as it was}} the topic of an alcohol advertisement.|$|R
25|$|Liberal Protestant {{activists in}} Germany were {{in close contact}} with the IAF, and Ludwig Weber (1846–1922) was on the IAF {{executive}} commission until 1887.

5000|$|In {{the third}} segment, Chuck talks about Sam and Dean's {{life on the}} road outside of hunting jobs, <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> The scenes briefly show Chuck's examples: They earn money through odd jobs and hustling; They drive {{thousands}} of miles to attend events like concerts or sports; Sometimes they park the Impala, sit on the hood, and stargaze for hours in silence.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2011, Santorum said {{he would}} {{continue}} to [...] "fight very strongly against libertarian influence within the Republican Party and the conservative movement." [...] In an interview with NPR in the summer of 2005, Santorum discussed what he called the [...] "libertarianish right", saying [...] "they have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do. Government should keep our taxes down and keep our regulation low and that we shouldn't get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, you know, people should <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> Well, that is not how traditional conservatives view the world, and I think most conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cain advocates the use {{of capital}} {{punishment}} in the United States. When asked if the death penalty should be thrown away when evidence comes into question, he replied [...] "No. If you do away with it, that will only brainwash people into thinking that they can <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> {{and get away with}} it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Breyer {{on whether}} to deny {{jurisdiction}} to citizens outside the U.S. [...] "So what I'm thinking now, assuming that it's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, {{is that if we}} go with you, it has a virtue of clarity. There is a clear rule. Not a citizen outside the United States; you don't get your foot in the door. But against you is that same fact.

2500|$|Williams named many singers as heroines: [...] "I love Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux. I grew up {{listening}} to The Distillers [...] Girl groups are really important to me, but the Shangri-Las especially".

2500|$|Globalization is {{sometimes}} {{perceived as a}} cause of a phenomenon called the [...] "race to the bottom" [...] that implies that multinational companies are constantly attempting to maintain or increase their influence in countries that are already reliant on foreign investment alone. Multinationals tend to target export dependent countries. Due to a rise in competition, underdeveloped countries are undercutting their competitors through lowering their labor standards thus lowering the labor costs for the multinational companies investing into them. Companies will deliberately move into countries with the most relaxed laws and regulations for labor standards allowing them to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> This results in factories with harsh labor conditions, low wages, and job insecurity.|$|E
