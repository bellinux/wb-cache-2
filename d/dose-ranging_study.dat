5000|$|The {{main goal}} of a <b>dose-ranging</b> <b>study</b> is to {{estimate}} the response vs. dose given, so as to analyze the efficacy and safety of the drug. Although such a response will nevertheless be available from phase III or phase IV trials, {{it is important to}} carry out dose-ranging studies in the earlier phase I or phase II stages. There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a steady-state condition showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. The main reasons for this is to avoid trials in the later phases using doses that are significantly different from those that will subsequently be recommended for clinical use and also to avoid the need for modification of dosing schedules at later stages where a large amount of data has already been accumulated for a different dose range.The duration of action should be determined during <b>dose-ranging</b> <b>study,</b> as it will allow definition of the dosage schedule. Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, {{it is difficult to determine}} the duration of action during early clinical trials. Other parameters instead are suggested as a tentative dosage, such as half-lives in plasma and urine in various test species and human, receptor binding in vitro, or pharmacodynamic data in vivo in animals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Indacaterol is a once-daily long-acting inhaled β 2 -agonist {{indicated}} {{for maintenance}} treatment of moderate-to-severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The large inter-patient and inter-study variability in {{forced expiratory volume}} in 1 second (FEV 1) with bronchodilators makes determination of optimal doses difficult in conventional <b>dose-ranging</b> <b>studies.</b> We considered alternative methods of analysis. Methods We utilized a novel modelling approach to provide a robust analysis of the bronchodilatory dose response to indacaterol. This involved pooled analysis of study-level data to characterize the bronchodilatory dose response, and nonlinear mixed-effects analysis of patient-level data to characterize the impact of baseline covariates. Results The study-level analysis pooled summary statistics for each steady-state visit in 11 placebo-controlled studies. These study-level summaries encompassed data from 7476 patients at indacaterol doses of 18. 75 - 600 μg once daily, and showed that doses of 75 μg and above achieved clinically important improvements in predicted trough FEV 1 response. Indacaterol 75 μg achieved 74 % of the maximum effect on trough FEV 1, and exceeded the midpoint of the 100 - 140 mL range that represents the minimal clinically important difference (MCID; ≥ 120 mL vs placebo), with a 90 % probability that the mean improvement vs placebo exceeded the MCID. Indacaterol 150 μg achieved 85 % of the model-predicted maximum effect on trough FEV 1 and was numerically superior to all comparators (99. 9 % probability of exceeding MCID). Indacaterol 300 μg was the lowest dose that achieved the model-predicted maximum trough response. The patient-level analysis included data from 1835 patients from two <b>dose-ranging</b> <b>studies</b> of indacaterol 18. 75 - 600 μg once daily. This analysis provided a characterization of dose response consistent with the study-level analysis, and demonstrated that disease severity, as captured by baseline FEV 1, significantly affects the dose response, indicating that patients with more severe COPD require higher doses to achieve optimal bronchodilation. Conclusions Comprehensive assessment of the bronchodilatory dose response of indacaterol in COPD patients provided a robust confirmation that 75 μg is the minimum effective dose, and that 150 and 300 μg are expected to provide optimal bronchodilation, particularly in patients with severe disease. </p...|$|R

Anti-cancer effects of a selective sigma- 1 agonist, 4 -(N-benzylpiperidin- 4 -yl) - 4 -iodobenzamide (4 -IBP), in glioblastoma were shown previously, leading to the present work where the effects on glioblastoma cells of 17 agonists or antagonists of sigma- 1 receptors were studied, including currently marketed drugs fluvoxamine, dextromethorphan, donepezil, memantine and haloperidol.

Although symptom/lung function response to low and high dose ICS medication is comparable, it is uncertain whether low dose ICSs are as effective as high dose {{in the treatment of}} inflammation and remodeling. Methods 22 mild or moderate asthmatic adult subjects (corticosteroid free for > 2 months) participated in a randomized, parallel group study to compare effects of fluticasone propionate (FP) 200 mcg/day and 1000 mcg/day. Alveolar macrophage (AM) -derived cytokines and basement membrane thickness (BMT) were measured at baseline and after 7 weeks treatment while symptoms, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to mannitol at baseline and 6 weeks. Results FP improved spirometry, eNO, symptoms and AHR with no difference between low and high dose FP. Both high and low dose FP reduced GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and IL- 1 ra, with no change in BMT and with no differences between low and high dose FP.
