60|$|During our <b>half-halt</b> at Al-Suwayrkiyah we {{determined}} to have a small feast; we bought some fresh dates, and we paid a dollar and a half for a sheep. Hungry travellers consider “liver and fry” a dish to set before a Shaykh. On this occasion, however, our enjoyment was marred by the water; even Soyer’s dinners would scarcely charm if washed down with cups of a certain mineral-spring found at Epsom.|$|E
50|$|According to Dr. Thomas Ritter, {{the best}} time to apply the <b>half-halt</b> is the moment when the hind leg it is meant to control touches the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The {{degree of}} {{pressure}} applied by the aids will vary greatly between horses, {{depending on the}} animal's training, temperament, balance, and {{the situation in which}} the <b>half-halt</b> is given. The degree of the aid is usually performed by instinct and feel, a result of experience from the rider, and often one <b>half-halt</b> will be slightly different from the one preceding it, depending on the horse's balance and the requirements of the upcoming exercise. However, the aids should not be so great that they signal the horse to make a transition.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{flushed with}} pleasure. He turned to her, and <b>half-halted,</b> but she {{continued}} to walk on.|$|R
50|$|<b>Half-halts</b> are universally useful, {{regardless}} of riding discipline, {{although they are}} used in great abundance in the dressage arena, where perfect control of the horse is required.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use <b>half-halts</b> as {{the horse is}} raising its head and neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), because this is when the horse is engaging its hindquarters.|$|R
50|$|Like the leg aids, the {{severity}} of the hands can communicate different things. So a slight resistance backed up with the leg can act as a <b>half-halt,</b> whereas a larger resistance will communicate to the horse to halt.|$|E
5000|$|Baucher {{then began}} using the <b>half-halt</b> and {{vibrations}} to decrease muscular tension. To do so, he rejected his long-time use of simultaneous application of hand and leg, {{and came up}} with the idea of 'hand without legs, legs without hand.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the <b>half-halt</b> is to {{rebalance}} the horse, asking it to carry its weight slightly more on his hindquarters and less on its forehand. Additionally, it {{may be used as}} a warning signal to the horse, calling its attention back to the rider to tell it that it is about to be asked to do something, such as perform a transition between or within a gait, make a turn, perform a difficult movement, or jump an obstacle. It {{can also be used to}} encourage the horse to take a lighter contact with the bit. The <b>half-halt</b> should not make the horse break into a different gait. However, repeated half-halts are used to help collect a gait.|$|E
25|$|To {{shorten the}} horse's stride, the rider sits taller and lengthens the spine. He or she also {{performs}} multiple <b>half-halts</b> in rhythm with the horse's strides, using the restraining aids {{to ask the}} horse to engage the hindquarters, yet keeping the leg to the horse's sides to keep impulsion. The rider should not hold the aids or hang onto the horse's mouth when shortening. If the rider does not keep sufficient leg on, the horse will simply fall onto the forehand or break into the trot or walk.|$|R
25|$|Preparation and Timing: The rider {{prepares for}} the {{transition}} by using <b>half-halts</b> to balance the horse, and bends him slightly in the intended direction. Since the first footfall of the canter is the outside hind leg, the rider times the aids {{to ask for the}} canter when the outside hind leg is engaged (i.e. under the body). So, at the trot the rider would ask when the inside front leg touches the ground (its shoulder will be forward). At the walk, the rider will ask when the outside shoulder starts to move back.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>half-halt</b> is a {{specific}} riding aid given by an equestrian to his horse, in which the driving aids and restraining aids are applied in quick succession. It is sometimes thought of as an [...] "almost halt," [...] asking the horse to prepare to halt in balance, before pushing it onward to continue in its gait.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>half-halt</b> may be {{performed}} two ways, {{both of which}} are commonly used by various skilled horsepeople. The first is a split-second application of the driving aids, to create energy, which is then quickly and immediately harnessed with the restraining aids, and then released. The second is the opposite approach: an application of the restraining aids, asking the horse to [...] "almost halt" [...] and bring its hindquarters under itself in the process, then immediately applying the driving aids to maintain the gait. In both cases, the driving and restraining aids should never be applied for a prolonged period, as that will only cause the horse to lean against the bit, tighten its back, and finally ignore the aids. The yielding of the aids {{is just as important as}} the application of the aids.|$|E
