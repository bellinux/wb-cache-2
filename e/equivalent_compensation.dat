Fuel subsidy has been a growing liability to Nigeria’s budgets, in a systematic fashion for almost four decades, hence creating vested interest. The exponential growth of cost of fuel subsidy is due to the rising cost of crude oil in the international market, exchange rate volatility and the population growth of Nigeria which resulted in increased petroleum consumption; the combination of these three variables therefore made the cost of the fuel subsidy unsustainable. Understanding the current fuel subsidies magnitude is critical for advancing reform because it underscores the potential socio-economic benefits to be realized. In addition to the burden that fuel subsidy is placing on the national budget, keeping petroleum below the market value has discouraged additional investment in Nigeria’s oil sector, because the visibility of recovering the investment under the artificially low price structure is uncertain...|$|E

ANTICIPATED UNEMPLO 4 ENT, TEMPORARY LAYOFFS The appropriate theoretical framework for the interpretation of measurements of unemployment is once again a matter of controversy. The issues involved are important both because of the overwhelming role that measured unemployment plays in the discussion of public policies designed to mitigate it and because of the research strategies implied for under- standing the causes and consequences of movements in it. One natural research strategy is to interpret unemployment as the equilibrium outcome of a worker's choices about Job search or the intertemporal allocation of nonmarket time. 1 0 f'course, labor supply theoretic explanations of move- ments in unemployment are not complete without further specification, but this approach does imply a general strategy for the necessary research...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrimination}} based on certain personal characteristics such as gender, national origin or ethnicity, beliefs and religious practices negates the other’s dignity and {{is an important factor}} in maintaining the stability of the existing dominating positions of supremacy within the society. Its multifarious manifestations render necessary that any public intervention does not limit itself simply in confronting the conduct intended to harm the other’s dignity. A subject can act as a vehicle of widespread preconceptions even in the pursuit of legitimate ends, such as when an activity which expresses a position of “private power” is exercised in a manner calculated to increase profits but is in contrast with the evolving needs of a tolerating and cohesive society. In fighting discrimination, the Italian legal system is inspired both by a logic of commutative justice based on the principle of damage and its <b>equivalent</b> <b>compensation</b> and by a redistributive logic of more equal opportunity. The laws against discrimination contain a meaning of discrimination which, on one hand, is based on a subjective element that does not take into account the entity of the concretely caused disparity and which, on the other hand, is based on an objective meaning centred on the particular harmful effect of the conduct that does not take into account any evaluation of the subjective element. Since the fight against discrimination in private law implies the use of techniques in balancing interests, employed by the judge in reference to concrete cases, the Italian legal system, in enacting legislation in accordance to European Union directives against discrimination, has appropriately chosen to regulate the area through the technique of general clauses and of open formulas, better adapted to confront the needs created by the emersion of value systems which are present in a multiethnic, multicultural and multireligious society. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{any given}} year {{depression}} affects as many as 121 million people worldwide and 20 percent or 19 {{million people in the}} U. S. suffer from at least one episode of depression during their lifetime. In the U. S., depression has a substantial impact on the economy. It is estimated that 17 billion dollars in salary and/or <b>equivalent</b> <b>compensation</b> is lost due to missing work days, caused by major depression. Depression is considered a highly prevalent condition that can lead to significant functional impairments, such as absenteeism and work productivity and problems with activities of daily living. This study focuses on depression in African-American men, and addresses three research questions. What are the differences in the magnitude and severity of depression among African-American (AA) and non-Latino white (nLw) males and females? What variables in the Socio Determinants of Health model predict depression in African-American males? Given the research results, what types of intervention could prevent or lessen the impact of depression in African-American males? Methods: A multivariate analytical model was developed to answer research questions posed by this study. The general purpose of multiple regressions was to identify relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable, depression in African-American males. The study used a nationally representative sample from the National Survey of American Life dataset and used a revised Social Determinants of Health model as a conceptual framework to guide the analysis. Results: Several steps were taken to select which predictor variables were significant in building a multiple regression model to predict depression in African-American males. In the end, 23 predictor variables were identified and these variables explained approximately 18. 1 {{percent of the variance in}} the depression score. The top five predictors are distress, being African American, everyday discrimination, and hopelessness and mastery. This informs the reader that these variables are the top five predictors of depression.
