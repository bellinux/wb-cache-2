5|$|Due to {{the unusual}} {{morphology}} of the mandibles, scientists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Brownimecia {{may have had}} a high level of feeding specialization.|$|E
5|$|Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Daspletosaurus social {{interaction}} {{would have more}} closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing {{each other in the}} process. Evidence of cannibalism in Daspletosaurus was published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{fragment}} {{appears to have}} been intentionally cut, most likely in modern times. They further suggest that this leads to the possibility that in context Jesus may not have even been speaking of a literal wife.|$|E

Hostage III <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{fifth-generation}} jet fighters {{will operate}} {{together in a}} [...] "combat cloud" [...] along with future unmanned combat aircraft, and Manazir <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this might come as quickly as loading a UCLASS with AMRAAMs to be launched at the command of an F-35.|$|R

5|$|Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and {{received}} the pallium from Pope John XII. On his journey there, Dunstan's acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing {{for himself and his}} attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they trust in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Some analysts <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> foreign powers, {{including}} Russia, {{may have}} been behind the shooting. They pointed {{out the fact that}} Armenia and Azerbaijan were close in signing some kind of an agreement at the OSCE 1999 Istanbul summit over Karabakh, something not in Russia's interest.|$|E
5|$|Some older studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a {{subsequent}} meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity {{may help prevent}} vasospasm their use {{does not appear to}} change outcomes.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} {{believed}} that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has begun to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this condition {{may be the}} result of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he chose this early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E
5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E

5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E
5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that {{the dress was}} white and gold. Some people <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the photo was {{overexposed}} and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E

5|$|Clark is {{best known}} as a war hero of the Revolutionary War in the West, {{especially}} {{as the leader of the}} secret expeditionary forces that captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79.

5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to crush the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, some <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at the Star and once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department.
