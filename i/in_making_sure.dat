25|$|Dirk took a great {{interest}} in the personal welfare of his students and their families, and was meticulous <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> they received adequate support; indeed, he encouraged Leggett to apply for a Prize Fellowship at Magdalen, which he held from 1963 to 1967. In the end Leggett's thesis consisted of studies of two somewhat disconnected problems in the general area of liquid helium, one on higher-order phonon interaction processes in superfluid 4He and the other on the properties of dilute solutions of 4He in normal liquid 3He (a system which unfortunately turned out to be much less experimentally accessible than {{the other side of the}} phase diagram, dilute solutions of 3He in 4He). The University of Oxford awarded Leggett an Honorary DLitt in June 2005.|$|E

Richard Hill, the curator of the penguins, explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> the penguins were comfortable. [...] "On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees", recalls Hill. [...] "In Hollywood, {{they were given a}} refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks. Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees."

500|$|Halo Legends had {{origins in}} the 2006 Marvel Comics tie-in, The Halo Graphic Novel; O'Connor said {{that the idea of}} an anime {{compilation}} existed for years before there was momentum for the project. Wanting to tell smaller stories in a different format than video games and novels and in different art styles, O'Connor said that anime was a natural fit. An additional consideration was that 343 Industries felt that the Japanese style of narrative fit the stories well. Most of the animation studios Microsoft approached were available for the project. Most studios were [...] "afraid" [...] of creating their own stories, even if they were familiar with the series, so O'Connor sent them possible story treatments. Microsoft was deeply involved <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> story details were correct and writing the scripts for the stories—O'Connor estimated that 50% of the dialogue in the final products were verbatim from the original scripts. While all the stories save one are considered canon, O'Connor noted that some discrepancies were the cause of artistic interpretation.|$|E

500|$|Mercedes McNab, {{well known}} for portraying the vampire Harmony Kendall on the {{television}} series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, guest starred as the recently turned vampire Lucy. Although hesitant to play another vampire, McNab {{came to realize that}} the character was less of a vampire and more of a [...] "girl who woke up and was basically drugged or was changed and didn't know what was going on". The actress also noted that Harmony was generally used for comic relief, whereas Lucy was intended to be [...] "serious and more dramatic". Her previous experience with director Kim Manners on the television series The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. also influenced her decision. Because many of her recent characters tended to die, McNab was delighted by Lucy's offscreen death. The actress was also working on an episode of Reaper during the filming of [...] "Fresh Blood", and the Supernatural production staff was able to fit her into the shooting schedule. The actress found them to be [...] "really helpful" [...] <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that her scenes did not take too long to film. Her portion of the opening scene only took a few hours to shoot, allowing her to return to Reaper the next morning.|$|E
500|$|Other teams, however, {{had more}} serious {{interest}} in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club {{president and general}} manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals. Rickey was especially interested <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him. In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: [...] "Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?" [...] Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player [...] "with guts enough not to fight back." [...] After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to [...] "turn the other cheek" [...] to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today. Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts' not containing a reserve clause. Among those Rickey discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly Pittsburgh Courier, who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck [...] "influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he's never completely gotten credit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Court in its {{decision}} {{wrote that the}} standards it outlined will allow involuntary medication [...] {{for the sole purpose}} of rendering the defendant competent to stand trial only in rare instances.

Sherwin concluded that the public will [...] "question the artist who says to question everything," [...] regardless of O’Shea’s Mark Vallen [...] "damage control" [...] on SUPERTOUCH.

[...] Heavy fog was particularly hazardous, and could come any time of year. [...] Once a steamboat was in a fog bank, a captain would have to reckon very carefully from his experience on the run just where his boat was. [...] With no radar, captains proved remarkably adept at determining their position with echoes from the steamboat's whistle. [...] Sound travels at about 1,080 feet per second in a fog bank, and rounding off to 1,000 feet for safety, that meant that if an echo was heard one second after the whistle blast, the steamboat was 500 feet from shore. [...] The maritime historian Jim Faber well-summarized the degree of detail that an experienced crew could deduce by echo location: ...|$|E
2500|$|After Mehmed Said Pasha's resignation, a new, non-partisan cabinet {{was formed}} by Ahmed Muhtar Pasha, an old {{military}} hero, which {{was known as the}} [...] "Great Cabinet" [...] (...) because it included three former Grand Viziers as ministers and sometimes as the [...] "Father-Son Cabinet" [...] (...) because it included Ahmed Muhtar Pasha's son, Mahmud Muhtar Pasha, as Minister of the Navy. Although the Savior Officers had succeeded <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that the Great Cabinet was free of CUP members, the CUP's domination of the Chamber of Deputies had not changed. Soon, however, rumors began to circulate that the government would dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and call new elections. The rumors were confirmed when, a few days after Ahmed Muhtar Pasha took office, the Savior Officers sent another memorandum, this time to the President of the Chamber of Deputies (and CUP member), Halil Bey, demanding that the Chamber be dissolved for new elections within 48 hours. The CUP members in the Chamber condemned and censured this threat. However, thanks to a law he had passed through the Senate, Ahmed Muhtar Pasha was able, with the sultan's support, to dissolve the Chamber with ease on 5 August, after which sultan Mehmed V immediately called for new elections by royal decree.|$|E
2500|$|The Burmese {{calendar}} {{first came}} to be adopted in present-day northern Thailand in the mid-13th century, and in central Thailand by {{the second half of}} the 16th century. Although then mainland kingdoms of Lan Na, Lan Xang, Siam, and later Cambodia adopted the Burmese epoch starting at 638 CE, each region retained its own traditions and/or introduced its own modifications afterwards. For example, the Kengtung, Lan Na, Lan Xang, and Sukhothai calendars still retained the use of numbering the months even though the Burmese calendar stopped using the numbered months alongside the month names. The use of numbering system may have predated the introduction of the Burmese calendar in any case since each region had its own numbering system. The first numbered month in Kengtung, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Sukhothai calendars is Tazaungmon (Karttika), Thadingyut (Asvina), (Nadaw) Margasirsha, and (Nadaw) Margasirsha, respectively. This means reading ancient texts and inscriptions in Thailand requires constant vigilance, not just <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> one is correctly operating for the correct region, but also for variations within regions itself when incursions cause a variation in practice.

2500|$|Lewis's novels {{have been}} criticised for their satirical and hostile portrayals of Jews, homosexuals, and other minorities. The 1918 novel Tarr was revised and republished in 1928. In an {{expanded}} incident a new Jewish character {{is given a}} key role <b>in</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> a duel is fought. This has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of a supposed Zionist conspiracy against the West. [...] The Apes of God (1930) has been interpreted similarly, {{because many of the}} characters satirised are Jewish, including the modernist author and editor Julius Ratner, a portrait which blends anti-semitic stereotype with historical literary figures (John Rodker and James Joyce; though the Joyce element consists solely {{in the use of the}} word [...] "epiphany" [...] in the parody of Rodker included in the novel). A key feature of these interpretations is that Lewis is held to have kept his conspiracy theories hidden and marginalised. Since the publication of Anthony Julius's T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form (1995, revised 2003), where Lewis's anti-semitism is described as [...] "essentially trivial", this view is no longer taken seriously. Somewhat belatedly, he recognised the reality of Nazi treatment of Jews after a visit to Berlin in 1937. He then wrote an attack on anti-semitism: The Jews, Are They Human? (published early in 1939; the title is modelled on a contemporary best-seller, The English, Are They Human?). The book was favourably reviewed in The Jewish Chronicle.|$|E
