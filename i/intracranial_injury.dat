500|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI), {{also known as}} <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury,</b> occurs when an {{external}} force injures the brain. [...] TBI can be classified based on severity, mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury), or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury is a broader category that may involve damage to other structures such as the scalp and skull. TBI can result in physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral symptoms, and outcome can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{features}} of earthquake-related head injuries {{may be different}} from those of injuries obtained in daily life because of differences in circumstances. We aim to compare the {{features of}} head traumas caused by the Sichuan earthquake with those of other common head traumas using multidetector computed tomography. METHODS: In total, 221 patients with earthquake-related head traumas (the earthquake group) and 221 patients with other common head traumas (the non-earthquake group) were enrolled in our study, and their computed tomographic findings were compared. We focused the differences between fractures and <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> and the relationships between extracranial and <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries.</b> RESULTS: More earthquake-related cases had only extracranial soft tissue injuries (50. 7 % vs. 26. 2 %, RR= 1. 9), and fewer cases had <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> (17. 2 % vs. 50. 7 %, RR = 0. 3) compared with the non-earthquake group. For patients with fractures and <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries,</b> there were fewer cases with craniocerebral injuries in the earthquake group (60. 6 % vs. 77. 9 %, RR = 0. 8), and the earthquake-injured patients had fewer fractures and <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> overall (1. 5 + 0. 9 vs. 2. 5 + 1. 8; 1. 3 + 0. 5 vs. 2. 1 + 1. 1).

40|$|Introduction: Work-related {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) caused by falls is a catastrophic event that leads to disabilities and high socio-medical costs. This study aimed to measure {{the magnitude of the}} preventive effect of safety helmets on clinical outcomes and to compare the effect across different heights of fall. Methods: We collected a nationwide, prospective database of work-related injury patients who visited the 10 emergency departments between July 2010 and October 2012. All of the adult patients who experienced work-related fall injuries were eligible, excluding cases with unknown safety helmet use and height of fall. Primary and secondary endpoints were <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> and in-hospital mortality. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of safety helmet use and height of fall for study outcomes, and adjusted for any potential confounders. Results: A total of 1298 patients who suffered from work-related fall injuries were enrolled. The industrial or construction area was the most common place of fall injury occurrence, and 45. 0 % were wearing safety helmets at the time of fall injuries. The safety helmet group was less likely to have <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> comparing with the no safety helmet group (the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95 % confidence interval (CI)) : 0. 42 (0. 24 – 0. 73)), however, there was no statistical difference of in-hospital mortality between two groups (the adjusted ORs (95 % CI) : 0. 83 (0. 34 – 2. 03). In the interaction analysis, preventive effects of safety helmet on <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> were significant within 4 m height of fall. Conclusions: A safety helmet is associated with prevention of <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> resulting from work-related fall and the effect is preserved within 4 m height of fall. Therefore, wearing a safety helmet can be an intervention for protecting fall-related <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Recent {{evidence}} suggests that presenting GCS may be higher in older rather than younger patients for an equivalent anatomical severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The {{aim of this study}} was to confirm these observations using a national trauma database and to test explanatory hypotheses. METHODS: The Trauma Audit Research Network database was interrogated to identify all adult cases of severe isolated TBI from 1988 to 2013. Cases were categorised by age into those under 65  years and those 65  years and older. Median presenting GCS was compared between the groups at abbreviated injury score (AIS) level (3, 4 and 5). Comparisons were repeated for subgroups defined by mechanism of injury and type of isolated <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury.</b> RESULTS: 25   082 patients with isolated TBI met the inclusion criteria, 10   936 in the older group and 14   146 in the younger group. Median or distribution of presenting GCS differed between groups at each AIS level. AIS 3 : 14 (11 - 15) vs 15 (13 - 15), AIS 4 : 14 (9 - 15) vs 14 (13 - 15), AIS 5 : 9 (4 - 14) vs 14 (5 - 15) all p< 0. 001. Similar differences between the groups were observed across all mechanisms of injury and types of isolated <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury.</b> We detected no influence of gender on results.

40|$|Background: Mild {{head injury}} (MHI) implies a risk for {{traumatic}} brain injury and even a small risk for development of an intracranial hematoma. Head computed tomography (CT) is recommended for early detection of such pathologic findings. The present multicenter study was performed to investigate whether determination of protein S 100 B in serum could contribute to the selection of patients for CT scanning. Methods: We included 226 patients {{with a history of}} head injury and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 at admission to hospital. Blood samples for S 100 B analysis and head CT were obtained within 12 hours after the injury. The diagnostic properties of S 100 B measurements for prediction of <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> revealed by CT were tested with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and cross-table analysis at different cut-off levels. We also included analysis of S 100 B levels normalized to correspond to blood sampling I hour after the injury. Results: CT showed <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> in 21 (9. 3 %) patients. S 100 B levels were significantly (p < 0. 001) elevated in patients with <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> (mean, 0. 36; 95 % CI, 0. 21 - 0. 50 mu g/L) compared with those in patients without <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> (mean, 0. 18; 95 % CI, 0. 16 - 0. 20 mu g/L). ROC curve analysis showed a significant (p = 0. 001) area under the curve (0. 73; 95 % CI, 0. 62 - 0. 84). Cross-table analysis showed that 20 of 21 (sensitivity 0. 95) patients with <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> were detected at a cut-off level of 0. 10 mu g/L, but 141 of 205 (specificity 0. 31) patients with no such injury also had a S 100 B level above this limit. Exclusion of cases with blood samples collected more than 3 hours after injury or normalization did not improve the diagnostic properties. Conclusion: Determination of serum S 100 B cannot replace the clinical examination or use of CT for patients with minor head injury, but adding S 100 B measurement to the clinical evaluation might support selection of patients for CT scanning...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Victims of {{homicide}} and attempted homicide {{are not uncommon}} in Sweden. We therefore aimed to study these victims to understand their injuries, their cause of death, {{and their relationship to}} the offender. All cases during five years in a district court in Sweden, where an offender had been convicted for homicide or attempted homicide, were identified and the court documents reviewed. Nineteen victims were identified; 14 males and five females, with an average age of 39. 1 years. Although knife/sharp weapon was the most common weapon used, the use of firearm caused more deaths. Our study shows higher rates of firearm use than many other countries. The most common anatomical site to be injured by knife/sharp weapon and firearm was the thorax followed by the head. The most common cause of death was hypovolemia, followed by <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries.</b> The high rate of firearm use shows that firearms are common modus operandi in Sweden often causing lethal injuries, if the offender intends to kill the victim.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{nationally representative}} outcomes of physical abuse injuries in children necessitating Emergency Department (ED) visits in United States. The impact of various injuries on mortality is examined. We hypothesize that physical abuse resulting in <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are associated with}} worse outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), the largest all payer hospital based ED database, for the years 2008 - 2010. All ED visits and subsequent hospitalizations with a diagnosis of "Child physical abuse" (Battered baby or child syndrome) due to various injuries were identified using ICD- 9 -CM (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification) codes. In addition, we also examined the prevalence of sexual abuse in this cohort. A multivariable logistic regression model {{was used to examine}} the association between mortality and types of injuries after adjusting for a multitude of patient and hospital level factors. RESULTS: Of the 16897 ED visits that were attributed to child physical abuse, 5182 (30. 7 %) required hospitalization. Hospitalized children were younger than those released treated and released from the ED (1. 9 years vs. 6. 4 years). Male or female partner of the child's parent/guardian accounted for > 45 % of perpetrators. Common injuries in hospitalized children include- any fractures (63. 5 %), <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> (32. 3 %) and crushing/internal injuries (9. 1 %). Death occurred in 246 patients (13 in ED and 233 following hospitalization). Amongst the 16897 ED visits, 1. 3 % also had sexual abuse. Multivariable analyses revealed each 1 year increase in age was associated with a lower odds of mortality (OR = 0. 88, 95 % CI = 0. 81 - 0. 96, p < 0. 0001). Females (OR = 2. 39, 1. 07 - 5. 34, p = 0. 03), those with <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> (OR = 65. 24, 27. 57 - 154. 41, p< 0. 0001), or crushing/internal injury (OR = 4. 98, 2. 24 - 11. 07, p< 0. 0001) had higher odds of mortality compared to their male counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of physically abused children, younger age, females and <b>intracranial</b> or crushing/internal <b>injuries</b> were independent predictors of mortality.

Hence, it is found imperative to search for a reliable alternative. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} find a reliable clinical alternative to detect an <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> without resorting to the CT. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study was undertaken in patients (1 - 14 years) with blunt head injury and having a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13 - 15 who had CT performed on them. Using statistical analysis, the correlation between clinical examination and positive CT manifestation is analyzed for different age-groups and various mechanisms of injury. Results: No statistically significant association between parameteres such as Loss of Consciousness, ′fall′ as mechanism of injury, motor vehicle accidents (MVA), more than two discrete episodes of vomiting and the CT finding of <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> could be noted. Analyzed data have led to believe that GCS of 13 at presentation is the only important clinical predictor of <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury.</b> Conclusion: Retrospective data, small sample size and limited number of factors for assessing clinical manifestation might present constraints on the predictive rule that was derived from this review.

To identify the risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> in children, the association of treatment outcome with various factors including mechanisms of injury, clinical characteristics, and intracranial pathology can be assessed. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted on children, who were younger than 15 years old with TBI and were enrolled from 2004 to 2015. Several clinically relevant issues were reviewed and statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 948 casualties were enrolled. Compared with falling down, the motorcycle accident was significantly associated with <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> (odds ratio 1. 73, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 08 – 2. 76). Other factors associated with <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> were hemiparesis (odds ratio 5. 69, 95 % CI 1. 44 – 22. 36), positive of basal skull fracture signs (odds ratio 15. 66, 95 % CI 3. 44 - 71. 28), and fixed reaction to light of both pupils (odds ratio 5. 74, 95 % CI 1. 71 – 19. 23).

Fracture characteristics found considerably more often in abused children were: multiple or complex configuration; depressed, wide, and growing fracture; involvement {{of more than a}} single cranial bone; non-parietal fracture; and associated <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury</b> including subdural haematoma. No fractures measuring more than 5. 0 mm on presentation were found after accidents, but 6 of these 'growing fractures' were found in abused children. Accidents usually resulted in single, narrow, linear fractures most commonly of the parietal, with no associated <b>intracranial</b> <b>injury.</b> The results suggest that in skull fracture in young children where a minor fall is alleged, it is possible to recognise abuse by consideration of the fracture alone...|$|E
40|$|Reports of {{suspected}} child abuse {{has increased in}} Sweden in recent years. Young children are particularly vulnerable to shaking and violence against the head. Internal injuries after head trauma caused by child abuse can be axonal <b>injury,</b> <b>intracranial</b> hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure and ischemia. The radiological modalities computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) have crucial diagnostic significance at head trauma and suspected child abuse. The overall {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the acute injuries that can occur within the brain in suspected child abuse. And to determine the diagnostic significance of the two modalities CT and MRI have in the context and how the methods differ. A systematic literature rewiev of scientific articles have been taken from three databases, ProQuest, Cinahl and PubMed. All articles that met the purpose and research questions were collected. The material quality was examined and processed in order to then be compiled. Literature Study results showed that DT of children’s brain must be done first, in order to identify any acute brain injuries. MRI is complementary after the acute phase. MRI can detect brain lesions injuries which were not detected by CT. CT with a MRI complement is the best way to establish injuries in children who has been abused with suspect <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries.</b> Validerat; 20140425 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|A missed or delayed {{detection}} of <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries</b> {{can lead to}} progressive neuronal damage and secondary brain damage. We present a case of 45 year female presented 8 after the road traffic accident and had a large posterior extradural hematoma on left side with mass effect. In addition {{there was a small}} speck of right frontal contusion with localized cerebral edema. The patient initially improved after evacuation of the hematoma. However on 3 rd post-operative day she was complaining of headache and became progressively drowsy. A follow up CT scan showed increase in peri-lesional edema around the right frontal contusion with squashing of the lateral ventricles suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema. The patient was shifted back to intensive care unit and responded well to further conservative management. In our patient the events could be collaborated well with existing evidence (presence of contrecoup contusion and on clinical deterioration at day 3) ...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the routine}} {{data do not}} {{document}} {{the reason for the}} fall, we assume most of the documented falls are fall-related and not caused by any other external causes like car accidents. A prospective study with all residents (n[*]=[*] 679) aged 75 or 80  years from a city in Finland was conducted to investigate types of injury and body regions affected in injurious falls over a 10 -year period. All falls that required medical care were registered. From 718 accident-related injuries 88 % were considered fall-related. The most common injuries were fractures of the upper limb and the hip. The frequencies of fractures and superficial injuries are comparable with our distribution. In contrast to the study from Finland, we have only a few injuries requiring first aid (superficial injuries of the head and <b>intracranial</b> <b>injuries)</b> or treatment in a hospital (fracture of the hip).|$|R
