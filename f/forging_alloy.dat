2500|$|Propellers {{were the}} first to be {{manufactured}} by the Hamilton Manufacturing Company in Milwaukee. [...] Hamilton and his company (as well as others) were aware of specific limitations using wood as a material for aircraft propellers. [...] As the propeller revolutions increased, the wood and laminate would lose their bond at a certain speed and cause the propeller to disintegrate. [...] Pontoons were the second product to be manufactured by the company. [...] Again, wood was also used in the manufacturing of pontoons and again there were specific limitations to this material being used in pontoons as with propellers. [...] The problem with wood and water is that it disintegrates faster even though it floats. [...] Even with all preservatives used to cover and protect the pontoon. [...] It still had a tendency to rot because it attracted worms that would burrow into the wood, especially in the South American and Caribbean climates, and allowed the material to decay faster. [...] It was understood throughout the industry and the scientific community that metal would soon be the choice for these devices. [...] In the mid-1920s, metal was introduced into the manufacturing processes because the material was stronger but not yet lighter. [...] This changed with the introduction of aluminum. [...] Specifically, an aluminum alloy called Duralumin, which allowed for the material to be lighter and stronger. [...] Duralumin was the biggest technological advantage of the time because it is a high strength aluminum <b>forging</b> <b>alloy</b> with 3.5% copper, 1.25% Iron, 1.25% silicon, and 1.25% manganese, which gave it high strength and a low weight ratio than aluminum. It was also able to take the centrifugal forces a propeller would generate, withstand the strong impacts with landing on water and flying, and would be able to resist some of nature's pests which could destroy a wood float quickly.|$|E
50|$|The alloys most {{used for}} {{extruded}} members are 2024-T4 for sections less than 0.125 in. thick and for general application, and 2014-T6 for thicker, more highly stressed sections.

Alloy 6061-T6 and its forging counterpart 6151-T6 often are utilized in miscellaneous fittings for reasons of economy and increased corrosion performance, when the parts are not highly stressed.|$|E

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Elsevier via [URL] © 2017. This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] tension and compression tests were conducted to investigate the quasi-static performance of ZK 60 Mg alloy in cast, followed by forging at optimum temperature of 450 °C and a ram speed of 39 mmmin- 1. Microstructure and texture analysis showed that the as-cast alloy exhibited a dendritic structure with casting porosity and random texture. In contrast, the <b>forged</b> <b>alloy</b> exhibited a refined grain structure with {{a significant reduction in}} casting porosity, while the texture changed to sharp basal texture. Measured mechanical properties of the <b>forged</b> <b>alloy</b> showed that strength did not change, however, ductility improved by 75 %. The analysis of the fracture surface of the <b>forged</b> <b>alloy</b> under tension revealed a ductile fracture with dimple morphology, while the as-cast alloy displayed a brittle fracture with open pores. This demonstrated that the reduction of casting defects and dendritic morphology, as well as the evolution of recrystallized grains, enhanced ductility, while partial dynamic recrystallization through the forging process resulted in only marginal modification of strength in the forged condition...|$|R

40|$|Oxidation {{studies have}} been carried out on NiCrAl-base alloys in air and air {{containing}} 1 % sulphur dioxide at 1000 -degrees-C. The alloys used were in the cast, forged and single-crystalline form. There was considerable difference in the oxidation behavior of the as-cast alloy and that of <b>forged</b> <b>alloy,</b> when the environment contained sulphur dioxide. In the absence of the latter, the behavior of the two alloys was not very different. The oxidation behavior of the single crystals was also very {{similar to that of the}} cast and <b>forged</b> <b>alloys,</b> when the atmosphere was oxidizing. A few single-crystalline alloys, however, underwent catastrophic oxidation when about 1 % sulphur dioxide gas was present, in a manner similar to that of the cast alloy. Oxidation tests at 1000 -degrees-C as well as detailed scale analysis indicated that the different microstructure, especially large difference in grain size was probably the main reason for the large difference in their oxidation behavior...|$|R
