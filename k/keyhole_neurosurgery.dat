40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{resurgence}} of clinical interest in keyhole transcranial endoscopic microsurgery as an alternative to conventional microsurgery in carefully selected cases. The supraorbital approach through an eyebrow incision may be considered one of the best examples of the keyhole concept. Although <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> offers the possibility of reduced approach-related morbidity, it can also present substantial technical challenges. This thesis investigates the potential for robotic platforms to improve the safety and effectiveness of such keyhole approaches. A qualitative survey of neurosurgeons was performed to identify the major technical challenges of <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery,</b> and a quantitative study of patents and publications performed to determine the technological innovations that might overcome these barriers. Three clear themes emerged: first, surgical approach and better integration with image guidance systems; second, intra-operative visualisation and improvements in endoscopes; and third, surgical manipulation and improvements in instruments. A community survey suggested that robotic platforms incorporating these technologies would be acceptable to patients and their relatives. Existing robotic platforms were reviewed against the aforementioned requirements for <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> In a cadaver study, it was demonstrated that most frequently used surgical robot today, the da VinciTM platform, was neither safe nor feasible to use in <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery,</b> providing justification for further research. Technological innovations were sought to address each of the identified barriers to <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery,</b> including: an on-demand augmented reality system; a 3 - Dimensional and High-Definition endoscope; and articulated robotic instruments. In a series of laboratory studies, each proposed technological innovation was compared against the current gold standard using a validated model. These technologies were then integrated into a robotic platform for image guided endoscopic microsurgery. Subsequent preclinical and clinical studies have shown promise, but further work is necessary to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — ROBOCAST is a multi-national project {{comprising}} several institutes which aim at outlining {{and implementing}} a prototype system for advanced, robot-assisted <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> This paper reports mainly on software and sensor {{aspects of the}} system in the pre- and intra-operative stage. We describe a comprehensive workflow of planning steps provided to the surgeon in a wizard-like manner. As a novelty, we present a method for automatic trajectory planning based on a statistical and patient-specific risk atlas. Intra-operative monitoring of system uncertainty is proposed. Furthermore, the usage of 2 D and 3 D Freehand Ultrasound for intra-operative validation is motivated and theoretically outlined. After {{the first of three}} years project runtime, we present current work in progress and preliminary results on several patient studies concerning automatic path planning, trajectory localization errors as well as ultrasound imaging on one, six and three patients, respectively. The results underline the usefulness and significance of proposed methods, both within the scope of the ROBOCAST project as well as for conventional <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} cadaver {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and safety of da Vinci robot-assisted <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> Several keyhole craniotomies were fashioned including supraorbital subfrontal, retrosigmoid and supracerebellar infratentorial. In each case, a simple durotomy was performed, and the flap was retracted. The da Vinci surgical system was then used to perform arachnoid dissection towards the deep-seated intracranial cisterns. It {{was not possible to}} simultaneously pass the 12 -mm endoscope and instruments through the keyhole craniotomy in any of the approaches performed, limiting visualization. The articulated instruments provided greater dexterity than existing tools, but the instrument arms could not be placed in parallel through the keyhole craniotomy and, therefore, could not be advanced to the deep cisterns without significant clashing. The da Vinci console offered considerable ergonomic advantages over the existing operating room arrangement, allowing the operating surgeon to remain non-sterile and seated comfortably throughout the procedure. However, the lack of haptic feedback was a notable limitation. In conclusion, while robotic platforms have the potential to greatly enhance the performance of transcranial approaches, there is strong justification for research into next-generation robots, better suited to <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery...</b>|$|E

Twenty-four patients (21 females; mean age, 53 ± 8. 6 years) operated on between 2002 and 2006 through a supra-orbital eyebrow approach were studied. Maximal tumor diameter ranged from 1. 6 to 6 cm. Gross total resection was done in 20 (83. 3 %). All tumors were histologically benign. Two patients (8 %) experienced CSF rinorhea and another two patients suffered transitory diabetes insipidus (8 %). One patient experienced transitory hemiparesis. There was one case of meningitis and one mortality. Follow-up ranged between 6 to 66 months (mean 31. 5 ± 20. 1 months), with no recurrence.

A evolução técnica e a introdução de instrumentais cirúrgicos mais delicados proporcionaram o uso de craniotomias menores no tratamento de patologias intracranianas. Avaliamos os aspectos técnicos da minicraniotomia supra-orbitária superciliar, considerando as indicações, limitações e complicações no tratamento de meningiomas na fossa craniana anterior e para-selares. Vinte e quarto pacientes (21 mulheres; idade média, 53 ± 8, 6 anos) operados entre 2002 e 2006 foram estudados. O diâmetro tumoral máximo variou de 1, 6 a 6 cm. Ressecção total foi obtida em 20 (83, 3 %). Todos os tumores eram histologicamente benignos. Dois pacientes (8 %) apresentaram fistula liquórica pós-operatória e outros dois diabetes insipido transitórioa (8 %). Um paciente evoluiu com hemiparesia transitória. Houve um caso de meningite e um de evolução fatal. O seguimento variou de 6 a 66 meses (média 31, 5 ± 20, 1 meses), não houve recidiva.

40|$|Minimally Invasive (MI) surgery {{represents}} {{the future of}} many types of medical intervention (<b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery,</b> natural orifice trans-luminal endoscopic surgery, etc.). However, the shortcomings of today's surgical tools fuel {{the need for the}} development of next-generation "smart instrumentation", which will be more accurate and safer for the patient. This paper presents the preliminary results of a biologically inspired microtexturing method, based on UV-lithography, and its application to MI neurosurgery. These results suggest that the size and geometry of the texture "printed" on the outer surface of a neurosurgical probe clearly affect the insertion and extraction forces generated at the brainprobe interface. Thus, by carefully choosing an appropriate microtexture, unique insertion characteristics can be obtained, which can improve the performance of existing instruments (e. g. reducing slippage in permanent electrodes such as those used in deep brain stimulation) or enable the development of novel designs altogether...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel image-guided system for precise automatic targeting in minimally invasive <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> The system {{consists of the}} MARS miniature robot fitted with a mechanical guide for needle, probe or catheter insertion.

We also describe a prototype implementation {{of the system and}} in vitro registration experiments. Our results indicate a system-wide target registration error of 1. 7 mm (standard deviation 0. 7 mm), which is close to the required 1. 0 – 1. 5 mm clinical accuracy in many keyhole neurosurgical procedures...|$|E

40|$|Robotics has {{recently}} been introduced in surgery to improve intervention accuracy, to reduce invasiveness and to allow new surgical procedures. In this framework, the ROBOCAST system is an optically surveyed multi-robot chain aimed at enhancing the accuracy of surgical probe insertion during <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> procedures. The system encompasses three robots, connected as a multiple kinematic chain (serial and parallel), totalling 13 degrees of freedom, and {{it is used to}} automatically align the probe onto a desired planned trajectory. The probe is then inserted in the brain, towards the planned target, by means of a haptic interface. This paper presents a new iterative targeting approach to be used in surgical robotic navigation, where the multi-robot chain is used to align the surgical probe to the planned pose, and an external sensor is used to decrease the alignment errors. The iterative targeting was tested in an operating room environment using a skull phantom, and the targets were selected on magnetic resonance images. The proposed targeting procedure allows about 0. 3 mm to be obtained as the residual median Euclidean distance between the planned and the desired targets, thus satisfying the surgical accuracy requirements (1 mm), due to the resolution of the diffused medical images. The performances proved to be independent of the robot optical sensor calibration accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In a {{translational}} neuroscience/neurosurgery perspective, sheep {{are considered}} good candidates to study {{because of the}} similarity between their brain and the human one. Automatic planning systems for safe <b>keyhole</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> maximize the probe/catheter distance from vessels and risky structures. This work consists {{in the development of}} a trajectories planner for straight catheters placement intended to be used for investigating the drug diffusivity mechanisms in sheep brain. Automatic brain segmentation of gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid is achieved using an online available sheep atlas. Ventricles, midbrain and cerebellum segmentation have been also carried out. The veterinary surgeon is asked to select a target point within the white matter to be reached by the probe and to define an entry area on the brain cortex. To mitigate the risk of hemorrhage during the insertion process, which can prevent the success of the insertion procedure, the trajectory planner performs a curvature analysis of the brain cortex and wipes out from the poll of possible entry points the sulci, as part of brain cortex where superficial blood vessels are naturally located. A limited set of trajectories is then computed and presented to the surgeon, satisfying an optimality criteria based on a cost function which considers the distance from critical brain areas and the whole trajectory length. The planner proved to be effective in defining rectilinear trajectories accounting for the safety constraints determined by the brain morphology. It also demonstrated a short computational time and good capability in segmenting gyri and sulci surfaces...|$|E
