500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Knickerbockers {{were the}} first {{baseball}} team to wear uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts and straw hats. The practice of wearing a uniform soon spread, and by 1900, all Major League Baseball teams had adopted them. By 1882 most uniforms included stockings, which covered the leg <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> knee, and were used to differentiate one club from another. The uniforms themselves had different colors and patterns that reflected the different baseball positions. [...] In the late 1880s, the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association {{were the first}} to wear striped uniforms.|$|E
2500|$|Viewers {{are told}} that in the beginning, god (lower case [...] "g" [...] as {{explicitly}} stated in the narration) created death and {{not knowing what to}} do with it, kept it in a sealed urn. Toad was asked by god to watch the urn but Frog pestered Toad into giving it to him. Frog proceeded to juggle the jar <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> foot and accidentally dropped it, [...] thus letting 'death' out, whereby everything from that point on had to die. As a symbolic reference to this story, George is frequently shown caring for an albino Argentine Horned Frog (also known as a Pacman frog) identical to the one shown during the opening narration.|$|E
