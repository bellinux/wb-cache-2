Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E

50|$|Studs {{are usually}} slender so more studs are needed than in post and beam framing.

The length of time required for a penetrant or sample on average to exceed a specified average heat rise above ambient at any single location determines the duration for the FT Rating (Fire and Temperature). If a hose-stream test is passed afterwards, the rating can then be expressed as an FTH Rating (Fire, Temperature and Hose-stream). The lowest of the three determines the overall rating.|$|E

50|$|Spray {{fireproofing}} {{of structural}} steel is most efficiently accomplished before interior partitions are built, otherwise {{a conflict with}} fire stops in firewalls could result.

Spray fireproofing cannot be applied prior to fire stopping at these surfaces, as the fireproofing would obstruct adherence of the <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> materials to the fire barrier surfaces. Spraying the upper room perimeter with fireproofing may also result in covering of wall/ceiling joints and through penetrations that require fire stopping.

Roxul Inc. Final Report [...] October 7, 1997 Page i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fire stops can introduce a physical connection between the two sides of a double-stud wall, hence providing structural flanking paths for transmission of vibration which worsens the sound insulation. This study primarily addressed the specific case of a load-bearing party wall with double wood studs, supporting a floor with wood joists perpendicular to the party wall and a floor deck or sub-floor of 15. 9 mm OSB. Even without structural transmission of vibration through a <b>fire</b> <b>stop,</b> the sound insulation in a real building is normally affected by flanking transmission. Addition of a <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> provides yet another path for vibration transmission between the rooms, and hence tends to worsen the sound insulation further. This study examines how a <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> at the floor/wall junction can degrade the apparent sound insulation of the party wall (the nominal separation) by increasing structural transmission of vibration around that wall via the connected floor system (the flanking path). Group 0 Constructions have no physical <b>fire</b> <b>stop.</b> Adding batt insulation to fill the wall's inter-stud cavities leaving a gap of 25 mm or less (Case 2) improves sound insulation provided by the party wall itself while adding negligible structural transmission. Strictly speaking, this is not a <b>fire</b> <b>stop,</b> but it does provide the necessary fire resistance (as shown in the companion study of fire spread) and meets the presc [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Any {{opening in}} the {{exterior}} of structures are critical when exposed to fire. Windows and doors may be open, ventilation openings may be unprotected, wall cladding and roof tiles may allow flames or embers to enter cavities. Gaps may have developed over time and allow embers to settle in crevices or cavities in the structure. In fact, rarely does initial fire penetration occur right through cladding, sheets, insulation or solid walls. Penetration is most often related to openings, weak joints or cracks. There is no doubt these weak points to fire spread in construction or indoor are crucial to the outcome of exterior fire exposure whether caused by wildfire or fire in outdoor trash or neighbouring buildings. Therefore, this has been addressed by authorities, standardization bodies and industry world-wide and much progress have been made during the last decade. This paper provide overview on new standards, on codes and on various pass/fail criteria set by code or classification standards. The paper describes how new designs of fire resistant ventilating facades and roofs apply dedicated cavity fire barriers and how new standard test methods helps to improve performances. A number of different fire scenarios that elements in vented facades/constructions can be exposed to have been studied. New test standards {{have been developed for}} the last few years and are explained. Finally, this paper evaluate how different <b>fire</b> <b>stop</b> products perform in different fire scenarios and which test standards are applicable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} present {{evidence}} of smoke spread due to problems in compartmentation and also reviews different test methods {{which can be}} employed to identify these problems during construction stages. Since 2010, evidence has emerged that the rapid spread of smoke occurs in and between UK buildings, including where accredited construction details and/or robust details are specified [1, 2]. It is considered that this rapid smoke spread {{could be due to}} incorrect installation, missing, inappropriate or defective components, that make up compartmentation and <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> within concealed spaces [1, 2, 3]. These defects can compromise the ability of compartmentation to resist fire and smoke spread between dwellings and also into any means of escape. The impact of the defects could ultimately be detrimental to occupant safety, care staff with the occupants and also fire fighters, {{in the event of a}} real fire. In 2016, fire risk assessments undertaken in buildings before occupancy (that ascertain the performance of the building with respect to fire and smoke spread in accordance with Approved Document B) of the UK Building Regulations are based upon a visual review of building design details and documentation, and also visual inspection of as-built details. However, this approach is inadequate to identify defects in the components that make up compartmentation and <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> details in concealed spaces [3] since, it is impossible to determine with the naked eye whether these details have been installed as designed. Littlewood and Smallwood [1, 2] have identified an urgent need to investigate the extent of these smoke spread problems within new dwellings being constructed in the UK and also the development for an appropriate compliance test which can identify issues in fire compartmentation and <b>fire</b> <b>stopping</b> and used before buildings are occupied - such as the in-construction testing (iCT) process. The paper also reviews different tests that can be employed as part of iCT methodology to identify the potential defects in fire compartmentation, and <b>fire</b> <b>stops</b> such as cavity barriers in buildings...|$|R
