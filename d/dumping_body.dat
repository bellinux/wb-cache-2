40|$|This {{investment}} project {{was dedicated to}} the development of models for low-noise garbage truck retrofitting in accordance with the acoustic requirements established through guideline RAL-UZ 59 for the award of environmental quality seals. Carrier trucks (MB 1613 KO) were retrofitted to meet low-noise chassis requirements in accordance with annex XXI, section 49, paragraph 3 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The noise of a newly designed low-noise lifting and tipping unit was reduced by 16 dB (A) as compared to the conventional ones. New covers were designed for bulk garbage containers. Noise reduction was 6 dB (A) during simulated lifting and tipping and 9 dB (A) during the transport phases. The cylinders of the presss plate were provided with position switches to slow the cylinders down before reaching the final position. The <b>dumping</b> <b>body</b> was noise-insulated for a noise reduction of 3 dB (A). The overall sound level A of garbage trucks operating state B was reduced by 5 dB (A) to 97 dB (A) in accordance with RAL-UZ 59. The guideline's acoustic requirements were fulfilled. New garbage trucks are manufactured meanwhile considering the developed noise reduction model. Trucks bearing the environmental quality seal for low-noise, low-emission vehicles are available on the market. (orig.)

40|$|In July 2008, a {{self-employed}} construction contractor (the victim) sustained fatal injuries when he {{was crushed}} against the cab of a dump truck by the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> at a residential construction site. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim was using the dump truck to deliver soil to the site and then grading the soil with a backhoe. The victim worked alone and there was no witness to the incident. The incident was initially reported by the property owner who arrived on site at approximately 5 : 00 PM and found both the dump truck and the backhoe idling. The property owner saw that the victim was crushed between the back of the cab and the front of the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> that was in the down position. With the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> down, the width of the space was 7 inches. The <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> movement was controlled by a dump lever located inside the cab. Post-incident examination determined that the dump lever was stuck and inoperable. There was a mechanical linkage between the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> hydraulic control lever and the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> cylinder valve. The linkage was located underneath the chassis between the frame members. The <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> could be actuated if the linkage was pushed. It appeared that the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> may have been stuck when the last load of soil was being unloaded.

50|$|An {{application}} for telescopic cylinders commonly seen {{is that of}} the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> on a <b>dump</b> truck used in a construction site. In order to empty the load of gravel completely, the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> must be raised to an angle of about 60 degrees. To accomplish this long travel with a conventional hydraulic cylinder is very difficult considering that the collapsed length of a single stage rod cylinder is approximately 110% of its output stroke.

40|$|Abstract:––The truck {{industry}} is a significant lifeline of the country’s economic activity. There is considerable scope to improve the design of their products. In order to save unloading costs tipper trucks are becoming very popular now a day. These bodies are also known as <b>dump</b> <b>bodies.</b> These are useful in {{a simple way to}} unload the material. Every extra pound of vehicle weight increases manufacturing cost, lower fuel efficiency and reduces vehicle payload capacity. With this concept of reducing weight and stress reduction the optimized model of tipper <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> is modeled and analyzed. Three models of tipper <b>dump</b> <b>bodies</b> are considered, whose specifications are taken from local industry. The three models are modeled in CAD package Pro-E and Static Structural analysis is done in ANSYS. The three models are 14 cubic meter capacity and bearing cubic load of 18 tons. By conducting the Finite Element Analysis on the three Models and according to standards, weight reduction and stress reduction is carried out. With the optimized parameters, optimized Model is developed and analyzed, stress analysis is carried out and the results are obtained.

40|$|Volvo Construction Equipment {{is highly}} {{regarded}} for robust products, {{but with an}} increasing competition in their market, development of the product portfolio {{is more important than}} ever. One step being carried out is to reduce losses in powertrains and increase the fuel efficiency for solutions such as articulated haulers and wheel loaders. This would eventually lower the fuel costs and emissions for the end customer. With this development, Volvo CE could strengthen their position in the market while also contributing to reducing the construction industry's environmental impact. By investigating the front bogie axle of the recently introduced hauler, Volvo A 60 H, important information about possible reductions and the distribution of the current losses were found. The investigation focused on a front bogie axle, but some of the results are applicable for other applications such as wheel loaders as well, since a lot of the technology in the axles are similar. A conceptual study was performed where completely new ideas were generated, such as implementing a dry sump system in the axle, as well as ideas for improving the subcomponents currently found in the axle. Two cases were presented for the evaluation of concepts, one with a fully loaded <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> and low speeds, and one with an unloaded <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> and a wider speed interval. The concepts were later evaluated using calculation tools such as MATLAB and a Simulink-model was created for the losses in the axle. When combining concepts that reduces load dependent losses, a potential reduction of 64 % of the axle's total losses was achieved for the case with a full <b>dump</b> <b>body.</b> The largest improvement found for the load independent losses was 8 % with an unloaded hauler and the highest speed investigated, 50 km/h. A dry sump system improves the axle's efficiency with 45 % in optimal working conditions, but was found to lower the efficiency at other conditions. Room for improvement of axle losses currently exists both for load dependent and load independent losses. The evaluation performed pointed towards the load dependent losses being the largest influence on the total losses, even with an unloaded <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> and high speeds. This is an interesting observation since a lot of work at Volvo CE has revolved around reducing the load independent losses since these are easier to affect with different lubrication levels and rotational speeds. A test methodology for load dependent losses should be implemented in order to validate the results of this thesis work, and also to aid further development at Volvo CE...|$|R
