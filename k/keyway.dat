5|$|A {{common type}} of {{internal}} broach is the <b>keyway</b> broach (C & D). It uses a special fixture called a horn to support the broach and properly locate the part with relation to the broach.|$|E
5|$|Broaching {{is often}} {{impossible}} without the specific broaching or <b>keyway</b> machines {{unless you have}} a system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with a modern machining centre or driven tooling lathe; these extra bits of equipment open up the possibility of producing keyways, splines and torx through one-hit machining.|$|E
25|$|R8 collets have a <b>keyway</b> {{to prevent}} {{rotation}} when fitting or removing, {{but it is}} the compressed taper and not the <b>keyway</b> that provides the driving force. Collets are compressed by a drawbar from behind, they are self releasing and tool changes can be automated.|$|E
50|$|Parallel, tapered, and Woodruff <b>keyways</b> can be {{produced}} on a milling machine. End mills or slotting cutters are used for parallel and tapered <b>keyways,</b> while a Woodruff cutter is used for Woodruff <b>keyways.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{internal}} <b>keyways</b> {{that are}} not too long, the <b>keyways</b> can be milled if a radius is acceptable.|$|R
50|$|For {{additional}} interchangeable core access control, non-proprietary <b>keyways</b> and key {{sections of}} the following designations are available: A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, R, TB, TD and TE. Other less common but still non-proprietary <b>keyways</b> and key sections also exist, but these typically have differing designations from manufacturer to manufacturer, even though the components may otherwise be identical.|$|R
25|$|In October 2014 a {{new kind}} of crack in the {{graphite}} moderator bricks was found at the Hunterston B reactor. This <b>keyway</b> root crack has been previously theorized but not observed. The existence of this type of crack does not immediately affect the safety of a reactor â€“ however if the number of cracks exceed a threshold the reactor would be decommissioned, as the cracks cannot be repaired.|$|E
2500|$|Each Hurst SC/Rambler came {{equipped}} with the [...] AMC V8 engine from the AMX. There were no factory options to this package. Standard clutch was a [...] with a three finger long-style Borg and Beck pressure plate. The 390 engine was mated to a manual transmission four-speed T-10 with close gear ratios. A Hurst shifter came with a large metal [...] "T" [...] handle. The rear end was an AMC 3.54:1 [...] "Twin-Grip" [...] limited slip differential using Dana internals, with outer wheel hubs attached through a spline and <b>keyway</b> system. The hub attachment method was the only weak point in the rear end assembly.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958 the Roadmaster {{could only}} be ordered as the well {{equipped}} Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new [...] "drawer pull" [...] grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For {{the first time since}} 1948 there were no distinguishing VentiPorts on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock <b>keyway.</b> Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.|$|E
50|$|Improperly {{machined}} <b>keyways</b> {{that had}} cutter deflection or drifting occur, {{may not be}} strong enough for the required application.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Keyways</b> in {{the boss}} of a pulley or gear can be {{machined}} without resorting to a dedicated broaching setup.|$|R
50|$|This {{variation}} was {{a horizontal}} {{mirror image of}} obverse <b>keyways,</b> no longer offered in new key system, and not available with a Primus option.|$|R
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a <b>keyway</b> and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E
50|$|Like many lock manufacturers, Schlage uses milled complex <b>keyway</b> shapes to {{mechanically}} prevent some non-OEM {{keys from}} entering or operating a lock. New <b>keyway</b> designs may be protected {{for a limited}} time by patent protection, which expires after a set number of years.|$|E

5000|$|Macroscopic and {{microscopic}} discontinuities (at the crystalline grain scale) {{as well as}} component {{design features}} which cause stress concentrations (holes, <b>keyways,</b> sharp changes of load direction etc.) are common locations at which the fatigue process begins.|$|R
50|$|Steering is by worm and wheel, {{the drop}} shaft {{attached}} to the wheel is on three <b>keyways</b> {{so it can be}} turned through 120 deg. to compensate for wear. Also adjustment is provided for engagement of the worm to the wheel.|$|R
50|$|A keyhole (or <b>keyway)</b> is a hole or {{aperture}} (as in a door or lock) {{for receiving}} a key. Lock <b>keyway</b> shapes vary widely with lock manufacturer, and many manufacturers {{have a number}} of unique profiles requiring a specifically milled key blank to engage the lock's tumblers.|$|E

50|$|The axle {{was made}} of best Lowmoor wrought iron, and had run about 220,000 miles during its 7 years service (normal life was 10 years or 300,000 miles). The {{fracture}} surface of the principal break showed {{what is now called}} a slow growth region on the outer part of the diameter, with a fast growth section at the centre. Although Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate did not recognize the problem as fatigue, he had seen many similar fracture surfaces in his career, attributing the break to the two <b>keyways</b> machined into the outer surface of the axle. He was quite right. The fatigue cracks probably grew from {{one or more of the}} sharp corners of the <b>keyways,</b> extending slowly around the circumference until the axle could no longer support its load, and the crack (or cracks) grew catastrophically. The load on an axle is complex, but involves both bending from the load in the vehicle above, and torsion from the rotation of the axle. He suggested that the four <b>keyways</b> rather than two be used, effectively spreading the load. Nowadays, the sharpness of the corners would also be reduced, so lessening the stress concentration. Thickening the shaft was done after this accident, and would also have helped to lower net stresses in the axle.|$|R
25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut <b>keyways</b> into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the concept}} is understood, the {{principle}} of operation can lead to all manner of designs where internal grooves, <b>keyways,</b> splines, etc. may be measured in a simple yet effective manner. These will often be made to order by the toolmakers, or a related skilled tradesman.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{large family}} of keyways {{expressed}} as four numbers. Except for zeros, digits in the <b>keyway</b> designation cannot repeat; i.e. 3578, 1358 and 1200 are valid, but 1244 and 3300 are not. Primus cannot be implemented on this series. The digit 9 is not used. Each digit represents {{the presence of a}} notch in the <b>keyway</b> and a corresponding protrusion along the blade of the key. The odd digits 1, 3, 5, and 7 extend along {{the left side of the}} <b>keyway</b> as observed from the lock face from bottom to top. The even digits are likewise, on the right side. Generally, keyways are identified by four non-zero digits in ascending order. In a large masterkey system, keys with fewer than four protrusions can be used to enter more than one <b>keyway.</b> For example, key blank 1460 will fit lock cylinder 1246, 1346, 1467, etc.|$|E
50|$|Broaching is {{primarily}} used to cut square cornered internal keyways. The specific broach, bushing and guide {{are used for}} each given <b>keyway</b> cross-section, which makes this process more expensive {{than most of the}} alternatives. However, it can produce the most accurate <b>keyway</b> out of all the processes. There are three main steps in broaching a keyway: First, the workpiece is set on the arbor press and the bushing is placed in the opening of the workpiece. Next, the broach is inserted and pushed through, cutting the <b>keyway.</b> Finally, shims are placed between the bushing and the broach to achieve the correct depth necessary for the key.|$|E
5000|$|Woodruff {{keys are}} semi{{circular}}, fitting partly into a circular segment <b>keyway</b> {{with the remainder}} fitting into a longitudinal slot <b>keyway</b> in the mating part. The circular segment can be cut directly by plunge cutting with a circular Woodruff cutter without any reliefs. The main advantage of the Woodruff key is the elimination of milling near shaft shoulders, where stress concentrations, and concentricity would be affected. [...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and <b>keyway</b> also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key. Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, snowblowers and marine propellers.|$|E
50|$|In 1930, the BS 196 {{standard}} for industrial {{plugs and sockets}} was introduced. The plugs are available in 5 A, 15 A and 30 A variants, with various configurations of <b>keyways</b> and pins to cater for different voltages. BS 196 plugs have now been superseded by BS 4343 (CEE type) connectors in most modern applications.|$|R
50|$|Shaping or {{slotting}} {{is largely}} used for cutting <b>keyways</b> {{that do not}} extend through {{the full length of}} the part. Like keyseating, shaping uses a single-point cutting tool for cutting, however, shapers are not guided through the cut on a fixed post. As such, shaper cuts are generally more susceptible to deflection than keyseater cuts.|$|R
5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, <b>keyways,</b> and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|R
