5|$|Although he {{verbally}} {{dismissed the}} French order expelling {{him and his}} family <b>from</b> <b>Syria,</b> Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in Syria.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the battle, the Abbasid forces were forced to {{withdraw}} <b>from</b> <b>Syria,</b> and Tulunid control over the province was reaffirmed. In the following year the Abbasid government agreed to a treaty which formally recognized Khumarawayh's rule over both Egypt and Syria.|$|E

5|$|According to Moubayed, Atrash's anti-government {{activities}} significantly {{contributed to}} Shishakli's resignation and departure <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> in February 1954 amid the countrywide unrest. In the first post-Shishakli democratic election later that year, Atrash {{was elected to}} parliament. Atrash was offered a cabinet position in Said al-Ghazzi's September 1955 government, but he rejected the offer because of the Ba'ath Party's opposition to the government's makeup.|$|E
5|$|Corbulo {{was given}} control over two provinces, Cappadocia and Galatia (modern-day central Turkey), with propraetorial and later proconsular {{authority}} or imperium. Although Galatia {{was considered a}} good recruiting-ground and Cappadocia had a few units of auxiliaries, {{the bulk of his}} army came <b>from</b> <b>Syria,</b> where half the garrison of four legions and several units of auxiliaries was transferred to his command.|$|E
5|$|The French entered Damascus the {{following}} day, encountering little resistance. Soon afterward, Faisal was expelled <b>from</b> <b>Syria.</b> Despite the Syrian army's decisive defeat, {{the battle is}} viewed in Syria {{and the rest of}} the Arab world as a symbol of courageous resistance against a stronger, imperial power.|$|E

5|$|The {{transfer}} of administrative powers to the Syrian government began on 1 August, {{the day in}} which Quwatli announced {{the establishment of the}} Syrian Army and his position as the commander in chief. Quwatli also asked Khoury to form a cabinet, which was established on 24 August. The French completed their withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> on 15 April 1946 and Quwatli declared Syria's independence day on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the spring}} and early summer of 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} a series of defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists <b>from</b> <b>Syria,</b> to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{probably}} {{wanted a}} new {{war against the}} Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. Trajan continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars. Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.|$|E
5|$|Having drilled {{his army}} {{for two years}} Corbulo, despite this misadventure, was ready. He had three legions at his {{disposal}} (III Gallica and VI Ferrata <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> and IV Scythica), to which were added {{a large number of}} auxiliaries and allied contingents from Eastern client kings like Aristobulus of Lesser Armenia and Polemon II of Pontus. The situation was furthermore favorable to the Romans: Vologases faced a serious revolt by the Hyrcanians in the region of the Caspian Sea as well as incursions of Dahae and Sacae nomads from Central Asia, and was unable to support his brother.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Islamic State of Iraq's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al-Qaeda’s central command authorized the Syrian Abu Mohammad al-Golani to set up a Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda in August 2011, to bring down the Assad government and establish an Islamic state there. Golani and some colleagues crossed the border <b>from</b> Iraq into <b>Syria,</b> and reached out to Islamists released <b>from</b> <b>Syria's</b> Sednaya military prison in May-June 2011 who were already active in fighting against Assad’s security forces.|$|R

5|$|In early 1921, using al-Shallash as an intermediary, Hananu began {{receiving}} {{support from}} Emir Abdullah, the Hashemite emir of Transjordan and Faisal's brother. Although the support from Emir Abdullah was relatively small in quantity, the French authorities feared {{it was part}} of a plot by Abdullah and his British allies to oust the French <b>from</b> <b>Syria.</b> Hananu, meanwhile, was launching frequent hit-and-run operations against the French left flank in the area between Urfa and Antioch in an effort to support the Turks at the main battlefront in Gaziantep.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive {{expedition}} to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew <b>from</b> <b>Syria</b> and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where, after being reinforced, they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle {{is considered to be}} one of Khalid ibn al-Walid's greatest military victories. It cemented his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August, Quwatli {{established}} a long-term {{agreement with the}} USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of {{a large portion of}} Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador <b>from</b> <b>Syria.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, {{destroying}} much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights <b>from</b> <b>Syria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tension in the Golan Heights area {{remained}} {{high and}} on 9January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar Szold {{were attacked by}} Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who crossed the border <b>from</b> <b>Syria.</b> The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.|$|E
