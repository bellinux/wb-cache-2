40|$|In October 2009, highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus (HPAIV) was isolated {{for the first}} time in poultry in Spain. Sequencing analysis revealed that it was an H 7 N 7 HPAIV. The progenitors of H 7 HPAIV strains involved in recent European poultry outbreaks were simultaneously circulating in wild birds. The infected Spanish farm is located close to a reservoir abundant in wild birds. Epidemiological investigation found no links to other poultry holdings and those located in the control area were negative for AIV. Previous spatial risk analyses had identified the area where the <b>infected</b> <b>holding</b> is located to beat high relative risk for the introduction and presence of H 5 N 1 HPAIV by wild birds. We suggest a risk-based surveillance scheme that targets smaller geographical units but maintains the number of wild birds being sampled, as early detection of potentially pathogenic AIV is crucial in preventing spread to poultry...|$|E
40|$|This study {{considered}} a simple SIR {{model for the}} spread of epidemics amongst holdings of a producer community in Northern Germany, based on the directed network of animal movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficiency of different control measures to reduce the epidemic size substantially. The currently applied control measures based on the distance to an <b>infected</b> <b>holding</b> were compared with the control measures based on the specific network-based centrality parameters. We found that network-based measures led to a more efficient control of epidemics with a much smaller number of removed holdings. To assess the impact of different holding types, the analysed control measures were implemented by both including and excluding these holding types. The comparison revealed a crucial role of multipliers in the spread of an epidemic. The network- based control measures depending on the removal by out-degree, outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and outgoing closeness centrality showed the best results: In the three-year network, on average, 2. 75, 4. 15, 3. 73 and 3. 43 times more holdings had to be removed by the control measures based on the 1, 3, 5 and 10 km radius to reduce the epidemic to the same size compared with the network-based control measures. In an area with a higher holding density, the improvement of the network-based control measures may become even more obvious. The removal of holdings based on the above-mentioned centrality parameters did thus not only rapidly decompose the network into fragments, but also reduced the epidemic size most efficiently...|$|E

40|$|Sepsis is a {{clinical}} syndrome {{that can be}} caused by bacteria or fungi. Early knowledge {{on the nature of the}} causative agent is a prerequisite for targeted anti-microbial therapy. Besides currently used detection methods like blood culture and PCR-based assays, the analysis of the transcriptional response of the host to <b>infecting</b> organisms <b>holds</b> great promise. In this study, we aim to examine the transcriptional footprint of infections caused by the bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus in a human whole-blood model. Moreover, we use the expression information to build a random forest classifier to classify if a sample contains a bacterial, fungal, or mock-infection. After normalizing the transcription intensities using stably expressed reference genes, we filtered the gene set for biomarkers of bacterial or fungal blood infections. This selection is based on differential expression and an additional gene relevance measure. In this way, we identified 38 biomarker genes, including IL 6, SOCS 3, and IRG 1 which were already associated to sepsis by other studies. Using these genes, we trained the classifier and assessed its performance. It yielded a 96 % accuracy (sensitivities > 93 %, specificities > 97 %) for a 10 -fold stratified cross-validation and a 92 % accuracy (sensitivities and specificities > 83 %) for an additional test dataset comprising Cryptococcus neoformans infections. Furthermore, the classifier is robust to Gaussian noise, indicating correct class predictions on datasets of new species. In conclusion, this genome-wide approach demonstrates an effective feature selection process in combination with the construction of a well-performing classification model. Further analyses of genes with pathogen-dependent expression patterns can provide insights into the systemic host responses, which may lead to new anti-microbial therapeutic advances...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Glycolysis is {{the sole}} source of energy for the intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum, making glycolytic enzymes {{putative}} therapeutic targets. Enolase, a single copy gene in P. falciparum is one such enzyme whose activity is elevated ~ 10 – 15 fold in <b>infected</b> RBC’s. It <b>holds</b> the possibility of having multiple biological functions in the parasite and hence can be a suitable candidate for diagnostic and chemotherapeutic purposes. Methods: We have aimed at generating parasite-specific reagents {{in the form of}} monoclonal antibodies. We have raised monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant P. falciparum enolase. Results: Two IgG monoclonals were obtained with 1 : 1000 titre and specific for P. falciparum enolase. Apicomplexan parasites including P. falciparum enolase has a plant like pentapeptide sequence (104 EWGWS 108) which is uniquely different from the host counterpart. A peptide spanning this pentapeptide region (ELDGSKNEWGWSKSK) coupled to BSA was used to raise parasite-specific antibody. Four monoclonals were obtained with 1 : 1000 titre and of IgM isotype. Interpretation & conclusion: All the monoclonals are specific for P. falciparum enolase and one of them display reactivity against native P. falciparum enolase signifying this pentapeptide to be surface exposed and immunogenic.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn {{understanding}} {{of the factors that}} determine the risk of members of a susceptible population becoming infected is essential for estimating the potential for disease spread, as opposed to just focusing on transmission from an infected population. Furthermore, analysis of the risk factors can reveal important characteristics of an epidemic and further develop {{understanding of}} the processes operating. MethodsThis paper describes the development of a mixed effects logistic regression model of susceptibility of holdings to foot and mouth disease (FMD) during the 2001 epidemic in Great Britain following the imposition of a national ban on the movements of susceptible animals (NMB). ResultsThe principal risk factors identified in the model were shorter distances to the nearest infectious seed (a <b>holding</b> <b>infected</b> before the NMB) and the county of the holding (principally Cumbria). Additional risk factors included holdings that are mixed species rather than single species, the surface area of the holding, and the number of cattle within 10 km (all p 0. 1). The fit of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and the Hosmer and Lemeshow Chi-squared statistic; the fit was good with both tests (area under the ROC= 0. 962 and Hosmer and Lemeshow Chi-squared statistic= 49. 98 (p> 0. 1)). ConclusionsHoldings at greatest risk of infection can be identified using simple readily available risk factors; this information could be employed in the control of future FMD epidemics...|$|R
40|$|Cholesterol {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the establishment of mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterial species such as Mycoacterium tuberculosis are capable of utilising cholesterol as a primary energy source in culture. M. leprae localises to cholesterol-rich areas of an <b>infected</b> cell, which <b>holds</b> significance for the intracellular niches created by mycobacteria. Despite the implications for other mycobacterial species, there has been very little research examining the relationship between cholesterol and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). This study examined the role of both serum and intracellular cholesterol during the early stages of MAP infection in both sheep and cattle in vivo and in vitro. Using a well-established infection model, sheep and cattle were exposed to MAP and blood and faecal samples were collected at monthly intervals. Total serum cholesterol changed significantly in exposed animals during the first few months of infection in both sheep and cattle when compared to the control cohorts. In in vitro infection experiments using monocytes from MAP non-exposed cattle and sheep and fluorescent microscopic techniques demonstrated that GFP-tagged MAP co-localised to cholesterol-rich domains within the cell. In addition, changes in the expression of a number of cholesterol-associated genes within the macrophage suggest that MAP is capable of altering cholesterol metabolism of the infected cell. Thus previously unexplored mechanisms within the intracellular environment created by MAP during the early stages of infection may be important for understanding the survival and persistence of MAP...|$|R
40|$|Bartonella henselae {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{zoonotic}} agents acquired from companion animals (cats) in industrialised countries. Nonetheless, given the high prevalence of infections in cats, the number of human infections reported is relatively low. One explanation for this discrepancy is that B. henselae strains vary in their zoonotic potential. To test the validity of this explanation, the population structure of B. henselae in the United Kingdom was quantified by applying multi- locus sequence typing (MLST) to a collection of isolates obtained by structured survey of cats living in the UK. The position of human-associated strains within this structure was then determined using MLST data obtained from infected human clinical material. A total of 13 MLST sequence types (STs) were identified among 98 feline isolates, with most (74 %) belonging to ST 4, ST 6 and ST 7. However, of the 23 human-associated strains characterized, most (85 %) belonged to three genotypes, ST 2, ST 5 and ST 8, which were rare amongst feline isolates. Differences in host association of ST 2, ST 5 and ST 8 (human-associated) and ST 6 (feline) were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Thus my data indicated that a few, uncommon STs were responsible for the majority of (symptomatic) human infections. Why certain STs are more frequently associated with zoonosis is uncertain; clearly, the ability to <b>infect</b> humans <b>holds</b> no selective advantage for B. henselae as humans are accidental hosts. Thus, this ability must be an unfortunate side effect of some other adaptation to part of the complex life cycle of B. henselae that involves chronic intra-erythrocytic parasitism in feline (reservoir) hosts, between which infection is transmitted by cat fleas. In an attempt to identify the stage of this life cycle in which zoonosis-associated strains consistently behaved in a manner different to other strains, I tested the performance of representative isolates of zoonosis-associated, and other STs in a series of assays previously developed as in vitro models for the various life cycle stages. Although differences were found in the growth kinetics and persistence of different isolates, variation in phenotype did not correlate with ST. I then exploited comparative genomics as an alternative approach to identifying differences between zoonosis-associated and other STs. This approach also allowed sensitive exploration of genomic variation within the species. SOLiD sequencing technology was used to generate sequence data for 16 B. henselae strains, which were compared by mapping to the previously-determined genome sequence of the type strain, Houston-I. I catalogued the modest variation in gene content within and between STs and identified 9013 genic SNPs within the dataset. Analysis of these SNPs allowed (i) the inference of a robust phylogeny that generally concurred with that of MLST data, (ii) the exploration of ongoing functional gene loss within the species, and (iii) the mapping of hotspots of selective pressure within the genomes. Further findings of this thesis include the molecular detection of Bartonella quintana in 12 endocarditis patients from the UK. Six ofthese patients were recent immigrants into the UK suggesting B. quintana is an important cause of endocarditis in UK immigrants. The use of MLST to determine the population structure of Bartonella species was extended to Bartonella bacilliformis, the aetiological agent of human bartonellosis, a disease of public health importance in Peru. A novel MLST scheme delineated 44 isolates into eight STs, some of which correlated with geographical provenance. Phylogenetic analysis revealed one ST, ST 8, exhibited an evolutionary divergence from the other seven STs that was akin to that observed between other Bartonella species, suggesting ST 8 strains are a novel Bartonella genospecies.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This study¹ was undertaken: (1) {{to obtain}} {{information}} {{on the distribution of}} the snail, Oxytrema silicula, in three coastal rivers in Oregon, and the seasonal incidence of infection in these snails and in snails from an inland stream, with the cercariae of the trematode, Nanophyetus salinincola; (2) to follow cercarial development in the snail under natural and experimental conditi is; (3) to determine the species of animals naturally infected with the metacercariae and those susceptible to experimental infection; and (4) to follow development of the metacercariae in the fish hosts. The snail was found widely distributed in the Alsea, Siletz, and Yaquina Rivers both in fresh and brackish water, Salinities in the brackish water areas were as. high as 11. 2 parts per thousand. Large snails were observed in all rivers during each season of the year. The incidence of infection with N. salmincola was highest in snails with aperture diameters from 10 to 1. 3 mm, and varied from 27 percent in snails from the Alsea River to 29 percent in snails from the Siletz, and Yaquina Rivers. Thirty-five percent of snails from Oak Creek, a stream near Corvallis, were found infected with cercariae of N. salmincola. There was no apparent change in the intensity of infection in the snails during the study period. Immature, but not mature, cercariae of N. salmincola were found in snails during the months of December through March. Identity of these cercariae as N. salmincola was shown by <b>holding</b> <b>infected</b> snails at room temperature for 15 days. At the end of this time 90 percent of the snails infected with N. salmincola contained mature cercariae. Mature cercariae were noted in snails during the months of April through November. The kidneys from 116 of 152 ocean-caught coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and from 11 of 1. 5 ocean-caught chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha, were found infected with 1 to 2400 metacercariae of N. salmincola. A dog fed two of these kidneys developed "salmon poisoning" disease. These results demonstrated {{for the first time that}} salinity was without any "cleansing" effect on either the trematode or the etiologic agent, though this effect was previously believed to occur. The fishes Cottus perplexus, Lampetra richardsoni, L. tridentata, and Richardsonius balteatus, and the Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon ensatus, all from western Oregon streams, were found naturally infected with the metacerariae of N. saimincola. This is the first report of natural infections in an animal other than a fish and in nonsalmonid fishes. Fourteen species of fishes were experimentally infected: Salmo gairdneri, S. salar, S. trutta, Salvelinus fontinalis, S. namaycush, L. richardsoni, C. perplexus, Carassius auratus, R. balteatus, Catostomus macrocheilus, Lepomis macrochirus, Gasterosteus a. aculeatus, G. a. microcephalus, and Gambusia affinis. This extends the number of salmonid and nonsalmonid fishes susceptible to experimental infection. Cysts from all five of the naturally infected animals and from 12 of the 14 experimentally infected fishes were given to hamsters by stomach tube. The identification of the parasites as N. salmincola was confirmed by recovery of adult flukes from the hamsters in all instances. except one (probably because of low dosage). Metacercariae from 1 to 106 days old from the experimentally infected fishes, and from naturally infected animals were studied. The stylet was absent in rnetacerariae approximately 50 days and older. The excretory bladder was always filled with round granules in metacercaniae 15 days and older. The diameter of the cyst and thickness of the cyst wall increased with age of the parasite...|$|R
