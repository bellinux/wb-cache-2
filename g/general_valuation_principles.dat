40|$|Article 31 of the Fourth Directive, which {{specifies}} the <b>general</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>principles</b> to {{be applied}} {{in the preparation of}} financial statements, shows a difference in emphasis between the different language versions. Except for the English version of the Directive, all others emphasize prudence, as opposed to the other valuation principles required by the article. The earlier drafts of the Directive are examined in an attempt to trace the development of this difference between the English and the other language versions. It seems that the particular wording of Article 31 with its relatively greater weight on prudence probably results from UK influence, more specifically from SSAP 2. A possible solution is then suggested as to why this particular emphasis on prudence was not retained in the English version of the Directive. Further, it is noted that German law did not explicitly make prudence an overriding concept before the Fourth Directive and nor does the German implementation of Article 31. ...|$|E
40|$|Risk-adjusted {{valuation}} is {{well established}} in both theory and business practice. However, its implications are not always immediately apparent or intuitive in legal disputes such as breach of contract lawsuits. In particular, damages are often calculated by discounting the differences in cash flows between but-for (no breach) and actual (breach) worlds by a single discount rate. While widely used, this approach can produce incorrect valuation results. This paper provides {{a case study of}} a breach of an electricity tolling agreement to illustrate the more <b>general</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>principle</b> of discounting but-for and actual cash flows using two discount rates. ...|$|R

The paper distinguishes three analysis levels: the first is the economic-substance one (aim, assumptions, <b>general</b> and peculiar <b>valuation</b> <b>principles</b> and rules); the second level concerns the display (prospects and docu-ments) and the disclosure (notes ecc.) profiles, assured by interesting integrative information; the last level re-calls the social (global/sustainability) reporting issues...|$|R
40|$|In {{a market}} of {{deterministic}} cash flows, given as an additive, symmetric relation of exchangeability on the finite signed Borel measures on the non-negative real time axis, it is {{shown that the}} only arbitrage-free price functional that fulfills some additional mild requirements is the integral of the unit zero-coupon bond prices {{with respect to the}} payment measures. For probability measures, this is a Choquet representation, where the Dirac measures, as unit zero-coupon bonds, are the extreme points. Dropping one of the requirements, the Lebesgue decomposition is used to construct counterexamples, where the Choquet price formula does not hold despite of an arbitrage-free market model. The concept is then extended to deterministic streams of assets and currencies in <b>general,</b> yielding a <b>valuation</b> <b>principle</b> for forward markets. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that a foreign cash flow's worth in local currency is identical to the value of the cash flow in local currency for which the Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to the foreign cash flow is the forward FX rate.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new <b>valuation</b> <b>principle</b> for {{possibly}} non-traded assets {{based on an}} implicit definition of a benchmark. The <b>valuation</b> <b>principle</b> allows taking (default and shortfall) risk constraints explicitly into account.

Furthermore, accounting for non-traded assets is considered and we derive a risk-adjusted balance sheet for non-deterministic cash streams.

This paper constructs a transformation on <b>valuation</b> <b>principles</b> by embedding {{them in a}} ¯nancial environment. Given an a priori valuation rule u, we de¯ne the associated a posteriori valuation rule h by an indi®erence argument: The u-value of optimally investing in the ¯nancial market alone should equal the u-value of ¯rst selling the payo ® at its h-value and then choosing an optimal investment strategy inclusive of the payo®.

Our contention is that the first decade following the initial harvesting of human {{embryonic stem}} cells (1998 - 2008) in the United States was characterized by institutional and policy responses that created a non-deliberative environment that hindered the process of instrumental valuation of stem cell research. This paper concludes that the current conditions of limited corporate involvement are favorable toward a democratic discussion of the legitimacy of stem cell research, but this will require overt challenges to political elites' attempts to control the creation and flow of instrumental knowledge on stem cell research. instrumental <b>valuation</b> <b>principle,</b> stem cell research, institutionalism, democratic justice,...|$|R
