40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work was to verify the {{historic}} data of historic artificial water reservoir Ottergrund, Banská Štiavnica district, which is inscribed in the UNESCO world heritage list. Main focus was set to area-storage capacity curve. There is historic map with the display of reservoir bottom contours and area-storage capacity curve in a paper format. These data were analysed and compared {{with the results of}} the calculation of area-storage capacity curve that was performed {{with the use of a}} new tool with named “ASC_Curve”, which is based on Python script. This tool utilizes ArcPy site package and it works with the TIN model of water reservoir bottom. In case of water reservoir Ottergrund we created the TIN model of the historic bottom; input data for the TIN model creation was the historic contour plan. The results of the analysis have shown that the storage capacity calculated with the use of the developed ASC_Curve tool is 97 % of the volume mentioned in the historic map. Analysis has also show the minor mathematical errors in the calculations of the area-storage capacity data in historic contour plan. This tool can also be used also for the analysis of the current storage capacity conditions of the water reservoirs, if the surveying with <b>echosounding</b> <b>equipment</b> is performed to obtain the data to produce the TIN model of the water reservoir bottom...|$|E

However, "sustainable mining” and the mitigation of social and environmental impacts remains an elusive goal. Numerous studies have documented how terrestrial mining industries disenfranchise and endanger local communities and destroy ecosystems. This paper tracks “sustainability” into seabed mining, a nascent, boutique mining industry which has garnered increasing commercial and political attention in part because corporate scientists represent seabed mining as a benign and profitable alternative to terrestrial mining. Empirically grounded in three months of participant observation on a Nautilus Minerals exploratory vessel in the Solomon Islands, I use actor network theory and critical discourse analysis to investigate how corporate scientists and technicians on the ship saw sustainability as a natural feature of seabed mining extraction aside from {{corporate social responsibility}} programs. The scientists used remote sensing oceanographic devices, <b>echosounding</b> <b>equipment,</b> mapmaking software, and cameras to see the seabed at the mining sites as lifeless and empty and to render the ocean invisible and unproblematic, and drew on a rich range of agricultural and pillaging metaphors and comparisons with other disastrous mining projects to reveal sustainability as a relational quality of seabed mining. Visualizing the extraction regime as sustainable is a new strategy seabed mining companies use to co-opt NGO criticisms. This work raises important questions about the limits of sustainable development and technnoscientific vision and the future relationship between telemining projects and environmental and indigenous rights groups...|$|E
