40|$|The dorsal (posterior) root {{ganglion}} is {{a relatively}} neglected part {{of the nervous system}} from the clinical point of view. In recent studies on the pathophysiology of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the main animal model of multiple sclerosis, the DRG of the rabbit was shown to be the site of extensive inflammation and demyelination and of focal conduction block in a high proportion of the large diameter afferents. The resulting severe <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> deafferentation accounts for the postural disturbance, hypotonia, ataxia and areflexia in rabbits with EAE. The vulnerability of the DRG is due to a deficient blood-nerve barrier and possibly also to a susceptibility of the branch point of the ganglion neurone to demyelination-induced conduction block. These and other studies in experimental animals suggest that in man the DRG may be a preferential (but neglected) site of focal structural and functional abnormalities in inflammatory and also other neurological diseases...|$|R

A candidate human TCR delta complementary DNA clone (IDP 2 O- 240 / 38), reported in a companion paper, was isolated by the subtractive library approach from a TCR gamma delta cell line.

Among the four sponge classes, Homoscleromorpha is notably the only sponge group to possess morphologically distinct basement membrane and specialized cell-junctions, and is therefore considered to possess true epithelia. The consequence of this peculiar organization is the predominance of epithelial morphogenesis during ontogenesis of these sponges. In this work we reveal the underlying cellular mecha-nisms used during morphogenesis accompanying ectosome regeneration in the homoscler-omorph sponge model: Oscarella lobularis. We identified three main sources of novel exopinacoderm during the processes of its regeneration and the restoration of <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> parts of the aquiferous system inO. lobularis: (1) intact exopinacoderm surround-ing the wound surface, (2) the endopinacoderm from peripheral exhalant and inhalant canals, and (3) the intact choanoderm found on the wound surface.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that collateral sprouting could occur from intact axons in an undamaged sciatic nerve was {{studied in the}} rat by suturing either a 7 -day predegenerated or a fresh nerve segment in an end-to-side fashion to the sciatic nerve proper. Following a 14 - or 35 -day recovery period, the pinch reflex test {{was performed on the}} transplanted segment to demonstrate the presence of sensory axons. The majority of cases, using a predegenerated nerve segment but not a fresh segment, responded positively. Neurofilament staining and histological examination confirmed the presence of axons in the attached nerve segment. In another series of experiments, the proximal peroneal fascicle was ligated and cut. Following a 7 -day predegeneration period the distal stump was sutured end-to-side to the ipsilateral tibial fascicle. After 90 days, stimulation of the tibial nerve proximal to the attached site induced substantial contraction in both the native gastrocnemius muscle and the foreign tibialis anterior muscle. These findings suggest that collateral sprouting may occur from intact axons, perhaps induced by factors emanating from the attached nerve segment, and subsequently make <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> connections...|$|R
40|$|This study characterizes a {{monoclonal}} antibody (3 A 1), and partially characterizes the cell surface antigen and the <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> blood T cell subset that it defines. The 3 A 1 antigen is {{present on the}} surface of several human T cell lines (HSB- 2, CEM, MOLT- 4, and others) in various amounts but is absent from the T cell line YT 4 E and all human B cell lines tested. Immunoprecipitation of an HSB- 2 extract with 3 A 1 yielded one specific band with a molecular weight of approximately 40, 000 in the presence of reducing agent. With directly fluoresceinated 3 A 1 antibody, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that 85 % of peripheral blood E-rosette-positive T cells were positive for the 3 A 1 antigen. After E-rosette-positive cells had been separated into 3 A 1 + and 3 A 1 - cell suspensions, the 3 A 1 + cells helped autologous peripheral blood B cell suspensions toward pokeweed mitogen-driven proliferation and intracytoplasmic Ig production, whereas 3 A 1 -T cells did not. Further, addition of 3 A 1 - cells from some but not all normal subjects to cocultures of 3 A 1 + cells and B cells actively suppressed intracytoplasmic Ig production. However, the 3 A 1 +T cell subset could be activated by concanavalin A to maximally suppress B cell Ig synthesis in vitro. Thus, the 3 A 1 antibody defines a major <b>functional</b> subject of <b>peripheral</b> blood T cells and should provide a useful marker for the study of human T cell function...|$|R

This appears to be largely driven by factors that {{are different from those}} at play in the general population. Chronic HD {{patients are}} already primed by a large number of structural and <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> vascular and cardiac abnormalities to experience demand myocardial ischemia. Conventional HD is capable of inducing myocardial ischemia.

Although it is uncomfortable to consider that much of the observed disease burden in HD patients may be an artifact of current dialysis treatment regimes, understanding the role that conventional dialysis plays in the pathophysiology of cardiac injury in HD patients has the potential to provide us with additional dialysis, and non-dialysis, based novel therapeutic targets to reduce currently excessive rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality...|$|R

Superimposed on this {{is the impact of}} psychological stress on skin physiology and pathology. Here, we review the “brain–skin connection,” which may underlie inflammatory skin diseases triggered or aggravated by stress, and we summarize relevant general principles of skin neuroimmunology and neuroendocrinology. Specifically, we portray the skin and its appendages as both a prominent target of key stress mediators (such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, ACTH, cortisol, catecholamines, prolactin, substance P, and nerve growth factor) and a potent source of these prototypic, immunomodulatory mediators of the stress responses.

To cope with stress-induced oxidative damage, the skin and hair follicles also express melatonin, probably the most potent neuroendocrine antioxidant.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—There is {{a paucity}} of useful {{information}} {{on the level of}} visual disability suffered by glaucoma patients. The aims of this study were to determine and rank the frequency of self reported visual disability in daily tasks performed by glaucoma patients; to examine the interrelation between disabilities using factor analysis; to study the relation between perceived visual difficulty and a measure of the severity of visual field loss; to develop a glaucoma specific subgroup of questions; and examine the validity and reliability of this subgroup of questions.  METHODS— 63 glaucoma patients completed a questionnaire containing 62  questions covering 10  broad aspects of daily life activities using a five point answer scale. Patients were classified into three groups as having mild, moderate, and severe field loss {{on the basis of the}} perimetric results. The relation between a measure of the severity of visual field loss and subjective visual disability in the three groups was examined.  RESULTS—Using factor analysis, the most frequently reported problems were grouped into the following four categories: outdoor mobility, glare and lighting conditions and activities demanding <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> vision, household tasks, and personal care. These four factors accounted for 72 % of the variability in the patients' questionnaire responses. With increasing severity of binocular visual field loss there was an increase in the number of self reported visual problems. A loss of confidence in performing some routine daily tasks tended to precede self reported specific visual disabilities. The factor "glare and lighting and activities demanding <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> vision" was found to have a significant relation with a measure of visual field loss and was used to create a glaucoma specific subset of questions. Cronbach's α showed a high degree of reliability and internal consistency (α = 0. 96) in this glaucoma specific subset of questions. Furthermore, the validity of this new subset of questions was shown to be significant (r= 0. 037, p< 0. 05) for the correlation between a measure of the severity of binocular visual field loss and the mean score of the variables used in the glaucoma specific subgroup of questions.  CONCLUSIONS—Outcome measures and quality of life issues need to be addressed in glaucoma. This pilot study identified common problems encountered by patients which at the present time are not assessed in routine glaucoma care. It also identified a subgroup of questions that seems to be specific for glaucoma. Further research is required if a significant impact on the quality of life of glaucoma patients is to be achieved. ...|$|R

In {{spite of the}} severely reduced number of lymphocytes in Jak 3 -deficient mice, the differentiation profile of thymocytes was normal and mature T cells accumulated in the periphery with age. However, we found that self-reactive T cells were not deleted in the thymus and the peripheral tissues in Jak 3 -deficient mice. All peripheral T cells were in the activation state and thus were unable to be activated further, {{as demonstrated by the}} failure of eliciting Ca 2 � response upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. From the analysis of TCR-transgenic Jak 3 -deficient mice, only self-reactive T cells appeared to be in the activated state and anergic.

We assessed whether Pax 5 (-/-) pro-B cells that were also rendered deficient for the linker for activation of T cells (LAT), an adaptor essential for T cell receptor signaling, {{can be used for}} the rapid in vivo analysis of mutant forms of LAT. We showed that Pax 5 (-/-) Lat(-/-) pro-B cell lines can be infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing a LAT cDNA and sorted for the expression of LAT. When injected into Rag 1 (-/-) mice, they restore normal intrathymic T cell development and give rise to <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> T cells. Considering that the handling of Pax 5 (-/-) pro-B cell lines is easier than that of bone marrow hematopoietic precursors, we used them for the rapid functional analysis of a novel Lat allelic series. When compared to knock-in and transgenic approaches, a major advantage of our Pax 5 (-/-) pro-B cell-based experimental approach consists in the production of mice bearing a given mutation within 2 - 3 months. Therefore, it constitutes a powerful first-line screen for mutations worth fastidious knock-in approaches...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{decipher}} how graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects T cell production and homeostasis. In GVHD+ mice, thymic output was decreased fourfold relative to normal mice, but was sufficient to maintain a T cell repertoire with normal diversity in terms of Vβ usage. Lymphoid hypoplasia in GVHD+ mice was caused mainly by a lessened expansion of the peripheral postthymic T cell compartment. In 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, resident T cells in the spleen of GVHD+ mice showed a normal turnover rate (proliferation and half-life). When transferred into thymectomized GVHD− secondary hosts, T cells from GVHD+ mice expanded normally. In contrast, normal T cells failed to expand when injected into GVHD+ mice. Thus, the reduced size of the postthymic compartment in GVHD+ mice was not due to an intrinsic lymphocyte defect, but to an extrinsic microenvironment abnormality. We suggest that this extrinsic anomaly {{is consistent with a}} reduced number of <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> T cell niches. Therefore, our results show that GVHD-associated T cell hypoplasia is largely caused by a perturbed homeostasis of the peripheral compartment. Furthermore, they suggest that damage to the microenvironment of secondary lymphoid organs may represent an heretofore unrecognized cause of acquired T cell hypoplasia...|$|R

40|$|The {{emigration}} of labelled thymus {{cells in}} the pig was studied directly in blood draining the large right distal cervical lobe of the thymus after controlled labelling with FITC delivered through cannulated branches of a main thymic artery and vein by temporary ex vivo perfusion at body temperature. Roughly 1 % of thymic cells emigrated per day. Unlike most thymocytes, which are small, the size spectrum of thymic emigrants is slightly larger than that of typical blood lymphocytes. Surface-marker {{studies show that the}} surface phenotypes of the emigrants differ from both typical thymus and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Although the emigrants resemble thymocytes in the high proportion of strong rosettes formed with sheep red blood cells (RBC), they rosette poorly with pig red cells, particularly in the unenhanced saline test, in this respect behaving like blood lymphocytes. The peripheral T-cell subset bearing a Fc receptor is almost absent in thymus, but is well represented among the emigrants which thus resemble corticosteroid-resistant thymocytes in the pig. The large population of thymus-dependent Null lymphocytes in young pig blood apparently arise in thymus since they constitute 1 / 3 of emigrants, although only forming less than 10 % of thymus cells. This emigration of thymic cells is discussed in relation to its implications for the turnover of known <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> T-cell populations...|$|R

Acute cold hyperalgesia is a serious side effect of oxaliplatin treatment. Although the therapeutic drug pregabalin is beneficial for preventing peripheral neuropathic pain by targeting the voltage-dependent calcium channel α 2 δ- 1 (Cavα 2 δ- 1) subunit, the effect of oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hypersensitivity is uncertain. To analyze {{the contribution of the}} Cavα 2 δ- 1 subunit to the development of oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hypersensitivity, Cavα 2 δ- 1 subunit expression in the rat spinal cord was analyzed after oxaliplatin treatment. Behavioral assessment using the acetone spray test showed that 6  mg/kg oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity 2 and 4 days later. Oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hypersensitivity 4 days after treatment was significantly inhibited by pregabalin (50  mg/kg, p. o.). Oxaliplatin (6  mg/kg, i. p.) treatment increased the expression level of Cavα 2 δ- 1 subunit mRNA and protein in the spinal cord 2 and 4 days after treatment. Immunohistochemistry showed that oxaliplatin increased Cavα 2 δ- 1 subunit protein expression in superficial layers of the spinal dorsal horn 2 and 4 days after treatment.

We assessed antigen presenting cell (APC) requirements for the latter differentiation. With added transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, both immature and mature populations of dendritic cells (DCs) induced antigen-specific Foxp 3 + T regs from Foxp 3 − precursors. Using endogenous TGF-β, DCs from gut-associated mesenteric lymph nodes were capable of differentiating Foxp 3 +T regs. Spleen DCs were 100 -fold more potent than DC-depleted APCs for the induction of T regs and required 10 -fold lower doses of peptide antigen. Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) was essential, but could be provided endogenously by T cells stimulated by DCs, but not other APCs. The required IL- 2 was induced by DCs that expressed CD 80 /CD 86 costimulatory molecules. The DC-induced Foxp 3 +T regs divided up to 6 times in 6 days and were comprised of CD 62 L and CD 103 positive and negative forms. The induced Foxp 3 +T regs exerted suppression in vitro and blocked tumor immunity in vivo.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of antigen receptors and the specificity it underlies are {{the hallmarks of}} the cellular arm of the adaptive immune system. T and B lymphocytes are indeed truly unique {{in their ability to}} generate receptors capable of recognising virtually any pathogen. It has been known for several decades that T lymphocytes recognise short peptides derived from degraded proteins that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Nonetheless, the molecular basis of this interaction is still a matter of debate, the central issue being the roles played by the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) in this context. In this study we have generated a transgenic mouse line lacking all three TCR-β chain CDR loops and a second line lacking the hypervariable CDR 3 loop only.

We have used lymphotoxin-α-deficient (LT-α−/−) mice, as well as LT-α-tumor necrosis factor-double-deficient (LT-α−/− TNF−/−) mice, to analyze the contributions of these related cytokines in both induction of trypanosomosis-associated immunopathology and infection control. Moreover, as the cytokine-deficient mice used have no detectable lymph nodes and lack germinal-center formation upon immune stimulation, we have analyzed the functional importance of both the lymph nodes and spleen during experimental Trypanosoma brucei infections. First, we show {{that the absence of}} LT-α does not significantly alter early trypanosomosis development or pathology but does result in better control of late-stage parasitemia levels and slightly prolonged survival. This increased survival of infected LT-α−/− mice coincides with the appearance of increased chronic-stage anti-trypanosome immunoglobulin M (IgM) -IgG 2 a serum titers that are generated in the absence of <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> lymphoid tissue and do not require germinal-center formation. Second, we show that splenectomized mice control their parasitemia to the same extent as fully immune-competent littermates. Finally, using LT-α−/− TNF−/− double-deficient mice, we show that in these mice T. brucei infections are very well controlled during the chronic infection stage and that infection-induced pathology is minimized. Together, these findings indicate that while increased IgM-IgG 2 a anti-trypanosome antibody titers (generated in the absence of LT-α, peripheral lymph nodes, and germinal-center formation) coincide with improved parasitemia control, it is TNF that has a major impact on trypanosomosis-associated immunopathology...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It is a <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> {{vascular}} disorder {{characterized by}} bluish discoloration {{of skin and}} mucous membrane due to diminished oxyhemoglobin. It {{may be due to}} central or local tissue oxygenation defects. It is a painful episodic disorder, where trophic changes and ulceration are very rare except in necrotizing variant. By definition, it refers to persistent abnormally deep blue or cyanotic discoloration of skin over extremities (hand and feet most commonly) due to decreased oxyhemoglobin. Etiology: It can be both primary and secondary to psychiatric, neurologic, autoimmune, infective, metabolic and other causes. The existing hypothesis suggests the prevailing role of vasospastic reaction over possible blood rheology impairment. [1] As per the current line of thinking, it is due to chronic vasospasm of small cutaneous arteries, and arterioles along with compensatory dilatation in the capillary and post capillary venules causes cyanosis and sweating. Clinical Features: Acrocyanosis is an uncommon condition. It usually presents with coolness and violaceous dusky discolorations of hands and less frequently the feet. Other peripheral part like ear, nose, lips and nipple can also be affected. [2] The changes may be transient after cold exposure but frequently persist during winter and even in summer. Management: There is no standard and curative medical or surgical treatment of acrocyanosis. In mild cases, it is unnecessary to give any drug treatment. Life style modification, dietary and hygiene counseling, avoidance of cold and reassurance that the bluish skin discoloration does not indicate any serious illness is all that is necessary...|$|R

Most (11 of 13) of the Thy 1 + and/or TL+ tumors, i. e., T-cell tumors, expressed high levels of either Ly 1 or Ly 2 antigen, but not both. Thus most thymic lymphocytic tumors expressed restricted Ly phenotypes comparable to phenotypes previously described for <b>functional</b> <b>peripheral</b> T cells. Because tumor phenotypes were stable over a number of transplant generations, they therefore appeared to be an intrinsic property of the specific tumors. The majority of the BALB/c lymphomas were Ly 1 - 2 + and also positive with anti-TL antiserum. This predominant phenotype on the BALB/c tumors may be related to either the mode of tumor induction or to the mouse strain, but since the restricted Ly pattern was observed both in BALB/c and AKR tumors, the phenotypic restriction itself is not a consequence of either of these factors. Tumor induction by ENU per se is not responsible for Ly or TL,ntigen expression since several non-T-cell BALB/ c tumors, also induced by ENU, did not express either Ly or TL antigens.

Results Here {{we describe the}} expression of PSA-NCAM (α- 2, 8 -linked polysialic acid modified NCAM) on <b>functional</b> adult <b>peripheral</b> blood natural killer cells and examine its possible role in masking Siglec- 7. Unmasking of Siglec- 7 using Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase massively reduces NK cell cytotoxicity. By contrast a specific removal of PSA using Endo-NF {{does not lead to}} a reduction of NK cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion The results presented here therefore indicate that PSA-NCAM is not involved in masking Siglec- 7...|$|R

Its diagnosis currently relies on history, physical examination and positive chromosome breakage tests. This study proposes a diagnostic strategy {{based on a}} combination of molecular and <b>functional</b> assays on <b>peripheral</b> blood and fibroblasts that allows early and accurate confirmation or rejection of Fanconi anemia diagnosis in patients with bone marrow failure...|$|R
