The {{conclave}} became deadlocked after Catholic monarchs opposed {{the election of}} Gregorio Barbarigo, who {{some members of the}} College of Cardinals also viewed as too strict. The conclave only ended in the July when cardinals started to become ill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> <b>and</b> after French cardinals agreed to vote for Pignatelli despite him coming from Spanish-controlled Naples.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers {{in the late nineteenth}} century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the heat}} of the battle, Major Carden lost his nerve and {{surrendered}} his command to one of his junior officers. This was a major turning point for the Americans. At one point, Capt. Rousselet of the Legion infantry led a charge and forced many Sumter's men back. Lack of ammunition made it impossible for Sumter to completely knock out the British. The battle raged for 3 hours without pause, causing many men to faint <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> thirst.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 1950, the Board of Transportation {{issued a}} report {{concerning}} the construction of bomb shelters in the subway system. Five deep stations in Washington Heights, including the 190th Street station, {{were considered to be}} ideal for being used as bomb-proof shelters. The program was expected to cost $104,000,000. These shelters were expected to provide limited protection against conventional bombs, while providing protection against shock waves and air blast, as well as <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> radiation from an atomic bomb. To become suitable as shelters, the stations would require water-supply facilities, first-aid rooms, and additional bathrooms.|$|E

25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book {{to be published in}} England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E

The music video for [...] "Land of Confusion", a song included on the band's 1986 album Invisible Touch, contained Spitting Image puppets of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and other notable individuals. David Lee Roth's self-titled video consisted of promotional clips created for his debut solo EP Crazy <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>and</b> album Eat 'Em and Smile. Jackson's video collection, which was certified gold in the United States, contained six promotional videos recorded for singles from her album Control.

2500|$|The {{stone is}} {{identified}} as a hearth stone; the nozzle of the bellows would be inserted into {{the hole in the}} front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> flame.

2500|$|The I2t {{rating is}} related to the amount of energy let through by the fuse element when it clears the {{electrical}} fault. This term is normally used in short circuit conditions and the values are used to perform co-ordination studies in electrical networks. I2t [...] parameters are provided by charts in manufacturer data sheets for each fuse family. [...] For coordination of fuse operation with upstream or downstream devices, both [...] melting I2t and clearing I2t are specified. The melting I2t is proportional to the amount of energy required to begin melting the fuse element. The clearing I2t is proportional to the total energy let through by the fuse when clearing a fault. The energy is mainly dependent on current and time for fuses as well as the available fault level and system voltage. Since the I2t rating of the fuse is proportional to the energy it lets through, it {{is a measure of the}} thermal damage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> magnetic forces that will be produced by a fault.|$|E
2500|$|Provence has {{a classic}} Mediterranean climate, with the [...] sea forming its {{southern}} border. Mild winters {{are followed by}} very warm summers with little rainfall. Sunshine is found in abundance in this region with the grapevines receiving more than 3,000 hours per year, twice the amount needed to ripen grapes fully. This abundance does have the adverse effect of potentially over ripening grapes if vineyard owners are not cautious. The strong mistral wind from the north provides positive and negative influences on the viticulture. While it can cool the grapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> dry the grapes after rain, providing some protection against rot and grape diseases, it can also damage vines that are not securely trained and protected by hillside landforms. In areas where the wind is particularly strong, the ideal vineyard locations are on hillsides facing south towards the sea, with the hill providing some shelter from the mistral's strength. In those areas, the type of grape varieties planted will {{also play a role}} since south-facing slopes receive the most sunshine and in the warm climate can easily over expose delicate and early ripening varieties which would be better suited on north-facing slopes.|$|E
2500|$|Within three minutes, the Greene Street {{stairway}} became unusable in both directions. Terrified employees crowded {{onto the}} single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect {{instead of the}} required third staircase. It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure {{which may have been}} broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly [...] to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that [...] "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture -- the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk". Even once firefighters arrived, their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the sixth to seventh floors.|$|E

He again was a semi-finalist in the men's 400 metres, but the Jamaican relay team performed poorly in the event final, failing to match their time <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>and</b> finishing in last place.
