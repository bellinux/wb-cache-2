The von Mises stresses are often used in finite element analyses due to their efficacy, as they allow for the combination of principal stresses into an equivalent stress that {{is comparable to the}} yield stress, hence giving a better chance of determining the failure of the system. It was observed that the displacement of the crown and the root were mainly affected by the material of <b>the</b> wire, <b>the</b> <b>bracket,</b> and <b>the</b> ligature. The strains induced at the PDL level were affected mainly by the wire material, with only minor influences of <b>the</b> adhesive, <b>the</b> <b>bracket,</b> and <b>the</b> ligature.

30|$|<b>The</b> {{conventional}} <b>bracket</b> demonstrated higher ARI {{scores than}} <b>the</b> precoated <b>bracket</b> system immediately after bonding and 24  h after bonding. In other words, <b>the</b> precoated <b>brackets</b> had less adhesive remaining after debonding. This is {{perhaps due to}} the fact that precoated brackets have a premeasured uniform layer of adhesive that is coated in a manner that leaves less adhesive after application, perhaps facilitating optimal application of <b>the</b> <b>brackets</b> to <b>the</b> tooth surface, minimizing adhesive quantity. It is also possible that this is a result of the uniform pressure applied in placing the adhesive on the mesh during machine precoating of <b>the</b> <b>bracket</b> during manufacturing, allowing better penetration of <b>the</b> <b>bracket</b> mesh.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> <b>bracket</b> ring is {{a ring of}} {{generalized}} determinants, called brackets, {{constructed on}} an arbitrary combinatorial geometry G. <b>The</b> <b>brackets</b> satisfy several familiar properties of determinants, including the syzygies, which are equivalent to Laplace's expansion by minors. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>bracket</b> ring is a universal coordinatization object for G in two senses. First, coordinatizations of G correspond to homomorphisms of the ring into fields, thus reducing the study of coordinatizations of G to {{the determination of the}} prime ideal structure of <b>the</b> <b>bracket</b> ring. Second, G has a coordinatization-like representation over its own bracket ring, which allows an interesting generalization rule. of some familiar results of linear algebra, including Cramer's An alternative form of the syzygies is then derived and applied to the problem of finding a standard form for any element of <b>the</b> <b>bracket</b> ring. we prove that several important Finally, relations between geometries, namely orthogonality, subgeometry, and contraction, are directly reflected in the structure of <b>the</b> <b>bracket</b> ring. 1.
