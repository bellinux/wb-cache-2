She seems to have inherited traits from both her parents, like her mother's [...] verbal tic and her father's aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge certain people, but she is not above commending them when they truly deserve it. Sarada is a central character of Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, searching for her estranged father while feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada felt hurt and betrayed when she suspects being Karins's biological child as the two wear similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> blood, Sarada later learns that Sakura is her biological mother as Karin explained that she was Sakura's midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her and promises to come home soon.

Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese. While in the English version, she is voiced by Laura Bailey in , and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances.|$|E
