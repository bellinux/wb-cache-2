25|$|SESSIONS: Well, I guess I'm {{concerned}} about your recollection, really, because it's {{not that long}} ago. It was an important issue. And that's troubling to me, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> too, Jack," [...] said Martha {{over the}} wire. [...] "Something I'm sure you'll {{be interested in}} hearing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Helen, {{and it has}} {{bothered me}} since Colonel Zane spoke of it to-night. Mordaunt is coming to Fort Henry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> my dear," [...] said Caleb in his hesitating way. [...] "No {{very good}} news; {{but then it}} might be worse." ...|$|R
500|$|Because of {{his time}} in the Senate, Gravel was invited to many of the early Democratic presidential debates. During the initial one at South Carolina State University on April 26, 2007, he {{suggested}} a bill requiring the president to withdraw from Iraq on pain of criminal penalties. He also advocated positions such as opposing preemptive nuclear war. He stated that the Iraq War had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the [...] "war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis." [...] Regarding his fellow candidates, he said, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> after standing up with them, some of these people frighten me – they frighten me." [...] Media stories said that Gravel was responsible for much of whatever [...] "heat" [...] and [...] "flashpoints" [...] had taken place. Gravel gained considerable publicity by shaking up the normally staid multiple-candidate format; The New York Times media critic said that what Gravel had done was [...] "steal a debate with outrageous, curmudgeonly statements." [...] The Internet was a benefit: a YouTube video of his responses in the debate was viewed more than 225,892 times, ranking seventeenth in most views for week and first among news and politics clips; his name became the fifteenth most searched-for in the blogosphere; and his website garnered more traffic than those of frontrunners Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or John Edwards. Gravel appeared on the popular Colbert Report on television on May 2, and his campaign and career were profiled in national publications such as Salon. Two wordless, Warholesque campaign videos, [...] "Rock" [...] and [...] "Fire", were released on YouTube in late May and became hits, and eventually gained over 760,000 and 185,000 views respectively. [...] "Rock," [...] in turn, was given airtime during an episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Some thirty-five years after he first achieved the national spotlight, he had found it again.|$|E
2500|$|After the crash, despite {{breaking}} his pelvis, Knievel addressed {{the audience and}} announced his retirement by stating, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen of this wonderful country, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that you are the}} last {{people in the world who}} will ever see me jump. Because I will never, ever, ever jump again. I'm through." [...] Near shock and not yielding to Frank Gifford's (of ABC's Wide World of Sports) plea to use a stretcher, Knievel walked off the Wembley pitch stating, [...] "I came in walking, I went out walking!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 November 2004, he {{announced}} he would not stand at the next general election {{and that he would}} retire from the House of Commons. On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being chairman of the works of art committee [...] [...] [...] because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to come, Ted," [...] she said, breathlessly, [...] "because to-morrow’s Wednesday. I’ve <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> but I don’t {{know whether}} I ought to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} yarn now, Shadow," [...] said Ben. [...] "I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that is more}} interesting than a story. It's about Nat Poole's uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} you was tellin' her. But I <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Mister Man. My wife's made up your bed too many times to suit me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. That's all right. But now, Isabel, there's {{something}} I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You'd find it out, and you'd better {{know it at}} once." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the telephone, {{he heard}} Claire's voice in an agitated, [...] "Milt! Meet me down-town, at the Imperial Motion Picture Theater, right away. Something I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I'll {{be in the}} lobby. Hurry!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Carbury and Henrietta {{had been}} {{nearly a month}} at Carbury, and Paul Montague had been there barely a week, when Roger Carbury thus spoke to the guest who had last arrived. 'I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something, Paul.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, mother," [...] the boy {{answered}} solemnly. Then after {{a moment}} he said, [...] "I <b>got</b> something <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> mother. But I don't know whether I hadn't better wait till morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sooz'n," [...] he said, [...] "de white folk is past my compre'nshin altogidder, an' I ha'n't <b>got</b> words <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how t'ankful I am dat you an' me {{was born}} black." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My Gawd, Jack!" [...] gasped Handy Oliver. [...] "You swore no {{one would}} pull a gun--an' here you've killed him yourself!... YOU'VE DOUBLE-CROSSED YOURSELF! An' if I die for it I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> Red wasn't lyin' then!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Alton. [...] "Still, I {{think they}} should, and, {{even if it}} hurts, I feel I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I'm sorry. If you would only take it, it would please me to give you back Carnaby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What if Mary {{should be}} {{standing}} at the keyhole, listening?" [...] said this elegant [...] "critter," [...] with the suspicion of a vulgar mind. [...] "I wouldn't have her hear what I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> for a mint of money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} bad between whiles," [...] said Herbert, wearily. [...] "And, while I can, I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that will}} make it up to you, and a great deal more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{after we}} {{separated}} this mawnin'," [...] returned Blinky. [...] "An' thet reminds me, pard, I've <b>got</b> somethin' <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> This fellar Hurd--or Mac New {{as you call}} him--has a pocketful of gold coin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> sir," [...] returned Jack, and as {{briefly as}} possible he narrated what had {{occurred on the}} lake and repeated what Coulter had told him. As he progressed Captain Putnam shook his head sadly.|$|R
60|$|This is all for {{now about}} homely Old Mr. Toad, because I have just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about another homely fellow,--Prickly Porky the Porcupine,--who carries a {{thousand}} little spears. The next book {{will tell you}} all about his adventures.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am not, I tell you. I jest got a clip on the nose, an' {{another one}} behind the ear; neither of 'em will do any harm. Now don't you get frightened; but I s'pose I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have. You {{know well}} all that I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I loved you before he ever saw you; {{and now that}} he has gone, I love you better than I ever did. Dear Lily!" [...] and he put out his hand to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say! I've <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> fellows," [...] puffed the fat boy {{as he came}} closer. [...] "I {{just saw}} that sneak of a Codfish coming from Fred's room. He looked awful sneakish, and I'm sure {{he was up to}} no good." ...|$|R

I suppose {{it will make}} you despise me, but I MUST confess it. Anne, there have been times this past winter and spring when I have HATED you." ...|$|E
60|$|This is curious; but it {{is nothing}} to what I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> next. Just as I was longing {{to take her to}} my bosom again as my friend and confidante, Elizabeth has disappeared. And, alas! alas! there is a reason for it which no {{sympathetic}} person can dispute.|$|E
6000|$|She {{spoke at}} last {{because she could}} put it off no longer, rather than because the right time had come. She began as they sat at breakfast.
