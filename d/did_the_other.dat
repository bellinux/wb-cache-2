5|$|In 1999 Estianty and Dhani {{agreed to}} {{establish}} a musical duo consisting of a singer and musician, based on concepts pioneered by international bands like Roxette and Savage Garden. Pinkan Mambo, a café singer, was chosen to be the second member of the newly formed group, named Ratu, meaning Queen. After three years of training, Ratu released its first album, Bersama (Together), in 2003, which was influenced by R. Maia wrote seven songs on the album, while Dhani <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three. The album was a commercial success, selling 250,000 copies.|$|E

Roberts Coles died (as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Confederate captain) during the Battle of Roanoke Island, February 8, 1862.|$|E
25|$|Thinking {{they had}} been cut off {{when they heard the}} gunfire from the road back to Hampton behind them, Duryée's men of the 5th New York Infantry withdrew from their {{advanced}} position and headed south {{to the sound of the}} guns, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Union troops from the Vermont and Massachusetts regiments under Lieutenant Colonel Washburn. Those troops were approaching Little Bethel in front of the site of the incident. The Union forces had lost the element of surprise for their attack and delayed the timing of it as well.|$|E
25|$|During {{his term}} of office, which lasted seven years, he crossed over to France (1733) in quest of recruits. Among those whom he brought {{back with him}} was the saintly Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau, massacred in 1736 at the Lake of the Woods, and Father Luc-François Nau. Mgr. Pierre-Herman Dosquet of Quebec {{returned}} at the same time, bringing with him three Sulpicians. The party sailed aboard the warship Rubis on May 29 and reached Quebec on August 16, after a distressing voyage of eighty days. Terrific winds and pestilential disease marked the long journey, and twenty people died.

25|$|Most of The Honeymooners {{took place}} in Ralph and Alice Kramden's small sparsely {{furnished}} two-room apartment. Other settings used in the show included the Gotham Bus Company depot, the Raccoon Lodge, a neighborhood pool parlor, a park bench where Ralph and Ed occasionally meet for lunch,and on occasion the Nortons' apartment (always noticeably better-furnished than the Kramdens'). Many episodes began with a shot of Alice in the apartment awaiting Ralph's arrival from work. Most episodes focused on Ralph' and Ed's characters, although Alice played a substantial role. Ed's wife, Trixie, played a smaller role in the series, and did not appear in every episode as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three. Each episode presented a self-contained story, which rarely carried over into a subsequent one. The show employed a number of standard sitcom clichés and plots, particularly those of jealousy, get-rich-quick schemes, and comic misunderstanding.|$|E
25|$|The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (WR) was the World War II women's {{branch of}} the United States Marine Corps Reserve. It was {{authorized}} by the U.S. Congress and {{signed into law by}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 30July 1942, yet the Marine Corps delayed the formation of the WR until 13February 1943. The law provided that members of the WR may be commissioned or enlisted in such ranks and ratings equal to the regular Marine Corps, and effective {{for the duration of the}} war plus six months. Its purpose was to release officers and men for combat and to replace them with women in shore stations. Ruth Cheney Streeter was appointed the first director of the WR. She was sworn in with the rank of major and later was promoted to a full colonel. After attending Bryn Mawr College, Streeter was involved in health and welfare work. The WR did not have an official nickname, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> World WarII women's military services, although many unofficial and uncomplimentary nicknames were used to describe the women.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, it was {{announced}} that Lipinski would be a commentator and analyst on NBC, NBC Sports, and Universal Sports during the Sochi Winter Games. As a result of positive reviews for the event, Lipinski and fellow analyst Johnny Weir were invited to appear as fashion commentators for Access Hollywood at the 86th Academy Awards with host Billy Bush. In September 2014, Lipinski and Weir were promoted to NBC's primary figure skating broadcasting team with Terry Gannon {{after more than a decade}} of Scott Hamilton, Sandra Bezic, and Tom Hammond at the helm. This promotion meant the B team of NBCSN from the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games will be commentating at every major skating event aired on NBC networks including the Grand Prix of Figure Skating: Skate America and the United States Figure Skating National Championships. Before the promotion, Lipinski, Weir, and Gannon only <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> five Grand Prix events and the Grand Prix Final, while Hamilton, Bezic, and Hammond got the bigger events like the National Championships.|$|E

25|$|Women were {{generally}} confined to underground {{roles in the}} French Resistance network. Lucie Aubrac, who {{has become a symbol}} of the French Resistance within France, never had a clearly defined role in the hierarchy of the movement, which in her case involved the regional Southern Liberation. Hélène Viannay, more highly educated than her husband Philippe Viannay, the founder of the Défense de la France, did not write one single article for the clandestine newspaper of the same name, nor <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> companions of the chiefs of the Défense de la France, although they did take part in meetings to edit the newspaper. On the other hand, Suzanne Buisson, cofounder of the Comité d'action socialiste (CAS) was the treasurer until her arrest. Only one woman, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, was a head of a network (by leading the British to believe that the true head of the Alliance network was actually a man). No woman ever led a movement, or a maquis (guerilla group) or a Liberation Committee, none was installed as a Commissioner within the Provisional Government of the Republic of France or a Minister of the Liberation.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} remind you that every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|Most recent is a {{study done}} by Larsen, Pulkkinen, and Adams (2002) in which they looked at many {{different}} levels of childhood behavior and emotion and the correlation into adulthood agreeableness. In their first analyses, structure coefficients showed that childhood compliance, aggression, and self-control discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did activity versus passivity, constructiveness, and anxiety. In their second analyses, structure coefficients indicated that adulthood socialization and impulsivity discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did inhibition of aggression and anxiety. In linking childhood behavioral profiles to adulthood personality profiles, high-compliant, high-self-control, and low-aggressive children {{were most likely to}} become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. These children were more unlikely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults. Further, low-compliant, low-self-control, and high-aggressive children were likely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults and these children were unlikely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. In addition to this, children classified as low-compliance, low-self-control, low-aggression types and children classified as high-compliance, high-self-control, low-aggression types had a greater probability of becoming adults with high-agreeableness, high-socialization, high-impulsivity profiles. Looking at stability of agreeableness they found results that indicated that stable low agreeable individuals reported less career stability and more depression when compared with stable high agreeable individuals and low to high agreeable individuals. Further, stable high agreeable individuals reported lower levels of alcoholism than <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> groups and fewer arrests than did stable low agreeable individuals.|$|E

500|$|Sigma Alpha Mu was {{established}} at Dartmouth College in 1930 as the Sigma Upsilon {{chapter of the}} national fraternity. [...] At the time, the Sigma Alpha Mu national limited membership in the organization to Jewish men. [...] Sigma Alpha Mu placed more emphasis on the observances of Judaism than <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> predominantly Jewish fraternity on campus, Pi Lambda Phi, and had difficulty attracting the interest of most mainstream Jewish students on campus. [...] The Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1935, during the Great Depression.|$|E
500|$|The Court of Chancery originated, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> High Courts before 1875, in the Norman curia regis or King's Council, {{maintained}} by most early rulers of England after 1066. Under the feudal system, the Council {{was made up}} of the Monarch, the Great Officers of the Crown and anyone else the Monarch allowed to attend. Its jurisdiction was virtually unlimited, with executive, judicial and legislative functions. This large body contained lawyers, peers, and members of the Church, many of whom lived far from London. It soon became apparent that it was too unwieldy to deal with the nation's day-to-day business. As a result, a smaller curia was formed to deal with the regular business of the country, and this soon split into various courts: first the exchequer of pleas, to deal with finance, and then the Court of Common Pleas, to deal with [...] "common" [...] cases.|$|E
500|$|Patton's {{strategy}} with his army favored speed and aggressive offensive action, though his forces saw less opposition than <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three Allied field armies {{in the initial}} weeks of its advance. The Third Army typically employed forward scout units to determine enemy strength and positions. Self-propelled artillery moved with the spearhead units and was sited well forward, ready to engage protected German positions with indirect fire. Light aircraft such as the Piper L-4 Cub served as artillery spotters and provided airborne reconnaissance. Once located, the armored infantry would attack using tanks as infantry support. Other armored units would then break through enemy lines and exploit any subsequent breach, constantly pressuring withdrawing German forces {{to prevent them from}} regrouping and reforming a cohesive defensive line. The U.S. armor advanced using reconnaissance by fire, and the [...]50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun proved effective in this role, often flushing out and killing German panzerfaust teams waiting in ambush as well as breaking up German infantry assaults against the armored infantry.|$|E

500|$|Festival processions {{offered a}} chance for laymen to {{approach}} and perhaps even glimpse the cult image in its barque, and for them to receive portions of the god's food. Because the key rituals of any festival still took place within the temple, out of public sight, Egyptologist Anthony Spalinger has questioned whether the processions inspired genuine [...] "religious feelings" [...] or were simply seen as occasions for revelry. In any case, the oracular events during festivals provided an opportunity for people to receive responses from the normally isolated deities, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> varieties of oracle that developed late in Egyptian history. Temples eventually became a venue for yet another type of divine contact: dreams. The Egyptians saw dreaming {{as a means of}} communion with the divine realm, and by the Ptolemaic period many temples provided buildings for ritual incubation. People slept in these buildings in hopes of contacting the temple god. The petitioners often sought a magical solution to sickness or infertility, but at other times they simply sought an answer to a question, receiving the answer through a dream rather than an oracle.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} playing the second half against Wimbledon with ten men after the {{dismissal}} of Luzhny, Arsenal defeated their London rivals by three goals to one. Before the game away to Leeds United on 16 April 2000, both clubs observed a minute's silence to honour the two Leeds fans who were murdered in Istanbul. Wenger and his players then presented bouquets of flowers to their counterparts. Arsenal went ahead in the 21st minute – Henry beat defender Jonathan Woodgate for pace and scored his 20th goal of the season. Further goals by Keown, Kanu and Overmars resulted in a 4–0 win and lifted Arsenal above Leeds into third, with a better goal difference. Arsenal beat Watford and continued their strong finish to {{the season with a}} 1–0 win at Everton to move into second place. Wenger believed Manchester United, who retained their status as champions in April, had benefited from the league being [...] "organised" [...] in their favour: [...] "They had a winter break.

[...] Beach Thomas, however, received particular opprobrium. Paul Fussell, the historian, describes him as [...] "notoriously fatuous" [...] during the war period. Peter Stothard, editor of The Times between 1992 and 2002, describes him as [...] "a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent" [...] and believes that he may have been the inspiration for the character of William Boot in Evelyn Waugh's Scoop. John Simpson, a war correspondent, describes him as [...] "charming but unlovable" [...] and thinks that the troops despised Beach Thomas more than they <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the authorities while based in their headquarters.|$|E
