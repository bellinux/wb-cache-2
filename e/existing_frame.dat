60|$|Having {{sent his}} reply out to Mrs. Milroy's messenger, Allan paused in a {{momentary}} perplexity. He had {{an appointment with}} Miss Gwilt in the park for the next morning. It was absolutely necessary {{to let her know}} that he would be unable to keep it. She had forbidden him to write, and he had no chance that day of seeing her alone. In this difficulty, he determined to let the necessary intimation reach her through the medium of a message to the major, announcing his departure for London on business, and asking if he could be of service to any member of the family. Having thus removed the only obstacle to his freedom of action, Allan consulted the time-table, and found, to his disappointment, that there was a good hour to spare before it would be necessary to drive to the railway station. In his <b>existing</b> <b>frame</b> of mind he would infinitely have preferred starting for London in a violent hurry.|$|E
60|$|Had anybody {{told him}} {{beforehand}} {{that he would}} openly make this declaration at Madame Goesler's table, {{he would have said}} that of all things it was the most impossible. He would have declared that nothing would have induced him to speak of Violet Effingham in his <b>existing</b> <b>frame</b> of mind, and that he would have had his tongue cut out before he spoke of her as the promised bride of his rival. And now he had declared the whole truth of his own wretchedness and discomfiture. He was well aware that all of them there knew why he had fought the duel at Blankenberg;--all, that is, except perhaps Lord Fawn. And he felt as he made the statement as to Lord Chiltern that he blushed up to his forehead, and that his voice was strange, and that he was telling the tale of his own disgrace. But when the direct question had been asked him he had been unable to refrain from answering it directly. He had thought of turning it off with some jest or affectation of drollery, but had failed. At the moment he had been unable not to speak the truth.|$|E
60|$|Added to {{all this}} was a private rankling sore in regard to Goarly and Bearside. He had now learned nearly all the truth about Goarly, and had learned also that Bearside had known the whole when he had last visited that eminent lawyer's office. Goarly had deserted his {{supporters}} and had turned evidence against Scrobby, his partner in iniquity. That Goarly was a rascal the Senator had acknowledged. So far the general opinion down in Rufford had been correct. But he could get nobody to see,--or at any rate could get nobody to acknowledge,--that the rascality of Goarly had {{had nothing to do}} with the question as he had taken it up. The man's right to his own land,--his right to be protected from pheasants and foxes, from horses and hounds,--was not lessened by the fact that he was a poor ignorant squalid dishonest wretch. Mr. Gotobed had now received a bill from Bearside for £42 7s. 9d. for costs in the case, leaving after the deduction of £15 already paid a sum of £27 7s. 9d. stated to be still due. And this was accompanied by an intimation that as he, Mr. Gotobed, was a foreigner soon about to leave the country, Mr. Bearside must request that his claim might be settled quite at once. No one could be less likely than our Senator to leave a foreign country without paying his bills. He had quarrelled with Morton,--who also at this time was too ill to have given him much assistance. Though he had become acquainted with half Dillsborough, there was nobody there to whom he could apply. Thus he was driven to employ a London attorney, and the London attorney told him that he had better pay Bearside;--the Senator remembering at the time that he would also have to pay the London attorney for his advice. He gave this second lawyer authority to conclude the matter, and at last Bearside accepted £20. When the London attorney refused to take anything for his trouble, the Senator felt such conduct almost as an additional grievance. In his <b>existing</b> <b>frame</b> of mind he would sooner have expended a few more dollars than be driven to think well of anything connected with English law.|$|E

50|$|However, as the managers’ {{attention}} is drawn consistently to particular details and into certain frameworks, they eventually begin {{to believe that}} these are the only things that work and matter.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of synthesizing new video <b>frames</b> in an <b>existing</b> video, either {{in-between}} <b>existing</b> <b>frames</b> (interpolation), or subsequent to them (extrapolation). This problem is challenging because video appearance and motion can be highly complex. Traditional optical-flow-based solutions often fail where flow estimation is challenging, while newer neural-network-based methods that hallucinate pixel values directly often produce blurry results. We combine the advantages of these two methods by training a deep network that learns to synthesize video frames by flowing pixel values from existing ones, which we call deep voxel flow. Our method requires no human supervision, and any video can be used as training data by dropping, and then learning to predict, <b>existing</b> <b>frames.</b> The technique is efficient, and can be applied at any video resolution. We demonstrate that our method produces results that both quantitatively and qualitatively improve upon the state-of-the-art. Comment: To appear in ICCV 2017 as an oral paper.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the results of}} experimental tests and numerical simulations carried out on full scale reinforced concrete (RC) <b>existing</b> <b>frames</b> retrofitted with buckling restrained braces (BRBs). Experimental tests were performed on two sample full scale RC building structures designed for gravity loads only. Such frames were subjected to cyclic pushovers to investigate their structural performance under earthquake ground motions. The results of the experimental tests show the efficiency of using BRBs to retrofit RC frames designed for gravity loads only. Such results were also confirmed by comprehensive non linear static and response history analyses carried out on an <b>existing</b> RC school <b>framed</b> building designed for gravity loads only and retrofitted with BRBs similar to those adopted for the tested full-scale frame. In such sample building the BRBs are placed along {{the perimeter of the}} <b>existing</b> <b>frames</b> to minimize the interruption of the functionality of the school and for easy of maintenance in the aftermath of major earthquake ground motions. The seismic performance assessment of the retrofitted structural system is illustrated in a detailed manner. Local and global response quantities are presented. The cost-effectiveness of the adopted retrofitting scheme is emphasised and further needs for the application of BRBs are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to grasp the {{influence}} of the newsroom on frame-building processes. First, journalists’ own understanding of “frames” and “framing” is discussed. Second, from an academic interpretation of these concepts, journalists’ framing practices are studied. To this end an ethnographic study was conducted at two newsrooms, one in Belgium and one in the Netherlands. The findings reveal that while the noun “frame” is sporadically used as a tool, the verb “framing” is considered as something from which a journalist should refrain. This is explained by the associations journalists make with strategic framing from sources as well as by the newspapers’ explicit attempt to no longer view the world from a single ideological frame. It is argued that the studied newsrooms have replaced ideology by, respectively, a counterframing strategy that strives to disprove <b>existing</b> <b>frames</b> (deframing) and a narrative approach that, one the one hand, sharpens <b>existing</b> <b>frames</b> but, on the other hand, offer more opportunities to create alternative frames (reframing) for events. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Existing</b> <b>frames.</b> Abstract. The {{choice of}} {{available}} {{finite element modeling}} conventions of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings may influence significantly the predicted inelastic seismic performance during the evaluation of <b>existing</b> RC <b>frame</b> redesigns. The problem is investigated by analyzing al-ternative models of a typical <b>existing</b> five-story RC <b>frame</b> which has been designed for mod-erate seismicity, using past seismic provisions. Different inelastic finite element models of the structure are established, taking into account a range of practical and more detailed finite element idealizations that range from the widely adopted concentrated plasticity elements to the more complex distributed damage fiber elements, accounting or not for large deforma-tions, joint flexibility, bond or shear deterioration. Following static inelastic analysis, key performance global and local response indices (such as interstory drift and plastic rotations) which are adopted in Performance Based Design, are estimated, to quantify the uncertainty introduced strictly by the modeling conventions alone. It is concluded that key response indi...|$|R
50|$|De Tomaso himself decreed a 16-inch {{front wheel}} and new Lario-styling for the Le Mans 1000 Instead of {{redesigning}} the frame to incorporate a smaller front wheel, Guzzi simply fitted the smaller wheel into the <b>existing</b> <b>frame</b> (which {{was designed for}} an 18-inch wheel) without reconfiguring the geometry. Sturdier forks were fitted, as were smaller (270 mm) semi-floating front discs. The new bike was now physically {{much larger than the}} lean and low earlier Le Mans bikes, and performance was scarcely better than the Mark III predecessor. An 18-inch option became available in 1987. The Series 2 bikes included uprated Bitubo dampers and updated geometry. Most 1988 models were factory-fitted with the 18-inch wheel.|$|E

5000|$|Gary A. Klein {{and colleagues}} (Klein et al. 2006b) have {{presented}} {{a theory of}} sensemaking {{as a set of}} processes that is initiated when an individual or organization recognizes the inadequacy of their current understanding of events. Sensemaking is an active two-way process of fitting data into a frame (mental model) and fitting a frame around the data. Neither data nor frame comes first; data evoke frames and frames select and connect data. When there is no adequate fit, the data may be reconsidered or an <b>existing</b> <b>frame</b> may be revised. This description resembles the recognition-metacognition model (Cohen et al., 1996), which describes the metacognitive processes that are used by individuals to build, verify, and modify working models (or [...] "stories") in situational awareness to account for an unrecognised situation. Such notions also echo the processes of assimilation and accommodation in Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development (e.g., Piaget, 1972, 1977).|$|E
50|$|When the Bullis {{family first}} {{settled on the}} farm, it is {{believed}} that they lived in a small, one-story frame building that had been moved from a former Erie Canal work camp settlement located on the property near the canal {{to the site of the}} present frame ell on the west side of the main portion of the house. During the 1983 restoration, the east wall of the <b>existing</b> <b>frame</b> ell was removed, ~exposing the west wall of the cobblestone house. The outline of a one-story frame building was evident as large stones and rough mortar filled the space within the outline, indicating an inside wall; above the outline showed the finished cobblestone which was originally the outside wall of the main house. Construction of the main cobblestone house began in 1839 and was completed in 1842. It is believed that the family gathered small fieldstones on the farm for the construction. The solidification of the mortar was a much slower process than the hard, fast-drying Portland cement of today. Work on the enlargement of the Erie Canal was also in progress, and the mason working on the Bullis House may have also been a canal worker.|$|E
