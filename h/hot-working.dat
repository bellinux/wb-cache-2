Evaluation of processes controlling work hardening and occurring after deformation at 900 °C were identified by microstructure observations of the specimens solution heat-treated after plastic deformation to a true strain equal 0. 23, 0. 50 and 0. 91.

A two-site mean field model including both dynamic and post-dynamic evolution was used to predict the recrystallized fraction, the average grain size and the stress–strain curves in different thermomechanical conditions...|$|E

40|$|The <b>hot-working</b> {{characteristics}} of Zircaloy- 2 {{have been studied}} in the temperature range of 650 to 950 °C and in the strain-rate range of 10 − 3 to 102 s− 1 using power dissipation maps which describe the variation of the efficiency of power dissipation, η = 2 m /(m + 1) where m is the strain-rate sensitivity of flow stress. The individual domains exhibited by the map have been interpreted and validated by detailed metallographic investigations. Dynamic recrystallization occurs in the temperature range of 730 to 830 °C and in the strain-rate range of 10 − 2 to 2 s− 1. The peak efficiency occurs at 800 °C and 0. 1 s− 1 which may be considered as the optimum <b>hot-working</b> parameters in the α-phase field of Zircaloy- 2. Superplastic behaviour, characterized by a high efficiency of power dissipation is observed at temperatures greater than 860 °C and at strain rates lower than 10 − 2 s− 1. When deformed at 650 °C and 10 − 3 s− 1, the primary restoration mechanism is dynamic recovery, while at rates higher than 2 s− 1, the material exhibits microstructural instabilities {{in the form of}} localized shear bands...|$|E
40|$|New {{high-performance}} engine concepts for aerospace and automotive application {{enforce the}} development of lightweight intermetallic γ-TiAl based alloys with increased high-temperature capability above 750 °C. Besides an increased creep resistance, the alloy system must exhibit sufficient hot-workability. However, the majority of current high-creep resistant γ-TiAl based alloys suffer from poor workability, whereby grain refinement and microstructure control during <b>hot-working</b> are key factors to ensure a final microstructure with sufficient ductility and tolerance against brittle failure below the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature. Therefore, a new and advanced β-solidifying γ-TiAl based alloy, a so-called TNM alloy with a composition of Ti– 43 Al– 4 Nb– 1 Mo– 0. 1 B (at%) and minor additions of C and Si, is investigated by means of uniaxial compressive hot-deformation tests performed with a Gleeble 3500 simulator within a temperature range of 1150 – 1300 °C and a strain rate regime of 0. 005 – 0. 5 s− 1 up to a true deformation of 0. 9. The occurring mechanisms during <b>hot-working</b> were decoded by ensuing constitutive modeling of the flow curves by a novel phase field region-specific surface fitting approach via a hyperbolic-sine law {{as well as by}} evaluation through processing maps combined with microstructural post-analysis to determine a safe <b>hot-working</b> window of the refined TNM alloy. Complementary, in situ high energy X-ray diffraction experiments in combination with an adapted quenching and deformation dilatometer were conducted for a deeper insight about the deformation behavior of the alloy, i. e. phase fractions and texture evolution as well as temperature uncertainties arising during isothermal and non-isothermal compression. It was found that the presence of β-phase and the contribution of particle stimulated nucleation of ζ-Ti 5 Si 3 silicides and h-type carbides Ti 2 AlC enhance the dynamic recrystallization behavior during deformation within the (α+β) phase field region, leading to refined and nearly texture-free α/α 2 -grains. In conclusion, robust deformation parameters for the refinement of critical microstructural defects could be defined for the investigated multi-phase γ-TiAl based alloy...|$|E
