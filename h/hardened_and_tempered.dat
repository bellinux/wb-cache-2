25|$|Around the 10th century, {{the use of}} {{properly}} quenched <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steel {{started to}} become much more common than in previous periods. The Frankish 'Ulfberht' blades (the name of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high quality. Charles the Bald tried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by Vikings in raids against the Franks.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered.</b> The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E
2500|$|... (3) In machine {{engraving}} {{the pattern}} is impressed in the roller by a small cylindrical mill on which {{the pattern is}} in relief. It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly polished soft steel roller, usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according {{to the size of}} the repeat with which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened steel cylinder is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered,</b> when it is ready for use. In size it may be either exactly like the die or its circumferential measurement may be any multiple of that of the latter according to circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{most people}} cannot {{determine}} if steel has undergone the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process by simply looking at it, {{there is a}} reliable and simple test. When examining a piece of steel, obtain a hand file and file an edge of the selected metal. If the piece of steel has not undergone the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process, the metal file should easily 'bite' into the sample. If the metal has been hardened, the file fails to cut into the sample and glances off with little visible effect.|$|R

60|$|He {{stood at}} attention, with a sparkle in his eyes, as the hot and dusty men went by. They were, {{for the most}} part, young men, newly raised infantry, now being <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> until they were fit {{to be used as}} the army's spear-head in some desperate thrust for which {{engineers}} and artillery had cleared the way. It was some time before the first battalion crossed, but the long yellow line still ran back up the hillside to the spot at which it emerged from the deepening shade, and the next platoon took the bridge with unbroken step. It swayed and shook with a curious regular tremble as the feet came down; but there was no giving way of tie and stringer-beam, and Dick forgot the men who were passing, and thought of fastenings and stressed material.|$|E

5000|$|The {{addition}} of {{large amounts of}} nickel and chromium needed for corrosion resistance in stainless steels means that traditional <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> methods are not effective. However, precipitates of chromium, copper, or other elements can strengthen the steel by similar amounts in comparison to <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> The strength can be tailored by adjusting the annealing process, with lower initial temperatures resulting in higher strengths. The lower initial temperatures increase {{the driving force of}} nucleation. More driving force means more nucleation sites, and more sites means more places for dislocations to be disrupted while the finished part is in use.|$|R
50|$|Of course, the counterpunch had to {{be harder}} than the punch itself. This was {{accomplished}} by annealing (softening) the punch blank, <b>and</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> the counterpunch. Such a tool solved two issues, one technical and one aesthetic, that arose in punchcutting.|$|R
25|$|Bits {{made from}} {{high-carbon}} steel are more durable than low-carbon steel bits {{due to the}} properties conferred by <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> the material.

50|$|At {{temperatures}} below 1200 °C, {{a vacuum}} furnace {{is commonly used}} for the heat treatment of steel alloys. Many general heat treating applications involve the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> of a steel part to make it strong and tough through service. Hardening involves heating the steel to a predetermined temperature, then cooling it rapidly.|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of oxide dispersion strengthening (ODS) {{has been applied}} to precious metals, nickel, ferritic steels, aluminium alloys and superalloys. Conventional melt processing is unsuitable for ODS alloys and alternative methods are required to incorporate oxides or other particles into various base compositions. In this context, Callejo et al. 1 describe an alternative approach to introduce nanoparticles into molten steel, in this instance a <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> steel. Addition of nanoparticles through a novel technology that ensures safe handling, suitable for industrial applications, provides an as-hardened steel with properties close to those obtained in conventional steels following <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> Their approach has the potential to eliminate the tempering step with associated cost and energy savings, although further characterisation of the ODS material, e. g. of the impact properties, is required {{in the context of the}} applications envisaged.

50|$|The {{primary use}} of a centre is to ensure {{concentric}} work is produced; this allows the workpiece to be transferred between machining (or inspection) operations without any loss of accuracy. A part may be turned in a lathe, sent off for <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> <b>and</b> then ground between centers in a cylindrical grinder. The preservation of concentricity between the turning and grinding operations is crucial for quality work.|$|R
50|$|Originally, all tool bits {{were made}} of high carbon tool steels with the {{appropriate}} <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> Since the introductions of high-speed steel (HSS) (early years of the 20th century), sintered carbide (1930s), ceramic and diamond cutters, those materials have gradually replaced the earlier kinds of tool steel in almost all cutting applications. Most tool bits today are made of HSS, cobalt steel, or carbide.|$|R
50|$|The Iron Age is a {{cultural}} period from roughly 1200 BC to 50 BC with {{the widespread use of}} iron for tools and weapons. Iron is not much harder than bronze but by adding carbon iron becomes steel which was being produced after about 300 BC. Steel can be <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> producing a sharp, durable cutting edge. A new woodworking tool allowed by the use of steel is the hand-plane.|$|E
50|$|Cold chisels come in {{a variety}} of sizes, from fine {{engraving}} tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. Cold chisels are forged to shape and <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge. The head of the chisel is chamfered to slow down the formation of the mushroom shape caused by hammering and is left soft to withstand hammer blows.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{materials}} {{have been used}} for balance springs. Early on, steel was used, but without any hardening or tempering process applied; as a result, these springs would gradually weaken and the watch would start losing time. Some watchmakers, for example John Arnold, used gold, which avoids the problem of corrosion but retains the problem of gradual weakening. <b>Hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steel was first used by John Harrison and subsequently remained the material of choice until the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} and composition of the steel, it can be hardened or softened. To make steel harder, it must be heated to very high temperatures.
