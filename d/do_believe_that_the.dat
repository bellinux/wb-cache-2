Reconstructionists do not {{altogether}} reject innovation in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates {{about the nature of}} such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic Pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.|$|E

2500|$|Mahdi of Sunni and Mahdi of Shia are different. [...] Sunni Muslims do not {{consider}} the son of Hasan al-Askari to be the Mahdi nor to be in occultation.

Sunnis believe that the Mahdi {{has not yet been}} born, and therefore his true identity is known only to Allah. Aside from the Mahdi's precise genealogy, Sunnis accept many of the same Hadiths Shias accept about the predictions regarding the Mahdi's emergence, his acts, and his universal Caliphate. Sunnis also have a few more Mahdi hadiths which are not present in Shia collections. However, they disagree with the Shi'a regarding exactly who the Mahdi is.|$|E

2500|$|Pentecostals {{believe that}} the baptism with the Holy Spirit is {{available}} to all Christians. Repentance from sin and being born again are fundamental requirements to receive it. There must also be in the believer a deep conviction of needing more of God {{in his or her}} life, and a measure of consecration by which the believer yields himself or herself to the will of God. Citing instances in the Book of Acts where believers were Spirit baptized before they were baptized with water, most Pentecostals believe a Christian need not have been baptized in water to receive Spirit baptism. However, Pentecostals <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> biblical pattern is [...] "repentance, regeneration, water baptism, and then the baptism with the Holy Ghost". There are Pentecostal believers who have claimed to receive their baptism with the Holy Spirit while being water baptized.|$|E

Passing contributed to only 48 yards between both teams as the rainy conditions forced them to stick to the running game. Cannon gained 53 yards on nine carries as the game's leading rusher. The performance by LSU impressed the pollsters, who ranked the team fifteenth after being unranked prior to the game. Coach Dietzel said in the locker room after the game:"It was gratifying to score a victory over a team coached by a man that I respect as much as coach Neely.

2500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece, {{once again in}} The Guardian (April 1, 2009), Arundhati Roy made a plea for {{international}} attention to what she called a possible government-sponsored genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

She also mentioned that the [...] "Government of Sri Lanka {{is on the verge}} of committing what could end up being genocide" [...] and described the Sri Lankan IDP camps where Tamil civilians are being held as concentration camps. A Sri Lankan writer called Roy's remarks [...] "ill-informed and hypocritical" [...] and criticized her for [...] "whitewashing the atrocities of the LTTE". Roy has said of such accusations: [...] "I cannot admire those whose vision can only accommodate justice for their own and not for everybody. However I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> LTTE and its fetish for violence was cultured in the crucible of monstrous, racist, injustice that the Sri Lankan government and to a great extent Sinhala society visited on the Tamil people for decades." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rebbe Nachman never {{claimed that}} he was the Messiah.

Otherwise, this tzaddik lives and dies the same as any other holy man. Toward the end of his life, he said, [...] "My fire will burn until the coming of Mashiach" [...] — indicating that the Messiah had not yet arrived.

In November 2015, Sanders gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including {{its place in the}} policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B.

In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: [...] "I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down.

2500|$|There {{have also}} been studies {{as to whether or}} not the images on the dotaku have {{significant}} meanings. According to a researcher named Oba, each picture contains a hidden pictograph that can be deciphered through a phonetic reading. For example, a picture of a man shooting a deer can be read as [...] "iru ka" [...] (to shoot a deer), but when combined to form [...] "Iruka" [...] , the pictures refer to Soga no Iruka, which is a reference to the Soga Dynasty. Through several more readings, Oba discovered that the drawings [...] "contain references to precise persons, places, and events in Japanese prehistory" [...] as well as provided [...] "info of shapes of buildings, hunting customs, and other aspects of daily life", possibly left for future generations. However, due to a lack of concrete evidence, other researchers have deemed it improbable that the pictures are actually hidden pictographs; it is possible that the pictures are just pictures. Despite the lack of evidence, researchers <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pictures aren’t just casual pictures drawn for the sake of art, that there is some other meaning behind them.|$|E
2500|$|Arguing {{on behalf}} of the United States in support of the respondents, Elliot Schulder focused largely on matters of {{statutory}} interpretation rather than specific outcomes for Amy. When pressed by the justices regarding the educational standards required, he contended that the district court opinion went too far: [...] "the emphasis is not on potential or shortfall from potential, but on the making available to handicapped children the same opportunities that are available to non-handicapped children to benefit from the regular educational program that the state or local school authorities provide." [...] The justices brought up an issue Kuntz, for the petitioner, touched on: [...] "what's this court supposed to do? Independently make its own judgment or ... all I'm allowed to do is to decide whether the school acted arbitrarily?" [...] Essentially, should the court rule on whether aspects of the individual education program allow a handicapped child to reach their full potential or is the approval of an individual education program sufficient to satisfy the act. Schulder argues a middle ground: [...] "We don't think the court has to measure potential, but we <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court has to make an independent determination whether, in this particular case, for example, the plan as developed provides the child in question access to the same educational opportunity available to non-handicapped children." ...|$|E
