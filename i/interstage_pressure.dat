25|$|Various minor {{accessories}} {{are available}} to fit these hose connectors. These include <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> gauges, which are used to troubleshoot and tune the regulator (not for use underwater), noisemakers, used to attract attention underwater and on the surface, and valves for inflating tires and inflatable boat floats, making the air in a scuba cylinder available for other purposes.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that all the {{remaining}} gas is unobtainable from a cylinder; rather that the regulator will deliver some of it less efficiently than the designed work of breathing, and the rest only when the ambient pressure is reduced. In most regulator designs the diver will have to overcome a larger cracking pressure to open the demand valve, and flow rate will be reduced. These effects increase as the <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases. This can provide the diver with a warning that gas supply from that cylinder will immanently cease. However, in at least one regulator design, once the <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> has been sufficiently reduced, the inflatable second stage servo-valve will deflate and effectively lock open the demand valve, allowing the residual gas to escape until the cylinder pressure has dropped to approximately equal the ambient pressure, at which point flow will stop until the ambient pressure is reduced by ascending to shallower depth.|$|E
25|$|A {{value of}} 10 bar <b>interstage</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> plus ambient pressure is a suitable estimate for minimum functional pressure for most planning purposes. This value will {{vary with the}} depth, and a regulator that has stopped delivering breathing gas may deliver a little more gas as the ambient pressure decreases, allowing a few more breaths from the cylinder during ascent if the gas is used up during the dive. The amount of gas available in this way depends on the internal volume of the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E
25|$|Bailout supply {{pressure}} options: If the <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> for the bailout regulator {{is lower than}} the main {{supply pressure}}, the main supply will override the bailout gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because main supply is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than main supply pressure, the bailout gas will override the main gas supply if the valve is opened. This will result in the bailout gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason the bailout regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or tucked into the harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely to snag on anything.|$|E
25|$|If a {{regulator}} stage has {{an architecture}} that compensates {{for a change}} of upstream pressure on the moving parts of the valve so that a change in supply pressure does not affect the force required to open the valve, the stage is described as balanced. Upstream and downstream valves, first and second stages, and diaphragm and piston operation can be balanced or unbalanced, and a full description of a stage will specify which of all of these options apply. For example a regulator may have a balanced piston first stage with a balanced downstream second stage. Both balanced and unbalanced piston first stages are fairly common, but most diaphragm first stages are balanced. Balancing the first stage has a greater overall affect on thr performance of a regulator, as the variation in supply pressure from the cylinder is much greater than the variation in <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure,</b> even with an unbalanced first stage. However the second stage operates on very a small pressure differential and is more sensitive to variations in supply pressure. Most top range regulators have at least one balanced stage, {{but it is not clear}} that balancing both stages makes a noticeable difference to performance.|$|E
25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E

40|$|A two-spool {{turbojet}} engine was operated in the Lewis {{altitude wind tunnel}} to study the inception of compressor surge. In addition to the usual steady-state pressure and temperature measurements, the compressors were extensively instrumented with fast-response <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers. Thus {{it was possible to}} obtain maps for both compressors, pressure oscillations during rotating stall, effects of stall on efficiency, and stage-loading curves. In addition, with the transient measurements, it was possible to record interstage pressures and then compute stage performance during accelerations to the stall limit. Rotating stall was found to exist at low speeds in the outer spool. Although the stall arose from poor flow conditions at the inlet-stage blade tips, the low-energy air moved through the machine from the tip at the inlet to the outer spool to the hub at the inlet to the inner spool. This tip stall ultimately resulted in compressor surge in the mid-speed region, and necessitated inter-compressor air bleed. <b>Interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements during acceleration to the compressor stall limit indicated that rotating stall was not a necessary condition for compressor surge and that, at the critical stall point, the circumferential <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution was uniform. The exit-stage group of the inner spool was first t o stall; then, the stages upstream stalled in succession until the inlet stage of the outer spool was stalled. With a sufficiently high fuel rate, the process repeated with a cycle time of about 0. 1 second. It was possible to construct reproducible stage stall lines as a function of compressor speed from the stage stall points of several such compressor surges. This transient stall line was checked by computing the stall line from a steady-state stage-loading curve. Good agreement between the stage stall lines was obtained by these two methods...|$|E

40|$|The Rocketdyne Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) cryogenic, {{rocket engine}} system, high pressure, liquid {{hydrogen}} turbopump was designed with a two-stage, partial-admission axial turbine. The turbine is basically two single-stage, partial-admission, subsonic impulse stages designed so the kinetic energy leaving the first-stage rotor is discharged {{directly into the}} second-stage nozzle at nominal operation to minimize staging losses. Very little data were available in the literature {{for this type of}} turbine design. Therefore, it was decided to test a full-size model of the turbine design using ambient-temperature gaseous nitrogen as the working fluid. The tester design features a variable orientation second-stage nozzle to determine the optimum circumferential location for highest performance. The tester also features the capability to vary the nozzle arcs of admission and incorporates quartz windows to study the flowfield upstream of the second-stage nozzle using a laser velocimeter. The test operations will probe the efficiency and flow characteristics for three arcs of admission and the effects of second-stage nozzle circumferential orientations over wide ranges of speed and pressure ratios as well as the <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> distributions...|$|E

Therefore potentially dangerous leaks of propellants could develop. The Interstage leaks analysis addresses {{the concerns of}} localized mixing of hydrogen and oxygen gases to produce deflagration zones in the Interstage of the Ares I launch vehicle during First Stage operation. This report details the approach taken to accomplish the analysis. Specified leakage profiles and actual flammability results are not presented due to proprietary and security restrictions. The interior volume formed by the Interstage walls, bounding interfaces with the Upper and First Stages, and surrounding the J 2 -X engine was modeled using Loci-CHEM to assess the potential for flammable gas mixtures to develop during First Stage operations.

40|$|LecturePg. 111 - 122 Although turbocompressors {{have been}} designed, built, {{and used in}} {{increasingly}} stringent conditions for more than 80 years, the turbomachinery industry, like all comparable industries, can only design and manufacture its products {{within the realm of}} existing knowledge and foreseeable operating, engineering, and scientific parameters. As end users of turbocompressors continue to implement ever more complex and demanding assortments of processes and process variables into their operations (i. e., equipment efficiencies, higher pressures, and the like), previously unseen combinations of factors can create new and unpredictable forces and effects on equipment. These unpredictable forces may, at different times, cause destructive results in the end user's facility, such as in piping, valves, gauges, tanks, etc. It is possible for these forces, which may only exist under the unique circumstances present at the end user's site, occasionally to manifest themselves in the centrifugal compressor rotor. When this occurs, the rotors may exhibit such phenomena as rotordynamic excitation, less than anticipated aerothermal performance, or even a physical failure of a rotor or other component. When this unfortunate circumstance occurs, turbocompressor OEMs dedicated to both customer satisfaction and continued expansion of knowledge and technical responsiveness, will investigate (typically in cooperation with the end user) to determine, if possible, the full range of dynamics that may be occurring during process operation at the end user's site, so that the turbomachines can, if possible, be made to withstand the unforeseen forces. These efforts typically involve some combination of analytical studies and research testing; analytical work to provide a sound computational model, and testing to provide the data necessary to calibrate or bound the models. The test program and results described herein represent an OEMs and end user's efforts to identify the cause of repeated impeller failures in an offshore gas reinjection compressor. A machine identical to the field units was fully instrumented with aerodynamic and mechanical instrumentation (including radial and axial vibration probes, dynamic and static straingauges, dynamic pressure transducers, and other <b>interstage</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature instrumentation). The compressor was then tested at full load and full pressure on hydrocarbon gas at the OEMs facility. Descriptions of the instrumentation and test procedure are provided. Concurrently, analytical efforts were undertaken to help understand the aerodynamic forces that may be contributing to the failures. Results from both the testing and the computational studies are presented along with the conclusions derived from both efforts...|$|E
