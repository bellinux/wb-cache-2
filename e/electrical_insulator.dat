5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an <b>{{electrical}}</b> <b>insulator,</b> but diamond with boron added is {{an electrical}} conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor), {{allowing it to}} be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of electric charge {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E

25|$|Aluminium oxide is an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> {{used as a}} {{substrate}} (silicon on sapphire) for {{integrated circuits}} {{but also as a}} tunnel barrier for the fabrication of superconducting devices such as single electron transistors and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).|$|E
25|$|The inner {{membrane}} is freely permeable only to oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. It is {{much less}} permeable to ions and small molecules than the outer membrane, creating compartments by separating the matrix from the cytosolic environment. This compartmentalization is a necessary feature for metabolism. The inner mitochondrial membrane is both an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> and chemical barrier. Sophisticated ion transporters exist to allow speciﬁc molecules to cross this barrier. There are several antiport systems embedded in the inner membrane, allowing exchange of anions between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix.|$|E

25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator).</b> The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and even see the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E
25|$|A {{capacitor}} {{consists of}} two conductors separated by a non-conductive region. The non-conductive region can either be a vacuum or an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> material known as a dielectric. Examples of dielectric media are glass, air, paper, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors. A capacitor {{is assumed to be}} self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field. In SI units, a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{noticed that the}} {{elements}} in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron's are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, {{all of the other}} elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron's reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that all do have in common is having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> at room temperature, but a good conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.|$|E

25|$|Diamond is an {{extremely}} effective thermal conductor and usually an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator.</b> The former property is widely exploited {{in the use of}} an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. As most simulants are thermal insulators, the thermistor's heat will not be conducted. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. The only possible exception is moissanite, which has a thermal conductivity similar to diamond: older probes can be fooled by moissanite, but newer Thermal and Electrical Conductivity testers are sophisticated enough to differentiate the two materials.|$|E
500|$|Diamond {{is a good}} <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator,</b> {{having a}} {{resistivity}} of 100GΩ·m to 1EΩ·m (1011 to 1018 Ω·m). [...] Most natural blue diamonds are an exception and are semiconductors due to substitutional boron impurities replacing carbon atoms. [...] Natural blue or blue-gray diamonds, common for the Argyle diamond mine in Australia, are rich in hydrogen; these diamonds are not semiconductors and {{it is unclear whether}} hydrogen is actually responsible for their blue-gray color. Natural blue diamonds containing boron and synthetic diamonds doped with boron are p-type semiconductors. N-type diamond films are reproducibly synthesized by phosphorus doping during chemical vapor deposition. Diode p-n junctions and UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm) have been produced by sequential deposition of p-type (boron-doped) and n-type (phosphorus-doped) layers.|$|E
500|$|Helium has a valence of {{zero and}} is {{chemically}} unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> unless ionized. As {{with the other}} noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and [...] have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has {{a large number of}} band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.|$|E
50|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{were once}} {{commonly}} used <b>electrical</b> <b>insulators</b> and heat transfer agents. Their use {{has generally been}} phased out due to health concerns.

500|$|Boron nitride {{nanotubes}} were {{predicted in}} 1994 and experimentally discovered in 1995. They can be imagined as a rolled up sheet of h-boron nitride. Structurally, it {{is a close}} analog of the carbon nanotube, namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulator</b> with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology. In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure.CyNz Nanotubes to Pure BN Nanotubes | year = 2002 | author = Han, Wei-Qiang | journal = Applied Physics Letters | volume = 81 | page = 1110 | issue = 6 |bibcode = 2002ApPhL..81.1110H |display-authors=etal}} ...|$|E
