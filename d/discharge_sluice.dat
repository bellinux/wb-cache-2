40|$|The {{demand for}} large {{discharge}} sluices in Viet Nam is increasing as the constructions of small river barriers show their restrictions in flooding and salt intrusion protection. The main {{objective of this}} study is therefore to research an appropriate design for the sluice structure type that can be applied in Vung Tau Go Cong, which is the largest project of <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice</b> in Viet Nam so far. From the literature review, {{it can be seen that}} in the Netherlands, several units of sluice caisson have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only a single caisson is applied as small river barriers. It is to say that a large <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice</b> with several units of caisson has never been built so far. In contrast with this type of structure, most of discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been build according to the “pier structure type”. In the Netherlands piers and bottom slabs are normally placed on batter pile foundations. Meanwhile in Viet Nam, piers are often placed on vertical pile foundations and a bottom slab is replaced by supporting beams. Because of both “proven structure”- caisson and pier have their own strong and weak points, by combining the best features of these “proven technologies” of the Netherlands and Viet Nam; two appropriate structure types were designed and the critical concerns related to them were checked. It is concluded that the caisson and pier sluice structure are feasible solutions for the <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice</b> at Vung Tau Go cong. It can be also considered as an innovative structure for larger <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice.</b> Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM) Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of infrastructure and sea level rise cause the existing discharge {{capacity of the}} Stevin and Lorentz sluices at the Afsluitdijk to be insufficient. This thesis focuses {{on the design of}} a new discharge facility at the Afsluitdijk with the possibility to anticipate on the changing conditions at both the IJsselmeer and Wadden Sea. The system is schematised as a closed-off estuary system within a water storage model, based on the water balance equation and a wind model from SOBEK. In contrast to previous studies, this study takes extreme conditions into account instead of only the daily conditions. The water storage system depends on the following governing parameters: the wind setup, tidal movement, target water level, sea level rise, in- and outflow conditions, in which the sea level rise is used as the function parameter. Within this schematisation three normative design conditions are considered for the acceptable water level prolongation at the inner basin: (I) the maximum acceptable height, (II) an acceptable duration of the high water level event and (III) the target water level boundaries. By means of a general sea level rise computation, the analyses showed that during daily conditions the need for pumps is inevitable from a sea level rise of + 0. 25 m or more, because the daily discharge driven by gravity becomes limited. However, during extreme conditions discharge driven by gravity remains beneficial up to a sea level rise of + 1. 00 m. Pumping is the only option beyond this point. Two design options are considered to be feasible for the combination of discharge driven by pumps and gravity: the open <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice</b> and the venturi culvert. The open <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice</b> is capable of discharging large volumes via gravity. In combination with the four pumps within a vertical door, the complete tidal cycle is utilised to discharge water, resulting in the most economical design option. On the other hand, there is the discharge facility made up of venturi culverts equipped with large pumps, capable of pumping large volumes during negative head differences. In addition, this option is capable of pumping water during small positive head difference, resulting in a very efficient option to pump large volumes. However, this concept is more expensive compared to the open <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice.</b> Within this thesis the discharge facility is designed for the + 0. 85 m sea level rise scenario, based on the financial optimum composition. This optimal composition consists of twenty seven venturi culverts and twelve open discharge sluices. The total available pump capacity of the discharge facility is 1, 250 m 3 /s, with a maximum discharge capacity by gravity of 4, 000 m 3 /s. Consequently, the maximum energy consumption is 32 MW, equivalent to 32, 000 households and requires an investment of 8 ̆ 01. 4 billion. As a consequence of combining both design options, the discharge facility is capable of anticipating on small sea level rise variations without exceeding the tolerable limits. An insurmountable consequence of the design methodology is the overcapacity during daily circumstances. Only twelve of the twenty-seven pumps are required during daily conditions, the residual pumps are only required for the more extreme condition. The sensitivity analysis showed a possible reduction in pump capacity, due to small changes in the design conditions. These changes consist of: (I) an increase in acceptable water level duration, (II) an increase in summer target water level and (III) the possibility to allow temporary reduction of the target water level {{prior to the start of}} high inflow. The required discharge capacity by pumps decreases to 950 m 3 /s, a 25 % reduction compared to the initial design. Feasibility of a discharge facility, designed on the extreme conditions, is confirmed by means of the sensitivity analysis and endorses the strong relation between the required discharge capacity and the governing parameters of the water storage system.

40|$|In {{many cases}} the bottom around a {{structure}} that is exposed to current has to be protected by a mattress. The purpose of the mattress {{is to protect the}} soil besides the structure from erosion and scour, thus preserving the strength of the foundation of the structure. Examples are the bottom protection around bridge piers, along guide bunds and behind discharge sluices. At the edge of the bottom protection parallel to the current (e. g. along guide bunds) or at the trailing edge (e. g. behind <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice)</b> scourholes will be formed in the unprotected bed. The slopes of these scourholes may be so steep that local soil failure follows. In that case the mattress has to span the local depression caused by the slope failure and maintain its protective function (see Figure 2 - 1). The mattress should therefore be able to withstand the tension forces that build up in the fabric. In this report a sequence of models is proposed and verified to estimate the maximum force in a mattress spanning a local soil failure. The study was commisioned by CUR in Gouda as a contribution to the design of the guide bunds of the Jamuna Bridge. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|In the Mekong Delta Vietnam, the {{construction}} of sluices {{with the purpose of}} retaining fresh water and preventing salt water intrusion potentially plays a very important role. However, the structures constructed in small rivers according to local or traditional technology revealed many disadvantages related to the economical, evacuation and ecological conditions. Hence, the demand for large sluices in the larger rivers and estuaries is increasing. In the Netherlands, several units of sluice caissons have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only single caissons are applied as small river barriers. It is to be noted that a large <b>discharge</b> <b>sluice</b> with several caisson units has never been built so far in Vietnam or in the Netherlands. In contrast with this type of structure, most discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been built according to the "pier structure type".

Besides, the improvements and combination of the hydraulic automatic gates and caisson sluice are also considered. The final results show that they are feasible and innovative solutions for the sluices in the large estuary branches in the Mekong Delta Vietnam, which can be applied to discharge a large amount of water, prevent tidal penetration and retain fresh water.

40|$|The Netherlands {{is a low}} lying {{country with}} 2 / 3 of its area below sea level. The country is {{protected}} against the sea by an expanded water defence system consisting of dunes, dikes, dams and storm surge barriers. In the south western part, the province of Zeeland, the coastline was shortened by closing of many estuaries with closure dams during the decades after the 1953 storm surge disaster. Separated marine and fresh water systems were born. Also for safety reasons {{in the northern part}} of the country in the former Zuider Sea, a 32 km long closure dam was constructed in 1932 : the Afsluitdijk. This dam connects the provinces of North-Holland and Friesland and separates the salt Wadden Sea (an international protected wetland) from the lake IJsselmeer. Nowadays this lake is a very important fresh water reservoir, a source for the preparation of drinking water, which is fed by the river IJssel, a branch of the river Rhine. The surplus of fresh water is drained daily through two large <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> at low tides in the Wadden Sea. During high tides the sluices are closed preventing sea water to enter. Also during very dry summer periods the sluices remain closed for several weeks. It 2 ̆ 7 s obvious that this dam is an immense barrier for many migratory fish species. The adults of the strong anadromous counter current swimmers can hardly enter the fresh IJsselmeer due to the very high current velocities in the <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices,</b> already reached several minutes after opening. The anadromous juveniles, together with the katadromous adults are able to reach the Wadden Sea via the open <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices,</b> but during dry periods they have to wait several weeks which might be a problem. Flounder larvae and glass eel want to enter the fresh water at high tides floating in the flood stream (selective tidal transport). Also weak swimmers as smelts and sticklebacks normally use this water movement to enter inland water bodies. At the seaside, just behind the closed <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> huge amounts of fish are gathering, waiting to enter, attracted by the fresh water discharge flow during the previous ebb tide. But it is uncertain if fish are able to stay close to the <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> during the flushing period. And even if fish are able to resist this flow, it is very difficult to create an extra attraction flow in a fish way which can be competitive with the huge discharge flow. The European Water Framework Directive demands an improvement of the ecological quality of water systems. As a result many fish migration routes in The Netherlands have to be restored; also at the Afsluitdijk. This paper describes the ecological demands and design criteria for fish ways at this location as well as several possible solutions to eliminate this fish migration barrier...|$|R

40|$|Smelt Osmerus eperlanus has two {{different}} life history strategies in The Netherlands. The migrating population inhabits the Wadden Sea and spawns in freshwater areas. After {{the closure of}} the Afsluitdijk in 1932, part of the smelt population became landlocked. The fresh water smelt population has been in severe decline since 1990, and has strongly negatively impacted the numbers of piscivorous water birds relying on smelt as their main prey. The lakes that were formed after the dike closure, IJsselmeer and Markermeer have been assigned as Natura 2000 sites, based on their importance for (among others) piscivorous water birds. Because of the declining fresh water smelt population, the question arose whether this population is still supported by the diadromous population. Opportunities for exchange between fresh water and the sea are however limited to <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices.</b> The relationship between the diadromous and landlocked smelt population was analysed by means of otolith microchemistry. Our interpretation of otolith strontium ((88) Sr) patterns from smelt specimens collected in the fresh water area of Lake IJsselmeer and Markermeer, compared to those collected in the nearby marine environment, is that there is currently no evidence for a substantial contribution from the diadromous population to the spawning stock of the landlocked population...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the future}} {{development}} plan, <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> will be constructed at three main branches of Tien River to prevent salinity intrusion. To evaluate the consequences of these constructions to the Mekong Delta Estuaries, the empirical relationship between tidal prism and river cross-section is estimated in this study. It is found that the two open branches of Tien River will deepen by more than 10 meters when all three other branches are closed. Due to the need of land for agriculture and other economic sectors, sea dikes are always built close to the mangroves forest. Along the Southern Coast of Viet Nam there are many places where mangrove degradations and coastline erosions are observed {{on a large scale}} when sea dikes are built too close to the mangroves forests. Based on the relationship found for mangroves width and coastline evolution, it is concluded that the critical value of 300 to 400 meters of mangroves width is necessary for the stability of the East Coast of Viet Nam. Results from the SWAN model also show that mangroves {{have a significant effect on}} wave height attenuation only at cross-shore widths greater than 300 to 400 m and that an increase in width beyond 1000 m does not make much of difference.

40|$|The Rhine {{is one of}} {{the largest}} rivers on the European continent. It runs from Switzerland through Germany and the delta covers almost half of the area of the Netherlands. The river basin covers 185. 000 km 2. In early ages the river ended in the estuary ‘Zuiderzee’, an open, tidal estuary that {{provided}} habitat for many species of fish. The Zuiderzee was particularly famous for its rich fishery grounds. To prevent future flooding and to develop new agricultural polders the Zuiderzee was closed off and separated from the Wadden Sea in 1932 with a 32 km long dike, the ‘Afsluitdijk’. The dike served as a protection against storm floods and as salt levels gradually decreased this new lake ‘IJsselmeer’ transformed into a huge freshwater storage with significant economic benefits. On the downside, the gradual intertidal fresh-saltwater gradient disappeared, and so did many of the characteristic fish like smelt, houting, sea trout, sea lamprey, herring, alosa, anchovy, etc. The Afsluitdijk had become a barrier between salt and fresh and closed off one of the main doors for fish migration into the river Rhine. The current tidal <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> only open to release superfluous freshwater in the rainy season and most of the time water currents are too high to allow fish to migrate from sea into the lake and hence the rivers upstream of the lake. The negative effects on fish populations resulted in a strong decrease of fishery. Commercial fishermen had to adapt to the new situation and their fishery had to change gradually into freshwater fishery. But nowadays this freshwater fishery is decreasing as well. It is widely accepted that opening the door for fish will greatly improve local and migratory fish populations and both biologists and engineers have proposed several solutions in the past. The major challenge in design remains the fact that the inland lake needs to remain fresh at all times. This limits the possibilities for the ideal solution; an open connection with free tidal characteristics. In 2012 both economic and nature conservation stakeholders have launched the idea of the Fish Migration River, designed to break the barrier. The idea is to construct an artificial river connecting the tidal saltwater Wadden Sea with the freshwater IJsselmeer, with enough length to buffer the saltwater flowing in during high tide. Situated next to the main sluices, a working Fish Migration River can serve multiple goals. It facilitates the return of freshwater fish unintentionally flushed out by the <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices.</b> It opens the dike for a wide range of migratory fish, and provides them with a gradual habitat for physiological adaptation. Furthermore this location has an added value for recreational and education activities. A visitor center is included in the plan as well. The plan has received positive reactions by local, regional and national government and a feasibility study has resulted in a primarily design. For an optimized design further research is needed. It is essential to understand both (local) ecological demands of the fish and potential morphological effects on the Wadden Sea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Closing-off the estuary Zuiderzee with a 32 km dam (Afsluitdijk) {{had severe}} {{consequences}} for fish migration between Wadden Sea and rivers IJssel/Rhine and Vecht. Plans are proposed {{to build a}} large fish passage (‘Fish Migration River’) next to the <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> in the Afsluitdijk at Kornwerderzand. This passage of several km length is unique in also allowing incoming tide, thus facilitating fish using selective tidal transport. To come to an optimal design and placing of entrances that efficiently will attract diadromous fish, several {{studies were carried out}} in spring 2014 to study behaviour and abundance of migratory fish. The seaward side of the sluices were monitored with lift nets, mainly targeting flounder larvae, three-spined stickleback, smelt and glass eel. DIDSON observations were made to determine vertical distribution of fish. An acoustic telemetry experiment (18 VEMCO receivers) was carried out to study searching behaviour and passage success of sea lamprey, houting and sea trout. Abundance estimates for the different species varied from several tens to hundreds of millions. The spatial dynamics of small fishes in time in the Kornwerderzand discharge basin were large. Numbers of small fish in the discharge basin were high, but the highest concentrations occurred at different locations in time. Lower numbers of glass eels and sticklebacks after highwater than before upcoming tide are in accordance with Selective Tidal Transport, although smelt numbers were similar after high water, suggesting more active swimming behaviour. Telemetry data showed large dynamics and intensive searching of the whole discharge basin by the fish. Passage success of sea lamprey appeared to be limited to 12 - 25 %. In addition, substantial delay of sea lamprey migration was indicated. Passage success of houting and sea trout appeared to be larger than 50 %. In this, discharge events, tidal current, wind and active swimming all play a role...|$|R
50|$|Markerwaard is {{a planned}} fifth polder {{that has never}} been completed. It was {{intended}} to build a south-western polder, to be called the Markerwaard, at several times during the project, but other polders took precedence. Parts of it have been built; in 1941 it was decided to begin work on the first section of dike, but the German occupiers stopped construction that same year. This dike originated on Marken, the last of the IJsselmeer islands, and went north for some 2 km where it ends abruptly today. After World War II, the eastern polder was chosen as the next project, but Marken was not wholly ignored; on October 17, 1957 a 3.5 km long dike was closed, running south of the now former island to the North Holland mainland.When construction started in 1959 on a new dike it had not yet been decided whether this would be the northern dike of Southern Flevoland or the southern dike of the Markerwaard, but the choice eventually fell to the former and another chance for the Markerwaard had passed. A minor flood near Amsterdam in 1960 had demonstrated the danger a large IJsselmeer still presented. A further planned element of the Markerwaard was subsequently executed: a 28 km dike between Lelystad and Enkhuizen, including two complexes of locks and <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> at either end, was to split the IJsselmeer in two, with the largest portion (1250 km²) continuing as the IJsselmeer and the smaller lake (700 km²) being named the Markermeer.

The extended domain of the EFDC Continental Shelf Model (CSM) allows far-field hydrodynamic impact assessment of the Severn Barrage, pre- and post-enhancement, to demonstrate the importance of accurate hydraulic structure representation. The enhancements were found to significantly affect peak water levels in the Bristol Channel, reducing levels by nearly 1 m in some areas, and even affect predictions as far-field as the West Coast of Scotland, albeit to a far lesser extent. The model was tested for sensitivity to changes in the discharge coefficient, Cd, used in calculating <b>discharge</b> through <b>sluice</b> gates and turbines. It was found that the performance of the Severn Barrage is not sensitive to changes to the Cd value, and is mitigated through the continual, rather than instantaneous, discharge across the structure.

40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the <b>discharge</b> <b>sluices</b> and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.

The sluices are carried parallel to, and just inside of, these dykes. The <b>sluices</b> <b>discharge</b> their water-earth mixture at intervals, the water fanning out and flowing towards the central pool which is maintained at the desired level by discharge control. While flowing from the sluices, coarse material is deposited first and then finer material is deposited (fine material has a slower terminal velocity thus takes longer to settle, see Stoke's Law) as the flow velocity is reduced towards the center of the dam. This fine material forms an impervious core to the dam. The water flow must be well controlled at all times, otherwise the central section may be bridged by tongues of coarse material which would facilitate seepage through the dam later.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{measurements and}} observations {{in a laboratory}} channel, the hydrodynamic behaviour of the approaching flow {{and the amount of}} sediment entering a right-angled lateral intake in a diversion dam were investigated. The velocity field, both upstream of the intake in the main channel and in front of the intake in the sluiceway, were measured under various discharge combinations of the river, intake and sluice gate. In addition, velocity profiles both upstream and downstream of the intake and the amount of sediment entering it were measured. Analysis of the velocity data showed that the <b>discharge</b> of the <b>sluice</b> gate {{played an important role in}} determining the velocity profile and also the mechanism of sediment entry. All velocity profiles where the sluice gate was closed had an inflection point, where the flow direction changed, leading to a return velocity near the bed. The elevation of this point was a function of the intake discharge and approximately equal to the height of the entrance sill. Experimental observation showed that sediment entered the intake by a tornado-like vortex. The strength and frequency of the vortices depended on the intake and <b>sluice</b> gate <b>discharges.</b> Analysis of the sedimentation data showed that the amount of sediment entering the intake increased with increasing intake discharge. In addition, an increase in the <b>sluice</b> gate <b>discharge</b> caused an increase of sediment entry to the intake under the same intake discharge. M. E. Varaki, J. Farhoudi, D. Walke...|$|R
40|$|Impact {{assessment}} of sluice regulation on water quality {{is one of}} the crucial tasks in the present river management. However, research difficulties remain because of insufficient in situ data and numerous influencing factors in aquatic environments. The Huaidian Sluice, the main control sluice of the Shaying River, China, was selected for this study. Three field experimental programs were designed and carried out to analyze spatial and temporal variations in water quality parameters under various sluice regulation conditions and to explore the impacts of regulation mechanisms on water quality. Monitoring data were used to simulate water quality under different scenarios by the water quality analysis simulation program (WASP). Results demonstrate that the influences of sluice regulation on permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 -N) concentrations (indicators of water quality) were complex and nonlinear and presented different trends of increase or decrease from different regulation modes. Gate openings of different widths and different flow rates affected CODMn and NH 4 -N concentrations differently. Monitoring results and numerical simulation results indicate that the sluice opening should be small. Flow <b>discharge</b> through the <b>sluice</b> should be greater than 10 m(3) s and less than 60 m(3) s to maintain low CODMn concentrations, and discharge should be low (e. g., 14 m(3) s) to maintain low NH 4 -N concentrations. This research provides an experimental basis for further research on the construction of water quality models and for the development of reasonable regulations on water quality and quantity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} origin of {{observed}} current velocities at the Gemini offshore wind farm in 2015. Currents have been measured of 1. 2 m/s while, based upon tidal and storm predictions, currents of only 0. 7 m/s were expected. The aim {{of this research is}} to gain insight into {{the origin of}} these higher currents, taking into account the physical oceanography at this location. We find that these high currents measured in August are forced by baroclinic currents. Stratification was present at a measurement ship, 32 km northeast from Gemini. In addition, satellite imagery shows Gemini to be located in a region with fronts, between warm water from the Wadden Sea and colder water from the North Sea. In fact, a tidal mixing front is formed on top of the already established saline stratification [Van Aken, 1986]. The origin of fresh water is found to be from <b>sluices</b> <b>discharging</b> onto the Wadden Sea. Prior to the period with high currents a pulse of fresh water is discharged onto the Wadden Sea. Followed by the lowest winds recorded in 2015, an optimal climate is formed in which fronts can travel offshore. This is supported by the satellite imagery. In addition, density-induced currents are calculated based upon the mathematical model of Heaps [1972]. The analysis if the data suggests that density driven currents of 0. 4 m/s are generated in August, which combined with the tide can give 1. 2 m/s currents.

40|$|Introduction: Determination the {{hydraulic}} performance of an irrigation network requires adequate {{knowledge about the}} sensitivities of the network structures. Hydraulic sensitivity concept of structures and channel reaches aid network operators in identifying structures with higher sensitivities which will attract more attention both during network operation and maintenance program. Sluice gates are frequently used as regulator and delivery structures in irrigation networks. Usually <b>discharge</b> coefficient of <b>sluice</b> gate is considered constant {{in the design and}} operation stage. Investigation of sensitivity of offtakes and cross-regulators has carried out by various researchers and some hydraulic sensitivity indicators have been developed. In the previous researches, these indexes were developed based on constant coefficient of discharge for free flow sluice gates. However, the coefficient of discharge for free flow sluice gates depend on gate opening and the upstream water depth. So, in this research, some hydraulic sensitivity indicators at structure based on variable coefficient of discharge for free flow sluice gates were developed and they were validated by using observed data. Materials and Methods: An experimental setup was constructed to analyses the performance of the some hydraulic sensitivity. The flume was provided with storage reservoir, pumps, electromagnetic flowmeter, entrance tank, feeder canal, delivery canals, offtakes, cross-regulators, collector reservoir, piezometric boards. The flume is 60. 5 m long and the depth of that is 0. 25 m, of which only a small part close to offtake and Cross-regulators was needed for these tests. Offtakes and Cross-regulators are free-flowing sluice gates type. Offtakes were located at distances 20 m and 42. 5 m downstream from the entrance tank, respectively. and, Cross-regulators were located 2 m downstream from each offtakes. The offtakes are 0. 21 m and Cross-regulators are 0. 29 m wide. The upstream and downstream water levels at gates were measured with piezometer taps. There is a collector reservoir downstream of each delivery canal that was equipped with a 135 V-notch weir as a measuring device. The flow was provided by a pump having maximum capacity 35 lit/s, and was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter of 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Hydroelectric {{power is}} an {{important}} source of energy. This is particularly true for Quebec and some other provinces in Canada. In the event of a combination of power trip and wicket gate blockage, as an emergency response, it is necessary to close the intake gates in order to stop water flow through the penstock to the unit. Such emergency closure can cause air pressure inside the penstock chamber to drop so significantly that the safety risks to the power station structures and facilities become unacceptable. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop analysis methods for the assessment of air pressure drop in emergency closure. The scope of this research work covers the determination of the following time-dependent quantities: water <b>discharge</b> beneath a <b>sluice</b> gate, dry air flow through air vents leading to the penstock chamber, amount of air entrained by turbulent water motions through the penstock, and the resultant changes of air pressure in the penstock chamber. The analyses are based on the energy principle and take into account a large number of variables including the upstream and downstream water levels, the geometry of the hydraulic passage, the time rate of gate closing, and features of downstream control structures. The analysis methods are applied to two cases of emergency closure of power generating stations in Quebec. The results of calculated air demand and pressure drop are in good comparison with field measurements. Emergency closure is shown to produce two significant impacts on penstocks and air vents: 1) intensified water jet in the first half of the time period it takes to close the gate; and 2) pressure drop in the last one third of the time period. Air entrainment by high-velocity flowing water {{is an important}} cause of pressure drop in emergency closure, and can be modeled using hydraulic jump entrainment equations. The values of air pressure drop calculated for the Isle-Maligne and La Tuque stations are below one third of the standard atmospheric pressure. However, there are significant air pressure fluctuations. This study has contributed to the development of quantitative framework and calculation procedures that can easily be extended for applications to other sites. The development is of engineering relevance to upgrade of existing air vents and the design of new air vents and to safe operations of emergency closure...|$|R
