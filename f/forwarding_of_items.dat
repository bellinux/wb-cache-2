We put <b>forward</b> 5 categories <b>of</b> <b>items</b> that we believe should be discussed in any work concerning SME financing, being (a) the SME's personality, (b) {{the viability of the}} SME's business and/or its industry, (c) the SME's knowledge and competency, (d) the financial position of the SME, and (e) the level of detail and preparation of the loan application.

40|$|We {{consider}} the information filtering problem, {{in which we}} face a stream <b>of</b> <b>items,</b> and must decide which ones to forward to a user to maximize the number <b>of</b> relevant <b>items</b> shown, minus a penalty for each irrelevant item shown. Forwarding decisions are made separately in a per-sonalized way for each user.

Performing well in this setting requires trading exploration vs. exploitation, forwarding items that are likely to be irrelevant, to allow learning that will improve later performance. In a Bayesian setting, and using Markov decision processes, we show how the Bayes-optimal forward-ing algorithm can be computed efficiently when the user will examine each forwarded article, and how an upper bound on the Bayes-optimal procedure and a heuristic index policy can be obtained for the setting when the user will examine only a limited number <b>of</b> <b>forwarded</b> <b>items.</b> We present results from simulation experiments using parameters estimated using historical data from arXiv. org. ...|$|R
40|$|Sensor nodes are {{inherently}} unreliable {{and prone to}} hardware or software faults. Thus, they may report untrustwor- thy or inconsistent data. Assessing the trustworthiness <b>of</b> sensor data <b>items</b> can allow reliable sensing or monitoring of physical phenomena. A provenance-based trust framework can evaluate the trustworthiness <b>of</b> data <b>items</b> and sensor nodes based on the intuition that two data items with similar data values but with different provenance (i. e., forwarding path) can be considered more trustworthy. <b>Forwarding</b> paths <b>of</b> data <b>items</b> generated from redundantly deployed sensors should consist of trustworthy nodes and remain dissimilar. Unfortunately, operating many sensors with dissimilar paths consumes significant energy. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to identify a set of sensor nodes and their corresponding paths toward the base station that achieve a certain trustworthiness threshold, while keeping the energy consumption of the network minimal. We prove the NP-hardness of this problem and propose ERUPT, a simulated annealing solution. Testbed and simulation results show that ERUPT achieves high trustworthiness, while reducing total energy consumption by 32 - 50 % with respect to current approaches...|$|R
30|$|Stimulus {{presentation}} began through MediaLab v 2010 {{with the}} study title and instructions, followed by a 10 -second baseline period in which participants saw a university’s main website. After the baseline period, the MediaLab software presented a new screen with the instructions, including “Imagine that {{you are about to}} shop a pair of jeans. During the search of a new pair of jeans, you found other consumers’ comments on a specific seller of jeans as next.” After this screen, the first stimulus was presented in a random order. Participants were allowed to take as long as they wanted to read all the comments, and they were instructed to click a “continue” button when they were ready to move <b>forward.</b> A set <b>of</b> <b>items</b> measuring the participant’s perceived trust was presented. Participants used a keyboard and a mouse to select and click the answer. Once this task was done, participants clicked a “continue” button, and the next stimulus was presented. The MediaLab v 2010 program controlled stimulus presentation and randomized stimulus presentation order. Upon completion, we removed electrodes from participants, cleaned the skin, debriefed them, thanked them, handed over gift cards, and dismissed them.

40|$|Background Despite {{developments}} in {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} for bipolar disorder, {{little is known about}} the specific dysfunctional beliefs that may predispose individuals to mania. Therefore a measure was specifically designed for this purpose based on a cognitive approach. The measure is called the Hypomanic Attitudes and Positive Predictions Inventory (HAPPI). Method Fifty-six individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and 39 matched healthy controls completed a brief version of the HAPPI (Brief-HAPPI), the Internal State Scale, and the Hypomanic Interpretations Questionnaire (HIQ). Results The bipolar group scored higher on the overall Brief-HAPPI scale, higher on the <b>forward</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> the Brief-HAPPI, lower on the reverse items and no different on the filler items. The group differences in overall score remained when controlling for current self-reported symptoms of mania and depression, and recent history of hypomanic symptoms, yet within the bipolar group, Brief-HAPPI score was positively correlated with the level of symptoms. The Brief-HAPPI showed a sizeable correlation with the HIQ, yet each scale showed a significant and independent association with bipolar disorder. Conclusion The Brief-HAPPI assesses dysfunctional beliefs that are associated with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{several studies}} had their number final <b>of</b> <b>items</b> reduced {{by more than}} 50 %. For example, Flight et al.

Our findings clearly indicate that a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>items</b> can get lost during {{the development of a}} new scale. These results are consistent with previous literature which states both that the initial number <b>of</b> <b>items</b> must be twice the desired number in the final scale, since, during the process of analysis <b>of</b> the <b>items,</b> many may be excluded for inadequacy (Nunnally 1967), and that the initial set <b>of</b> <b>items</b> should be three or four times more numerous than the number <b>of</b> <b>items</b> desired, as a good way to ensure internal consistency of the scale (DeVellis 2003).

40|$|To {{increase}} the number <b>of</b> <b>items</b> available for adaptive testing and reduce the cost <b>of</b> <b>item</b> writing, the use <b>of</b> techniques <b>of</b> <b>item</b> cloning has been proposed. An important consequence <b>of</b> <b>item</b> cloning is possible variability between the item parameters. To deal with this variability, a multilevel item response (IRT) model is presented which allows for differences between the distributions <b>of</b> <b>item</b> parameters <b>of</b> families <b>of</b> <b>item</b> clones. A marginal maximum likelihood and a Bayesian procedure for estimating the hyperparameters are presented. In addition, an item-selection procedure for computerized adaptive testing with item cloning is presented which has the following two stages: First, a family <b>of</b> <b>item</b> clones is selected to be optimal at the estimate of the person parameter. Second, an item is randomly selected from the family for administration.

40|$|This study {{consists}} of three main projects covering (i) the relationship between disclosure quality and earnings management and (ii) the relationship between corporate governance and disclosure quality. Disclosure quality is measures using the IR Magazine Award, the forward looking information in the annual report, and the analyst forecast accuracy. Match-paired samples comprised of the winners and non-winners of the IR Magazine Award during the years from 2005 - 2008 were employed in this study. Simultaneity bias in all projects was remedied {{by the use of}} a simultaneous system of equation, which was estimated using two-stage least square regression (2 SLS). This study provides several interesting findings. With regard to the first project, disclosure quality and earnings management, it is shown that all disclosure quality proxies are consistently reported significant negative relationship with earnings management in the OLS regression. However, audit committee characteristics and board characteristics reveal insignificant relationship with earnings management, except audit committee meeting which reported positive association. Concerning the potential complementary and substitutive effect of internal governance and disclosure quality in deterring earnings management, result of the interaction terms revealed that there is a complementary relationship between audit committee quality and disclosure quality (measured using Investor Relation Magazine Award) in deterring earnings management. When disclosure quality and earnings management are treated as endogenous, this study reveals that there is a significant bi-directional relationship between disclosure quality and earnings management, highlighting that causality can run in both directions. This suggests that future research should control for disclosure quality factors when examining the impact of corporate governance and earnings management and that the potential simultaneity between disclosure quality and earnings management should be considered in future models. With respect to the second project, corporate governance and disclosure quality, this study reveals that audit committee effectiveness, board meeting and board independent are significantly positively related to disclosure quality (measured using IR Magazine Award and the number <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> looking <b>items</b> in the annual report). With regard to the potential complementary or substitutive effect between board and audit committee characteristics in improving firm disclosure quality, this study reveal that there is a substitutive effect between board quality and audit quality in enhancing disclosure quality (measured using analyst forecast accuracy). If disclosure quality and board independence are treated as endogenous, there is a significant positive bi-directional relationship between them when disclosure quality is measured using the number <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> looking <b>items.</b> However, there is a negative bi-directional relationship and an insignificant bi-directional relationship shown when disclosure quality is measured using analyst forecast accuracy and the IR Magazine Award respectively. ...|$|R
