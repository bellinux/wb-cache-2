25|$|Yugo 45 {{derivative}} {{models have}} included the Yugo 55, 60, 65, Koral, Ciao, Tempo, Cabrio, GV, GV Plus, GVX, and GVL. Yugo engines were fitted with a carburetor {{until well into the}} 1980s before fuel-injected models (starting with the Koral 65) were introduced beginning with the GVX-EFI (an <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system),</b> which featured a 1300 cc engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{the diesel}} engine was {{enlarged}} to 1.8L, whilst the entry level 1.1L and 1.3L models were updated with the redesigned HCS {{version of the}} Kent/Valencia family introduced for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point fuel injection system replaced the carburettor on models with the 1.4L engine.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Red Triangle {{negotiated}} the legal {{transfer of the}} Alvis car trademarks. The following year, the company announced that the 4.3 Litre Short Chassis tourer would once again be available. All Alvis' records remain intact at the company’s Kenilworth headquarters along with a large stock of period parts. One of the men to have worked on the very last Alvis car produced in 1967 is still retained by Red Triangle in a training capacity. Built to the original plans, the new car has been named the [...] "Continuation Series", to reflect the 73-year interruption in its production between 1937 and 2010. It differs only in detail from the pre-war examples: for emissions, the engine is governed by an <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> with electronic ignition, brakes are hydraulic rather than cable, the steering column collapsible and the rear light arrangement reconfigured to conform to modern standards.|$|E
50|$|Modern digital <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> {{optimize}} these competing objectives {{more effectively}} and consistently than earlier fuel delivery systems (such as carburetors). Carburetors {{have the potential}} to atomize fuel better (see Pogue and Allen Caggiano patents).|$|R
50|$|Some latter {{versions}} of this 350 were produced with an analog <b>electronic</b> port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> introduced in the Cadillac Seville of 1976.|$|R
50|$|Hilborn {{eventually}} {{started a}} company to sell his <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> to the public, which became popular with the hot rodders of the 1950s and 1960s. A classic mechanical Hilborn <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> is recognizable by its distinctive flared velocity stack intake pipes, rising straight up from each cylinder, flared at the open top, and usually polished or plated for a bright, shiny finish. Today, that company continues to provide performance products including mechanical and <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
2500|$|More {{beneficial}} to AMC's future was {{the introduction of}} an all-new line of compact Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer models {{in the autumn of}} 1983 for the 1984 model year. The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the sport utility vehicle (SUV). They initially used the AMC 150 C.I.D. (2.5L) OHV four-cylinder engine with a carburetor, and a General Motors-built [...] carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5L I4 engines. A Renault [...] Turbo-Diesel I4 diesel was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a [...] I6 engine, derived from the older [...] I6 with a new head design and an <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> replaced the outsourced V6. American Motors' [...] "new" [...] engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix (Renix) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design continued to be improved and refined until its discontinuation {{at the end of the}} 2006 model year. The 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding [...] The XJ Cherokee itself was built by Chrysler until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, Bendix {{introduced}} [...] "Electrojector", a true multipoint <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> {{which was}} optional on several 1958 models of automobiles built by Chrysler Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Like {{its larger}} variant this car also boasted {{advanced}} technological innovations. 1969 saw {{the introduction of}} the Bosch D-jetronic fully <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> into the 250CE. This was the first ever production Mercedes-Benz to use this system.|$|E
50|$|Most newer {{vehicles}} have <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems,</b> and do {{not require}} air <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> in their exhausts. Instead, they provide a precisely controlled air-fuel mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich combustion. Oxygen sensors are used to monitor the exhaust oxygen content {{before and after the}} catalytic converter, and this information is used by the Electronic Control Unit to adjust the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> so as to prevent the first (NOx reduction) catalyst from becoming oxygen-loaded, while simultaneously ensuring the second (HC and CO oxidation) catalyst is sufficiently oxygen-saturated.|$|R
2500|$|Half-width torsion bars (full-width {{on higher}} spec models) with {{trailing}} arms at the rear, [...] and coil sprung MacPherson struts, {{attached to a}} thick pressed steel subframe at the front. The engine range available at launch included 1.2L and 1.4L E-type [...] "Energy" [...] petrol inline-four engines (first seen in the Renault 19) and 1.7L and [...] 1.9L diesel engines, both based on the F-type unit. The petrol engines gradually had their carburettors replaced with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> {{by the end of}} 1992, in order to conform to ever stricter pollutant emission regulations brought in by the EEC.|$|R
5000|$|These {{engines in}} the First {{generation}} Focus produced 75 and [...] respectively, but for MkII Focus the 1.4 variant was slightly modified and produced [...] Both engines have belt driven camshafts and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>systems.</b> They weigh 90 kilograms.http://www.ctm.it/pdf/Powertrain%20Product%20Guide%202007.pdf http://www.api.org/certifications/engineoil/new/upload/1_Customer_Focused_Technology_Transition_BSamardizich_Ford_DAP_Forum_April_20_2010.pdfThe 1.6 Ti-VCT is introduced in 2004, it which features Variable Cam Timing; this [...] version {{is used in}} MkII Focus. A new 105/125 bhp EU5 version {{is used in the}} MkIII Focus, also a 1.6 L [...] version is used in Ford Fiesta Zetec-S. The Sigma is usually coupled to the Ford IB5 five-speed manual transmission.|$|R
50|$|Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{helped to}} enhance fuel {{injection}} research for NASCAR {{as he was}} leading lap 34 out of 334. His contribution to the fledgling technology {{came in the form}} of driving the one-millionth mile with an <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, the UK {{version of}} the Bonneville America was further updated with an <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> to meet the European {{emission}} legislation, with the fuel injectors concealed by dummy carburetors. [...] The US {{version of the}} Bonneville America was not updated to EFI until 2009.|$|E
50|$|Powertrain {{changes for}} 1986 {{included}} {{replacement of the}} 2.2 L engine's carburetor by a new throttle-body <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> while a new 2.5 L four-cylinder engine, also fuel-injected, {{was added to the}} option list, replacing the Mitsubishi 2.6 L. The four-speed manual transmission - previously offered as standard equipment - was dropped.|$|E
50|$|For 1981 the B-engine was re-designed as the H engine, {{which was}} used through to 1993 (and 1994 cabriolets). Unlike the earlier version, the H-engine is very durable. Saab used Bosch-made {{mechanical}} K-Jetronic continuous <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in the <b>fuel</b> injected and 8-valve turbocharged versions, and the Bosch LH 2.2, 2.4 and 2.4.2 and Lucas Automotive <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> {{were used in the}} 16-valve versions. The 2.1 L inline-four 16-valve engine used the Bosch LH 2.4.2 EZK electronic ignition system with knock sensor. 1981 was also the first year that the Turbo was available with an automatic transmission. The four-speed manual option disappeared after this year.|$|R
50|$|Renix (Renix Electronique) was a {{joint venture}} by Renault and Bendix that {{designed}} and manufactured automobile <b>electronic</b> ignitions, <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>electronic</b> automatic transmission controls, and various engine sensors. Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles. The name became synonymous in the U.S. with the computer and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> used on the AMC/Jeep 2.5 L I4 and 4.0 L I6 engines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{establishment}} of a system of electronic control gasoline engine, we try to develop and optimize a set of <b>electronic</b> control <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> which aims at the LJ 462 Q gasoline engine.

50|$|Programmed Fuel Injection, or PGMFI/PGM-FI, is {{the name}} given by Honda to a {{proprietary}} digital <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> for internal combustion engines which injects {{the right amount of}} fuel per cylinder based on specific engine data, available since the early 1980s. This system has been implemented on motorcycles, automobiles, and outboard motors.|$|E
50|$|The Lucas 14CUX (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Rover 14CUX) is an automotive <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> developed by Lucas Industries and fitted to the Rover V8 engine in Land Rover vehicles between 1990 and 1995. The system was also paired with the Rover V8 by a number of low-volume manufacturers such as TVR, Marcos, Ginetta, and Morgan.|$|E

50|$|The 1HD-FTE is a 4.2 L (4164 cc) straight-6 24 valve {{turbocharged}} diesel engine. Bore is 94 mm {{and stroke}} is 100 mm, with a compression ratio of 18.8:1. Output is 164 hp (122 kW) at 3400 rpm with 280 lb·ft (380 N·m) of torque at 1400 rpm. The <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> is direct <b>injection,</b> and adopts the <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (EFI) <b>system.</b> Redline of this engine is at 4200 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The TU250x had a twin valve, single {{cylinder}} engine with a closed-loop <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Injection</b> (EFI) <b>system</b> (marketed as Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV)) and a 32-bit ECU, oxygen sensor, catalytic converter, integral cold-start system, 32mm throttle body 10-nozzle injector and a proprietary air <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> (marketed as Suzuki Pulsed-secondary AIR-injection or PAIR) that introduces fresh air from the airbox into the exhaust port to ignite unburned hydrocarbons, reducing emissions.

50|$|The {{engine is}} a , four-valve DOHC, 54-degree, liquid-cooled, fuel {{injected}} V-twin. It has a {{bore and stroke}} of 112.0 x 90.5 mm. Each bore is lined with Suzuki's SCEM (Suzuki Composite Electrochemical Material) to aid heat transfer, improve piston-to-cylinder clearances and reduce weight. The engine has <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> with 52 mm throttle bodies and dual spark plugs.The transmission is five speed.|$|E
5000|$|High Pressure Charged {{version of}} 2L-TE, the fuel is {{injected}} {{with a high}} pressure system, High Pressure Charging. Bore and stroke remains the same, 92 mm for both.

50|$|The fuel {{injected}} 4A-FE is the successor of the carbureted 4A-F. It was manufactured between 1987-2001. Toyota designed this engine with fuel economy in mind. The 4A-FE {{is basically the}} same as the 4A-F (introduced in the previous generation of Corollas), the most apparent difference being the <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> as noted by the E. The engine was succeeded by the 3ZZ-FE, a 1.6-liter engine with VVT-i technology.|$|E
50|$|For {{model year}} 1987, {{the method of}} fuel {{delivery}} for the engines was switched from carburetors to <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> The <b>system</b> that GM chose was called throttle body injection, or TBI. Suburban gained rear-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS) for the 1990 model year. A heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmission, the 4L80-E was added for 1991. Also for 1989, the grille was redesigned to accommodate a quad side-by-side headlight setup and larger marker lights/turn signals than the previous dual filament single headlight setup, which was styled concurrently with the GMT400 light duty trucks. Economy models (usually for fleet usage) were available with only two headlights (again, based on the base model C/K series).|$|R
50|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the 600 in 1985. The 600 sedan was moved to a longer {{wheelbase}} and the former base and ES trims were dropped, replaced by a new SE trim. This was {{due in part to the}} new Lancer, which would have competed directly with the 600 (the 5-speed manual transmission was no longer offered as well, in an attempt to keep competition between the Lancer and 600 to a minimum). The coupe and convertible remained relatively unchanged except for minor trim and interior changes. The only significant advancement was the replacement of the 2.2 L engine's two-barrel Holley electronic feedback carburetor by an <b>electronic</b> throttle-body <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

The altered design did not constitute a new [...] "phase". In March 1994 (at the Geneva Motor Show), the phase two model was launched, with small updates to the exterior and interior of the Clio. Most noticeable was the change in the front grille from two metal ribs to a single colour-coded slat. The bump strips were made slightly larger and rounder and had the car's trim level badge incorporated into them. The badges on the tailgate strip were moved up onto the tailgate itself and the tailgate strip was given a carbon fibre look. The rear light clusters were given a slightly more rounded bubble shape, giving the Clio a more modern look. The clusters, however, are physically interchangeable with phase ones'.|$|R
