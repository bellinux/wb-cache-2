Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> target only the intended pest species; {{it can also}} target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint {{may be used to}} break up outlines and features. Disruptive coloration, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by other factors including shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare's first plays {{were written}} in the {{conventional}} style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> spring naturally from {{the needs of the}} characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups {{is that they are}} more likely to suffer from parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E

5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|E
5|$|Since {{laws of war}} demand {{ambulances}} {{be marked}} {{with one of the}} Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount offensive weapons, military ambulances are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as non-combatants; however, this application <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.|$|E

Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> understand her parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the lock on the apartment's front door to keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} when {{termites}} encounter {{each other in}} foraging areas, some of the termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering. Dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to {{the isolation of the}} area and thus the need to construct new tunnels. Conflict between two competitors <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> occur. For example, though they might block each other's passages, colonies of Macrotermes bellicosus and Macrotermes subhyalinus are not always aggressive towards each other. Suicide cramming is known in Coptotermes formosanus. Since C.formosanus colonies may get into physical conflict, some termites squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die, successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities.|$|E
5|$|The Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), {{also known}} as the Dzungarian hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster, Siberian dwarf hamster or Russian winter white dwarf hamster, is one of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> happen. In the wild, they originate from Dzungaria, the wheat fields of Kazakhstan, the meadows of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} meat ants {{depends on what}} {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E
