40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{cross-border}} takeover activity in the EU over the past years. This is fortunate since the Commission views the increase of such activity and the ensuing restructuring of firms as vital to implement its aim of making Europe the most competitive economy by 2010. The Commission is concerned, however, by the fact that most Member States still have legal, cultural, or other structures, which either impede or reduce the occurrence of takeovers. The Commission is also concerned that the level of protection afforded to offeree shareholders in the context of takeovers differs from one Member State to another. Indeed, the offeree shareholders in some Member States enjoy a far better protection than their counterparts in other Member States. This thesis analyses these two aspects of takeover regulation from the point of view of the UK and France. The latter countries have had a significant impact upon the drafting of the Directive on takeover bids, as well as of numerous individual European countries' takeover regulations, due to their solid experience with national takeover regulation. It is therefore believed that the comparative analysis of the takeover regimes of these two jurisdictions will offer a better understanding of both the Directive on takeover bids and other European countries' takeover regulations. Such comparative analysis is further believed to offer an insight into how the level of growth of a particular market and the different ownership structures impact upon the rules governing takeovers. This thesis begins by explaining the regulatory framework of takeovers in the UK and France as well as the ownership structures prevailing in these two jurisdictions. It subsequently analyses in a comparative manner the role of the offeree management and the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> in these two countries. This thesis concludes with the gradual convergence of takeover regulations in the UK and France and throughout Europe more generally...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of the Finnish Companies Act 21. 7. 2006 / 624 (hereinafter the FCA) is the system of so-called true non-par value shares. The Finnish true non-par value system offers companies the opportunity to allot shares completely free of charge even in a directed share issue, i. e. when the pre-emptive rights of the existing shareholders are derogated. This opportunity could be risky, especially {{from the viewpoint of}} the minority shareholders, if the required majority of shareholders could in a shareholders meeting freely adopt a resolution about that kind of share issue. In practice, this would mean that a part of the share of the assets and of the power in the company of the old shareholders could be transferred to the new shareholders. However, the use of the directed share issue without payment is restricted by certain material grounds defined in the FCA. Pursuant to chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA, a directed share issue without payment is allowed only if there is an especially weighty reason both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company. The aim of this research is to formulate a meaningful interpretation of the wording of chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA, which {{could be used as a}} test when it must be judged, is there an especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company. My main thesis proposes that besides the formal or judicial principle of equality between shareholders, the principle of equality in its entirety, as it is known in Finnish company law, also has an economic dimension, which can be referred to as the principle of economic equality between shareholders. As such, a directed share issue without payment always means a breach against the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> in the formal sense. However, if the company acquires enough substantial economic benefits through that kind of share issue, the real financial position and value of shareholdings of even those shareholders, who are not entitled to the shares allotted without charge, might remain untouched or even improve. The economic <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> could then be the core of the material grounds of the directed share issue without consideration. This thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the objects and hypotheses of the research, its methods, the most important sources and its structure. Chapters 2 and 3 are the theoretical or general part of the research. The former contains discussion about historical and modern corporate law theories, the concept of a share in a company limited by shares and the relevance of the investment made to a company s capital against the shares. The latter deals with the principle of equality between shareholders and the different dimensions of that principle. Chapters 4 and 5 constitute the practical part of the research. The former provides detailed presentation of the directed share issue without payment as a process. The latter focuses to the interpretation of the especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company and provides examples about acceptable grounds to the directed share issue without payment. Finally, chapter 6 summarizes the theses and conclusions of the research. The main conclusions of this research are that Finnish company law contains a principle of the economic <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> as a mandatory rule, and this rule is based on the economic purpose of business companies and the material objectives of the equality principle in company law. The residual position of shareholders in a business company is still based on a contribution to the company. However, even an indirect improvement of the financial position of the company as a result of a directed share issue without payment can be considered as the equivalent of a contribution, i. e. the directed share issue without payment should not be, in effect, a share issue without payment as it would be understood in everyday language. The principle of economic equality also gives a meaningful bedrock to the interpretation of chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA. This principle can then be considered a distinctive feature between the material grounds of the normal directed share issue against payment and the directed share issue without payment. In the former type of directed share issue, the adequate issue price plays a central role and fulfils the objective of economic equality. In the directed share issue without payment other kinds of benefits to the company and the evaluation of economic equality against those benefits will have an independent role. A directed share issue without payment must always be in the interests of the company, the benefit it provides to the company must be substantial and of an economic nature, and it must be defendable when compared to the interests of all shareholders of the company. This latter part of the material grounds of the directed share issue without payment must be interpreted as an example of the mandatory principle of economic equality between shareholders. The essential meaning of that principle in the directed share issue without payment is that the dilution of formal shareholder rights of old shareholders must be compensated in economic sense through the enhanced financial position of the company as a whole. The evaluation of such an expected compensation must, however, be made at the time of the share issue resolution, not retrospectively. Tutkimuksen aiheena on suunnattu maksuton osakeanti ja sen aineellisen perusteen osakeyhtiölain (624 / 2006) 9 luvun 4 §:n 1 momentissa tarkoitettu yhtiön kannalta ja sen kaikkien osakkeenomistajien etu huomioon ottaen erityisen painava taloudellinen syy tulkinta. Suunnatun maksuttoman osakeannin mekanismina mahdollistaa osakeyhtiölaissa omaksuttu nimellisarvoton osakeyhtiön pääomajärjestelmä, jossa osakkeiden antaminen ei edellytä osakepääoman korottamista. Sellaisenaan suunnattu maksuton anti näyttää osakkeenomistajien yhdenvertaisuuden kannalta ongelmalliselta menettelyltä: annin ulkopuolelle jäävien osakkeenomistajien suhteellinen osuus yhtiössä supistuu, eikä yhtiöön välittömästi tule uusia varoja. Keskeisenä väitteenä tutkimuksessa on, että yhdenvertaisuudella osakeyhtiössä on taloudellinen ulottuvuus, jonka turvaaminen on myös osa suunnatun maksuttoman annin aineellista perustetta. Osakkeenomistajien taloudellinen yhdenvertaisuus toteutuu, kun annista seuraavan yhtiön taloudellisen aseman parantumisen voidaan perustellusti odottaa korvaavan annin ulkopuolelle jäävien osakkeenomistajien suhteellisen yhtiöosuuden laimenemisen. Vaatimus yhtiön taloudellisen aseman paranemisesta tai kääntäen yhtiön taloudellisen aseman heikkenemisen torjumisesta merkitsee, että annin maksuttomuuden on oltava näennäistä. Taloudellinen yhdenvertaisuus periaatteena antaa mielekkään sisällön suunnatun maksuttoman annin perusteeseen sisältyvälle kaikkien osakkeenomistajien edun huomioon ottamisen vaatimukselle. Suunnatun maksuttoman annin perusteen tulkinta taustoitetaan tutkimuksessa käsittelemällä osakeyhtiötä koskevia teorioita viimeisen sadan vuoden ajalta, osakeyhtiön oikeushenkilöyttä, osakkeen käsitesisältöä, osakkeen maksullisuuden ja nimellisarvon merkitystä, osakeyhtiöoikeudellisen yhdenvertaisuusperiaatteen eri ulottuvuuksia sekä yhtiön edun sisältöä ja merkitystä. Suunnatun maksuttoman annin aineellisesta perusteesta hahmotetaan testi, jota vasten menettelyn sallittavuutta eri käytännön tilanteissa voidaan arvioida. Tutkimukseen on otettu myös yksityiskohtainen esitys suunnatun maksuttoman annin järjestämistä koskevasta menettelystä sekä systemaattinen kuvaus erilaisista mahdollisista suunnatun maksuttoman annin käyttötilanteista...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rules}} regarding the internet-based exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights for public corporations incorporated in Canada, France, Germany, the U. S. (DelGCL & RMBCA), the UK and Switzerland. The traditional doctrine associates information, communication and voting with shareholder meetings. In addition, shareholder meetings regularly prompt reviews of management's activities exercised on behalf <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> by accountants or the judiciary. The analysis {{reveals that the}} current regimes <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> meetings merely provide for voting and information {{in the context of}} a digital environment, while communication and review is usually not replicated. The lack of all functions <b>of</b> traditional <b>shareholder</b> meetings is one reason of why exclusively virtual shareholder meetings have not gained widely spread acceptance across jurisdictions. Another reason is that a well-fitting design for the web-based exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights does not yet exist. Thus, the paper develops an advisable design <b>of</b> Virtual <b>Shareholder</b> Meetings that replicates all for functions <b>of</b> traditional <b>shareholder</b> meetings, while it is likely to reduce shareholder apathy at the same time. It argues that enabling more frequent opportunities for voting is the logical consequence of the developments of continuous disclosure requirements and continuous buy/hold/sell-decisions by market participants. Therefore, the virtual exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights should be achieved through (1) liberalizing currently existing legislative and practical barriers, and in particular, time and place restrictions on shareholder meetings; (2) re-integrating analyst and institutional investor meetings in the process <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> meetings, and (3) substituting for the traditional face-to-face accountability <b>of</b> managers to <b>shareholders</b> through specific electronic means. The latter involves, specifically, the use of RSS-Feed and XBRL-technologies for gathering and evaluating information, the use of the company's website as the central communication platform for management to shareholders and shareholders to shareholders, and the election <b>of</b> an independent <b>shareholder</b> rights manager (firm) by the shareholder body with procedural, technical, and organizational authority for organizing the exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights.

40|$|<b>Equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens, {{irrespective}} {{to their}} nationality {{is provided by}} all constitutions of the European socialist states. Yet a different construction is put on the question in the discussed constitutions {{on account of the}} fact that the constitutions were adopted in different periods, different patterns were followed, and first of all that not all these States encouner the question <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens irrespective to their nationality as an actual problem. The <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights irrespective to nationality becomes the problem in federal States and those homogenous States where numerous minorities live, i. e. in Romania and Hungary. Constitutions of Romania and Hungary formulate the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens irrespective to their nationality not only as an individual right but also as the collective one. It means that they provide not only the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights of particular citizens, but they guarantee <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights to the whole national minorities. Guaranteeing the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights to particular national minorities has to be recognized as a better and more complete securing <b>of</b> the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights. A possibility of cultivating their national separateness by particular citizens does not by itself create the full <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights. It is determined by activities of educational institutions at all their levels, extensive development of education and culture — and this cannot be implemented only by individual actions of citizens. The socialist federations, i. e. the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia secure the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights irrespective to nationality in different ways. In Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia the equality is secured by guaranteeing particular nationalities the development of their separate character. In the Soviet Union, the complete <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights of particular nations and peoples is intended to be achieved by the creation of a uniform Soviet nation. These two distinct ways are reflected in the discussed constitutions. Still, in all the European socialist States the true <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens irrespective to their nationality is to be achieved by the equality in the social and economic domain. Most of the constitutions clearly differentiate between the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights and obligations of citizens and the equality before the law irrespective to nationality. It has to be added though, that in those States, where the constitutions do not proclaim explicitely the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens before the law irrespective to their nationality, the respective provisions were omitted mostly for that reason that at the time of adopting the constitutions there were no differences perceived between the notions <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens before the law and <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights of citizens.
