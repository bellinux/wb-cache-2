This thesis, entitled "Cost comparison of hydropower options for rural electrification in Rwanda" intends {{to show that the}} use {{of a large number of}} mini hydropower plants for <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> sparse <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in Rwanda is the least cost option when compared to installing either a single small or large hydropower plants. This is done by considering rural households to be randomly distributed and the model composed by 98 rural villages having three different population densities is used to test the validity of the hypothesis. Three different hydropower options providing the same level <b>of</b> service to <b>rural</b> households were used for the cost comparison. The relationship between the electrification cost per household versus the population density is deduced. Many distribution technologies can be used in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and the accurate selection of the appropriate distribution technology is the main concern as it affects the cost of the whole distribution system. The rural network should be carefully designed so that the sizing of conductors to be used for LV and MV network is properly done at a low cost. The high distribution cost depends largely on the size of power to be delivered.

Hybrid energy system is an excellent solution for <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> remote <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> where the grid extension is difficult and not economical. Hybrid Wind/PV systems are highly efficient and require very low maintenance. An average model of a hybrid wind-photovoltaic generating system has been presented.

The method of investigation concerns with {{the definition of the}} system topology, interconnection of the various sources with maximum transfer of energy, optimum control and energy management. The proposed energy management strategy was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink with the Neural Network controller. The optimal transfers of power from the sources are based on power, voltage and current control was done in order to regulate the DC bus voltage to a fixed value. The various models with the output waveforms are represented and discussed. The role of Neural Network controller is to interconnect the system for optimal performance based on expected wind, solar irradiations and battery voltage.

40|$|The earlier {{research}} on electricity supply to rural areas {{has tended to}} address the technical and financial performance of both grid connected and decentralised power systems and the socio-economic impact of electrification. However, this study has chosen to {{examine the impact of}} the developments and trends on the approach to rural electrification and its implications for developing countries in particular. The study includes a comprehensive historical analysis of rural electrification programmes implemented in both industrialised and developing countries. A general conclusion is that rural electricity supply has always been considerably more expensive than the supply to urban areas and, as a consequence, utilities have been reluctant to extend the service to rural areas. In most cases government subsidies were needed to make rural electrification programmes feasible. In many industrialised countries, and some developing countries, separate organisations were made responsible for the implementation of these programmes. These organisations have met with varying degrees of success in reaching customers. In particular small-scale private rural utilities have seldom proved to be successful. Evidence suggests that, from a development point of view, electrification should preferably be a component of an integrated rural development programme. The <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> has traditionally been based on electricity supply from a central grid. However in the future, the <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in developing countries will be increasingly based on decentralised power facilities. In this respect it is also emphasised that small-scale independent power producers should be seen as fully fledged suppliers of electricity to the public grid. The all-round unsatisfactory performance of the electricity sector of several developing countries calls for urgent reforms. However the results of the historical analysis and recent experiences in industrialised countries with privatisation in the power sector suggest that developing countries should ask themselves the questions what is the minimum amount of power sector reform that is needed. The study reveals that political stability, autonomy, and an appropriate utility organisation which is based on an analysis of the business environment and contemporary management, are needed to successfully implement future rural electrification programmes...|$|E

A crucial task for the microgrid controller is to automatically identify the connected loads {{on the basis of their}} consumption behaviors. For this, a template-matching algorithm is proposed that is based on Dynamic Time Warping, which is primarily used in speech recognition.

The national electricity grid, managed by the parastatal ESKOM, has been experiencing problems due to various reasons, particularly since 2008.

40|$|International audienceThe {{production}} and consumption of electricity in Latin America has grown strongly in recent decades (about 4 % per year) with an increasing share coming from fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} an increase in the carbon intensity of the electricity production. Large hydro still represents a substantial part of the electricity mix in most Latin-American countries. However, the construction of new dams has slowed mainly due to their local environmental consequences. In the last decade, most of these countries showed a growing interest in developing renewable energy technologies (RETs) for power generation, especially wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric dams. This interest is explained primarily by the need of diversifying the power mix and increase security of supply. Additionally, other policy objectives have been considered, such as the <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> isolated <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> the decrease <b>of</b> energy imports, the creation of new jobs and the reduction of GHG emissions. The latter goal became especially important after the COP 21 (Paris, 2015), in which most countries agreed to follow decarbonisation pathways for their economies which means, among other measures, an increased effort to develop green energy. In this context, governments have set relatively ambitious targets and implemented public policies to encourage investment in RETs and thus take advantage of the great potential available. Different policy instruments have been implemented: tax exemptions, feed-in tariffs, feed-in premium, auction systems, tradable certificates, etc. However, even though many years of government effort and public resources have been invested in order to speed up the development, diffusion and implementation of RETs, experiences in different countries show {{that this is a very}} slow process. The current share of RETs is still low (or extremely low depending on the country), especially when compared to the ambitions of policy objectives. Support policies for RETs in Argentina is an interesting case to analyse the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms in a context of high risk perception. Recent experience in the electricity sector shows that the application of several theoretically effectives instruments did not produce the expected results despite the large potential available.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the feasibility of}} decentralized gasification of oil palm biomass in Indonesia to relieve its over-dependence on fossil fuel-based power generation and facilitate the <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> its <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The techno-feasibility <b>of</b> the gasification of oil palm biomass was first evaluated by reviewing existing literature. Subsequently, two scenarios (V 1 and V 2, and M 1 and M 2) were proposed regarding the use cases of the village and mill, respectively. The capacity of the gasification systems in the V 1 and M 1 scenarios {{are determined by the}} total amount of oil palm biomass available in the village and mill, respectively. The capacity of the gasification systems in the V 2 and M 2 scenarios is determined by the respective electricity demand of the village and mill. The global warming impact and economic feasibility (net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)) of the proposed systems were compared with that of the current practices (diesel generator for the village use case and biomass boiler combustion for the mill use case) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Under the current daily demand per household (0. 4  kWh), deploying the V 2 system in 104  villages with 500 households each could save up to 17. 9 thousand tons of CO 2 -eq per year compared to the current diesel-based practice. If the electricity could be fed into the national grid, the M 1 system with 100 % capacity factor could provide yearly GHG emissions mitigation of 5. 8  ×  104  ton CO 2 -eq, relative to the current boiler combustion-based reference scenario. M 1 had a positive mean NPV if the electricity could be fed into the national grid, while M 2 had a positive mean NPV at the biochar price of 500  USD/ton. Under the current electricity tariff (ET) (0. 11  kWh) and the biochar price of 2650  USD/ton, daily household demands of 2 and 1. 8  kWh were required to reach the break-even point of the mean NPV for the V 2 system for the cases of 300 and 500 households, respectively. The average LCOE of V 2 is approximately one-fourth that of the reference scenario, while the average LCOE of V 1 is larger than that of the reference scenario. The average LCOE of M 1 decreased to around 0. 06  USD/kWh for the case of a 100 % capacity factor. Sensitivity analysis showed that the capital cost of gasification system and its overall electrical efficiency had the most significant effects on the NPV.

40|$|<b>Electrification</b> <b>of</b> {{remote and}} <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> is {{usually in the}} form of a {{standalone}} power system that operates self-sufficiently. Renewable energy resources, if available in such areas, are expected to have a large and ultimately, a full share of electricity generation in these areas to lessen the levelized cost of electricity for the operators. Thereby, the electric network of such remote areas can be considered as a sustainable microgrid (MG). Larger remote areas can be supplied by several MGs, each with a different operator (owner) and running independently. The occasional power deficiency and overloading of those MGs can be addressed by local support from the floating energy storages, or by importing power from a neighboring MG, after interconnecting the MGs temporarily. Thus, such MGs are expected to experience a transformation in their structure; a small change when new energy storage systems are connected and a significant alteration when it is coupled with another MG. Before such actions, the stability of the new system is vital to be cautiously examined to intercept the transformation, if instability is to occur. An eigenanalysis-based small signal stability evaluation technique is used in this research for an MG with a transforming structure. The analysis will be used as a decision-making process prior to a change in the MG. If the new system is defined to be unstable, the analysis can provide a range of control parameters for the energy resources to guarantee the stability of the new system. Through MATLAB-based analyses, the impact of the number and rating of the sources and loads, as well as the system topology of one MG on the stability of the system of coupled MGs, is evaluated. Moreover, the impacts of the number, energy capacity, rate of discharge and state of charge of the energy storage systems are assessed...|$|R

In addition, as there are numerous models of system components in the market, selection of the optimal model for each component has always become a tedious and time consuming for system designers. Therefore, optimization methods are often used in the sizing algorithms for such systems. This study presents the development of Firefly Algorithm-based Sizing Algorithm, known as FASA for sizing optimization of SAPV systems. The sizing algorithm utilized Firefly Algorithm (FA) to optimally select the model of each system component such that a system technical performance indicator is consequently optimized. FA was incorporated in two sizing approaches, i. e. the intuitive method and the hybrid intuitive-deterministic method with the technical performance indicator set as Performance Ratio (PR) and Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) respectively. Besides that, two design cases of PV-battery system, i. e. system with standard charge controller and system with MPPT-based charge controller were investigated. Apart from that, Iterative-based Sizing Algorithms (ISA) for each design case with the two sizing approaches were developed to determine the optimal solutions which were used as benchmark for FASA. The results showed that FASA had successfully found the optimal PR and LPSP in all design cases using both intuitive and hybrid intuitive-deterministic methods.

The main objective of the Government is to eradicate the poverty and up grade the life standards <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> community by the growth <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> economy as a result <b>of</b> <b>electrification</b> in <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> This research is an attempt to evaluate whether the objectives of the village hydro projects (objectives of the Government, objectives of the Funding Agencies and expectation <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> community) have been achieved or if not identifies the drawbacks of village hydro project industry. Finally an attempt has been made to give recommendations to develop village hydro projects as a faceable industry while guarding its social aims up to the standards. For the purpose of data collection, three case studies have been done base on three village hydro projects, which have been funded by Sam path Bank. The reasons to select these three projects are availability of resources and easy access. Data were collected by literature survey on three projects, using a questionnaire and face to face interviews conducted with selected samples of villagers in these areas. Questionnaire was given to three samples of (minimum 30 each) villagers of above three projects. Data of social impact and drawbacks of these projects were collected by face to face interviews with selected samples of villagers. At these three case studies, economic and social impacts of the village hydro projects have been identified. But in these case studies, an attempt hasn't made to do test the technical feasibility <b>of</b> village hydro <b>electrification</b> projects. Observations have done in business angle rather than technical. As such more qualitative data has been collected and analyzed rather than quantitative data. There is an opportunity in future to do a research on technical feasibility <b>of</b> village hydro <b>electrification</b> projects. Collected data have been analyzed by using the methods of SWOT analysis and PEST analysis. Cost- benefit analysis has been used to identify the acceptability of the projects and level of satisfaction of the consumers. The recommendations and observations to develop village hydro electrification projects as a faceable industry have been given in the last chapter based on the findings of data analysis...|$|R

Planners have suggested hybrid energy system for the <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> worldwide. This study investigates the techno-economic and environmental effect of applying demand side man-agement (DSM) activities to rural loads before design and sizing of hybrid energy systems for such community. Iporin a rural area in Ibadan, Nigeria which is endowed with an average daily solar radiation of 3. 84 kWh/m 2 /day was taken as a case study. The total daily consumption which was initially estimated as 297 kWh/day after the application of DSM techniques dropped to 130 kWh/day representing a decrease of 56. 80 %. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables software was used for simulation and optimization purpose. Parameters such as DSM index, net present cost, and emission level were used in determining the effect of the DSM technique. Overall, the DSM activities proved to be more economical and environmental friendly...|$|E
40|$|In Bolivia 44 % of {{the people}} living in rural areas do not have {{reliable}} access to electric energy. This is due to a combination of unfavourable geography and the lack of economic resources to achieve the necessary infrastructure. In this context, the main goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of micro-grids including photovoltaic panels (PV), batteries systems and the possible inclusion of diesel generators for off-grid applications. To that aim, a linear optimization model was developed within the Pyomo framework in order to optimize both the installed capacities and dispatch of the PV, battery and diesel sub-systems. The defined objective function is the net present cost. The exogenous inputs of the optimization are the typical demand and solar irradiation of a region of Bolivia in order to achieve results close to real Bolivian systems. Results indicate that due to the high levels of subvention to hydrocarbons, the PV and Li-Ion technology are not yet competitive with a diesel generator for the <b>electrification</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> On the other hand a sensitivity analysis is performed and proves that if the government decide to stop part of the subvention or shared it between conventional and non-conventional sources, the PV becomes competitive and the Li-Ion batteries enter the market around 2020.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. <b>Electrification</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} faced by ESKOM and methods are required to extend medium voltage distribution lines to these often remote areas. As loads increase due to line-extension, in-fills and energy theft, maintenance cost and life expectancy of distribution and power transformers becomes more critical. The thesis addresses these two aspects with the development of a self regulated and protected electrification transformer that makes use of current, voltage and ambient temperature measurements to regulate voltage and protect hardware from overloading. The design of the hardware that allows the system to run at 200 % load without decreasing the lifetime of the transformer is examined. Temperature estimation techniques are used to estimate the temperatures in the 16 kVA, 22 kV to 230 V, distribution transformer to run above nameplate ratings without causing damage. The control of the system is implemented on TMS 320 F 2812 digital signal processor from TI that is DSP/BIOS compatible. The control software is implemented using DSP/BIOS, which allows real-time scheduling and monitoring of procedures. Furthermore a distribution transformer was fitted with temperature sensors and heat run tests were performed. The results of the temperature tests were used to verify the estimation techniques and to determine constants used for temperature estimation...|$|E
