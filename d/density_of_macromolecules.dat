40|$|AbstractThe Stokes–Einstein–Debye {{equation}} is currently {{used to obtain}} information on protein size or on local viscosity from the measurement of the rotational correlation time. However, the implicit assumptions of a continuous and homogeneous solvent do not hold either in vivo, {{because of the high}} <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> or in vitro, where viscosity is adjusted by adding viscous cosolvents of various size. To quantify the consequence of nonhomogeneity, we have measured the rotational Brownian motion of three globular proteins with molecular mass from 66 to 4000 kD in presence of 1. 5 to 2000 kD dextrans as viscous cosolvents. Our results indicate that the linear viscosity dependence of the Stokes–Einstein relation must be replaced by a power law to describe the rotational Brownian motion of proteins in a macromolecular environment. The exponent of the power law expresses the fact that the protein experiences {{only a fraction of the}} hydrodynamic interactions of macromolecular cosolvents. An explicit expression of the exponent in terms of protein size and cosolvent's mass is obtained, permitting definition of a microscopic viscosity. Experimental data suggest that a similar effective microviscosity should be introduced in Kramers’ equation describing protein reaction rates...|$|E

From this model the radial structure factor and density value histogram are estimated and applied as constraints to the 3 D reconstruction in reciprocal- and real-space, respectively. Interestingly, similar improvements are obtained when using the correct radial structure factor and density value histogram from a crystal structure. Thus, the estimated pseudo-atomic model yields a sufficiently accurate mass distribution to optimally sharpen a density map...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryote gene {{expression}} is mediated by {{a cascade of}} RNA functions that regulate, process, store, transport, and translate RNA transcripts. The RNA network that promotes this cascade depends on a large cohort of proteins that partner RNAs; thus, the modern RNA world of eukaryotes is really a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) world. Features of this ‘‘RNP infrastructure’ ’ {{can be related to}} the high cytosolic <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> and the large size of eukaryote cells. Because of the densely packed cytosol or nucleoplasm (with its severe restriction on diffusion of macromolecules), partitioning of the eukaryote cell into functionally specialized compartments is essential for efficiency. This necessitates the association of RNA and protein into large RNP complexes including ribosomes and spliceosomes. This is well illustrated by the ubiquitous spliceosome for which most components are conserved throughout eukaryotes and which interacts with other RNP-based machineries. The complexes involved in gene processing in modern eukaryotes have broad phylogenetic distributions suggesting that the common ancestor of extant eukaryotes had a fully evolved RNP network. Thus, the eukaryote genome may be uniquely informative about the transition from an earlier RNA genome world to the modern DNA genome world.

40|$|Inside cells, the {{concentration}} of macromolecules can reach up to 400 g/L. In such crowded environments, proteins are expected to behave differently than in vitro. It {{has been shown that}} the stability and the folding rate of a globular protein can be altered by the excluded volume effect produced by a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> However, macromolecular crowding effects on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are less explored. These proteins can be extremely dynamic and potentially sample a wide ensemble of conformations under non-denaturing conditions. The dynamic properties of IDPs are intimately related to the timescale of conformational exchange within the ensemble, which govern target recognition and how these proteins function. In this work, we investigated the macromolecular crowding effects on the dynamics of several IDPs by measuring the NMR spin relaxation parameters of three disordered proteins (ProTa, TC 1, and a-synuclein) with different extents of residual structures. To aid the interpretation of experimental results, we also performed an MD simulation of ProTa. Based on the MD analysis, a simple model to correlate the observed changes in relaxation rates to the alteration in protein motions under crowding conditions was proposed. Our results show that 1) IDPs remain at least partially disordered despite the presence of high concentration of other macromolecules, 2) the crowded environment has differential effects on the conformational propensity of distinct regions of an IDP, which may lead to selective stabilization of certain target-binding motifs, and 3) the segmental motions of IDPs on the nanosecond timescale are retained unde...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{mechanical}} degradation {{and changes in}} conformation of a branched ultrahigh molar mass biomacromolecule, hydrophobically modified starch, as caused by high-pressure homogenization. The characterization was performed with asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) with multiangle light scattering (MALS) and refractive index detection. The starch which had been chemically modified with octenyl succinate anhydride (OSA) proved to be very large and polydisperse. Upon high-pressure homogenization, the molar mass and rms radius (r(rms)) decreased, {{and the extent of}} these changes was related to the turbulent flow conditions during homogenization. The treatment also induced an increase and scaling with size in the apparent <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>macromolecules.</b> To further study the changes in conformation, it was necessary to calculate the hydrodynamic radii (r(h)). This can be determined numerically from the elution times in the analysis and the flow conditions in the AsFlFFF channel. The results showed that the treatment can cause a dramatic decrease in the quotient between r(rms) and r(h), suggesting major conformational changes. These results together could be interpreted as degradation and "crumpling" <b>of</b> the <b>macromolecule,</b> which would give a decrease in rrms and an increase in apparent density, together with a "fraying" of more outer parts <b>of</b> the <b>macromolecule,</b> which could give rise to the increase in r(h) ...|$|R

The role <b>of</b> these <b>macromolecules</b> in mediating adhesion and attachment were examined. Interfacial forces and adhesion affinities of A. pullulans were probed for early-exponential phase (EEP) and late-exponential phase (LEP) cells, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Biochemical assays showed that A. pullulans produces both pullulan and a uronic acid based polymer. The pullulan is not produced until the LEP, {{and it can be}} removed by treatment with pullulanase. Both adhesion forces between the microbe and the AFM tip (silicon nitride) and attachment of the cells to quartz sand grains were controlled by the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the uronic acid polymer. Uronic acid polymers doubled in density between the EEP and the LEP and were unaffected by the enzyme pullulanase. Retention to quartz in a packed column was quantified using the collision efficiency (R), the fraction of collisions between the microbes, and the sand grains, that result in attachment. Adhesion forces and retention on glass were well correlated, with these values being higher for EEP cells (Fadh) 7. 65 (4. 67 nN; R) 1. 15) than LEP (Fadh) 2. 94 (0. 75; R) 0. 49) and LEP + pullulanase cells (Fadh) 2. 33 (2. 01 nN; R) 0. 43).

MT imaging (MTI) can provide a quantitative measure <b>of</b> macromolecular <b>density,</b> and therefore <b>of</b> tissue damage, and has been applied in the central nervous system in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other diseases. This article introduces the contrast mechanisms behind MTI and gives some practical guidance about implementing MTI and about quantitative analysis of the MT scans. An overview of MT measurements made in animal studies, in postmortem tissue samples, and in other demyelinating diseases attempts to rationalize the pathological basis of changes in MT contrast in MS. The application of MTI to MS is reviewed, with emphasis on the contribution that MTI has made to the current understanding of the MS disease process, both its natural history and the response to treatment. The pathological basis of abnormal MT contrast is still open to debate, with many conflicting reports; indeed, it is unlikely that a simple measure of MT effect will reveal the details of pathology that is a combination of inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, and axonal loss. There is no doubt, however, that MT measurements have contributed to the current understanding of both disease progression and the response to treatment and will prove to be a valuable tool in the future, particularly if more refined techniques can be applied practically in multicenter studies. 7484...|$|R

In turn the prediction of a protein structure from its folding pathway involves the characterization {{of the dynamics of}} the polypeptide backbone. This study addresses how the internal dynamics of arborescent polypeptides are affected by increased crowding of the interior of these branched polymer molecules. Linear, comb-branched, and arborescent poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA) samples were analyzed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy to determine their chain conformation. The PGA chains of these constructs were shown to adopt α-helical and random coil conformations in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. The hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of the arborescent PGAs, determined using dynamic light scattering measurements, increased with increasing generation number and when the side-chains adopted random coil instead of α-helical conformations. The PGA samples were labelled with 1 -pyrenemethylamine to determine how their structure affected the internal dynamics of the arborescent polymers in solution, from the analysis of their fluorescence spectra and decays. For each pyrene-labelled polymeric construct excimer formation increased with increasing pyrene content, and the efficiency of excimer formation increased with the generation number due to the increased <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>macromolecules.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> the time-resolved fluorescence results acquired in DMF and in DMSO demonstrated that the helical conformation led to slower chain dynamics in DMF and that despite the higher viscosity of DMSO, the polypeptide side-chains were more mobile {{as a consequence of the}} random coil conformation of the linear PGA segments.
