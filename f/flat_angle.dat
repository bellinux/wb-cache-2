2500|$|While the {{fuselage}} was of conventional construction it was unusually deep, almost filling {{the gap between}} the planes, in the manner of the LFG Roland C.II. The portly dimensions of {{the fuselage}} made for a fairly clean engine installation – but the radiators were rather clumsily attached to the fuselage sides, in a position that must have interfered with the pilot's view forward and down past the nose. Apparently either could be bypassed to limit loss of coolant in the event of battle damage. An advanced feature was that the controls were operated by rods mounted within the airframe rather than cables carried externally, as was more usual at the time. The very small gap between the top wing and the fuselage gave the pilot excellent visibility above, but probably precluded the fitting of a standard (S.E.5 type) Foster mounting for the upper Lewis gun; existing photographic evidence points to a fixed gun pointing up at a slight angle to clear the propeller arc. This would not have been conducive to Ball's favourite attack from behind and below, as is often stated (see illustrations), although, if the type had gone into production it is possible that a variant of the [...] "Nieuport type" [...] Foster mounting would have been devised, to allow the Lewis to be fired at various upward angles, including the steep one favoured by Ball, as well as at a <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> directly forwards.|$|E

50|$|Impact fuzes were, {{and in some}} armies remain, the {{standard}} fuze for HE projectiles. Their default action is normally 'superquick', some have had a 'graze' action which allows them to penetrate light cover and others have 'delay'. Delay fuzes allow the shell to penetrate the ground before exploding. Armor- or concrete-piercing fuzes are specially hardened. During World War I and later, ricochet fire with delay or graze fuzed HE shells, fired with a <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> of descent, was used to achieve airburst.|$|E

50|$|While not {{necessarily}} a cost factor, an adverse effect of the high latitude is the refraction of radio signals by the atmosphere. At Grise Fiord, the satellite antenna faces horizontally south at the satellite which is located over the equator. The signal from the satellite strikes the atmosphere at such a <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> that adverse conditions can deflect the signal away from the straight-line required to reach the antenna. The effect is similar to how an oar appears bent at {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
50|$|The fort's guns {{came from}} the {{dismantled}} Ørje Fortress in Marker. The artillery {{was made up of}} <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> guns with a range of 6 to 9 km. The fortifications themselves consisted of 300 m of halls and tunnels dynamited into the mountain at Ingstadkleiva, as well as trench systems and gun positions excavated from the rock with explosives. There are two main underground parallel tunnels of around 80 m length, with a 35 m tunnel connecting them at a straight angle. One of the main tunnels served as crew quarters while the other was in direct connection with the above ground artillery pits.|$|E

The technique of anamorphic projection can be seen quite commonly on text written at a very <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> on roadways, such as [...] "Bus Lane" [...] or [...] "Children Crossing", to make it easily read by drivers who otherwise would have difficulty reading obliquely as the vehicle approaches the text; when the vehicle is nearly above the text, its true abnormally elongated shape can be seen. Similarly, in many sporting stadiums, especially in Rugby football in Australia, it is used to promote company brands which are painted onto the playing surface; from the television camera angle, the writing appear as signs standing vertically within the field of play.|$|E

Often a mini mill will be constructed in an area with no other steel production, {{to take advantage of}} local markets, resources, or lower-cost labour. Mini mill plants may specialize, for example, in making coils of rod for wire-drawing use, or pipe, or in special sections for transportation and agriculture.|$|R
50|$|An iron {{is a type}} of club used in {{the sport}} of golf to propel the ball towards the hole. Irons {{typically}} have shorter shafts and smaller clubheads than woods, the head is made of solid iron or steel, and the head's primary feature is a large, <b>flat,</b> <b>angled</b> face, usually scored with grooves. Irons are used {{in a wide variety of}} situations, typically from the teeing ground on shorter holes, from the fairway or rough as the player approaches the green, and to extract the ball from hazards, such as bunkers or even shallow water hazards.|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{surgeons}} categorize ptosis by {{evaluating the}} position of the nipple relative to the inframammary crease (where the underside of the breast meets the chest wall). This is determined by measuring {{from the center of the}} nipple to the sternal notch (at the top of the breast bone) to gauge how far the nipple has fallen. The standard anthropometric measurement for young women is 21 cm. This measurement is used to assess both breast ptosis and breast symmetry. The surgeon will assess the breast's angle of projection. The apex of the breast, which includes the nipple, can have a <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> of projection (180 degrees) or acute angle of projection (greater than 180 degrees). The apex rarely has an angle greater than 60 degrees. The angle of the breast apex is partly determined by the tautness of the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. For example, when a woman lies on her back, the angle of the breast apex becomes a flat, obtuse angle (less than 180 degrees) while the base-to-length ratio of the breast ranges from 0.5 to 1.0.|$|E
5000|$|The {{day before}} the flight, Brown and his ground crew had {{performed}} an engine run on the chosen Me 163B to ensure that everything was running correctly, the German crew being apprehensive should an accident befall Brown, until being given a disclaimer signed by him {{to the effect that}} they were acting under his orders. On the rocket-powered scharfen-start takeoff the next day, after dropping the takeoff dolly and retracting the skid, Brown later described the resultant climb as [...] "like being in charge of a runaway train", the aircraft reaching 32,000 ft (9.76 km) altitude in 2 minutes, 45 seconds. During the flight, while practicing attacking passes at an imaginary bomber, he was surprised at how well the Komet accelerated in the dive with the engine shut down. When the flight was over Brown had no problems on the approach to the airfield, apart from the rather restricted view from the cockpit due to the <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> of glide, the aircraft touching down at 200 km/h. Once down safely, Brown and his much-relieved ground crew celebrated with a drink.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a new {{algorithm}} for all-hex meshing of domains with multiple regions without post-processing cleanup. Our method starts with a strongly balanced octree. In contrast to snapping the grid points onto the geometric boundaries, we move points a slight distance away from the common boundaries. Then we intersect the moved grid with the geometry. This allows us to avoid creating any <b>flat</b> <b>angles,</b> and {{we are able to}} handle two-sided regions and more complex topologies than prior methods. The algorithm is robust and cleanup-free; without the use of any pillowing, swapping, or smoothing. Thus, our simple algorithm is also more predictable than prior art...|$|R

5000|$|The Committee {{assigned}} the California Institute of Technology {{to undertake the}} first systematic study {{of the dynamics of}} aerial launched torpedoes. Tank tests using scale models revealed that the [...] "low and slow" [...] approach that had been presumed necessary for a successful drop was actually counterproductive: striking the water at a <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> frequently caused the after body of the torpedo to “slap”, damaging the mechanism. Full scale testing simulated aerial torpedo drops under controlled conditions by pneumatically launching full size torpedoes down a 300 foot slide on California's Morris Dam into a mountain lake known for its clarity, allowing all aspects of the water entry to be examined utilizing high-speed photography. Fragile or vulnerable components were improved, tested, refined, and tested again. Improved components were shipped to Newport Rhode Island for air drop testing - 4,300 drops in all. The CalTech study {{led to the development of}} [...] "drag rings" [...] that slowed and stabilized the torpedo in flight and cushioned its impact with the water and [...] "shroud rings" [...] (also known as the [...] "ring tail") that reinforced the vulnerable tail fins. They also tested and developed a box-shaped wooden tail that stabilized the torpedo in flight and absorbed energy as it was stripped off as the torpedo entered the water, based on the Kyoban series of similar aerodynamic tails, first developed in 1936 by the Japanese for their Type 91 torpedo used at the Attack on Pearl Harbor, but first observed at the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 8, 1942.|$|E
50|$|This type of winding {{structure}} {{creates an}} optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. In {{order to do}} so, the windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves, provided by the lower layer. If the circles are superposed, it can be seen, that the most compact design {{can be achieved by}} using an arrangement with a 60 degree angle. The ratio of provided space to the part of the circle can be determined mathematically.The best spatial use can be achieved if the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference, in order to fulfill the stated requirement. When the winding has been placed around the coil body it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and coil bobbin geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the winding direction. As a consequence a bigger winding width of the coil, leads to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section {{at the side of the}} winding.Due to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump shape. Experience has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.|$|E

40|$|Which plane graphs admit a {{straight}} line representations such that all faces have {{the shape of a}} triangle? We present a characterization based on <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> assignements, i. e., selections of angles of the graph that have size π in the representation. Another characterization is in terms of contact systems of pseudosegments. We use discrete harmonic functions to show that contact systems of pseudosegments that respect certain conditions are stretchable. The drawback of the characterization is that we are not able to effectively check whether a given graph admits a <b>flat</b> <b>angle</b> assignment that fulfills the conditions. Hence it is still open to decide whether the recognition of graphs that admit straight line triangle representation is polynomially tractable...|$|E
