25|$|Apheresis {{platelets}} {{are collected}} using a mechanical device that draws {{blood from the}} donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected. The remaining blood is returned to the donor. The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, {{as opposed to the}} multiple donations for whole-blood platelets. This means that a recipient is not exposed to as many different donors and has less risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and other complications. Sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk. Pathogen reduction of platelets using for example, riboflavin and UV light treatments can also be carried out to reduce the <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> of pathogens contained in donated blood products, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of transfusion transmitted diseases. Another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and UVA light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and leukocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion. In addition, apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than “soft spin” centrifugation at isolating the desired blood component.|$|E

The opinion provides a quantitative assessment of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> that might enter the food and feed chain yearly if bovine intestine and mesentery from animals {{born and raised in the}} EU would be re-allowed for consumption. Data on the evolution of the BSE infectious titre; and of the weight of histological structures accumulating BSE infectivity, were collected. The Cattle TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM) was used to estimate the number of BSE infected cattle entering undetected in the food and feed chain yearly. A model named TSEi was developed to estimates the BSE <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> in tissues from infected animals at different ages and the total yearly <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> that could enter the food and feed chain in the EU 27. In BSE infected cattle, the infectivity associated with intestine and mesentery reaches its maximum in animals younger than 18 months and then progressively declines to a minimum value in animals older than 60 months. Due to the decline of the BSE prevalence in the EU, between 2007 and 2012, the yearly amount of BSE infectivity associated with intestine and mesentery (sent to destruction) from animals entering the food and feed chain was reduced by a factor of 10. However, over this period, the maximum level of exposure to the BSE agent for individuals that would have consumed these tissues remained stable. Finally, th...|$|E

It has been postulated, however, that BKPyV infection originates from the kidney allograft. Because BKPyV seroreactivity correlates with BKPyV replication and thus might mirror the <b>infectious</b> <b>load,</b> we investigated whether BKPyV seroreactivity of the donor predicts viremia and BKPyV-associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN) in the recipient. In a retrospective cohort of 407 living kidney donor-recipient pairs, pretransplantation {{donor and recipient}} sera were tested for BKPyV IgG levels and correlated with the occurrence of recipient BKPyV viremia and BKPyVAN within 1 year after transplantation. Donor BKPyV IgG level was strongly associated with BKPyV viremia and BKPyVAN (p < 0. 001), whereas recipient BKPyV seroreactivity showed a nonsignificant inverse trend. Pairing of high-BKPyV-seroreactive donors with low-seroreactive recipients resulted in a 10 -fold increased risk of BKPyV viremia (hazard ratio 10. 1, 95 % CI 3. 5 - 29. 0, p < 0. 001). In multivariate analysis, donor BKPyV seroreactivity was the strongest pretransplantation factor associated with viremia (p < 0. 001) and BKPyVAN (p = 0. 007). The proportional relationship between donor BKPyV seroreactivity and recipient infection suggests that donor BKPyV seroreactivity reflects the <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> of the kidney allograft and calls {{for the use of}} pretransplantation BKPyV serological testing of (potential) donors and recipients...|$|E

For HIV RNA levels, females had lower levels than males (0. 19 log 10 lower; P = 0. 04), but no differences were observed by risk group.

40|$|Virological assays {{for human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 load and drug resistance can broadly be divided into culture-based and molecular biology-based methods. Culture-based methods give a direct measure of <b>infectious</b> virus <b>load</b> and phenotypic drug resistance, whereas molecular biology-based methods are indirect, assaying nucleic acid levels to determine virus load and point mutations associated with drug resistance. We have compared culture-based and non-culture-based methods for patients enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial of zidovudine (the Concorde Trial). Virus loads were assayed by culture of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) or quantitative PCR, and drug resistance was assayed in culture or in a quantitative, PCR-based point mutation assay. The rates of detection of viremia and drug resistance were higher by PCR than by culture for this population of subjects. Comparison of the virus loads by the two measures showed a good correlation for virus loads in PBMCs but a poor correlation for virus loads in plasma. The latter result probably reflected the inaccuracies of culture in assaying plasma with the low infectious virus titers seen in the study population. The concordance of phenotypic and genotypic drug resistance methods was high, with all phenotypically resistant isolates having at least one resistance-associated mutation and with no mutations being found in a drug-sensitive isolate. Genomic resistance scores (weighted sums of levels of resistance mutations) showed good correlations with the levels of phenotypic resistance, and both resistance measures were observed to increase as the duration of exposure to drug increased. Overall, non-culture-based methods were shown to correlate well with culture-based methods and offer a low-cost, high-throughput alternative.

Several novel peptides representing mimotopes of the carbohydrate moiety of the chlamydial glycolipid exoantigen were identified by phage display 1. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA), which measure specific antibody responses, had shown that peptide-specific serum antibodies were induced by vaccination before exposure to whole Chlamydia (infection). Those antibody responses correlated with reduced <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> and tissue pathology when mice were infected. We used lymphocyte proliferative assays (LPA) to measure T lymphocyte responses to peptides and chlamydial organism. The LPA showed dose-dependent peptide-specific proliferation only with lymphocytes from immunized mice. Spleen and lymph node cells from mice vaccinated with our peptide candidates demonstrated immunity both pre...|$|E
40|$|Background. Trachoma, {{caused by}} {{repeated}} infections with ocular Chlamydia trachomatis, is targeted for elim-ination using multiple annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic communities. Infection rates do not decline as expected in some communities, leading to concerns about azithromycin resistance. Methods. After 3 yearly MDAs in 32 communities in Tanzania, 107 children were identified 1 year later with infection. All were provided MDA again, and 90 were seen again at 2 months, of whom 30 had infection. Chlamydia trachomatis isolates were obtained {{before and after}} MDA in 15 paired samples and were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. The <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> of C. trachomatis before MDA was determined in 30 children who had infection at both times and 60 whose infection cleared. Results. The median load was 8. 6 genome copies per polymerase chain reaction in the consistently infected, and 8. 4 in those whose infection cleared (P =. 86). For the consistently infected, the average minimum inhibitory con-centration was 0. 26 µg/mL for azithromycin before and 0. 20 µg/mL after MDA. All isolates had minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 0. 50 µg/mL. Conclusions. There {{is no evidence that}} continued infection after MDA was due either to resistance to azithro-mycin or to a heavier load of organism before treatment. Other potential causes of persistent infection need to be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman rhinoviruses (HRV) {{represent}} {{the single most}} important etiological agents of the common cold and are the most frequent cause of acute respiratory infections in humans. Currently the performance of available animal models for immunization studies using HRV challenge is very limited. The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a well-recognized model for the study of human respiratory viral infections. In this work we show that, without requiring any genetic modification of either the host or the virus, intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV 16 resulted in measurable isolation of infective virus, lower respiratory tract pathology, mucus production, and expression of interferon-activated genes. Intramuscular immunization with live HRV 16 generated robust protective immunity that correlated with high serum levels of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, cotton rats treated prophylactically with hyperimmune anti-HRV 16 serum were protected against HRV 16 intranasal challenge. Finally, protection by immunization was efficiently transferred from mothers to newborn animals resulting in a substantial reduction of <b>infectious</b> virus <b>loads</b> in the lung following intranasal challenge. Overall, our results demonstrate that the cotton rat provides valuable additional model development options for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against rhinovirus infection...|$|R
40|$|Infant {{mortality}} {{at birth}} may help illuminate {{the usefulness of}} season of birth {{as an indicator of}} early life exposures. We obtained data for infant mortality rates (IMR) at the county (municipio) level during the late 1920 s-early 1940 s in Puerto Rico using historical records and linked IMR with individual birth year and place using the PREHCO (Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions) study. We classified PREHCO respondents into two groups according to high or low <b>infectious</b> disease <b>load,</b> corresponding to lower or higher proportion endogenous mortality in the year respondents were born. We estimated the effects of IMR (using continuous, logit, quartile, Box-Cox transformations) and season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then by subgroups, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent’s educational level, adult behavior (smoking, exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height, childhood SES). Findings: (1) no significant associations between IMR and heart disease or diabetes but significant associations between high IMR and low knee height, low education, older age and no rigorous exercise as an adult; (2) stronger effects of season of birth on adult health among respondents born in years with lower infectious disease loads; (3) stron...|$|R

When cardiovascular diseases are viewed from an evolutionary biology perspective, a heightened thrifty and an inflammatory design could be their mechanisms. Human ancestors confronted a greater <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> and were subjected to the selection for proinflammatory genes and a strong inflammatory function. Ancestors also faced starvation periods that pressed for a thrifty genotype which caused fat accumulation. The pressure of sustaining gluconeogenesis during periods of poor nourishment selected individuals with insulin resistance. Obesity induces a proinflammatory state due to the secretion of adipokines which underlie cardiometabolic diseases. Our actual lifestyle needs no more of such proinflammatory and thrifty genotypes and these ancestral genesmight increase predisposition to diseases. Risk factors for atherosclerosis and diabetes are based on inflammatory and genetic foundations that can {{be accounted for by}} excess fat. Longevity has also increased in recent times and is related to a proinflammatory response with cardiovascular consequences. If human ancestral lifestyle could be recovered by increasing exercise and adapting a calorie restriction diet, obesity would decrease and the effects on chronic low-grade inflammation would be limited. Thereby, the rates of both atherosclerosis and diabetes could be reduced. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Within the genera Chlamydia, the {{development}} of refined diagnostic techniques has allowed the identification of four species {{that are capable of}} infecting pigs. The epidemiology, clinical, and zoonotic impacts of these species are however largely unknown. The study aimed to investigate the presence of Chlamydia spp. in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs, and relate the findings to clinical signs. Results By histology, 20 of 48 pigs had intestinal lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection. By PCR, forty-six of the pigs were positive whereas two samples were inhibited. Sequencing of 19 DNA extracts identified these as Chlamydia suis. By immunohistochemistry, 32 of 44 samples were positive and a significant relationship was detected between macroscopically visible intestinal lesions and a high degree of infection. By real-time PCR, a significant difference was detected between pigs with and without conjunctivitis when a Ct value of 36 was employed but not when a Ct value of 38 was employed. Conclusions Chlamydia suis was demonstrated in most samples and overall, no correlation to clinical signs was detected. However, a correlation was noted between samples {{with a high degree of}} infection and the presence of clinical signs. It is possible, that the intensive pig production systems studied might predispose for the transmission and maintenance of the infection thus increasing the <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> and the risk for disease in the pig. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of the > 98 % genomic {{similarity}} among Chlamydia trachomatis serovars, the higher worldwide ecological success of E and F is enigmatic. We intend to provide a quick overview of the molecular data that distinguish these from the remaining strains. Examples are: -	E and F possess a similar chromosomal genetic make-up distinct from the remaining genotypes. Some loci linked to this independent co-segregation comprehend membrane proteins, hypothetical virulence factors, and regulatory regions (published data). -	Some loci reveal nonrandom mutational patterns, where mutations exclusive of E and F are clustered in specific protein domains, likely promoting strains functional and/or structural attributes (published data). -	Based on data from a worldwide survey, MOMP of E and F exhibit the lowest mutation rate (22. 3 -fold lower), implying more fitted antigenic profiles to deal with host immunity (published data). -	The likelihood of E and F strains to undergo genetic recombination is about 12 -fold lower than that of the other genotypes (P< 10 - 2), suggesting a putative clonal evolution, where superimposed favorable clones may be strongly maintained in vivo (preliminary data from our lab). -	Strains E and F do not seem to originate higher <b>infectious</b> <b>load</b> in vivo, when compared with other genital genotypes (published data). Full-genomic data from multiple and diverse clinical isolates will be essential to decipher the secret behind the higher ecological success of E and F strains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{asymptomatic}} {{phase of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} 1 (HIV- 1) infection the lymphatic tissues seem {{to function as a}} major reservoir of HIV. We have examined the viral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lymph node mononuclear cells (LNMC) of 12 naturally and 4 experimentally long-term simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected African green monkeys (AGM) to help explain the apathogenicity of the AGM isolates of SIV (SIVagm) in their natural host. The mean number of SIVagmproducing cells determined by limiting dilution assay was found to be 1. 7 ± 2. 2 and 2. 1 ± 3. 3 per 105 PBMC or LNMC, respectively. Similarly, polymerase chain reaction analysis of serially diluted cells showed the mean provirus carrying cell number to be 2. 8 ± 3. 7 per 105 PBMC and 4. 0 ± 5. 5 per 105 LNMC. When normalized for CD 4 +cells the provirus and <b>infectious</b> virus <b>loads</b> in the LNMC and PBMC were also similar. No trapping of virus particles could be detected byin situhybridization or immunohistochemistry. The data demonstrate that in contrast to HIV- 1 -infected humans, the viral burden in the lymph nodes of long-term SIVagm-infected AGMs is comparable to that in the PBMC...|$|R
40|$|Host {{defense against}} multicellular, {{extracellular}} pathogens such as nematode parasites {{is believed to}} be mediated largely, if not exclusively, by T lymphocytes. During our investigations into the course of Brugia malayi and Brugia pahangi infections in immunodeficient mouse models, we found that mice lacking B lymphocytes were permissive for Brugian infections, whereas immunocompetent mice were uniformly resistant. Mice bearing the Btkxid mutation were as permissive as those lacking all B cells, suggesting that the B 1 subset may be responsible for host protection. Reconstitution of immunodeficient recombination activating gene (Rag) - 1 �/ � mice with B 1 B cells conferred resistance, {{even in the absence of}} conventional B 2 lymphocytes and most T cells. These results suggest that B 1 B cells are necessary to mediate host resistance to Brugian infection. Our data are consistent with a model wherein early resistance to B. malayi is mediated by humoral immune response, with a significant attrition of the incoming <b>infectious</b> larval <b>load.</b> Sterile clearance of the remaining parasite burden appears to require cellmediated immunity. These data raise the possibility that the identification of molecule(s) recognized by humoral immune mechanisms might help generate prophylactic vaccines.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} variable reporting and coding practices on the measurement of maternal mortality in urban and rural Scotland, 1861 - 1901, using recorded causes of death and women who died within six weeks of childbirth. This setting provides data (n= 604 maternal deaths) to compare maternal mortality identified by cause of death with maternal mortality identified by record linkage and to contrast urban and rural settings with different certification practices. We find that underreporting was most significant for indirect causes, and that indirect causes accounted for {{a high proportion of}} maternal mortality where the <b>infectious</b> disease <b>load</b> was high. However, distinguishing between indirect and direct maternal mortality can be problematic even where cause of death reporting appears accurate. Paradoxically, underreporting of maternal deaths was higher in urban areas where deaths were routinely certified by doctors, and we argue that where there are significant differences in medical provision and reported deaths, differences in maternal mortality may reflect certification practices as much as true differences. Better health services might therefore give the impression that maternal mortality was lower than it actually was. We end with reflections on the interpretation of maternal mortality statistics and implications for the concept of the obstetric transition...|$|R
