40|$|Torque {{being a very}} {{important}} physical parameter, plays a very vital role in various applications like aviation, automobile, power and agriculture industries. Torque is, generally, measured by mechanical type torque meters/torque wrenches, having higher uncertainty. These mechanical type torque meters/torque wrenches need to be calibrated using strain gauged <b>torque</b> <b>transducers.</b> Hence, there is acute thrust over development of precise and reliable strain gauge based <b>torque</b> <b>transducers.</b> In the present work, a <b>torque</b> <b>transducer</b> of capacity 5 Nm has been studied.

40|$|A new <b>torque</b> <b>transducer</b> {{with high}} {{overload}} capability and direct frequency output is reported. It employs the recently developed metallic triple-beam resonators with thick-film printed {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) drive and pickup elements. The new <b>torque</b> <b>transducer</b> has been tested in a torque range of up to 20 Nm, resulting in a strain level of 400 microstrain on the measurement shaft surface and giving a large frequency-change output of 800 Hz. The strain level required by the new <b>torque</b> <b>transducer</b> can be much lower (~ 100 microstrain) than the level (~ 1800 microstrain) usually required by conventional metallic resistance-strain-gauge-based <b>torque</b> <b>transducers,</b> thus increasing the transducer overload capability by a large factor. Nevertheless, under such a low strain level, the new <b>torque</b> <b>transducer</b> can still output an adequately large frequency change of 200 Hz for measurement.

50|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>transducer,</b> {{similar to}} a load cell, is an {{electronic}} device used to convert torque into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the torque being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge converts the deformation (strain) to electrical signals. A <b>torque</b> <b>transducer</b> usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. <b>Torque</b> <b>transducers</b> {{of one or two}} strain gauges are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few millivolts and usually requires amplification by an instrumentation amplifier before it can be used. The output of the transducer is plugged into an algorithm to calculate the force applied to the transducer. There are several styles available for <b>torque</b> <b>transducers.</b> Rotary, stationary (reaction), and inline are used for different calibration and audit purposes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract − In {{the strict}} sense, {{traceability}} of torque measurement with rotating <b>torque</b> <b>transducers</b> is given only for non-rotating operation. The presented study examines in how far such proof of traceability is valid also for rotating operation.

40|$|In {{the spark}} {{ignition}} engine system, driver convenience is very dependent on satisfying <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> appropriate with the throttle position given by the driver. Unfortunately, sometimes the fulfillment of <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> is not in line with fuel saving efforts. This requires the development of high performance and robust power train controllers. One way to potentially meet these performance requirements is to introduce a method of controlling <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> using fuzzy gain scheduling. By using this method, the throttle opening commanded by the driver will be corrected by throttle correction signal that guarantees <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> output will follow the desired <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> input, and also reducing fuel consumption. In this case, {{spark ignition engine}} with automatic transmission is used to meet a good performance under this controller design...|$|R
50|$|Commonly, {{torque sensors}} or <b>torque</b> <b>transducers</b> use strain gauges {{applied to a}} {{rotating}} shaft or axle. With this method, a means to power the strain gauge bridge is necessary, {{as well as a}} means to receive the signal from the rotating shaft. This can be accomplished using slip rings, wireless telemetry, or rotary transformers. Newer types of <b>torque</b> <b>transducers</b> add conditioning electronics and an A/D converter to the rotating shaft. Stator electronics then read the digital signals and convert those signals to a high-level analog output signal, such as +/-10VDC.|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{injection}} gasoline engine, or better known as spark ignition engines, an effort to improve engine performance {{as well as to}} reduce fuel consumption is a fairly complex problem. Generally, engine performance improvement efforts will lead to increase in fuel consumption. However, this problem can be solved by implementing <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> control based on intelligent regulation such as the fuzzy logic inference system. In this study, fuzzy logic <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> regulation is used to control the throttle position entered by the driver to achieve optimal <b>engine</b> <b>torque.</b> An <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> vs. throttle position and engine speed mapping for vehicles with economical function is used to build this control process regulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of key factors on the powertrain loading dynamic characteristics and fatigue damage. First, the engine and the transmission output shaft torque of a multi-axle vehicle powertrain system were measured by proving grounds (PG) testing and analyzed with a conclusion that the powertrain loading changes were mainly related to three key factors: the mean <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> the harmonic <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> and the vibration properties of the system. Subsequently, a dynamic model considering the three factors was built and validated by the test data. Finally, fatigue damage of shaft parts and gear parts were calculated to investigate the influence degrees of the three factors. The results show that, the harmonic <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> and the vibration properties of the powertrain system have a great influence on the fatigue damage of shaft parts, and the mean <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> is the main factor causing the fatigue damage of gear parts...|$|R

In line with national efforts {{to come up with}} energy sources that are both environmentally friendly and sustainable, this work was carried out to compare performance properties of native crude marula (Sclerocarya birrea) seed oil and petrodiesel fuel on a variable compression engine test rig with automatic data acquisition set up. Parameters such as <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> brake power and specific fuel consumption were measured at different loads for the two fuels. The results indicate that engine performance when powered with crude marula oil compares favourable with those for petrodiesel. Optimum numerical values for <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> brake power and specific fuel consumption were 28. 2 Nm, 6. 27 W and 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 22. 7 Nm, 6. 6 W, 0. 33 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil. The engine performance was also analysed for same parameters, namely, <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> brake power and specific fuel consumption when powered using the same fuels over a range of compression ratios while the load was fixed at 80 %. Optimum numerical values for <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> brake power and specific fuel consumption were 27. 2 Nm, 3. 67 W and 0. 59 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 26. 3 Nm, 3. 6 W, 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil. The results indicate that compression ratio of 16 : 1 yields optimum engine performance in terms of <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> and brake power for both fuels under review. However, marula oil fuel recorded smooth steady increase in performance profile across all compression ratios which out-performs petrodiesel on lower compression ratios for <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> and brake power, and is largely better than petrodiesel on fuel consumption...|$|R
