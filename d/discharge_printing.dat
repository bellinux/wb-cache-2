40|$|Textile <b>discharge</b> <b>printing</b> is {{the most}} {{versatile}} and important of {{the methods used for}} introducing design to textile fabrics. In discharge styles, the pattern is produced by the chemical destruction of the original dye in the printed areas. The discharging agents used can be oxidising or reducing agents, acids, alkalis and various salts. However, the most important methods of discharging are based formaldehyde sulphoxylates and thiourea dioxide. Recently, environmental and industrial safety concerns have increased the potential for the use of enzymes in textile processing to ensure eco-friendly production. Formaldehyde sulphoxylate (NaHSO 2. CH 2 O. 2 H 2 O) {{is one of the most}} powerful discharging agents; however, it is quite toxic and produces formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen associated with nasal sinus cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. In this work, a hazardous chemical has been replaced with eco-friendly horseradish peroxidase enzyme in textile <b>discharge</b> <b>printing.</b> Enzymatic <b>discharge</b> <b>printing</b> was carried out with a phenol oxidising enzyme system such that the reactive dye was selectively discharged from the cotton fabric in selected areas, creating a printed surface. The effects of enzyme concentration, pH of the printing paste, treatment time and the temperature of enzymatic treatment were studied. The optimum conditions for enzymatic <b>discharge</b> <b>printing</b> were found to be pH 8. 5 at 70 °C with a dye concentration of 80 g/L and 60 min as the treatment time. Key words...|$|E

40|$|This {{creative}} study {{focuses on}} the design and production of innovative visual effects in fashion fabrics, in particular on textile printing {{and the use of}} certain printing techniques to impart a relief surface to the cloth. Close {{attention has been paid to}} fashion trends and forecasts in order to develop innovative textile products. Research in the form of fashion mood boards can be found in Appendix 3. Recent technological and socio-economic developments are resulting in trends towards shorter industrial production runs and a greater flexibility in design. The designer therefore has more opportunity to become involved in the production process,enabling a greater degree of textile development This research suggests that a working knowledge of the technical aspects of industrial and craft-based processes can enable the textile designer to use these factors as design tools which can allow innovation within design for fashion. Practical research of textile printing and other coloration techniques has been documented within the framework of a dictionary of visual effects. This was used as a point of reference to explore the possibility of increasing design potential by the combination of elements, and can be found in Appendix 2. Combination elements include sculptural techniques; devore printing and wool fabric sculpturing, together with coloration by dyeing and direct and <b>discharge</b> <b>printing.</b> A plain knitted base cloth was included to increase combination possibilities. The fibres explored were primarily the protein fibres, and they were combined with other natural and synthetic fibres. Visual results of this research and processing routes can be found in Appendix 2...|$|E
40|$|This work {{developed}} out {{of earlier}} textile research, which was process-led. I had already used {{techniques such as}} burning, rusting and weaving human hair into fabrics in the 1990 s for Alexander McQueen and for Donna Karan’s 1995 Florence Biennale exhibit. For Karan I developed those design ideas using devoré, a technique that etches patterns into fabrics with a pile such as velvet. I produced a series of 3 m x 1. 4 m devoré panels featuring large, gestural marks without a repeat. Each panel was individual and was engineered for a specific garment. My close collaboration with Karan meant that my textile designs impacted on her fashion designs, for example when her designs incorporated patterns I had burnt out on satin fabric that she subsequently sent back to me to add in beading. I further developed this way of designing for Karan’s “Vietnam Collection” (S/S 2001). Here I produced a multiple stripe pattern as a black print on ivory chiffon and as a <b>discharge</b> <b>print</b> on black matt viscose jersey before cutting and collaging the fabric into panels specifically engineered for the body. These were augmented {{in conjunction with the}} designer through a design process of draping and twisting, rather than drawing. The fabric thus dictated and influenced the design rather than the design requiring a fabric. The result was three-dimensional and tactile fabrics with drama and graphic energy. My textiles were used in the Donna Karan catwalk show and featured in the S/S 01 advertising campaign and other international publications, including British, Italian and American Vogue. They can be viewed online at vogue. co. uk, style. com and catwalking. com. This particular look was subsequently copied throughout the industry including in high street fashion, though the technical processes used for the mass market were different and the proportion and balance of the patterns was altered...|$|R
40|$|Over 20 years ago, The Museum at FIT {{received}} an anonymous gift of approximately 165 small textile samples and 27 scarves from the company, Wesley Simpson Custom Fabrics, Inc. The textiles {{dating from the}} late 1930 s through the 1940 s were designed for moderately priced women 2 ̆ 7 s apparel. Printed on rayon crepe grounds, they were typical of the period, loose painterly florals, paisleys, conversationals, and small geometric, abstract and stripe patterns on light-colored grounds or <b>discharge</b> <b>printed</b> on dark grounds. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Brooklyn Museum of Art also have substantial holdings of Wesley Simpson Custom Fabrics, and an examination of all three institutions allows for a fairly comprehensive picture of the company. Fortuitously the textiles in the FIT collection were accompanied by a small archive of ads from newspapers and fashion magazines, promotional photographs and press clippings dating from 1944 to February 1949. What the press material revealed about the company was that spanning the immediate post-WWII period from 1945 to 1949, a concerted {{effort was made to}} bring the company 2 ̆ 7 s name and its textiles {{to the attention of the}} American consumer. Promotional ads appeared in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada, linking the sale of Wesley Simpson Custom Fabrics with specific department stores. Ads appeared in The New York Sun, Indianapolis Star, the Atlanta Constitution, Los Angeles Examiner, the El Paso Dessert News, and The Gazette in Montreal—to name a few. Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s strategy was to sell his textiles in one particular retail store in a given city. According to an industry publication, Retailing Home Furnishings, he had by March of 1947 a customer list of approximately 350 stores. The company 2 ̆ 7 s rayon textiles were priced to appeal to the moderate market and sold in the home-sewing departments of stores for 1. 19 to S 3. 98 a yard.

40|$|This {{site-specific}} textile installation {{was made}} for the international exhibition Cloth and Memory 2 at Salts Mill, Yorkshire. Research was based on visits to the vast redundant spinning area of the mill, where my thoughts turned to past working lives. I {{was drawn to the}} floor: the large grey flagstones are irregularly sized rectangles carefully fitted together to make an indestructible industrial surface. Inspired by how these stones were fitted, and the water stains from a leaking roof, I decided to make something at ground level to be walked around and observed from above. Research into the mill, the workers, and their life/work conditions informed my choice to focus on the handkerchief, as a common but largely historic artefact, owned by most, for use or simply as commemorative gifts. I collected hundreds of vintage hankies, from different shops and people, and even some found on the street. Every handkerchief had a memory embedded in it: a monogram, a hand embroidered edge, worn holes, stains or folds. Each piece was worked on individually, dyed black, destroying its individuality temporarily; but the details, weave, initials, embroidery and edges all came back to life through <b>discharge</b> <b>printing</b> to different tones and colour. The final piece grew over six months, handkerchiefs being positioned and stitched dependent on size, colour and quality of cloth. This installation piece was the largest and most ambitious textile I have created. It is different from previous work and generated new and challenging ways of thinking, working, constructing and exhibiting. The exhibition as a whole was about pushing the boundaries of textiles and all 23 artists responded to the extraordinary site embracing dirt, dust, history and space. The work is documented/discussed in Cloth and Memory 2 (ed. Lesley Millar, Salts Estates Ltd, 2013), to which I also contributed...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a print head for applying a printing medium to a substrate, in particular a semiconductor structure {{such as a}} photovoltaic solar cell, having a print head housing and a valve element, wherein the print head housing {{has at least one}} feed opening for feeding in printing medium and a plurality of outlet openings for <b>discharging</b> the <b>printing</b> medium, wherein the valve element is mounted rotatably in the print head housing, in order to switch between a first printing operating state, in which the feed opening is connected in a fluid-conducting manner to the outlet openings, and a second shut-off operating state, {{in which there is no}} fluid-conducting connection between the feed opening and the outlet openings. The invention is characterized in that the print head has at least one flushing medium connector and the valve element is configured and mounted rotatably in the print head housing in such a way that, in a third flushing operating state, the flushing medium connector is connected in a fluid-conducting manner to the outlet openings and, in the first and second operating state, there is no fluid-conducting connection between the flushing medium connector and the outlet openings...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a hospital-wide computer system that produces on-line, partially automated discharge summaries, assists nursing staff with discharge functions, and stores a core clinical database on all patients. The system was created using only tools and functions contained within the existing order-entry/results reporting hospital information system. Data enters the discharge database in three ways: direct transfer from the information system, on line selection by physicians and nurses of specific data already contained in the system (eg. lab and radiology results), and by typed input of varying amounts of text (eg. chief complaint, hospital course). If completed the night prior to discharge, the system produces several products for residents and nurses, included typed prescriptions, the <b>printed</b> <b>discharge</b> summary, nursing referral or patient care forms, and simple discharge planning information for the patient. During the course of a 9 week pilot program, 428 summaries were completed on the system, 420 of which met JCHAO criteria...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{preprinted}} form in ensuring an improved and sustained quality of documentation of clinical data in compliance with the national guidelines for sedation by non-anaesthetists. DESIGN: The process of retrospective case note audit was used to identify areas of poor performance, reiterate national guidelines, introduce a post-sedation advice sheet, and demonstrate improvement. SETTING: Emergency Department, Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton. SUBJECTS: Forty seven patients requiring sedation for relocation of a dislocated shoulder or manipulation of a Colles' fracture between July and October 1996 and July and October 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence that the following items had been documented: consent for procedure, risk assessment, monitored observations, prophylactic use of supplementary oxygen, and <b>discharging</b> patients with <b>printed</b> advice. Case note review was performed before (n = 23) and after (n = 24) the introduction of a sedation audit form. Notes were analysed for the above outcome measures. The monitored observations analysed included: pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, electrocardiography, and conscious level. RESULTS: Use of the form significantly improved documentation of most parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of the form, together with staff education, resulted in enhanced documentation of data and improved conformity with national guidelines. A risk management approach to preempting critical incidents following sedation, can be adopted in this area of emergency medicine...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discover}} how often hospital discharge summaries {{were available to}} physicians seeing patients for follow-up visits after hospitalization. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Teaching hospital in Ottawa, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 792 patients discharged from an internal medicine service after treatment for acute illness. We determined when and by which physician each patient was seen during the first 6 months after discharge. We also determined the date each patient's <b>discharge</b> summary was <b>printed</b> and the physicians to whom it was sent. We confirmed that summaries were received {{by means of a}} survey or by telephoning physicians' offices. Patients were observed for 6 months or until they were readmitted to hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of follow-up visits to physicians for which discharge summaries were available. RESULTS: During the observation period, patients made 6619 visits (median six per patient, interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 9) to 914 different physicians (median three per patient, IQR 2 to 4). Discharge summaries were available for only 996 (15 %) visits. Summaries were available for only 65 initial visits (8. 2 %); no summaries were available for any visit for 542 (68. 4 %) patients. Summaries were most commonly unavailable because they were not generated in time for follow-up visits (20. 0 %) or were not sent to follow-up physicians (50. 8 %). CONCLUSION: At our institution, discharge summaries often did not get to physicians seeing patients after discharge from hospital...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Hospital {{discharge}} is {{a transition}} of care, where medication discrepancies {{are likely to}} occur and potentially cause patient harm. The purpose of our study {{was to assess the}} prescribing accuracy of hospital discharge medication orders at a London, UK teaching hospital. The timeliness of the discharge summary reaching the general practitioner (GP, family physician) was also assessed based on the 72 h target referenced in the Care Quality Commission report. 1 Method: 501 consecutive discharge medication orders from 142 patients were examined and the following records were compared (1) the final inpatient drug chart at the point of <b>discharge,</b> (2) <b>printed</b> signed copy of the initial to take away (TTA) discharge summary produced electronically by the physician, (3) the pharmacist's amendments on the initial TTA that were hand written, (4) the final electronic patient discharge summary record, (5) the patients final take home medication from the hospital. Discrepancies between the physician's order (6) and pharmacist's change(s) (7) were compared with two types of failures – ‘failure to make a required change’ and ‘change where none was required’. Once the patient was discharged, the patient's GP, was contacted 72 h after discharge to see if the patient discharge summary, sent by post or via email, was received. Results: Over half the patients seen (73 out of 142) patients had at least one discrepancy that was made on the initial TTA by the doctor and amended by the pharmacist. Out of the 501 drugs, there were 140 discrepancies, 108 were ‘failures to make a required change’ (77 %) and 32 were ‘changes where none were required’ (23 %). The types of ‘failures to make required changes’ discrepancies that were found between the initial TTA and pharmacist's amendments were paracetamol and ibuprofen changes (dose banding) 38 (27 %), directions of use 34 (24 %), incorrect formulation of medication 28 (20 %) and incorrect strength 8 (6 %). The types of ‘changes where none were required discrepancies’ were omitted medication 15 (11 %), unnecessary drug 14 (10 %) and incorrect medicine including spelling mistakes 3 (2 %). After contacting the GPs of the discharged patients 72 h postdischarge; 49 % had received the discharge summary and 45 % had not, the remaining 6 % were patients who were discharged without a GP. Conclusion: This study shows that doctor prescribing at discharge is often not accurate, and interventions made by pharmacist to reconcile are important at this point of care. It was also found that half the discharge summaries had not reached the patient's family physician (according to the GP) within 72 h...|$|R
