5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system.</b> Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} absorbed through the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system.</b> Inhalation of vanadium and vanadium compounds results primarily in {{adverse effects on}} the respiratory system. Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose. Other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures on blood parameters, liver, neurological development, and other organs in rats.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system</b> and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} between the respiratory and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>systems</b> has been long recognized and depends on various anatomical, physiological and pathological mechanisms. The certain recognition of some interactions, such as the {{relation between}} asthma and gastroesophageal reflux, {{is more or less}} intuitive to the pulmonogist, whereas other areas of confluence are more easily missed, such as the relation between airway disorders and inflammatory bowel disease. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the interaction between the lung and the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>systems,</b> as far as anatomy, physiology, pathology, clinical manifestations and therapeutical options go.

This intestinal lymphoid follicle plays an important role in the immune system of the digestive tract.|$|R
40|$|Accidental {{poisoning}} {{of workers}} occurs occasionally in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Some {{of the chemicals}} involved in industrial poisoning are unique and rarely available to the general public. One such case of poisoning due to dimethyl sulphate fumes is described. Death due to this poison has been rarely reported in lit-erature. The respiratory and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>systems</b> are its primary targets. The diagnosis and prevention of this poisoning is of paramount importance...|$|R
25|$|Both {{classical}} and atypical Timothy syndromes {{are caused by}} mutations in CACNA1C. These mutations are in exon 8 (atypical form) and exon 8a (classical form), an alternatively spliced exon. Exon 8a is highly expressed in the heart, brain, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system,</b> lungs, immune system and smooth muscle. Exon 8 is also expressed in these regions and its level is approximately 5-fold higher than exon 8a expression.|$|E
25|$|Like amygdalin, {{laetrile}} is hydrolyzed in the duodenum (alkaline) {{and in the}} intestine (enzymatically) to D-glucuronic {{acid and}} L-mandelonitrile; the latter hydrolyzes to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, that in sufficient quantities causes cyanide poisoning. Intravenous laetrile does not result in cyanide exposure. This {{is due to the}} fact that the necessary enzymes are released either upon chewing the plant material or are provided by bacteria residing in the human <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} disease {{had more than one}} form. The other major forms are Becker, limb-girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and EDMD. Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, being caused by a {{mutation}} of a gene located on the X chromosome, predominantly affect males, although females can sometimes have severe symptoms, as well. Most types of MD are multisystem disorders with manifestations in body systems including the heart, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system,</b> nervous system, endocrine glands, eyes, and brain.|$|E

25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system.</b> Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|Frequently alcoholics have {{disrupted}} social {{links in}} their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic gastritis, and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system</b> and reduces absorption of nutrients that are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|During late 2015, {{work being}} done on St Peter's Burial Ground in advance of road {{construction}} involved the disinterment of the remains of nearly 2,000 individuals who had been buried there during the cemetery's period of operation (1821-1945). The burial ground had been connected with the former St Peter's Church, a large one which seated some 1,500 people, which was demolished in 1976. Archaeologists found that {{nearly half of the}} bodies were those of young children, who appeared to have died quickly during the mid-19th century from illnesses affected the lungs and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system.</b> The numbers are taken as reflecting the massive increase in the city's population during that period due to its booming textile industry, which led to unhealthy living situations among the working classes.|$|E
