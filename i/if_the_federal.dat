5|$|Specter {{criticized the}} federal {{government}}'s policy on cancer, stating {{the day after}} Jack Kemp—the 1996 Republican vice presidential nominee and former congressman—died of cancer, that Kemp would still be alive <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government had {{done a better job}} funding cancer research.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{delegations}} {{from the}} Southern states, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens would effectively pay {{a portion of}} the debt of other states <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and foreign debt at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{proposed}} <b>federal</b> {{law would}} undermine a stronger Vermont law if passed, {{according to state}} officials and advocacy groups. The reporting threshold under <b>the</b> proposed <b>federal</b> law is $500 - {{much higher than the}} $25 threshold found in a similar Vermont law passed five years ago. <b>If</b> passed, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> bill would preempt the state law.|$|R
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{property}} is an enclave, then {{the federal government}} has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land to the federal government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal enclave, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is criminal or civil. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> property is not an enclave, the federal government either has concurrent jurisdiction (shared authority with the state) or proprietary jurisdiction (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture is {{broadly defined}} as the {{production}} of fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants in a controlled environment. This report discusses the growth of U.

Relevant legislation and policies are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

25|$|During the campaign, Conrad {{pledged that}} he would not stand for {{re-election}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> budget deficit had not fallen substantially {{by the end of his}} term. By 1992 it became obvious that this would not be the case, and although polls showed that the electorate would have welcomed his reneging on that pledge, Conrad considered his promise binding and did not run for re-election. Byron Dorgan won the Democratic primary election.|$|E
25|$|Monetarists {{follow the}} {{explanation}} given by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz. They {{argue that the}} Great Depression {{was caused by the}} banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction by 35%. This caused a price drop by 33% (deflation). By not lowering interest rates, by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the Federal Reserve passively watched the transforming of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve had taken aggressive action.|$|E
25|$|The next day, the Arkansas Secession Convention {{convened in}} the State House in Little Rock. David Walker, who opposed secession, was elected president. The {{convention}} continued in session {{for two and}} a half weeks. Feeling ran high and many fiery speeches were made, but it soon became evident that a majority of the members did not think that the situation at that time called for secession. The convention voted down a resolution condemning Lincoln's inaugural address, and defeated a conditional ordinance of secession. The opinion seemed to prevail that Arkansas should secede only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> government made war on the Confederate States. Still hoping for a compromise settlement that would avoid war, the delegates agreed to go home until after the people had voted on the secession question at a special election to be held in August.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Tardif {{expressed}} the PQ government's opposition to any transfer of flights from Dorval International Airport in Montreal to Mirabel International Airport {{outside of the}} city.

50|$|During {{the years}} of {{transition}} that began with President Reagan's initial attempt to dismantle LSC, LSC programs intensified their efforts to identify funding that could replace, <b>if</b> necessary, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> money that enabled the provision of legal services to poor people. The 1980s and 1990s saw intensified attacks upon federal funding and resulted in major reductions coupled with additional restrictions on clients who could be served, types of cases that could be taken, and means of advocacy.|$|R
500|$|Bradley H. Patterson, Jr., {{a member}} of the Ford administration, {{evaluated}} the tribe's claim and concluded that [...] "Maine's tribes stood to gain a sizeable portion of that state" [...] <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government went forward and litigated the dispute on behalf of the tribe, to which the court had declared the tribe was entitled. Patterson evaluated various other options, and recommended a land and cash settlement; however, in December 1976, Ford decided to pass this issue to the next administration: that of President Jimmy Carter.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{prominent}} placement of Bouchard in the referendum campaign, Parizeau planned to retain all authority {{with regard to}} negotiations, and to appoint {{most members of the}} negotiation team if they were to occur. Parizeau also believed federalist Quebecers such as Chrétien and Charest would be quickly disregarded and replaced at negotiations by representatives from the other nine provinces. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> government refused to negotiate, or if negotiations were to exceed October 30, 1996, Parizeau stated that he would proceed with a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) for an independent Quebec pursuant to Section 26 of the Sovereignty Bill.|$|E
500|$|After South Carolina {{and several}} other states started seceding {{in the winter of}} 1860-61, he still {{advocated}} that Virginia not follow suit. On January 7, 1861, he presented a resolution known as the Anti-Coercion Resolution, which rejected secession, but stated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> government used coercion toward the seceded states, Virginia would fight, which was duly adopted. However, when President Abraham Lincoln made his call for troops on April 15, 1861, he was [...] "from that time forth zealously active in all measures for the defence of his State." [...] The call for troops was precisely the scenario detailed in their Anti-Coercion Resolution and Virginia seceded.|$|E

50|$|In America {{the passing}} of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is a policy that would have benefited <b>if</b> <b>the</b> bottom up {{approach}} were applied (Matthews, 2004). When the NCLB was passed many states struggled in the beginning {{to figure out what was}} required by the legislation, then all States across the America had to get their State education plan approved by U.S. Department of Education (Matthews, 2004). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> education plan was approved then each State had focus on how to incorporate NCLB into the State’s framework of educational governance and how to use the legislation to achieve the State own goals for education performance (Matthews, 2004). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>federal</b> government had consulted with each State about its education policies, performances, future goals, teachers and then <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government would have a better understanding on what policy objectives were achievable at <b>the</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> and State level governments (Matthews, 2004).|$|R
500|$|The {{political}} leaders {{also agreed to}} Austin's stipulation that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government refused to address the petition within several months, Texas residents would form their own state government, essentially declaring independence from Coahuila, if not from Mexico. [...] The central committee elected by the convention was too impatient to wait long. [...] In late December, the committee called for a March election for delegates to the Convention of 1833. [...] The second convention reiterated some of the previous concerns and took additional steps to declare Texas an independent state, further concerning Mexican authories, who feared this was a step towards Texas joining the United States.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln applauded Seward's speech, {{which he}} read in Springfield, {{but refused to}} approve any {{compromise}} {{that could lead to}} a further expansion of slavery. Once Lincoln left Springfield on February 11, he gave speeches, stating in Indianapolis that it would not be coercing a state <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government insisted on retaining or retaking property that belonged to it. [...] This came as the United States Army still held Fort Sumter; the president-elect's words upset moderate southerners. [...] Virginia Congressman Sherrard Clemens wrote, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, by his speech in the North, has done vast harm.

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable.

50|$|Brennan listed some {{situations}} where pendent jurisdiction would be inappropriate. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff's <b>federal</b> law claims are dismissed before trial, {{the state law}} claims should be as well; likewise, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> state law claims predominate in the plaintiff's complaint, the district court may dismiss the state law claims without prejudice for a state court to hear. Also, Brennan explained that in some cases, the likelihood of jury confusion in dealing with separate legal theories of relief could militate in favor of separate trials for <b>the</b> state and <b>federal</b> claims. Brennan concluded {{that even though the}} jury ruled against plaintiff on his <b>federal</b> claim, <b>the</b> preemption issue created a particularly good reason for exercising pendent jurisdiction in this case.|$|R
