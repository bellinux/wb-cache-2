5|$|Bede's primary {{intention}} {{in writing}} the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show {{the growth of the}} united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; {{by the end of the}} Historia the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur M. Diamond argues Hayek's {{problems}} arise {{when he goes}} beyond claims that can be evaluated within economic science. Diamond argued that: “The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited {{in its ability to}} synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.” Chandran Kukathas argues that Hayek's defence of liberalism is unsuccessful because it rests on presuppositions that are incompatible. The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason. Norman P. Barry similarly notes that the “critical rationalism” in Hayek’s writings appears incompatible with “a certain kind of fatalism, that we must wait for evolution to pronounce its verdict.” Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argue that the element of paradox exists in the views of Hayek. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of [...] "invisible hand" [...] evolution that Hayek claimed has created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. Also, John N. Gray summarized this view as [...] "his scheme for an ultra-liberal constitution was a prototypical version of the philosophy he had attacked." [...] Bruce Caldwell wrote: [...] "If one is judging his work against the standard of whether he provided a finished political philosophy, Hayek clearly did not succeed," [...] although he thinks that [...] "economists may find Hayek's political writings useful." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} very odd Americans here who keep {{throwing}} Harold into fits of laughter. One’s a dreadful little man whom indeed <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> kick and who’s always sitting over the fire {{and talking about the}} colour of the sky. I don’t believe he ever saw the sky except through the window-pane. The other day he took hold of my frock—that green one you thought so nice at Homburg—and told me that it reminded him of the texture of the Devonshire turf. And then he talked for half an hour about the Devonshire turf, which I thought such a very extraordinary subject. Harold firmly believes him mad. It’s rather horrid to be living in this way with people one doesn’t know—I mean doesn’t know as one knows them in England.|$|E
6000|$|The Eden story {{provided}} Adam with a sin: the [...] "original sin" [...] {{for which}} we are all damned. Baldly stated, this seems ridiculous; nevertheless it corresponds to something actually existent not only in Paul's consciousness but in our own. The original sin was not the eating of the forbidden fruit, but the consciousness of sin which the fruit produced. The moment Adam and Eve tasted the apple they found themselves ashamed of their sexual relation, which until then had seemed quite innocent to them; {{and there is no}} getting over the hard fact that this shame, or state of sin, has persisted to this day, {{and is one of the}} strongest of our instincts. Thus Paul's postulate of Adam as the natural man was pragmatically true: it worked. But the weakness of Pragmatism is that most theories will work if you put your back into making them work, provided they have some point of contact with human nature. Hedonism will pass the pragmatic test as well as Stoicism. Up to a certain point every social principle that is not absolutely idiotic works: Autocracy works in Russia and Democracy in America; Atheism works in France, Polytheism in India, Monotheism throughout Islam, and Pragmatism, or No-ism, in England. Paul's fantastic conception of the damned Adam, represented by Bunyan as a pilgrim with a great burden of sins on his back, corresponded to the fundamental condition of evolution, which is, that life, including human life, is continually evolving, and must therefore be continually ashamed of itself and its present and past. Bunyan's pilgrim wants to get rid of his bundle of sins; but <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> reach [...] "yonder shining light;" [...] and when at last his bundle falls off him into the sepulchre of Christ, his pilgrimage is still unfinished and his hardest trials still ahead of him. His conscience remains uneasy; [...] "original sin" [...] still torments him; and his adventure with Giant Despair, who throws him into the dungeon of Doubting Castle, from which he escapes by the use of a skeleton key, is more terrible than any he met whilst the bundle was still on his back. Thus Bunyan's allegory of human nature breaks through the Pauline theology at a hundred points. His theological allegory, The Holy War, with its troops of Election Doubters, and its cavalry of [...] "those that rode Reformadoes," [...] is, as a whole, absurd, impossible, and, except in passages where the artistic old Adam momentarily got the better of the Salvationist theologian, hardly readable.|$|E
