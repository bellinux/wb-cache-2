50|$|A <b>fixed</b> {{interest}} <b>rate</b> {{is based}} on the lender's assumptions about the average discount <b>rate</b> over the <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> period. For example, when the discount rate is historically low, <b>fixed</b> <b>rates</b> are normally higher than variable rates because interest rates are more likely to rise during the <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> period. Conversely, when interest rates are historically high, lenders normally offer a discount to borrowers to <b>fix</b> their interest <b>rate</b> over time, as rates are more likely to fall during the <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> period.|$|R

50|$|At {{the behest}} of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, Honduras began a process of {{financial}} liberalization in 1990. The process began with the freeing of agricultural loan rates and was quickly followed by the freeing of loan rates in other sectors. Beginning in late 1991, Honduran banks were allowed to charge market rates for agricultural loans if they were using their own funds. By law, the banks had to report their rates to monetary authorities and could <b>fix</b> <b>rates</b> within two points of the announced rate.|$|E
50|$|During {{his second}} term, Hogg {{endorsed}} three constitutional amendments. Voters defeated the proposals to charter state banks {{and to provide}} a pension for indigent Confederate veterans, but approved the amendment to allow for public election of the railroad commissioners.

When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the commission in Reagan v. Farmers Loan and Trust in 1894, this law helped them to be fully equipped to fight the power of the railroads.|$|E
50|$|The Potable Water and Basic Sanitation Regulation Commission (CRA) is a {{regulatory}} {{agency of the}} Government of Colombia in charge of regulating the {{water supply and sanitation}} in Colombia, including the potable and public water distribution, sewage and waste management services.

50|$|Hobbs miscalculated {{the slump}} in demand in {{developed}} economies especially in Europe. Fearing that money printing operations {{would lead to}} an inflation break out, he advised mortgage holders with high debt to income to buy certainty and <b>fix</b> <b>rates.</b> He was wrong; after initially raising rates, the ECB was forced to cut them to historic lows. In 2007 as a non-executive director he helped launch Brendan Investments Plc, a ten-year collective investment in European property for smaller investors, after obtaining Central Bank approval as the first retail investment product {{to comply with the}} EU Prospectus Directive. The intake at under €13m fell short of expectations and although entering the stable German commercial property market, the vehicle was set back by early loses when its anchor tenant, Germany's largest retail group Arcandor went into liquidation during the banking crisis.

30|$|Also {{contrary}} to our hypothesis, {{we did not}} detect any changes in kill rates for either summer or winter, as we would expect as evidence of interference competition. This was likely due to our methods rather than the ecological reality of the system, and a more intensive field effort may have yielded different results (Knopff et al. 2010; Elbroch and Wittmer 2013 b). Because we employed the night[*]>[*] 1 model to quantify kill rates, we limited our ability to detect small prey or large prey when large competitors displaced cougars from their kills (Elbroch and Wittmer 2013 a). This would influence both our comparison of selection for smaller ungulates and the predictive power of our kill rate models. The multiplicity of GPS <b>fix</b> <b>rates</b> employed {{over the life of}} the project also likely reduced the effectiveness of many explanatory variables in identifying clusters with and without kills. For these reasons, our methods may have failed to detect cougar prey switching to smaller prey that may have increased their kill rates.|$|E
40|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{telemetry}} provides data {{to study}} spatial utilization patterns of animals. Spatial uncertainty due to poor accuracy and <b>fix</b> <b>rates,</b> however, may detract from inferences {{based on such}} data. The exclusion of two-dimensional (2 D) locations may improve such inferences, but the prevalence of 2 D locations may be a factor of landscape properties. In trials conducted using GPS units stationed at known positions, fix rate decreased significantly with increased canopy cover, but was unaffected by slope. Most (75 %) of the locations recorded in closed woodland were 2 D locations, suggesting that the exclusion of 2 D locations may reduce estimates of the utilization of such habitats. Excluding 2 D locations from records obtained for GPS units deployed on free-ranging elephants (Loxodonta africana) increased daily displacement distances, and changed the number of locations per habitat. However, selection ratios and estimates of home range area were not influenced by filtering location data. We concluded that although the exclusion of 2 D locations improved the accuracy of locations per se, it resulted in significant data loss. This loss could alter inferences on patterns of spatial utilization...|$|E
40|$|Ambiguity Resolution (AR) plays a {{vital role}} in precise GNSS positioning. Correctly-fixed integer ambiguities can {{significantly}} improve the positioning solution, while incorrectly-fixed integer ambiguities can bring large positioning errors and, therefore, should be avoided. The ratio test is an extensively used test to validate the fixed integer ambiguities. To choose proper critical values of the ratio test, the Fixed Failure-rate Ratio Test (FFRT) has been proposed, which generates critical values according to user-defined tolerable failure rates. This contribution provides easy-to-implement fitting functions to calculate the critical values. With a massive Monte Carlo simulation, the functions for many different tolerable failure rates are provided, which enriches the choices of critical values for users. Moreover, the fitting functions for the fix rate are also provided, which for the first time allows users to evaluate the conditional success rate, i. e., the success rate once the integer candidates are accepted by FFRT. The superiority of FFRT over the traditional ratio test regarding controlling the failure rate and preventing unnecessary false alarms is shown by a simulation and a real data experiment. In the real data experiment with a baseline of 182. 7 km, FFRT achieved much higher <b>fix</b> <b>rates</b> (up to 30 % higher) and the same level of positioning accuracy from fixed solutions as compared to the traditional critical value.
