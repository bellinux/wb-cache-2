40|$|A novel event {{detector}} algorithm, which {{points out}} in-door acoustic human activities, for constrained wireless sensor node hardware is {{proposed in the}} present paper. In our approach, event detections are computed from the signal energy statistics change rate at two instants separated by an (L − 1) samples interval. The experimentation is run in two phases: (i) the detector characterisation and tuning seek detector configurations that enable event detections from three acoustic human activities: closing a <b>door,</b> <b>dropping</b> a plastic bottle, and clapping; (ii) event detector validation tests measure the reliability to signal events from general acoustic activities, people talking particularly. The test results, which included emulated node hardware, actual sensor node, and a one-hop WSN, demonstrate the detector implementations signaled successfully events. And for the WSN, we found that event detections decay in a nonlinear fashion as the distance d, between the acoustic signal source and the sensor, is increased. Copyright © 2009 M. A.

6000|$|... 'My {{secret was}} out; and my only {{struggle}} now was for liberty and freedom. I gained my feet before a hand was on me, threw myself among my assailants, and cleared my way with my strong arm, as if I bore a hatchet in my hand, and hewed them down before me. I gained the <b>door,</b> <b>dropped</b> over the banisters, {{and in an}} instant was in the street.|$|R
60|$|The {{remainder}} of the meal passed off as breakfasts usually do. Conversation flagged, and people played with their teaspoons.

Tibbs retired to the back parlour by his wife’s orders, to check the green-grocer’s weekly account; and ultimately Mrs. Tibbs and Mrs. Bloss were left alone together.|$|R

60|$|That {{evening when}} Dick, {{on his way}} to the apartments of one of the officers, was going along a {{corridor}} that skirted the portion of the Palace occupied by the zenana; a figure came out suddenly from behind the drapery of a <b>door,</b> <b>dropped</b> on her knees beside him, and, seizing his hand, pressed it to her forehead. It was, to all appearance, an Indian girl in the dress of one of the attendants of the zenana.|$|R

5000|$|A 2012 book by Bruce Jackson and Diane Christian {{discusses}} the Polunsky Unit. According to one passage: [...] "Whenever a condemned prisoner goes anywhere outside his cell, he must {{back up to}} the <b>door,</b> <b>drop</b> to his knees, and extend his hands backward through the narrow slot to be handcuffed. Then he stands, turns around, and waits for the door to be opened. The whole process of dropping to the knees and extending the arms backward is particularly difficult and painful for the older convicts with arthritis." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} a commodious one, and the {{richness}} of the covering of the divan, and the handsome rugs spread on the floor, were satisfactory signs that the chamberlain considered them prime favourites of the sultan. Having seen the box placed in a corner, and paid the coolie, they followed the attendant along some spacious corridors and passages, until they entered a room where Fazli Ali was seated on a divan. The attendant let the curtains that covered the <b>door</b> <b>drop</b> behind them, as they entered.|$|R

60|$|So saying, {{and making}} the knight a sign to follow him, the hermit went towards the altar, and passing behind it, pressed a spring, which, opening without noise, showed a small iron door wrought {{in the side of}} the cavern, so as to be almost imperceptible, unless upon the most severe scrutiny. The hermit, ere he ventured fully to open the <b>door,</b> <b>dropped</b> some oil on the hinges, which the lamp supplied. A small staircase, hewn in the rock, was discovered, when the iron door was at length {{completely}} opened.|$|R
60|$|And {{then they}} came upon the cage which Rabba Kega, with the other black warriors of the village of Mbonga, the chief, had placed and baited for Numa. Rabba Kega saw that the bait was gone, {{though there was no}} lion within the cage, nor was the <b>door</b> <b>dropped.</b> He saw and he was filled with wonder not unmixed with apprehension. It entered his dull brain that in some way this {{combination}} of circumstances had a connection with his presence there as the prisoner of the white devil-god.|$|R

50|$|Retail Media {{originated}} as media available {{within the}} retail environment.

Retail Media now reaches outside the retail environment to encompass media channels such loyalty program marketing, couponing and <b>door</b> <b>drops,</b> fleet media (retailer's fleet vehicles, etc.). Though many retail media channels are found inside the retailer's store/environment, the media channels themselves are not always 'owned' or operated by retailers. Many retail media channels are operated independently by specialist media companies who also manage other media outside the retail environment.|$|R
5000|$|Lovefilm {{originally}} used {{partners to}} advertise its services but {{started to run}} TV adverts from 2006. Since then, the number of white label services and partners has decreased, possibly due to increased brand awareness of the Lovefilm name. Since advertising {{on a regular basis}} on TV the company has used British male actors for voice overs - Simon Pegg, Ewan McGregor, Bill Nighy and Ray Winstone. As of 2009, the theme song for the TV ads is [...] "It Must Be Love" [...] by Madness.

5000|$|The Department of Health Pandemic Plan (revised November 2007) states [...] "UK health {{departments}} (directorate in Scotland) will run a national <b>door</b> <b>drop</b> and advertising campaign in Phase 5, alerting {{the public to}} the heightened risk, emphasising the need for personal preparation and socially responsible behaviour.

Information materials will also be available through primary care, pharmacies and on the Department of Health website." [...] After criticism of the lateness of its launch, it was announced in late July that the National Flu Line service was to be launched on 24 July 2009.|$|R
