25|$|The tension {{was high}} {{between the two}} Mercedes {{teammates}} going into the weekend when Hamilton {{was found to have}} altered his car settings during the latter stages of the Spanish Grand Prix, using a higher-powered <b>engine</b> <b>setting</b> than the team had previously allowed in order to stay ahead of teammate Rosberg. Rosberg was then discovered to have done the same while chasing down Hamilton {{at the end of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix, though he failed to get past. Despite losing the Drivers' Championship lead to teammate Hamilton in Spain, Rosberg stated he would not be changing his approach and was not heavily focused on the championship but expected the battle to remain tight. Hamilton reckoned his increased comfort with the F1 W05 Hybrid would put Rosberg under pressure in Monaco, saying it was a track where he performed well but the 2013 race was where he was unable to extract the most amount of performance from his car although he hoped to get more out of his Mercedes and wanted to have the Ferrari and Red Bull cars battling him for the victory.|$|E
500|$|On lap 39, Webber asked Red Bull {{to advise}} Vettel {{to reduce his}} speed but his request was {{rejected}} due to the quick pace and the close distance between themselves and the McLaren cars. Webber entered fuel-saving mode on lap 40 which lost him performance while Vettel had saved one kilogram of fuel and opted to run on a faster <b>engine</b> <b>setting.</b> Vettel got a run exiting turn eleven and took to the inside lane to draw alongside Webber on the back straight. As the pair approached turn twelve, they made contact at high-speed which sent Vettel spinning through 360 degrees twice. Both drivers ended on the run-off area and Vettel almost hit Webber again as Hamilton and Button overtook them and took the lead. Vettel retired with a punctured right-rear tyre. Webber sustained damage to his front wing endplate. [...] The expected rain only manifested as a very light drizzle on lap 41, as Webber made a pit stop for a replacement front wing two laps later. Hamilton was informed by McLaren to conserve fuel on lap 44 as the drivers drove cautiously through turn one because of the light rain. Senna drove to the pit lane to retire with an fuel pressure issue. Button was instructed to conserve fuel although he was not given a target lap time because the team's chief engineer Phil Prew felt Button would not pass his teammate. Hamilton {{had been told by}} his race engineer Andy Latham that Button would not overtake him. Both drivers had been asked by McLaren to drive cautiously through turn eight where there was a high risk for problems with their front right tyres.|$|E

As we pounded so did the enemy. I adjured the driver to be patient and to push gently, for it did not seem right to imperil the slender chance of escape by running the risk of throwing the engine off the line. But after a dozen pushes had been given with apparently little result a shell struck the front of the <b>engine,</b> <b>setting</b> fire to the woodwork, and he thereupon turned on more steam, and with considerable momentum we struck the obstacle once more. There was a grinding crash; the engine staggered, checked, shore forward again, until with a clanging, tearing sound it broke past the point of interception, and nothing but the smooth line lay between us and home.|$|E

50|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.On lap 39, Webber asked Red Bull to advise Vettel to reduce his speed but his request was rejected due to the quick pace and the close distance between themselves and the McLaren cars.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} {{the moment of}} inertia of <b>engine</b> generator <b>set</b> was proposed in this paper, which was defined as Governor Sensitivity Test Method (GSTM). In this method, the moment of inertia of <b>engine</b> generator <b>set</b> was estimated by means of measure transient speed change of <b>engine</b> generator <b>set</b> when the <b>engine</b> load increases suddenly. In the present, {{there have been some}} methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine, such as, Additional Mass Method, Running Down Test Method and Accelerating- Decelerating Method Under No Load. These methods for estimating the moment of inertia of <b>engine</b> generator <b>set</b> all have shortcomings on accuracy or operability. These shortcomings have been overcome by using the GSTM method proposed in this paper. It is easy to operate, and the factors affecting estimation errors are small. In this paper, the basic principle of the GSTM method was discussed. The factors affecting estimation errors ware analyzed. An example of calculating the moment of inertia of an <b>engine</b> generator <b>set</b> using the GSTM method was presented. The result of calculating the moment of inertia of <b>engine</b> generator <b>set</b> was used to simulate the transient speed response of an <b>engine</b> generator <b>set.</b> The GSTM method was verified to be practical by comparing the results of simulation and experiment...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{maritime}} navigation through obstructions {{is still one}} of the many problems faced by mariners. The increasing traffic densities and average cruise speed of ships also impede the collision avoidance decision making process by reducing the time in which decisions have to be made. It seems logical that the decision making process be computerised and automated as a step towards reducing the risk of collision. Although some studies have focused on this area, the majority did not consider the collision regulations or environmental conditions and many previously proposed methods were idealistic. This study develops a motion planning algorithm that determines an optimal navigation path for ships in close range encounters based on known and predicted traffic and environmental data, with emphasis on the adaptability of the algorithm to optimised for different criteria or missions. The domain of interest is the 5 nautical mile region around own-ship based on the effective range of most modern navigation radars and identification devices. Several computational constraints have been incorporated into the algorithm and categorised based on safety priority. Collision-free and conformity with collision regulations are the primary constraints that have to be satisfied; followed by secondary or optional mission specific constraints e. g. commensurate with environmental conditions or taking the shortest navigation path. Own-ship speed is considered to be a dynamic property and a function of the <b>engine</b> <b>setting,</b> which is a variable modifiable by the optimisation routine. The change in the ship’s momentum as a result of a turning manoeuvre is also included in the model. A modified version of an evolutionary algorithm is adopted to perform the optimisation, where the variables are spatial coordinates and the <b>engine</b> <b>setting</b> at the particular path segment. The navigation path can be optimised for specific criteria by adjusting the weighting on the cost functions that describe the properties of the navigation paths...|$|E
