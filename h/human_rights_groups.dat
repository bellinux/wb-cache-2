5|$|On December 28, 2013, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress {{abolished}} the re-education through labor system and detainees were released.

5|$|The law was {{condemned}} by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe (of which Russia is a member), by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and by <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

5|$|In March 2000 Fosters Resources, a Canadian company, {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with the government of Sudan to develop the concession that covered most of the Melut Basin, including the Adar Yeil field, in partnership with a consortium of Arab and Sudanese companies. Fosters was forced to withdraw in May 2000 when its financial backing collapsed due to pressure from <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, he {{was sentenced}} to 68 years in prison, {{including}} 12 years hard labour; the sentence was reduced to 65 years on appeal. Gambira reportedly protested his imprisonment by organising chanting with other imprisoned monks, boycotting his trial, and going on hunger strike. <b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also protested his imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E

50|$|What distinguishes a <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>group</b> {{from other}} {{political}} elements {{of any given}} society is that while political advocates usually seeking to protect only the rights of their own constituents, a <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>group</b> seeks to defend the same rights for all members of that or any other society.|$|R

5|$|Practitioners of Falun Gong have {{launched}} {{a number of}} other campaigns to bring attention to the treatment of Falun Gong in China. Notable examples include the Human Rights Torch Relay, which toured to over 35 countries in 2007 and 2008 ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The relay was intended to draw attention to a range of human rights issues in China in connection with the Olympics, especially those related to Falun Gong and Tibet, and received support from hundreds of elected officials, past Olympic medallists, <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> and other concerned organizations.|$|E
5|$|Soviet dissidents and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> were {{routinely}} repressed by the KGB. Overall, political repression tightened during the Brezhnev era and Stalin experienced a partial rehabilitation. The two leading {{figures in the}} Soviet dissident movement during the Brezhnev Era were Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov. Despite their individual fame and widespread sympathy in the West, they attracted little support from {{the mass of the}} population. Sakharov was forced into internal exile in 1979, and Solzhenitsyn was forced out of the country in 1974.|$|E
5|$|When Falun Gong {{was banned}} in {{mainland}} China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners. Some <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> claim {{that as many}} as 10,000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001 alone. More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners. In some labor camps, Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population.|$|E

5|$|Dissent within Uganda and Amin's {{attempt to}} annex the Kagera Region of Tanzania in 1978 {{led to the}} Uganda–Tanzania War and the demise of his eight-year regime. Amin then went into exile, first in Libya and then in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003. Amin's rule was {{characterized}} by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. The number of people killed {{as a result of}} his regime is estimated by international observers and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> to range from 100,000 to 500,000.|$|E
5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} arrested and prosecuted {{on charges of}} creating mass disturbances, incitement of ethnic hatred, and complicity in murder. Following a trial protested by several international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> for irregularities—including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police—Askarov was given a life sentence, which he is currently serving. In November 2010, Askarov's health {{was reported to be}} rapidly deteriorating {{as a result of his}} confinement. Numerous groups have advocated on his behalf, including Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, People In Need, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience.|$|E

5|$|His government's {{treatment}} of non-Arab Libyans has also {{came in for}} criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. <b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> also criticized the {{treatment of}} migrants, including asylum seekers, who passed through Gaddafi's Libya {{on their way to}} Europe. According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, {{as well as}} the United States Department of State and the European Union, have {{expressed}} concern about the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE have been accused of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks {{between the government and the}} LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E

Other notable Western performers, including Sting, have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns. West was reportedly paid US$3 million for his performance. West had previously participated in cultural boycotts, joining Shakira and Rage Against The Machine in refusing to perform in Arizona after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens.|$|E
5|$|The twenty {{health workers}} facing felony charges {{were found guilty}} and sentenced on 29 September 2011 by the {{military}} National Safety Court of First Instance. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, the trial lasted only a few minutes. Thirteen of the twenty received sentences of fifteen years' imprisonment, while five were sentenced to five years and two were sentenced to ten years. The sentences were {{a blow to the}} hopes of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> lobbying on the health workers' behalf, which had predicted authorities would ease their stance after releasing some defendants on bail.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ethical}} {{component}} {{that must be}} considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.|$|E
