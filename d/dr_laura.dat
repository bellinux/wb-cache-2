50|$|The mayor moved quickly, and {{appointed}} a local civil engineer, <b>Dr.</b> Guillermo <b>Laura,</b> {{to design a}} new city transport master plan. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura's</b> ambitious project, originally published in 1970, called for the eventual construction {{of a network of}} nine city freeways (two were already in use), which would total 74 km (46 mi). Preparation for the plan resulted in the expropriation and demolition of over 3,000 homes during 1977-78, and construction on the first two freeways began in November 1978. Totaling 14 km (9 mi) and opened in December 1980, they were granted to the Spanish-Argentine AUSA consortium as toll roads with a concession until 2006.|$|R

25|$|<b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura</b> premiered to low {{ratings and}} unkind reviews. Critics and viewers {{complained that the}} format had been dumbed down and did not stand out from any other daytime talk show. The biting rhetoric that worked well on radio seemed overly harsh for {{face-to-face}} discourse, owing to the normal sympathetic nature of most other daytime hosts; the radical change in Schlessinger's demeanor from her radio persona left viewers cold. The television show failed to generate the energy and interest of Schlessinger's radio show.|$|E
25|$|By November 2000, {{advertisers}} {{that had}} committed to Schlessinger's show had pulled their support due to plummeting ratings. CBS was displeased {{enough with the}} ratings that it began looking to either drop the series or move it to late night slots on its stations within two months of its premiere. Other stations outside of CBS did the same thing, while others moved it to weaker sister stations. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura</b> aired its last first-run episode on March 30, 2001, on the stations that continued to air it, with reruns continuing until September 2001.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Schlessinger {{signed a}} deal with Paramount Domestic Television to produce a {{syndicated}} talk show titled <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura,</b> which was carried in major markets by CBS's owned and operated stations and in 96% of the nation's markets overall for fall 2000. This was considered somewhat of a coup for Paramount as they felt that a popular personality such as Schlessinger was could be a spark they needed to sell themselves as a daytime syndication powerhouse rivaling King World and Warner Bros. Television, which distributed the popular topical talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show and the variety talk show The Rosie O'Donnell Show.|$|E

500|$|Given Sil grows {{rapidly and}} kills humans with ease, {{at a certain}} point film {{character}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura</b> Baker even speculates if she was a biological weapon sent by a species who thought humans were like an intergalactic weed. Feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in the script, as it discussed mankind's place in the universe and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity, considering that [...] "maybe [...] not a potential threat, maybe a competitor, maybe a resource." [...] He also declared that more could be said about Sil's existentialist doubts, as she does not know her origin or purpose, and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate the species.|$|E
500|$|Sil's violent outbursts {{during sleep}} make the {{scientists}} consider her a threat. They {{try to kill}} her using cyanide gas but she breaks out of her containment cell and escapes.

Sil matures rapidly into an adult (Natasha Henstridge) in her early twenties and makes her way to Los Angeles. Her body strength, regenerative ability and intelligence make tracking her extremely difficult. The scientists fear she may mate with human males and produce offspring that could eliminate the human race.

[...] He was hospitalized at the nearby Mid-Atlantic Equine Medical Center in New Jersey and then shipped on August 10, 2012 to Belmont Park where he trained for several days. He was then shipped to Saratoga Race Course, home to the Travers Stakes, to recover further. However, he had no public workouts and missed the Travers. [...] He {{was scheduled to be}} flown back to Baffert's home stable in California on August 27, but Paynter again developed a fever and diarrhea. He was sent to the Upstate Equine Medical Center in Schuylerville, NY where he was diagnosed with colitis, an inflammation of the colon. Paynter's condition quickly deteriorated and was deemed life-threatening. Ahmed and Justin Zayat began to tweet regular updates on his condition to the public. His care was supervised by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura</b> Javsicas, an Equine Internal Medicine specialist. [...] Her devotion to Paynter was admired by both Zayat and Baffert, who later said that Javsicas should receive a special Eclipse Award.

Unfortunately, Homer forgot to fix his own computer, {{and in the process}} sends a virus across the world. Chaos ensues, and widespread looting begins. Krusty's malfunctioning pacemaker apparently kills him in front of the family. Bart tearfully mourns his hero, but he perks up, after finding a note. The letter in Krusty's pocket states that a rocket (codenamed Exodus) is being populated with humanity's [...] "best and brightest", and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on Mars. When they reach the shuttle, Homer fails to bluff his way on board by claiming to be the famous pianist from the film Shine but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as the ship's designated proofreader. Lisa is only able to take one parent with her, and quickly chooses Marge. Homer and Bart find a second, unguarded rocket and board just before it launches. They quickly notice that the spaceliner is filled with such notoriously obnoxious and mediocre celebrities as radio psychologist <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura,</b> film director Spike Lee, skating champion Tonya Harding, former vice president Dan Quayle, grunge rock singer Courtney Love, politician Ross Perot, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, actor Tom Arnold, MTV VJ Pauly Shore, and actress/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell.

40|$|Dr. Stoler 2 ̆ 7 s talk poses {{a simple}} question: how do colonial {{histories}} matter in our contemporary world? Might {{we think of}} this moment, not {{as one of a}} colonial past or colonial present but one in which a colonial presence pervades sensibilities and evades easy recognition, as it still carves out the jagged political lineaments and fault lines of unequitably distributed duress today. Challenging us to reconsider the categories and concepts on which understandings of colonial effects have relied, it calls for concept-work that attends not to the fixity of concepts, but to their fragilities and filiations, and the practices which they support. Her presentation will be introduced by Dr. Juliet Erazo, Associate Professor and Associate Chair of the Global and Sociocultural Studies Program at FIU. <b>Dr.</b> Ann <b>Laura</b> Stoler is the Willy Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Anthropology and Historical Studies at the The New School for Social Research in New York City.

2500|$|Leading {{up to the}} September 11, 2000, {{premiere of}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Laura,</b> Schlessinger created a {{significant}} amount of controversy. In the months before the premiere of her TV show, Schlessinger called homosexuality a [...] "biological error", said that homosexuality was acceptable {{as long as it was}} not public, and said that homosexuals should adopt older children. She may have expressed her view that [...] "a huge portion of the male homosexual populace is predatory on young boys." [...] Schlessinger was frequently criticized in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual (LGBT) media for these views. Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), an LGBT media watchdog group, began monitoring Schlessinger's on-air comments about LGBT people, posting transcripts of relevant shows on its website.|$|E

From the beginning, Bell considered the role ideal for Suzanne Rogers, a former Rockette from the Radio City Music Hall and Broadway chorus girl in such musicals as [...] "Coco" [...] and [...] "Follies". Bell approached Rogers about taking the role of Maggie, and she agreed. She was immediately described by critics who gave reviews of the show as {{being one of the}} most energetic girls on daytime television. The news of Suzanne Rogers being cast as Maggie was a different move, taking an actress who loves to dance, to a character of a crippled farm girl.

A nonparametric model is developed in which customers evaluate the overall service quality and a set of dimensions or attributes that determine this service quality. The model assumes that overall service quality is determined by a linear combination of attributes evaluations with some unknown weights and that different customers may have different weights for the attributes. The nonparametric techniques are based in Nearest Neighbours combined with Restricted Least Squared methods. The model is applied to several simulated data sets where we know the true value of the parameters of the model. Then we have applied the methodology to a specific set of data from CABINTEC ("Intelligent cabin truck for road transport"). Finally, the methodology is applied to the measurement {{of the quality of the}} postgraduate courses of a public Spanish University.
