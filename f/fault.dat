5|$|The San Andreas <b>Fault</b> has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this <b>fault</b> was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial <b>Fault</b> and the San Jacinto <b>Fault.</b> Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra <b>fault</b> zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek <b>Fault</b> (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain <b>Fault</b> which extends from the Coyote Creek <b>fault,</b> the San Jacinto <b>Fault</b> which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose <b>fault</b> trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch <b>fault</b> which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto <b>Fault,</b> the Imperial <b>Fault,</b> and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial <b>Fault</b> may have ruptured together with a rupture of the San Andreas <b>Fault</b> during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E
5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown <b>fault</b> under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg. This <b>fault</b> is called the Cottage Grove <b>Fault,</b> a small tear in the Earth's rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. The <b>fault</b> is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley <b>Fault</b> System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas <b>Fault</b> comes together with the Garlock <b>Fault,</b> which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon <b>Fault</b> mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf <b>Fault,</b> but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley <b>Fault,</b> {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other <b>fault</b> zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
40|$|Overtesting induces {{unnecessary}} yield loss. Untestable <b>faults</b> have {{no effect}} on normal functions of circuits. However, in scan testing, untestable <b>faults</b> may be detected through scan chains. Detected untestable <b>faults</b> cause overtesting. Untestable <b>faults</b> consist of uncontrollable <b>faults,</b> unobservable <b>faults,</b> and uncontrollable and unobservable <b>faults.</b> Uncontrollable <b>faults</b> may be detected under invalid states through scan chains by shift-in operations. Unobservable <b>faults</b> cannot be observed at primary outputs, but their effects may be propagated to scan flip-flops. Thus, unobservable <b>faults</b> may be detected through scan chains by shift-out operations. Several methods {{to reduce the number of}} detected untestable <b>faults</b> were recently proposed. These methods identify invalid states and generate test patterns avoiding invalid states. As the result, the number of detected uncontrollable <b>faults</b> was reduced. However, they cannot reduce the number of detected unobservable <b>faults.</b> In this paper, both uncontrollable and unobservable <b>faults</b> are identified using a multi-cycle capture test generation method. We evaluate the relationship between the numbers of untestable <b>faults</b> and the number of time expansions for ISCAS’ 89 benchmark circuits, and also evaluate factors that untestable <b>faults</b> are identified...|$|R

40|$|The NW–SE {{trending}} Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone (SSZ) is {{the internal}} {{part of the}} Zagros continental collision zone, which mainly consists of metamorphic rocks deformed in a dextral transpressional zone. This dextral transpression is attributed to brittle deformation related to late Cenozoic Arabia–Eurasia oblique continental collision. Major NW-trending <b>faults,</b> including the Dalan, Garmdareh, Yasechah, Sheida, and Ben <b>faults,</b> are reverse <b>faults</b> with a dextral strike-slip component. These <b>faults</b> were displaced by NW-trending synthetic and NE-trending antithetic <b>faults.</b> There are also E-trending thrusts and N-trending normal <b>faults</b> developing in directions that are, respectively, almost normal and parallel to the major shortening direction. The NW-trending Ben, Yasechah, and Sheida <b>faults</b> are NE-dipping <b>faults,</b> and the Dalan and Garmdareh <b>faults</b> are SW-dipping <b>faults.</b> These <b>faults</b> indicate {{the presence of a}} transpressive flower structure zone that probably led to the exhumation of Jurassic high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as eclogite, in {{the central part of the}} study area...|$|R
40|$|Project {{managers}} use inspection data as {{input to}} capture-recapture (CR) models {{to estimate the}} total number of <b>faults</b> present in a software artifact.

5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier <b>Fault</b> on {{the east and the}} Hurricane <b>Fault</b> on the west. The Hurricane <b>fault</b> zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal <b>fault</b> that stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this <b>fault</b> is about 3,600ft (1,098m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.|$|E
