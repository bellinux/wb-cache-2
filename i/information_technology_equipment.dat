The power quality is more and more serious, because a lot of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> <b>equipments</b> and power electric converters were used in recent years. Harmonic and load unbalance can affect the measurement result of power factor of utility. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze the six formula of power factor. The simulation system was modeled in Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and some novel IP (intellectual property) cores, such as CORDIC core and FFT core by the way of Bottom-Up. The technology of semiconductor was more and more maturely. Design of SOC (System On a Chip) is a trend to achieve the strong and small volume in the future. The measurement data were employed to calculate active, reactive and apparent power. The average error rate of our design is about 0. 05 %...|$|R
