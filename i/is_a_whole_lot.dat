500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a B rating, {{saying that the}} tale [...] "is {{surprisingly}} good and surprisingly gruesome fun. Eklund makes {{the most of the}} maniac role and Breslin is a sympathetic victim." [...] Reviewer Dwight Brown wrote, [...] "The script gives Berry a blue-collar character she can make accessible, vulnerable and gutsy... Chestnut is not suitably gallant and stalwart as her caring lover and a cop on a mission... This film <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> scarier than you think it's going to be." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "An effectively creepy thriller about a 911 operator and a young miss in peril, The Call is a model of low-budget filmmaking." [...] She praised its [...] "clean, clever premise" [...] and said that Berry's Jordan is [...] "an old-fashioned hero in many respects, so it's fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old-fashioned filmmaking techniques, like crosscutting, to build tension and old-school exploitation tricks like evil to justify taking the story dark and then dark and bonkers." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin E. Cirulis of Computer Gaming World {{wrote that}} Command & Conquer [...] "remains mainly a good, networkable version of Dune II". Cirulis found the game's {{interface}} intuitive and described its online component as [...] "sophisticated and easy-to-use", also praising its story for being [...] "as interesting as the actual tactics and gunfire", and commented that he [...] "would buy C {{just to see}} where {{things are going to}} end up". However, according to him, the developers failed [...] "to correct major shortcomings" [...] in Dune II, as its fog of war does not fit with the real-world setting, also finding fault with design choices in the game's missions, which he believed were structured like [...] "puzzles" [...] that allowed for only one way to win. Nevertheless, he concluded that it remained [...] "the best-looking and sounding strategy game yet" [...] despite its flaws, and that it was [...] "more than entertaining enough to make up for its shortcomings." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald wrote that the game [...] "has all the playability of Dune II, but with more diverse units, more unusual scenarios, and impressively executed wraparound cutscenes." [...] McDonald called its combat a [...] "satisfying blend of action and strategy", and noted that this, combined with an attention to [...] "little details", made the game a [...] "success", also praising its cutscenes as [...] "terrifically executed". Although he was disappointed that the game lacked [...] "fancier terrain or another zoom level", McDonald concluded: [...] "This game <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of fun, so get it, play it, and love it like your own child." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 17, Prime Minister Harper {{suggested}} that the attacker {{may not have been}} acting alone, but did not elaborate. In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. [...] "All you hear <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of shooting coming towards you, and you don't know if that's a firefight or whether it's just a bunch of guys with automatic weapons wiping everybody out in their path."

6000|$|And then, because Buster Bear always {{enjoys a}} good joke {{even when it}} is on himself, he laughed until he had to hold his sides, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better than going off in a rage as Little Joe Otter had done. [...] "You're pretty smart, Mr. Otter! You're pretty smart, but there are other people who are smart too," [...] said Buster Bear, and still chuckling, he went off to think up a plan to get the best of Little Joe Otter.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{my opinion}} that their camp <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> nearer than Alec has supposed. There are plenty of draws back in these hills where a camp could be hidden and {{discovered}} only by chance, unless some one was making special search for it. The fact that that bloody-minded Injun was hanging around the beaver pond so {{late in the day}} is evidence enough for me that his camp isn't many miles away. I'll bet it's within five miles of us this blessed minute. They probably located our trap lines, then built their camp in a place we were not likely to visit and then by working back up through the hills kept their trail hidden, and crossed on the ice to work our long lines, as Alec suspects. They left our short lines alone, partly because they could not get at them without leaving a trail in the soft snow and partly so as not to arouse suspicion.|$|E

6000|$|They {{were in the}} shade, and {{the fresh}} sweet wind, heavy {{with the scent of}} growing corn and wheat, swept {{steadily}} over the court, relieving it from heat, and Victor clean forgot his worriments. This girlish figure filled his eyes with pictures of unforgetable grace and charm. The swing of her skirts as she leaped for the ball, the free sweep of her arm (she had been well instructed), and the lithe bending of her waist brought the lover's sweet unease. When they came to the net now and again, he studied her fine figure with frank admiration. [...] "You are a corker!" [...] was his boyish word of praise. [...] "I don't go up against many men who play the game as well as you do. Your 'form' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better than mine. I am a bit lucky, I admit. You see, I studied baseball pitching, and I know the action of a whirling sphere. I curve the ball--make it 'break,' as the English say. I can make it do all kinds of 'stunts.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Gamezebo's Nadia Oxford {{was also}} impressed, scoring the game 4 out of 5, despite its shallowness; [...] "He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of brainless sword-swinging, and {{sometimes}} that's {{all you want}} out of a game. The levels are repetitive and the enemies have no AI to speak of, but slicing through the robot tide admittedly gives you a comforting sense of progression ... He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe is shallow and straightforward, but it's fun. In fact, it's the most fun you can have with He-Man outside of re-watching your grainy VHS collection or engaging in grownup He-Man roleplay." ...|$|E

5000|$|In February 2012, Finkelstein [...] "launched a {{blistering}} attack" [...] of the BDS movement during an interview, {{saying it was}} a [...] "hypocritical, dishonest cult" [...] that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality {{their goal is to}} destroy Israel[...] In addition, he said: [...] "Im getting a little bit exasperated with what I think <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of nonsense. Im not going to tolerate silliness, childishness and a lot of leftist posturing. I loathe the disingenuousness. We will never hear the solidarity movement a two-state solution." [...] Furthermore, Finkelstein stated that the BDS movement has had very few successes, and that just like a cult, the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views. He does mention though that he supports the idea of a non-violent BDS movement.|$|E
