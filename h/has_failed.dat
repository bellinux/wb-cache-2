Released on September 14, 2004, {{it was the}} band's second and final studio album {{distributed}} by Sanctuary Records. The System <b>Has</b> <b>Failed</b> was the first album released after Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002 which prevented him from playing guitar. It is also {{the first of three}} Megadeth records not to include original bassist and co-founder David Ellefson. Instead, the album features session players, including former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland on lead guitar. However, Poland only provided lead guitar parts and solos on a contractual basis and did not rejoin the band. To date, it is the only Megadeth album where the only certified member of the band was the sole Mustaine.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose <b>has</b> <b>failed,</b> but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E
