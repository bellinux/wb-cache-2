5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, he made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publisher {{that he wanted to}} retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E
5|$|Malta was {{invaded by}} the French First Republic in June 1798, and the Order was {{expelled}} from the island, resulting in the French occupation of Malta. Grand Master Hompesch was pressured to capitulate, as the Maltese nobility and the Magistrate of the Castellania, together with influential and high ranking figures made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fiscal of the Castellania that, unless he surrenders, those resisting the French would have to simultaneously face an internal revolution. The French reformed the legal system with the country being divided into provinces for roughly each 3,000 inhabitants, all with their own Justice of Peace.|$|E
5|$|According to Roberts, it {{is clear}} that the next phase of {{negotiations}} was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 15 May a German {{messenger}} reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord for {{a meeting}} with von Küchler to negotiate the articles of a written capitulation document. Both quickly agreed on most conditions, Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army, naval and air forces. When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies should be treated as francs-tireurs—seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war—Winkelman's refusal made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland, with the exception of Zealand, would capitulate, not the country itself. On other points a swift agreement was reached and the document was signed at 10:15.|$|E
5|$|Early on 6 April 1941, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{launched}} preliminary attacks {{along the}} Drava between Ždala and Gotalovo {{in the area}} of the 27th Infantry Division Savska with the intention of securing crossings over the river, but they were unsuccessful. By the evening, German successes along the Hungarian border made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the frontier. The XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava right along the 4th Army front, including at Zákány near Gyékényes. These local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist the Germans which they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period.|$|E

5|$|German foreign {{intelligence}} gathering, large-scale Allied trench raids and observed troop concentrations west of Arras made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that a spring offensive near Arras was being planned. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted to the German side and helped confirm {{many of the}} suspicions held by the Germans, providing them {{with a great deal}} of useful information. By March 1917, the German forces were aware that a major attack was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late-March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a major attack. The Germans quickly developed plans to launch a pre-emptive operation, following the adage that the best defence is a good offence, intent on capturing the northern section of the Zouave Valley along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Heavy Canadian Corps artillery fire ultimately prevented the Germans from executing their pre-emptive attack.|$|E

25|$|However, {{because a}} peace treaty had not been {{concluded}} at that time, Allies of World War II and Japan considered that Taiwan and Penghu were still sovereign territories of Japan.

Allies also stated that the ROC's control over Taiwan and Penghu was just a military occupation assigned by Allies, and made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ROC that the disposition of Taiwan and Penghu could not be settled until a peace settlement is made with Japan.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the defeat}} and the dismay felt in Washington, Burnside {{was not yet}} {{relieved}} from command. He planned to resume his offensive north of Fredericksburg, but it went amiss in January 1863 in the humiliating Mud March. Following this, a cabal of his subordinate generals made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government that Burnside was incapable of leading the army. One of those conspirators was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, who was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac on January 26, 1863. Hooker, who had an excellent record as a corps commander in previous campaigns, spent {{the remainder of the}} winter reorganizing and resupplying his army, paying special attention to health and morale issues. And being known for his aggressive nature, he planned a complex spring campaign against Robert E. Lee.|$|E

A music video for [...] "Save It for the Bedroom" [...] had been released a few days prior and was directed by Lawrence Hardy.
