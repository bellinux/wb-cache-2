40|$|International audienceThe {{classical}} one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation (ADE) {{gives an}} inadequate description of tracer cloud {{evolution in the}} River Severn, U. K. A solute transport model incorporating the effects of tracer <b>storage</b> in <b>dead</b> zones is presented in which the channel is conceived as being divided into two parallel regions. The bulk flow region occurs in the central part. Its longitudinal dispersive properties are described by the ADE. Adjacent to this, an additional cross-sectional area is defined in which tracer can be stored temporarily in regions of slowly moving water called dead zones. Exchange between the two regions follows a first order rate equation. Applying the model to the River Severn shows that a dispersing cloud's evolution occurs in two distinct stages with a rapid transitional phase. Initially, shear-dispersion is dominant while the tracer particles mix fully over the bulk flow. Once this has occurred, <b>dead</b> zone <b>storage</b> accounts well for the non-Fickian evolution of the cloud. After the transitional phase the <b>dead</b> zone <b>storage</b> mechanism clearly dominates over shear-dispersion. Overall, the combined shear flow dispersion ? dead zone model (D-DZM) provides a much better, physically consistent description of the tracer cloud's evolution than the simple classical ADE approach can do alone.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{details the}} data collection methodology used for identifying missing energy balance components in a dynamic temperature model. The basis for collecting these data was a preliminary temperature model application on the Virgin River in southwestern Utah for a low flow scenario, where {{a decrease in the}} solar radiation inputs by 15 - 20 % during calibration were required to match observations. This suggested that important components of the energy balance may be missing when modeling the system with a typical surface flux temperature model. Possible missing energy flux components were identified as bed conduction, hyporheic exchange, dead zone warming, poor representation of solar radiation entering the water column, and substrate warming due to solar radiation penetration. Data collection efforts revealed that bed conduction, hyporheic flow, and <b>dead</b> zone <b>storage</b> are of importance in the system.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse and develop design methods for {{building}} integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) technology at the Green Energy Laboratory (GEL) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in China. PV/T technology generates electrical and thermal energy in a smaller area, compared to solely PV panels and solar collectors. For a PV panel, the electrical efficiency will decrease when the surface temperature increases, typically during peak solar irradiation. The air or water circulating in the PV/T component cools the PV surface, maintaining higher efficiency and thus higher energy generation. A water based PV/T component has been calibrated and validated according to measurements conducted in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the component was used to model a PV/T façade at the south wall of GEL. A façade integrated PV/T system utilising air as heat transfer medium was also modelled, but not validated, as no measurements were available for this component. The BIPV/T systems were optimised for five parameters; <b>dead</b> band, <b>storage</b> tank size, mass flow rate, tank inlet height from heat source and tank inlet height from mains water supply. Simulations have been conducted to analyse the effect of building integration, both on the building energy demand and the BIPV/T system operation. Simulations were carried out for the same building model with air based BIPV/T system, water based BIPV/T system, air based PV/T system, water based PV/T system and PV façade (BIPV). The results show that PV/T integrated to the building façade has negligible effect on the total energy demand of the building. The electrical efficiency was highest for the air based BIPV/T system and the water based BIPV/T showed the largest amount of collected thermal useful energy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to provide a flow-cytometric (FCM) {{approach}} evaluating A. minutum cellular responses to mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses. Coupling SYBR-Green I and SYTOX-Green staining, FCM analysis and sorting, and microscopic observations permitted identification and characterization of five cellular states/forms of A. minutum; 1) vegetative cells, 2) pellicle cysts, 3) degraded cells, 4) empty theca and 5) <b>dead</b> cells. <b>Storage</b> on ice resulted in the transformation of a portion of vegetative cells into dead cells, pellicle cysts, and "degraded" cells; however, centrifugation resulted mostly in pellicle cysts and a few degraded cells. After these thermal and mechanical treatments, control and stressed cultures were monitored for 14 days. Stressed A. minutum cultures appeared to grow at the same rates as control cultures during the first seven days. During the last week of monitoring, however, cell densities of stressed cultures reached their stationary phase earlier than control cultures, suggesting incomplete recovery. Additional experiment assessing kinetics of excystment indicated that it can occur less than 9 hours following mechanical stress (centrifugation) and that 75 % of the culture can excyst within 24 hours. Upon 30 min of exposure to chemical stressors (saponine and H 2 O 2), only vegetative cells, pellicle cysts, and dead cells were detected. For both chemicals, encystment was dose-dependent. Counts of pellicle cysts increased with increasing saponine or H 2 O 2 concentration. Pellicle cysts were the most-predominant cell type at chemical treatments above 0. 05 g. L- 1 saponine and above 0. 015 % H 2 O 2. Occurrence of dead cells appeared to follow an all-or-none response as dead-cell percentage increased from 3 % at 0. 015 % H 2 O 2 to 81 % at 0. 03 % H 2 O 2 without pellicle cyst formation. Overall, encystment-excystment of A. minutum upon changes of environmental conditions can occur very rapidly but can be monitored using FCM and SYBR-Green I staining...|$|R

The water surface area of its reservoir is 380 km 2 with a designed storage capacity of 11. 11 km 3 at a maximum operating level (330 m a. s. l). The dam started operating in 1986. No detailed study was yet carried out to assess its reservoir. The present study indicated that the annual sediment deposited in the reservoir is 45. 72 × 106 m 3 year- 1 which is divided into 23. 2 × 106 and 22. 52 × 106 m 3 year- 1 for dead and live zones respectively.

40|$|In this dissertation, I study a {{critical}} transition {{in the urban}} development of Tell es-Sweyhat, a large site in Syria occupied from c. 3000 - 1900 BCE. In {{the middle of the}} third millennium, Sweyhat was an open town centered on a fortress. It was ringed with cemeteries and had a ceremonial public building in its outskirts (Sweyhat Period 3). Around 2150 BCE, the settlement experienced a sudden expansion from 15 HA to 35 - 40 HA. Sweyhat became a fortified city with a high central ceremonial platform and no formal cemetery (Sweyhat Period 4). The new fortifications combined with increased population density signifies Sweyhat's transition from a town to a regional urban center. In this dissertation, I identify the changes in land use during this transition and examine the accompanying social changes. I focus on several domestic structures excavated {{along the edge of the}} Sweyhat 4 Inner City wall, along with the associated artifact inventories, including spinning and weaving equipment, grinding and cooking equipment, and whole ceramic vessels. One adult burial and several infant burials were also uncovered here. Additional soundings reached down into the Sweyhat 3 layers of this neighborhood. I synthesize the data from these excavations alongside architectural remains and artifact assemblages from other excavated areas of the site, to create a narrative of the changes in the site's occupational history and the possible meanings inherent in those changes. The results reveal that the character and location of certain daily and special activities changed, including mourning the <b>dead,</b> grain <b>storage,</b> grinding and cooking activities, and ceremonial activities. The outer town cemeteries were abandoned, possibly in favor of individual household burials. Grain storage, grinding, and cooking activities that had been located in the central storage area moved to the home. The locus of ceremonial activities shifted from the public building in the outer town to a new structure located in the city center. Access to this new structure was limited: it sat atop a high terrace that was accessible only by particular ramps or stairways, in a district at the center of the city's two fortifications. These shifts suggest increased control of formerly accessible public activities and greater attention to individual privacy. These changes were an integral part of Tell es-Sweyhat's transition from open town to walled city...|$|R

Each ejaculate was then diluted 1 : 1 with Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender and maintained at 4 o C on a rotary shaker for 16 h. After semen dilution, sperm concentration, viability, and SQI were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 h. The SQI increased from 0 to 4 h of storage then decreased in a quartic fashion as storage time further increased (r 2 = 0. 83). There was a linear decrease in sperm viability as storage time increased (r 2 = 0. 87). There was a negative relationship for the SQI from fresh semen with percentage of <b>dead</b> sperm over <b>storage</b> period yielding correlation coefficients ranging from r= - 0. 88 to - 0. 55.

40|$|This is the publisher’s final pdf. The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] stream tracer techniques do not allow separation of in-channel dead zone (e. g., eddies) and out-of-channel (hyporheic) transient storage, yet this separation is important to understanding stream biogeochemical processes. We characterize in-channel transient storage with a rhodamine WT solute tracer experiment in a 304 m cascade-pool-type bedrock reach with no hyporheic zone. We compare the solute breakthrough curve (BTC) from this reach to that of an adjacent 367 m alluvial reach with significant hyporheic exchange. In the bedrock reach, transient storage has an exponential residence time distribution with a mean residence time of 3. 0 hours and a ratio of transient storage to stream volume of 0. 14, demonstrating that at moderate discharge, bedrock in-channel storage zones provide a small volume of transient storage with substantial residence time. In the alluvial reach, though pools are similar in size to those in the bedrock reach, transient storage has a power law residence time distribution with a mean residence time of > 100 hours (estimated at nearly 1200 hours) and a ratio of storage to stream volume of 105. Because the in-channel hydraulics of bedrock reaches are simpler than alluvial step-pool reaches, the bedrock results are probably a lower end-member with respect to volume and residence time, though they demonstrate that in-channel storage may be appreciable in some reaches. These results suggest that in-stream <b>dead</b> zone transient <b>storage</b> may be accurately simulated by exponential RTDs but that hyporheic exchange is better simulated with a power law RTD as a consequence of more complicated flow path and exchange dynamics...|$|R

In the light of pressing sustainability challenges like climate change {{and the importance of}} the global livestock system for food security as well as GHG emissions, finding ways to increasing {{food production}} sustainably and without increasing competition for food crops is essential. Yet, many unknowns relate to livestock grazing, in particular grazing intensity, an essential variable to assess the sustainability of livestock systems. Here we explore ecological limits to grazing intensity (GI; i. e., the fraction of Net Primary Production consumed by grazing animals) by analysing the role of seasonality in natural grasslands. We estimate seasonal limitations to GI by combining monthly Net Primary Production data and a map of global livestock distribution with assumptions on the length of non-favourable periods that can be bridged by livestock (e. g., by browsing <b>dead</b> standing biomass, <b>storage</b> systems or biomass conservation). This allows us to derive a seasonality-limited potential GI, which we compare with the GI prevailing in 2000. We find that GI in 2000 lies below its potential on 39 % of the total global natural grasslands, which has a potential for increasing biomass extraction of up to 181 MtC/yr. In contrast, on 61 % of the area GI exceeds the potential, made possible by management. Mobilizing this potential could increase milk production by 5 %, meat production by 4 %, or contribute to free up to 2. 8 Mio km² of grassland area at the global scale if the numerous socio-ecological constraints can be overcome.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Population {{and habitat}} {{characteristics}} of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) {{were examined in}} oak stands (Quercus garryana) in Benton County, Oregon. Characteristics of eight oak stands not containing Acorn Woodpeckers were also examined. The data {{were used to determine}} which factors might be related to woodpecker presence and abundance within the northern extension of the range of this species. Population size varied from 2 to 8 individuals with a mean of 4. 25 birds per group. All were resident populations with communal storage limbs for acorns which are used as a winter food. During winter months, birds were also observed flycatching and possibly ground-feeding and gleaning for food. Neither the area of the home rance nor the number of trees in the home range were significantly correlated to the number of woodpeckers living in an area. Rather, the number of dead limbs in the home range was the best single indicator of woodpecker number. The number of storage limbs was related to the number of dead limbs in the home range. Trees in oak stands containing Acorn Woodpeckers were larger, in diameter and had more dead limbs than trees in oak stands not containing woodpeckers. The density of trees in stands occupied by woodpeckers was lower than the density of unoccupied stands. These three factors are important to the availability of resources on which the Acorn Woodpeckers depend: acorns for winter food and <b>dead</b> limbs for <b>storage</b> and nesting. An hypothesis for the recent extension of the Acorn Woodpecker range into northern Oregon is that it is related to the development of oak forests in the Willamette Valley. Prior to settlement in the 1840 's, oak savannas were maintained by periodic ground fires. The control of these fires after settlement has allowed the development of mature oak forests which provide suitable habitat for Acorn Woodpeckers...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Presentation date: 1992 - 06 - 09 Fluorescent dye {{was used}} to assess summer low flow {{hydraulic}} retention and transient <b>storage</b> (<b>dead</b> zone) associated with fish habitat structures at Camp Creek, Drift Creek, and the East Fork of Lobster Creek within the central Coast Range of Oregon. Utilizing channel units to stratify stream reaches, the effect of instream structures upon the hydraulic retention of pools was evaluated. The cycling time of water into and out of storage was also estimated by calculating an exchange coefficient. Camp creek had a pre- and post-treatment design that included unaltered, low, medium, and high levels of coarse woody debris loading. Except for one Camp Creek channel unit (CC 21), major alterations to low flow channel unit dimensions did not occur after treatment and the volume of water in transient storage in the other treated channel units was probably not altered. Intensive debris loading increased the length of channel unit CC 21 by 6 meters and the average cross-sectional depth by 0. 04 meters. An "additional sums of squares" test {{was used to}} evaluate whether there was a statistically significant difference existing between Camp Creek pre- and posttreatment simple linear regressions of transit time versus debris loading and the average cross-sectional area, depth, width, and velocity. The additional sums of squares comparison did show that an increase in posttreatment transit time was statistically significant (p 0. 10) when compared against debris additions that were located within the low flow wetted perimeter of the stream (wood influence Zone I). Statistically significant (p 0. 10) results for dye plume and geomorphic variables for Drift Creek and Lobster Creek are not presented as major conclusions {{because of a lack of}} pretreatment control data. Qualitatively, however, one-tailed t-test indicate that during summer discharges, flow velocities and peak concentrations may significantly decrease in treated channel units, compared to the channel units that were assumed to be controls. Intensive debris loading may enhance low flow channel complexity by increasing turbulent mixing and increasing the transit time of water. However, in this study the largest amount of debris volume was located in the cross-section of channel existing between low flow and bankfull flow (wood influence Zone II). Thus, hydraulic interaction with debris primarily occurs during winter flows and storm flows when streampower is at its highest...|$|R
