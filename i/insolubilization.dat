40|$|Elicitation of soybean cells {{causes a}} rapid <b>insolubilization</b> of two cell wall {{structural}} proteins, p 33 and p 100. Likewise, a short elicitation of 30 min rendered cell walls more refractory to enzyme digestion as assayed by the yield of protoplasts released. This effect could be ascribed to protein cross-linking {{because of its}} insensitivity to inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D) and translation (cycloheximide) and its induction by exogenous H 2 O 2. Moreover, the induced loss of protoplasts could be prevented by preincubation with DTT, which also blocks peroxidase-mediated oxidative cross-linking. The operation of protein <b>insolubilization</b> in plant defense was also demonstrated by its occurrence in the incompatible interaction {{but not in the}} compatible interaction between soybean and Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea. Likewise, protein <b>insolubilization</b> was observed in bean during non-host hypersensitive resistance to the tobacco pathogen P. s. pv tabaci mediated by the hypersensitive resistance and pathogenicity (Hrp) gene cluster. Our data strongly suggest that rapid protein <b>insolubilization</b> leads to a strengthened cell wall, and this mechanism functions as a rapid defense in the initial stages of the hypersensitive response prior to deployment of transcription-dependent defenses...|$|E

40|$|Enzymatic {{removal of}} the cell wall induces {{vegetative}} Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells to transcribe wall genes and synthesize new hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) related to the extensins found in higher plant cell walls. A cDNA expression library made from such induced cells was screened with antibodies to an oligopeptide containing the (SP) x repetitive domains found in Chlamydomonas wall proteins. One of the selected cDNAs encodes an (SP) x-rich polypeptide that also displays a repeated YGG motif. Ascorbate, a peroxidase inhibitor, and tyrosine derivatives were shown to inhibit <b>insolubilization</b> of both the vegetative and zygotic cell walls of Chlamydomonas, suggesting that oxidative cross-linking of tyrosines is occurring.

The <b>insolubilization</b> process (cross-linking between soluble extensin precursor molecules) is catalyzed by extensin peroxidases. We have ionically eluted extensin peroxidases from intact water-washed suspension-cultured tomato (hybrid of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. and Lycopersicon peruvianum L. [Mill. ]) cells and purified them to homogeneity by molecular sieve and cation-exchange chromatography. Four ionic forms of peroxidase (PI,PII,EPIII, and EPIV) were resolved; only the latter two cross-linked tomato soluble extensin. The molecular weight (34, 000 - 37, 000), amino acid composition, and isoelectric point (9. 0) of the extensin peroxidases were determined. Substrate specificities of the enzymes were investigated: soluble extensin and potato lectin (a hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein with a domain that strongly resembles extensin) were cross-linked by only two forms of the enzyme, whereas bovine serum albumin, aldolase, insulin, {{a number of other}} marker proteins, and proteins eluted from tomato cells (except extensin) could not be cross-linked. We have also isolated a yeast elicitor that enhances total peroxidase activity and extensin <b>insolubilization</b> within 1 h of challenge in cultured cells of tomato.

40|$|After early life, the {{dry weight}} of normal human lenses {{increases}} {{at a relatively}} constant rate with time. Transformation from soluble to insoluble material appears to occur at a comparable rate, resulting in a constant amount of soluble material. However, in cataract the <b>insolubilization</b> rate is accelerated. These observations are supported by determination of D-aspartic acid/L-aspartic acid ratios. The abundance of D-aspartic acid increases with aging at a constant rate in the insoluble fraction of normal lenses but does not change in the soluble fraction. However, in cataractous lenses {{there is a significant}} decrease in the ratio in the insoluble fraction. Examination of polypeptides isolated from reduced and alkylated soluble and insoluble cataractous lens proteins as well as other data suggest the following additional conclusions: (i) the 10, 000 -dalton polypeptide in the insoluble fraction is derived in part from degradation of an already insoluble precursor; and (ii) the lowered abundance of D-aspartic acid in the insoluble fraction of cataractous lenses is primarily due to the rapid <b>insolubilization</b> of the 43, 000 - and 20, 000 -dalton range components...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} if limited proteolysis of / 3 -crystallins {{is associated with}} <b>insolubilization</b> of proteins in rat lens during maturation and to test if the protease, calpain II, is involved. Methods. Soluble and insoluble lens proteins from 4 -day-old to 4 -month-old rat lens cortexes and nuclei were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The insoluble proteins from 4 -month-old nuclei were electroblotted and the NH 2 termini of proteins sequenced.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we have shown}} that histidine‐rich glycoprotein (HRG), a relatively abundant plasma protein, can bind to immunoglobulin G (IgG) and inhibit the <b>insolubilization</b> of IgG‐containing immune complexes (IC). It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether HRG can inhibit the formation of insoluble IC (IIC) resulting from the interaction of rheumatoid factor (RF) with human IgG‐containing IC. Light scattering techniques were {{used to examine the}} effect of HRG on the formation of IIC between RF and IC containing human IgG according to three different models. In all three models physiological concentrations of HRG could block the formation of IIC induced by RF. Optical biosensor studies of the RF–IgG interaction also revealed that HRG can mask the epitopes on IgG recognized by RF. Additional studies examined whether HRG can solubilize already formed IIC and demonstrated that HRG can, in fact, partially solubilized IIC. These data indicate that HRG can regulate the formation of IIC induced by RF at three levels: namely by inhibiting the initial recognition of IgG containing IC by RF, by inhibiting the subsequent <b>insolubilization</b> of IgG containing IC by RF and by solubilizing already formed IIC. Collectively, these findings suggest that HRG may be an important inhibitor of the formation of pathogenic IC in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the common lipid moiety of {{bacterial}} LPS on secretion from washed human platelets has been studied. The lipid A-rich LPS of S. minnesota R 595 and a lipid A preparation both potentiated platelet serotonin secretion in response to IgG aggregates or immune complexes up to 50 -fold but had little effect {{in the absence of}} IgG. Lipid A has been shown to bind immune aggregates, raising the possibility that its mechanism of action involved effective enlargement or <b>insolubilization</b> of the aggregates. IgG aggregates of dimer to tetramer size were shown to be platelet simuli, equivalent on a weight basis to larger soluble aggregates. The effect of both sizes of aggregates on platelets were equally enhanced by the LPS, indicating that increased size of aggregates alone could not account for the effect of LPS. Similarly, because lipid A-rich LPS enhanced platelet response to already insoluble immune complexes, its mechanism of action cannot simply be <b>insolubilization</b> of immune aggregates. These LPS did not enhance platelet stimulation by antiplatelet antibody, monosodium urate crystals, or thrombin and only slightly enhanced stimulation by insoluble human skin collagen. This indicates some stimulus specificity in the ability of LPS to increase platelet secretion.

40|$|AbstractThe XPA {{protein is}} {{essential}} for both of the known modes of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in human cells: transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and global genome repair (GGR). In TCR, this protein {{is thought to be}} recruited to lesion sites in DNA at which RNA polymerase II is blocked and in GGR, by direct recognition of damages by repair protein complex containing XPC/HR 23 B or DNA damage-binding protein. However, details of the recruitment of the XPA protein in vivo are unknown. It was shown earlier that a portion of another NER protein, PCNA, which is completely extractable from non-S-phase mammalian nuclei, becomes insoluble after ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation and cannot be extracted by methanol or buffer containing Triton X- 100. In the present study, we have found that UV light irradiation of human or Chinese hamster cells leads to decrease of extractability of the XPA protein by Triton X- 100. Maximal <b>insolubilization</b> of the XPA protein is observed 1 – 4 h after irradiation but it is not detectable by 22 h. This effect is dose-dependent for UV light from 2. 5 to 15 J/m 2 and is unaffected by the pre-treatment of cells with sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylation. The UV light-induced <b>insolubilization</b> of the XPA protein was also observed in two lines of Cockayne syndrome complementation group A cells, indicating that the effect is not dependent upon TCR.

40|$|The {{eye lens}} is {{composed}} of fiber cells that are filled with α-, β- and γ-crystallins. The primary function of crystallins is to maintain {{the clarity of the}} lens through ordered interactions as well as through the chaperone-like function of α-crystallin. With aging, the chaperone function of α-crystallin decreases, with the concomitant accumulation of water-insoluble, light-scattering oligomers and crystallin-derived peptides. The role of crystallin-derived peptides in age-related lens protein aggregation and <b>insolubilization</b> is not understood. We found that αA-crystallin-derived peptide, (66) SDRDKFVIFLDVKHF(80), which accumulates in the aging lens, can inhibit the chaperone activity of α-crystallin and cause aggregation and precipitation of lens crystallins. Age-related change in the concentration of αA-(66 - 80) peptide was estimated by mass spectrometry. The interaction of the peptide with native crystallin was studied by multi-angle light scattering and fluorescence methods. High molar ratios of peptide-to-crystallin were favourable for aggregation and precipitation. Time-lapse recordings showed that, in the presence of αA-(66 - 80) peptide, α-crystallin aggregates and functions as a nucleus for protein aggregation, attracting aggregation of additional α-, β- and γ-crystallins. Additionally, the αA-(66 - 80) peptide shares the principal properties of amyloid peptides, such as β-sheet structure and fibril formation. These results suggest that crystallin-derived peptides such as αA-(66 - 80), generated in vivo, can induce age-related lens changes by disrupting the structure and organization of crystallins, leading to their <b>insolubilization.</b> The accumulation of such peptides in aging lenses may explain a novel mechanism for age-related crystallin aggregation and cataractogenesis...|$|E

40|$|When aggregated, cell surface {{proteins}} become {{resistant to}} solubilization by detergents, presumably because of aggregation-induced or -stabilized {{interactions between the}} membrane protein and the cytoskeleton or plasma membrane skeleton. We genetically engineered variants of the tetrameric high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) to identify a site on its alpha, beta, or gamma chains that mediates such putative interactions. Using flow cytofluorometry, we studied rat basophilic leukemia cells, transiently transfected COS cells, and stably transfected P 815 cells bearing wild-type and mutated receptors. We observed that (i) solubilization was markedly dependent {{on the degree of}} aggregation, the extent varying somewhat with the cell type and, particularly at lower levels of aggregation, with the time after addition of detergent; (ii) truncation of no single cytoplasmic domain of the alpha, beta, or gamma chains ablated the <b>insolubilization</b> effect; and (iii) incomplete receptors were also efficiently insolubilized by aggregation. Thus receptors consisting only of alpha and gamma chains, a "receptor" consisting of only the ectodomain of the alpha chain attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol anchor, and "receptors" consisting only of minimally modified gamma chains were resistant to solubilization after aggregation. We conclude that no unique subunit or domain of Fc epsilon RI mediates the <b>insolubilization</b> phenomenon.

We calculate that following deposition, covalently bound GvP 1 contributes up to 4 % to 5 % of the cell wall dry weight. The deposition of GvP 1 in situ requires peroxide and endogenous peroxidase activity. Isoelectric focusing of saline eluates of callus revealed only a few basic peroxidases that were all isolated or purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. In vitro and in situ assays of extensin cross-linking activity using GvP 1 and peroxidases showed that a 40 -kD peroxidase cross-linked GvP 1 within minutes, whereas other grapevine peroxidases had no significant activity with GvP 1.

The best photosolubilization was achieved using a 1 / 100 mole ratio of mercaptan to cuprous bromide. <b>Insolubilization</b> improved with increased mercaptan digestion time while pH appeared to have little effect on this mechanism. PH did change final print-out density. Increased sensitivity was observed when the emulsion was re-exposed while still wet. Fixing or dissolution depends on several factors including emulsion thickness...|$|E
