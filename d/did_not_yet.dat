5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> exist.|$|E
5|$|O'Bannon {{had written}} 29 {{pages of a}} script titled Memory, {{containing}} {{what would become the}} opening scenes of Alien: a crew of astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been interrupted because they are receiving a signal from a mysterious planetoid.

5|$|Specimens of Archaeopteryx {{were most}} notable for their {{well-developed}} flight feathers. They were markedly asymmetrical {{and showed the}} structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a barb-barbule-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again {{in line with the}} situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The thumb <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers.|$|E
5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The inability of the sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{several of the}} routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> have a route number, such as the Preston–Norwich state highway, were assigned one. The road was designated as NY319 and maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation west of the Norwich city limits and {{by the city of}} Norwich within the city. The alignment of NY319 remained unchanged for the next half-century.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man & Bass debuted on {{the aging}} 16-bit Super Famicom despite the series having already transitioned to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with Mega Man 8. Producer Keiji Inafune claimed Mega Man & Bass was created {{with regard to}} younger players who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> own {{one of the more}} {{advanced}} gaming systems. The game received positive remarks from critics for its graphics and use of a tried-and-true gameplay formula, though many found the difficulty to be too steep. Although Mega Man & Bass shares many traits with previous console games in the series, the ninth numbered title would not be released until 2008.|$|E

5|$|Several modern {{commentators}} regard Staunton as {{de facto}} World Champion after his match victory over Saint-Amant, although that title <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> formally exist. After Saint-Amant's defeat, no other Frenchmen arose {{to continue the}} French supremacy in chess established by Philidor, Deschapelles, La Bourdonnais and Saint-Amant. Some contemporary English commentators, mainly in Staunton's Chess Player's Chronicle, and some later writers hailed Staunton as the world champion.All presented at From Chess Player's Chronicle vol. 5 p. 92 and p. 128.|$|E
5|$|The trailer piqued the {{interest}} of Twitch Film editor Todd Brown, who inquired if the project had entered production. When Matti {{told him that the}} film <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> have a screenplay, Brown encouraged him to write it while he looked for investors for financing. On the script's ninth revision, screenwriter Michiko Yamamotoknown for films such as Magnifico (2004) and Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros (2006)came on board to help finalize the remainder of the draft. Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details in the story.|$|E
5|$|This {{argument}} {{is based in}} part on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Bevans. In Bevans, the parties argued over whether a federal court in Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the case of a U.S. Marine charged with a murder that occurred on a ship in Boston Harbor. No issues regarding federal income taxation or the Internal Revenue Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E

5|$|When Bédard {{joined the}} project, the game {{focused on the}} 2D–3D {{mechanic}} and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> have open world ambitions. He coded the game in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. His first task, the level editor Fezzer, was coded from scratch in XNA and inspired by SketchUp. Bédard also wrote the game engine, Trixel Technology, which turns 2D tiles ("triles") into sides of a 3D cube pixel. The engine tracks player-character Gomez in 3D space even though the game behaves as a 2D platformer. Bédard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3D and 2D space.|$|E
5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E
5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> exist however, {{and so his}} engineer Reginald Skelton developed {{the idea of a}} caterpillar track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him {{all the way to the}} Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E
