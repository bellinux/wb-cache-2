5|$|Nearly all artillery, {{including}} howitzers, guns, anti-aircraft and rockets, were {{tasked with}} anti-tank defence.

Each anti-tank strong-point typically consisted of four to six anti-tank guns, six to nine anti-tank rifles, and five to seven heavy and light machine guns. They were supported by mobile obstacle detachments {{as well as by}} infantry with automatic firearms.

In China, {{it is not uncommon}} to encounter lower grain price due to the delays in their transportation. There are many reasons for the low living standards in rural areas, the obsolete rural logistic system, especially regarding agricultural products, is obviously one of them. Recently, to improve logistics development conditions of China's agricultural products, <b>every</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> government increased rural logistics investment in construction projects; however, there are still delay issues from the productions centers to the urban areas.

40|$|Vietnam {{has emerged}} {{recently}} {{as one of}} the fastest growing economies and widely be perceived as the next transition tiger. State capacity, which is believed to be pivotal to the success of the NIC, is under scrutiny inVietnam. This paper attempts to examine state capacity ofVietnam in the institutional, political, administrative and technical aspects employing examples in urban and housing development. This paper argues that despite the permeation of state machinery into <b>every</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> society and creates an outlook of a strong socialist party state, state capacity in Vietnam is in fact rather weak. Although the country is striving hard in strengthen its capacity in various areas, such reforms are either yet to take root or being dragged by legacy of the old regime. The unique state-society relationship in Vietnam also shapes the trajectories of adaptation of state capacity in the course of rapidly changing economic and social environment...|$|R
