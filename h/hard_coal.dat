5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E

30|$|Fang (2002) {{simulated}} {{the effect}} on the roof stability at face ends by support type using discrete element software and believes that under soft coals, the critical issue is to control the distance from the support tip to the coal wall, which must be controlled within the distance limit. Under the conditions of medium <b>hard</b> <b>coals,</b> the constraint distance from the support tip to coal wall is relatively large and thus there will be a rational arrangement for the tip to wall distance and support resistance force. For <b>hard</b> <b>coals,</b> the study focus should be on improving the top coal caving ability. In the study on the mechanical relationship of support and surrounding rock in a soft coal extraction, Huang (2002) found that the increase of support resistance can reduce the tensile stress range in the top coal between support tip and coal wall, increase the self-support capacity from the top coal between support tip and coal wall, and suppress the movement and fracture of top coals. Nevertheless, the increase of support resistance has a limited effect on the improvement of subsidence of unsupported zone between the support tip and coal wall.|$|R

40|$|The coal {{combustion}} processes constitute {{one of the}} major sources of heavy metals emission into the atmosphere.

Type, {{amount and}} {{composition}} of gases which form in rocks and coals during a metamorphism process depend {{on a number of}} factors in particular genetic type of original matter, way and conditions of its gathering, temperature, pressure and geological time. Sorption tests were done by the volumetric method, with the use of adsorption micro-burettes. A major advantage of the measurement set-up is that the surplus amounts of adsorbate can be used in experiments, which is of particular importance when handling sorbents with heterogeneous structure, such as <b>hard</b> <b>coals.</b> Sorbates used in the test program were the vapours of hexane, hex- 1 -ene, heptane, hept- 1 -ene, octane and benzene. Measurement results seem to corroborate the hypothesis that sorption of polar substance vapours is chiefly a surface process. Polarity of <b>hard</b> <b>coals,</b> mostly associated with the presence of reactive oxygen groups (nitrogen and sulphuric groups), largely affects the sorption of polar substances and in a most characteristic manner controls the sorption of apolar ones. In the case of the latter, sorption is induced by the action of the dispersive interaction force between the coal surface and the sorbate's polar molecules. The pattern of sorption isotherms indicates that the presence of dual bond affects the sorbent-sorbate interactions and hence the sorption capacity of investigated coals.
