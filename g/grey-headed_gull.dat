50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gull</b> (Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus), {{also known}} as the grey-hooded gull, is a small gull which breeds patchily in South America and Africa south of the Sahara. It is not truly migratory, but is more {{widespread}} in winter. This species has occurred as a rare vagrant to North America, Italy and Spain. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus Larus.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gull</b> is {{slightly}} larger than the black-headed gull at 42 cm length. The summer adult has a pale grey head, a grey body, darker in tone than the black-headed, and red bill and legs. The black tips to the primary wing feathers have conspicuous white [...] "mirrors". The underwing is dark grey with black wingtips. The grey hood is lost in winter, leaving just dark streaks.|$|E
50|$|The Hartlaub's gull {{takes two}} years to reach maturity. Juvenile birds have a brown band across the wings. They differ from same-age <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> in that they lack a black {{terminal}} tail band, less dark areas in the wings, darker legs, and a white head.|$|R
50|$|The Snowdon Aviary was {{designed}} by Cedric Price, Frank Newby and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, and was built in 1964. A variety of birds have been kept in the aviary since it was opened, and it currently houses green peafowl, sacred ibis, little egrets, cattle egrets, northern bald ibis and <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gulls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tanji Bird Reserve has had around 300 {{species of}} birds {{recorded}} within it, including 82 species of Palearctic migrants. The reserve has been declared as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International. Species seen regularly on the reserve's lagoons include Black-headed heron, white-fronted plover, Caspian tern, spur-winged plover, sanderling, Western reef heron, royal tern and lesser black-backed gull. While the Bijol Islands are an important feeding and roosting area for substantial numbers of shorebirds, seabirds, ospreys, and other birds, including Gambia's only breeding seabirds, including colonies of <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gulls,</b> slender-billed gulls, royal terns, Caspian terns, long-tailed cormorants and Western reef herons.|$|R
5000|$|Hartlaub's gull is 36-38 cm in length. It is a mainly white gull with a {{grey back}} and upperwings, black wingtips with {{conspicuous}} white [...] "mirrors", {{and a dark}} red bill and legs. When breeding {{it has a very}} faint lavender grey hood, but otherwise has a plain white head. Sexes are similar. This species differs from the slightly larger <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gull</b> in its thinner, darker bill, deeper red legs, paler, plainer head, and dark eyes.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{purposes}} of this protected area is to provide a sanctuary for Nearctic migratory birds, as it is a unique habitat on almost 2000 km of coast on the Pacific Ocean. A total of 200 species of resident and migratory birds {{can be found in the}} park including: the grey gull, the sanderling, the Black skimmer, Belcher's gull, the kelp gull, the <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>gull,</b> the White-tufted grebe, the Great grebe, the White-cheeked pintail, the Cinnamon teal, the Common moorhen, the Virginia rail, the Cocoi heron, the Snowy egret, the Little blue heron, the Chilean flamingo, among others.|$|E
50|$|Three shallow {{alkaline}} {{lakes and}} the surrounding lands make up the Kenya Lake system: Lake Bogoria at 10700 ha, Lake Nakuru at 18800 ha and Lake Elementaita at 2534 ha. This system {{has one of the}} most diverse populations of birds in the world, and is the home of thirteen globally threatened species of bird. It is an important nesting and breeding site for great white pelicans, and is the most important feeding area for lesser flamingos in the world. The system is home to globally important populations of black-necked grebe, African spoonbill, pied avocet, little grebe, yellow-billed stork, black-winged stilt, <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gull</b> and gull-billed tern.|$|E
40|$|Ile aux Oiseaux, a small {{barrier island}} on the south-westen {{fringe of the}} Saloum Delta, Senegal, grows {{at a rate of}} about 100 in's per year in south-easten direction. It hosts an {{impressive}} breeding population of royal tens (Sterna maxima), caspian terns (Sterna caspia), slender-billed gulls (Larus genei) and <b>grey-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus cirrocephalus). All these are ground-breeding birds, and very vulnerable to predation and human disturbance. The Saloum Delta National Park's administration is trying to set up an effective protection against intruders. Ideally the expected breeding areas should be picketed off before the breeding season's start. In order to determine beforehand which areas are to be declared off-limits one should know which criteria the birds use for selecting the breeding sites. From 1998 till 2003 I undertook detailed annual surveys of the island's topography, its vegetation and the location of breeding colonies. The colonial species, i. e. royal terns, caspian terns and slender-billed gulls consistently showed preference for the vicinity of new beach crests, either on bare sand or where the vegetation was still low. Some colonies however are found inland, be it on former beach crests or on former beaches. <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> instead breed in a scattered fashion on low vegetation, mostly sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum). Breeding sites are located exclusively on the island's most dynamic parts, its northern and southern extremes, in areas where little or no pioneer vegetation is to be found...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{analysis}} of growth data is important as {{it allows us}} to assess how fast things grow and determine various factors that have impact on their growth. In the current study, growth measurements on body features (body mass, wing length, head length, bill (culmen) length, foot length, and tarsus length) for Grey-headed Gulls populating Bonaero Park and Modderfontein Pan in Gauteng province, South Africa, and for Swift Terns on Robben Island were taken. Different methods such as polynomial regressions, non-parametric models and non-linear mixed effects models have been used to fit models to growth data. In recent years, non-linear mixed effects models have become an important tool for growth models. We have fitted univariate inverse exponential, Gompertz, logistic, and Richards non-linear mixed effects models to each of the six body features. We have modeled these six features simultaneously by adding a categorical covariate, which distinguishes between different features, to the model. This approach allows for straightforward comparison of growth between the different body features. In growth studies, the knowledge of the age of each individual is an essential information for growth analysis. For Swift Terns, the exact age of most chicks was unknown, but {{a small portion of the}} sample was followed from nestling up to the end of the study period. For chicks with unknown age, we estimated age by fitting the growth curve, obtained from birds with known age, to the mass measurements of the chick with unknown age. It was found that the logistic models were most appropriate to describe the growth of body mass and wing length while the Gompertz models provided best fits for bill, tarsus, head and foot for Grey-headed Gulls. For Swift Terns, the inverse exponential model provided the best univariate fit for four of six features. The logistic model, with a variance function increasing as a power of fitted values, with a different power for each feature and autoregressive correlation structure for within bird errors with errors from different features within the same subject assumed to be independent, gave the best model to describe the growth of all body features taken simultaneously for both <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> and Swift Tern data. It was shown that growth of <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> and Swift Tern chicks occurs in the following order (foot, body mass, tarsus) -(bill, head) -(wing) and (tarsus, foot) -(body mass, bill, head) -(wing), respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} {{paper on the}} ecology of fish-eating birds on Lake Kariba {{and their impact on}} fish populations within and beyond the lake. Most fish-eating species which were present in the middle Zambezi valley before inundation still occur on the lake (Donnelly and Donnelly 1983) and only those which occupied specialized habitats now lost through flooding have disappeared or become scarce and restricted (e g. Rufous-bellied Heron, African Skimmer, Little Bittern). White-breasted Cormorants disappeared from the lake after 1963 but have now returned (Hustler et al. 1986, Hustler 1986 a). Species that have colonized the lake include the Black Egret, Lesser Black- backed Gull, <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Gull</b> and White-winged Black Tern. The last three species have probably responded to the large areas of open water formed by the lake and the increase in fishing activity (Begg 1973, Hustler 1986 b). There is no permanent population of Pelicans on Lake Kariba (Irwin 1981) but small numbers have been recorded periodically in recent years (Hustler 1987). These birds are abundant in shallow lakes such as Lake St. Lucia, South Africa (Whitfield and Cyrus 1978) and Lake Nakuru, Kenya (Vareschi and Jacobs 1984), and are absent from Lake Kariba because there are few suitable shallow areas. Fish-eating birds on the lake can be divided into residents, migrants and vagrants. It is likely that most resident species have increased in number because of the longer shoreline and greater availability of fish. Intra-African or palearctic migrants may be present for up to six months every year but their numbers vary considerably. The present investigations were sponsored for many years by the University of Zimbabwe Research Board and by the Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries (SAREC) ...|$|E
