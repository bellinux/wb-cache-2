An insider said: [...] "The trouble is that while Alfie is busy playing that game, a delivery driver who calls at the Queen Vic makes a big play for Kat – and soon she's facing serious temptation." [...] The insider added: [...] "Kat is vulnerable, insecure and at odds with Alfie. It's {{exactly the sort of}} state that could see her do something very stupid indeed. Alfie has done serious damage to their marriage but Kat could destroy it completely." [...] Another source added: [...] "In accusing her of cheating on him, Alfie has undone years of good work in building up Kat's self-esteem. No matter what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>now,</b> she feels as though he still sees her as a woman of loose morals. He cooks up a hare-brained plan to keep Kat by treating her mean – and starts ignoring her, basically." ...|$|E
2500|$|I later learned, {{a copy of}} my {{personal}} credit report– with detailed information about my bank accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number– had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union. The sham company that received it, [...] "Educational Funding Services" [...] of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop {{a few blocks from}} Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys [...] "had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them." [...] <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>now,</b> [...] "These are vicious people. These are vipers." [...] Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. … [...] After that, however, an attorney subpoenaed me, while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). [...] A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me– an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained {{my personal}} phone records. [...] Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME's lawyers as [...] "proof" [...] of my bias against Scientology.|$|E

6000|$|The poor Girondins, many of them, {{under such}} fierce bellowing of Patriotism, say Death; {{justifying}}, motivant, that most miserable word of theirs by some brief casuistry and jesuitry. Vergniaud himself says, Death; justifying by jesuitry. Rich Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau had been of the Noblesse, {{and then of}} the Patriot Left Side, in the Constituent; and had argued and reported, there and elsewhere, not a little, against Capital Punishment: nevertheless he now says, Death; a word which may cost him dear.

In this Convention, above all, no word he could speak would find favour; <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>now,</b> Banishment; and in mute wrath quits the place for ever,--much hustled in the corridors. Philippe Egalite votes in his soul and conscience, Death, at the sound of which, and of whom, even Patriotism shakes its head; and there runs a groan and shudder through this Hall of Doom. Robespierre's vote cannot be doubtful; his speech is long.

6000|$|But Douglas {{says that}} he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of those laws because, in his view, it is a {{compromise}} of the Constitution. You Kentuckians, no doubt, are somewhat offended with that. You ought not to be! You ought to be patient! You ought to know that if he said less than that, he would lose the power of [...] "lugging" [...] the Northern States to your support. Really, what you would push him to do would take from him his entire power to serve you. And you ought to remember how long, by precedent, Judge Douglas holds himself obliged to stick by compromises. You ought to remember that by the time you yourselves think you are ready to inaugurate measures for the revival of the African slave trade, that sufficient time will have arrived, by precedent, for Judge Douglas to break through, that compromise. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>now</b> nothing more strong than he said in 1849 when he declared in favor of Missouri Compromise,--and precisely four years and a quarter after he declared that Compromise to be a sacred thing, which [...] "no ruthless hand would ever daze to touch," [...] he himself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to destroy it. By a mere calculation of time it will only be four years more until he is ready to take back his profession about the sacredness of the Compromise abolishing the slave trade. Precisely as soon as you are ready to have his services in that direction, by fair calculation, you may be sure of having them.|$|E

6000|$|The Dred Scott {{decision}} expressly gives {{every citizen}} of the United States a right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories. And now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, {{that the people of}} the Territory could lawfully drive slavery out again. When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was cleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare absurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be. Clear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay. Well, it was because the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery. He does not say so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he made here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he has never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery. He desires that you, who wish the Territories to remain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does not say it himself. He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have stated, by changing his language entirely. What <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>now</b> is something different in language, and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too. It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the Constitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the Territories beyond the power {{of the people of the}} Territories to control it as other property. He does not say the people can drive it out, but they can control it as other property. The language is different; we should consider whether the sense is different. Driving a horse out of this lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about; it is putting him on the other side of the fence. Or it might be a sort of exclusion of him from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him; but neither of these things is the same as [...] "controlling him as other property." [...] That would be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use and abuse him, to make the most money out of him, [...] "as other property"; but, please you, what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more than this? What do they really want, other than that slavery, being in the Territories, shall be controlled as other property? If they want anything else, I do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, first, for the purpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge has made; and, in the second place, the importance of the change,--that that change is not such as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power to exclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the judge sometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property by unfriendly legislation they may control it to death; as you might, in the case of a horse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much that he would die. But when you come to legislative control, there is something more to be attended to. I have no doubt, myself, that if the Territories should undertake to control slave property as other property that is, control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as property, and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens as property, really deal with it as property,--the Supreme Court of the United States will say, [...] "God speed you, and amen." [...] But I undertake to give the opinion, at least, that if the Territories attempt by any direct legislation to drive the man with his slave out of the Territory, or to decide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there, or to tax him to such an extent that he cannot keep him there, the Supreme Court will unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional, as long as that Supreme Court is constructed as the Dred Scott Supreme Court is. The first two things they have already decided, except that there is a little quibble among lawyers between the words [...] "dicta" [...] and [...] "decision." [...] They have already decided a negro cannot be made free by Territorial legislation.|$|E
