5|$|Females of many spider species, {{including}} P. labiata, emit volatile pheromones <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> these generally attract males from a distance. The silk draglines {{of female}} jumping spiders also contain pheromones, which stimulate males to court females and may give information about each female's status, for example whether the female is juvenile, subadult or mature.|$|E

Nearly two weeks later, on August 21, 2012, an uncontrolled blast for the Second Avenue Subway station at 72nd Street was done incorrectly, causing a large explosion that sent debris <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> broke windows of buildings {{in the area and}} damaged nearby sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E

5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 feet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of}} the French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, {{the project}} {{expanded}} to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium {{for most of the}} more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of radioactive materials <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E

5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets {{slammed into the}} base, leveling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off {{an explosion in the}} main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E

5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E

5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice shavings are thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and {{calls out to}} Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and {{they set out to}} find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Morgan's battery departed for the Western Front in October 1914 as part of the 3rd (Lahore) Division. Morgan suffered a near-miss from a German 5.9-inch gun which blew him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> buried him in a shell hole, and he was evacuated to hospital in Boulogne with shell shock. He was granted a short sick leave in England only to be present when news reached his family that his brother had been killed in action. On returning to the front, Morgan became aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Edward Spencer Hoare-Nairne, the commander of the Lahore Divisional Artillery. The artillery remained on the Western Front when the bulk of the division departed for the Mesopotamian campaign. As it took longer to train artillery than infantry, the Lahore divisional artillery acted in turn as the artillery of the 2nd Canadian Division, 3rd Canadian Division, 4th Australian Division and finally the 4th Canadian Division until their own artillery was sufficiently trained to take over.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 32-yard line, Davis {{threw an}} {{incomplete}} pass then connected on a 21-yard pass to Jarvis {{for a first}} down. After an incomplete pass, Davis threw another pass to Jarvis, who caught it at the four-yard line. Facing third down, Davis attempted another pass. The ball was tipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> caught by Virginia Tech defender Brent Warren. The Hokies resumed running down the clock with short rushes by Evans, who advanced {{the ball to the}} 13-yard line with 3:05 remaining in the game. Boston College used its allotted second-half timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time for a late scoring drive. In a strategic move, Tech coach Frank Beamer ordered an intentional safety rather than attempt a punt from the Tech end zone. Any such kick {{has the potential to be}} blocked for a defensive touchdown. Thus, an intentional safety gives the defense two points while denying them the slight chance to score seven. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 30–12 with 3:05 remaining, but the limited time remaining meant Tech's lead would be sufficient to win the game without a series of unlikely events.|$|E

5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|In Australia's reply, Lindwall {{came in at}} 6/304 and {{attacked}} immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 7/332. The visitors ended on 389 and England started their second innings late on the second day. Debutant John Dewes took strike and got off the mark when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall’s steepling bouncer had risen over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Lindwall made the early breakthrough soon after, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England at 1/20. Dewes often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> the Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E
