40|$|Thin-walled, {{high-strength}} concrete elements exhibiting low system {{weight and}} great slenderness {{can be created}} with a large degree of lightweight structure using the textile-reinforced, load-bearing concrete (TRC) slab and a shell with {{a very high level}} of sound absorption. This was developed with the objective of lowering system weight, and then implemented operationally in construction. Arising from the specifications placed on the load-bearing concrete slab, the following took place: an adapted fine-grain concrete matrix was assembled, a carbon warp-knit fabric was modified and integrated into the <b>fine</b> <b>concrete</b> matrix, a <b>formwork</b> system at prototype scale was designed enabling noise barriers to be produced with an application-oriented approach and examined in practically investigations {{within the context of the}} project. This meant that a substantial lowering of the load-bearing concrete slab’s system weight was possible, which led to a decrease in transport and assembly costs...|$|R

40|$|More and more, {{people are}} looking to build and live in {{different}} ways. They want houses with a high standard of living and reasonable production and maintenance costs.

MMC include prefabricated products made in the factory and also new methods of building that are site-based and they are regarded as a means of achieving higher quality, reducing time spent onsite, increasing safety and overcoming skills shortages in the industry.

40|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>formwork</b> is {{a common}} type of {{temporary}} structure used on construction projects. Due to difficulties in considering actual construction site implications during formwork design, assessments of formwork integrity are often made in the field by site personnel based on subjective visual inspection. The use and re-use of <b>concrete</b> <b>formwork</b> exposes the workers involved in formwork use to different types of injury. This research study aims at: (i) mapping a general site activity workflow for the use and re-use of vertical formwork; (ii) evaluating onsite safety risks associated with formwork use and re-use activities, and (iii) assessing the reliability associated with formwork use and re-use. Development of the mapped workflow and identification of safety risks associated with each activity were based on interviews of construction site foremen involved in formwork construction and jobsite observations of formwork construction activities. Based on results from the survey on 32 carpenters engaged in concrete work, worker risk associated with formwork activities was quantified. Erection, stripping, and assembly of formwork {{were found to be}} activities that contribute most to the cumulative risk. The worker perception on the safety risk was compared to the recorded Occupational Safet...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{method of}} {{generation}} {{of a stable}} suspension of nano-particles of titanium dioxide and the strengthening properties of the ornamental <b>fine</b> <b>concrete</b> that contains cement binders with a nano-dispersed additive constitute {{the subject of the}} research covered by the authors. Nanoparticles react with the basic chemical elements that compose the concrete and act as crystallization centres. Therefore, the concrete porosity is reduced, while physical and technology-related properties of the ornamental <b>fine</b> <b>concrete</b> are improved. The authors have proven that the application of the nano-dispersed additive that contains titanium dioxide influences the processes of the structure formation in respect of <b>fine</b> ornamental <b>concretes</b> and improves the strength, as well as the water and cold resistance of <b>fine</b> <b>concretes.</b> The improvement is attributed to the dense concrete structure and strong adhesion between cement grains and between the cement and the aggregate.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} a case study of low-income housing situated in a warm-temperate climate (Morelia, Mexico). It represents the first comprehensive evaluation of thermal comfort in a widely used <b>concrete</b> <b>formwork</b> construction system in that country. The study was conducted in two seasons, determined by climatic analysis identifying the months that presented the most extreme conditions during the year. Indoor thermal conditions were monitored and are compared with the adaptive comfort temperature and comfort zone derived from existing standards. A thermal comfort field survey was also conducted, including the distribution of questionnaires in both seasons. The findings are compared with monitored data to assess the overall thermal performance of the housing typology. The results reveal poor thermal performance with houses falling significantly outside the thermal comfort boundaries in both periods due to a number of factors, including the properties of the building envelope, the impact of solar radiation, the number of occupants and their behavior. The results indicate that it is easier for subjects to adapt to cooler rather than warmer conditions. These findings expand existing knowledge of the performance of this <b>concrete</b> <b>formwork</b> system in Mexico as well as other industrialised building systems in similar climates. It demonstrates the urgency of designing viable solutions according to local climate, and questions the use of identical housing prototypes across different climatic regions...|$|R

The CSS {{is a combination of}} a precast <b>concrete</b> <b>formwork</b> and in is supposed to be cast at the construction site. It is intended that the precast con position before the structural top layer is cast. The precast <b>concrete</b> <b>formwork</b> consist of a relatively thin bottom layer in normal concrete with a thicker steel fiber reinforced lightweight concrete The CSS concept is supposed to be an alternative to today’s existing slab solutions in buildings and harbor structures. The C concept is lighter than a traditional concrete slab, but with maintained load carrying capacity. For a typical 250 weight reduction would be up to 35 % compared to a traditional concrete slab. The precast CSS elements are also stiffer than today’s existing precast products, which means that the number of temporary supports needed during the constructio be reduced or eliminated. This reduction would lead to saved time, space and money at the construction site. The lightweight concrete used in the precast formwork has an approximate density of 900 kg/m strength in laboratory tests with respect to compressive strength, tensile strength and shear capacity. Since the material properties for lightweight that agreement can be obtained and that the material models used are valid for this specific concrete. The results indicate...|$|R
