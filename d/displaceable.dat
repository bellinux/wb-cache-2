50|$|His Geotrophics {{collection}} for Spring/Summer 1999 had already featured Chair Dresses that represented {{the idea of}} a nomadic existence and a completely transportable environment. This concept was later expanded in Chalayan’s After Words {{collection for}} Fall/Winter 2000. which included some of his most well known designs such as ‘the coffee table dress'. In Afterwords, Hussein Chalayan focused on the involuntary and dramatic aspect of mobility, and illustrated the sentimental impacts of forced migration. Presented at Sadler’s Wells theatre in London, the show featured a bare, white stage flanked by asymmetrical planes on three sides and contained 1950s-style furniture that the models adapted as clothing in the show’s finale and either carried or wore off the stage. One of the models transforms a mahogany coffee table into a geometrical and telescopic skirt, so that it becomes <b>displaceable</b> on human body. The show was based on the idea of having to evacuate home during a time of war, hiding possessions when a raid was impending, and using clothing as the means to carry away possessions more quickly. The theme was an autobiographical expression of Chalayan’s Turkish Cypriot roots and the political events that affected his childhood.However Chalayan does not merely illustrate the situation, he challenges the historical context in which the immigrants had to leave behind their possessions and lose their identity because of their un-portable quality of the objects. Since he designs the clothes as portable private properties, the immigrants can carry these items that define their identities and cultures with them during their unwanted journeys. This way he allows them a relatively more active position where they can adapt the physical nature to the social context.The Table Skirt and the entire set from the show were later featured in the 2001 Tate Modern’s Century City exhibition in London.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable transmission members having mating crown gears, driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a driven member. The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially <b>displaceable</b> and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures <b>displaceable</b> gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against <b>displaceable</b> gear for biasing the <b>displaceable</b> gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, crown gear sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple torque driver mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity. Prior torque drivers such as 'click-type' torque wrenches do not actually limit torque application but only provide an audible warning that the limit has been reached...|$|E
