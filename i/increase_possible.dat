5000|$|Nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{are used}} in load-bearing structures to the highest homologous temperature of any common alloy system (Tm = 0.9, or 90% of their melting point). Among the most demanding applications for a structural material are those in the hot sections of turbine engines. The preeminence of superalloys {{is reflected in the}} fact that they currently comprise over 50% of the weight of advanced aircraft engines. The widespread use of superalloys in turbine engines coupled {{with the fact that the}} thermodynamic efficiency of turbine engines is increased with increasing turbine inlet temperatures has, in part, provided the motivation for increasing the maximum-use temperature of superalloys. In fact, during the past 30 years turbine airfoil temperature capability has increased on average by about 4 °F (2.2 °C) per year. Two major factors which have made this <b>increase</b> <b>possible</b> are ...|$|E
50|$|One {{observation}} {{that has been}} made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods. In an examination of mammal body mass changes over time, the maximum <b>increase</b> <b>possible</b> in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power. This is thought to reflect the emergence, during a trend of increasing maximum body size, of a series of anatomical, physiological, environmental, genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible. A strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass, such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism. When normalized to generation length, the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change.|$|E

More surprisingly, this misspecification bias exacerbates when the number of time series observations <b>increases.</b> <b>Possible</b> ways of detecting useless factors are also examined...|$|R

In order to cover all possible quench scenarios the dynamic range of the beam loss monitors has to be matched to the simulated loss rates. For that purpose different detector systems (PIN-diodes and ionization chambers) are compared...|$|E

40|$|Ca {{added to}} the {{solution}} bathing the outside of isolated frog skin causes a decrease in net Na transport across the skin while antidiuretic hormone (ADH) causes an <b>increase.</b> <b>Possible</b> interrelations between {{the effects of these}} agents have been examined. The decrease in Na transport caused by Ca was the same before and after treatment of the skin with ADH and the increase in transport caused by ADH was unaffected by the presence of Ca. The relationship between Ca concentration and degree of inhibition of Na transport was not appreciably altered by ADH. These results indicate that Ca and ADH do not compete but act independently at two different sites and these sites appear to be located on the same barrier to Na movement in the skin. Further, Ca causes a decrease in Cl influx across the short-circuited skin but ADH has no effect on Cl movement, again suggesting that the actions of these agents are independent...|$|E
