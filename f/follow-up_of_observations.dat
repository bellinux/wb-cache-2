40|$|The Universe is {{comprised}} of {{hundreds of billions of}} galaxies, each populated by hundreds of billions of stars. Astrophysics aims to understand the complexity of this almost incommensurable number of stars, stellar clusters and galaxies, including their spatial distribution, formation, and current interactions with the interstellar and intergalactic media. A considerable fraction of astrophysical discoveries require large statistical samples, which can only be addressed with multi-object spectrographs (MOS). Here we introduce the MOSAIC study of an optical/near-infrared MOS for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), which has capabilities specified by science cases ranging from stellar physics and exoplanet studies to galaxy evolution and cosmology. Recent studies of critical technical issues such as sky-background subtraction and multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) have demonstrated that such a MOS is feasible with current technology and techniques. In the 2020 s the E-ELT will become the world’s largest optical/IR telescope, and we argue {{that it has to be}} equipped as soon as possible with a MOS. MOSAIC will provide a vast discovery space, enabled by a multiplex of ∼ 200 and spectral resolving powers of R = 5 000 and 20 000. MOSAIC will also offer the unique capability of 10 -to- 20 ‘high-definition’ (MOAO) integral-field units, optimised to investigate the physics of the sources of reionisation, providing the most efficient <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The combination of these modes will enable the study of the mass-assembly history of galaxies over cosmic time, including high-redshift dwarf galaxies and studies of the distribution of the intergalactic medium. It will also provide spectroscopy of resolved stars in external galaxies at unprecedented distances, from the outskirts of the Local Group for main-sequence stars, to a significant volume of the local Universe, including nearby galaxy clusters, for luminous red supergiants...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the issues of organization <b>of</b> long-term <b>follow-up</b> monitoring <b>of</b> the patient population in real clinical practice. Every medical intervention is analyzed from the position of positive evidence of its effectiveness, safety and clinical-economic benefits. Although randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard of evidence-based medicine, they feature a range of drawbacks; in some cases, such trials are infeasible are extremely complicated to perform due to certain aspects. Along with that, results of RCTs may not completely correlate with clinical practice. Thus, a register – a system of long-term clinical monitoring of a patient population – is a significant source of information on effectiveness and safety of medical interventions. This tool <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> a patient’s condition is irreplaceable in medicine, particularly, in allergology both for epidemiological purposes and to assess effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions: e. g., use of IgE antibodies – biopharmaceutical omalizumab.

40|$|The MAGIC telescopes are {{strongly}} involved in several multimessenger programs. One <b>of</b> them are <b>follow-up</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> astrophysical neutrino events, {{to search for}} hadronic γ-ray emission from the neutrino direction and identify potential neutrino sources. In 2013 the IceCube collaboration reported the first detection of astrophysical neutrinos and up to now 55 events, which interact inside the IceCube detector active volume, dubbed High Energy Starting Events (HESE), have been reported. These include 13 track-like events, caused usually by muon neutrino charge current interactions. The track-like events (as opposed to cascade-like neutral current interactions) are characterised by a very good angular resolution of < 1 deg, which facilitates follow-up observations and potential source identification.
