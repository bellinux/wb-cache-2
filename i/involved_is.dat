5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the {{adoption}} of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These events may have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|In many {{practical}} situations {{additional information}} about the matrices <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> known. An important case are sparse matrices, that is, matrices most of whose entries are zero. There are specifically adapted algorithms for, say, solving linear systems Ax = b for sparse matrices A, such as the conjugate gradient method.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
50|$|US forces {{reported}} to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>were</b> the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. Iraqi forces {{reported to}} <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>were</b> the 4th Brigade, 6th Iraqi Army Division.|$|R
50|$|<b>Involve</b> <b>is</b> {{based in}} Old Street in Central London. <b>Involve's</b> Director <b>is</b> Simon Burall and the Chair of Involve's Board of Trustees <b>is</b> Ed Mayo. <b>Involve</b> <b>was</b> founded in 2004 by Richard Wilson to {{determine}} how new forms of public participation can strengthen democracy in Britain and elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} self-financed by Doan Nguyen, and {{everyone}} <b>involved</b> <b>was</b> a volunteer {{as there was}} no money to pay them. Many of those <b>involved</b> <b>were</b> students who wanted to get experience in movie making, without having to move to another city.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively, {{to ensure}} that an {{entertainment}} or exhibition is not detrimental to the public interest, the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter, every person involved in its promotion, and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held. Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence, unless the person <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> able to show {{he or she was}} not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution. The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition, or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E

50|$|Genes <b>involved</b> <b>are</b> IGF-2, CDKN1C, H19, and KCNQ1OT1.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>involved</b> <b>was</b> a 1991-built Let L-410 Turbolet, registered 9Q-CCN, {{with construction}} number 912608. It normally carries up to 19 passengers. The aircraft <b>involved</b> <b>was</b> previously registered ES-LLB, and was operated by Airest, an Estonian airline, until 2007, and was stored until Filair {{bought it in}} 2009.|$|R
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> known as a pathogen. The {{process by which the}} pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
50|$|The arrests {{were the}} {{culmination}} of {{an investigation by the}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) The RCMP received cooperation and assistance from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the Canada Border Services Agency. Provincial police forces <b>involved</b> <b>were</b> the Ontario Provincial Police and the Sûreté du Québec. Municipal police forces <b>involved</b> <b>were</b> the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, the Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police, and the Durham Regional Police. Private security forces <b>involved</b> <b>were</b> corporate physical security teams from Via Rail Canada and CN Rail.|$|R

5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark, {{which follows}} {{the events of}} Blood-C, {{is set in a}} version of Earth where humans are preyed upon by monsters called Elder Bairns; to keep humans safe, the Elder Bairns honor a {{covenant}} dubbed Shrovetide, a contract between humans and Elder Bairns that allows Elder Bairns to feed on humans for a limited period of time. During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights Elder Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an Elder Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in which she would subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath. The experiment fails, and everyone <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> massacred aside from Fumito, his ally Yūka Amino, and Saya herself. Betrayed by Fumito, Saya swears vengeance against him. By the events of The Last Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and regulates the use of the internet.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> secondary to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential tether is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} {{equations}} <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> symmetric and tridiagonal (banded with bandwidth 3), and is typically solved using tridiagonal matrix algorithm.|$|E

25|$|Whether BBB {{dysfunction}} is {{the cause}} or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could {{also play a role}} in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called CD166), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> CXCL12, which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of CXCL13 under methylprednisolone therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|If {{all food}} <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> pareve, but one is cooked on dairy equipment, {{and the other}} is cooked on meat equipment, all {{physical}} separations are required, but no special appearance is needed, because there is no concern of mar'it 'ayin.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{certainly}} {{occurred during}} Western Jin (265–316). Some {{of it is}} haunted by {{the social and political}} turmoils involved with the various changes of the times. Since the time span <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> about 50 years, many poets and trends in poetry transcend these somewhat arbitrary limits.|$|E

25|$|The mytheme of the Judgement of Paris {{naturally}} offered artists {{the opportunity}} to depict a sort of beauty contest between three beautiful female nudes, but the myth, at least since Euripides, rather concerns a choice among the gifts that each goddess embodies. The bribery <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> ironic and a late ingredient.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} both {{processes}} is disruption of cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair, and, therefore, tumour formation. ERα is certainly {{associated with more}} differentiated tumours, while evidence that ERβ is <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> controversial. Different versions of the ESR1 gene have been identified (with single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and are associated with different risks of developing breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{trapping}} {{mechanism of}} Utricularia is purely mechanical; no {{reaction from the}} plant (irritability) is required {{in the presence of}} prey, in contrast with the triggered mechanisms employed by Venus flytraps (Dionaea), waterwheels (Aldrovanda), and many sundews (Drosera). The only active mechanism <b>involved</b> <b>is</b> the constant pumping out of water through the bladder walls by active transport.|$|E
