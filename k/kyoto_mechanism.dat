40|$|International <b>Kyoto</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are {{especially}} designed to reach worldwide emissions reduction targets globally. The main intention behind {{the idea of}} emissions abatement attainment by <b>Kyoto</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is to make emissions cut opportunities more flexible and to allow the trade of emissions permits (ET) and the investment transfer from industrialized to less developed countries or regions in transition (CDM or JI) instead of or additional to emission abatement by domestic policy strategies.

40|$|Unrestricted {{use of the}} <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> yields {{substantial}} {{cost savings}} on {{the implementation of the}} Kyoto Protocol. Annex-I emission trading can cut compliance costs by more than a third while global trading can further reduce costs to a fraction of the amount without emission trading. In absolute terms, emission trading may reduce compliance costs up to $ 300 billion and bring down the permit price below $ 5 t/CO 2. Restricting the use of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Mechanisms,</b> such as ceiling on the sales or purchases of emission permits wipes out a substantial part of these cost savings. A ceiling on permits sales has probably a larger impact on emission trading than limiting purchases; mainly the buyers suffer since they have to pay more for emission permits as well as take more expensive domestic measures to reduce emissions. The EU-proposal for a ceiling on both permit sales and purchases favours the USA but harms the EU, a result opposite the negotiating positions of both parties on this subject. Market power and market segmentation also imply limiting the flexibility of emission trading and hence increase compliance costs. The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> have a strong but varying impact on carbon leakage. Without emission trading, carbon leakage is about 10 - 20 % but since Annex-I trading lowers the permit price, the impact on energy prices is lower and hence carbon leakage is only 3 - 7 %. CDM on the other hand increases carbon leakage to 30 - 40 %...|$|R
50|$|Annex I Parties {{may also}} use International Emissions Trading (IET).

It is also possible for Annex I countries to sponsor carbon projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries. These projects generate tradable carbon credits that can be used by Annex I countries in meeting their caps. The project-based Kyoto Mechanisms are the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI).

The analysis indicates that non-CO 2 GHG emission reduction is a key strategy for emission reduction representing 25 % of the total EU emission reduction in the Kyoto period. The bulk of non-CO 2 emissions is not energy related. Agriculture is an important source of non-CO 2 emissions. Forestry is important because of the carbon storage potential and the potential to produce renewable biomass. The calculations show that greenhouse gas emission reduction may well have significant impacts on agriculture and forestry on the long term. MARKAL studies for non-EU countries allow the identification of important strategies and key projects for CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) and JI (Joint Implementation).

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol {{stipulates}} that industrialised countries and countries with economies in transition, i. e. {{the group of}} Annex I countries, shall reduce their overall {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} and other five greenhouse gases by at least 5 % as compared to their 1990 emission levels.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{recent developments}} in U. S. climate policies. Although the United States does {{not participate in the}} <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> a number of climate policies are being implemented at state level {{as well as at the}} federal level. First, we report and compare the federal cap and trade proposals in the 110 th Congress. Then, the paper illustrates the current situations of state level climate policies, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern states or AB 32 in California. We analyze these proposals from the viewpoint of technology policies and impacts on international markets. It is found that technology policies play important roles in the cap and trade proposals and that there is a great expectation for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology. In terms of the impacts on international markets, several federal proposals as well as regional programs permit trading in international markets. As emission targets become more stringent in the future, U. S. GHG emitters are more likely to interact with these markets. Thus, despite the lack of U. S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol, U. S. markets will be linked to foreign markets, at least, in an indirect way. Key Words: United States, climate policy, cap and trade, the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{an approach}} to measuring and improving the economic and ecological efficiency of <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Mechanism</b> projects. The approach consists of Global Warming Eco-Efficiency (GWEE), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) & Joint Implementation (JI) Environmental-Efficiency (EE) and CDM & JI Economic-Productivity (EP). The GWEE indicator {{is based on the}} ratio of the value added of a system to its global warming influence in order to measure the eco-efficiency of a product in terms of the global warming issue. In addition, CDM & JI EE and CDM & JI EP are proposed to measure the environmental and economic performances of CDM and JI projects, respectively. While EE is defined as the ratio of the Certified Emission Reductions (CER) obtained from a CDM project or Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) from a JI project to total global warming influence relevant to the CDM or JI implemented, EP is defined as the ratio of the total of CER profit (and ERU profit) and the sales revenue to the costs of the CDM (and JI) implemented.

Parametric surveys were carried out for natural gas and CHP capital prices, which inherently include large uncertainties; the resultant calculations revealed {{that in some cases}} the CHP would be voluntarily (i. e., without financial support from an investor's country) introduced in China, and that in some cases the CHP could be certified as a CDM project with financial support by the investor country.

40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one {{of three}} {{flexible}} mechanisms included in the Kyoto Protocol. It enables Annex I countries to finance emission reductions in developing (non-Annex I) countries and use the credits thus obtained to meet their emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The CDM has two objectives: to reduce the costs of compliance of the Annex I countries' emission reduction commitments, and to assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). The major part of emission reductions under the CDM (certified emission reductions - CERs) comes from renewable energy investments, reduction of nonCO 2 greenhouse gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide), and energy-efficiency projects. Over two-third of projects and emission reductions occur in China and India. The uneven geographical distribution of projects and the lack of consistent control of projects' contribution to sustainable development make some contend that the CDM has not fulfilled its initial objectives.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question of high practical relevance for climate policy design is whether price controls such as CO 2 taxes, or quantity restrictions such as emission quotas should be preferred. I show {{that as the}} reach of climate policies is limited in terms of either suboptimally low reduction targets or the policy's extent over only parts of the world, the likelihood of price measures to be more advantageous in terms of minimizing uncertainty related welfare losses increases. The increase of the relative advantage of the price mechanisms over quantity measures {{may be more than}} proportional to the regional limitedness of the policy, suggesting that even for relatively important climate coalitions the identified factor implies a clear advantage for price measures. This analysis of the prices vs. quantities question is closer to so far on a high political level seriously discussed climate policies, not to speak of already implemented local or regional climate policies, than previous theoretical literature addressing the issue, which typically relied on the assumption of first bests (i. e. global) policies. Illustrating the main thought of the analysis, I explain why in the example of policies with an extent corresponding to the current <b>Kyoto</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the simple theoretical weighting of the price vs. the quantity approach seems to favor price mechanisms independently of the exact form of the global abatement cost and benefit curves. prices versus quantities, greenhouse gas tax, emission quotas, tradable permits, uncertainty, emission abatement costs, climate change costs, emission abatement benefits, regional climate policy, unilateral climate policy. ...|$|E
40|$|To-date, forest resource-based carbon {{accounting}} in {{land use}}, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Kyoto Protocol (KP), European Union (EU) and national level emission reduction schemes considers {{only a fraction}} of its potential and fails to adequately mobilize the LULUCF sector for the successful stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Recent modifications at the 2011 COP 17 meetings in Durban have partially addressed this basic problem, but leave room for improvement. The presence of an Incentive Gap (IG) continues to justify reform of the LULUCF carbon accounting framework. Frequently neglected in the climate change mitigation and adaptation literature, carbon accounting practices ultimately define {{the nuts and bolts of}} what counts and which resources (forest, forest-based or other) are favored and utilized. For Annex I countries in the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> the Incentive Gap under forest management (FM) is significantly large: some 75 % or more of potential forestry-based carbon sequestration is not effectively incentivized or mobilized for climate change mitigation and adaptation (Ellison etal. 2011 a). In this paper, we expand our analysis of the Incentive Gap to incorporate the changes agreed in Durban and encompass both a wider set of countries and a larger set of omitted carbon pools. For Annex I countries, based on the first 2 years of experience in the first Commitment Period (CP 1) we estimate the IG in FM at approximately 88 %. Though significantly reduced in CP 2, the IG remains a problem. Thus our measure of missed opportunities under the Kyoto and UNFCCC framework - despite the changes in Durban - remains important.
