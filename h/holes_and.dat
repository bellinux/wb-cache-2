5|$|Hunting {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative hunting technique {{is similar to that of}} the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and <b>holes,</b> <b>and</b> the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E
40|$|A phenomenological {{theory of}} double {{injection}} into an insulator with traps is derived under the injected plasma approximation. Four probable trap configurations are considered: discrete <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> electron traps, discrete <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> exponential electron traps, exponential <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> discrete electron traps, <b>and</b> exponential <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> electron traps. The traps {{are assumed to}} act as recombination centres. The large range of possible j-V relations which emerges from these models is delineated. By allowing the recombination radiation to cause photodetrapping the scaling law (j/d) = f(V/d 2) can be violated, explaining a common feature of experimental work on anthracene. An exact calculation is used to confirm the theory for a simple case...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} two smaller {{harbours}} south of Paddy's Hole named Guy's <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> Powder <b>Hole</b> (or Sand Hole).Between Guy's <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> Powder <b>Hole</b> is {{the remains of}} the Powder Jetty (or Powder Wharf) dating from the First World War or earlier.|$|R

5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st {{millennium}} BC, typical ancient Chinese writing {{materials were}} bronzewares, animal bones, and bamboo slips or wooden boards. By {{the beginning of}} the Han dynasty, the chief writing materials were clay tablets, silk cloth, and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string; these were passed through drilled <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> secured with clay stamps.|$|E
5|$|Some {{other studies}} have {{proposed}} that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the epidural space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein.|$|E
40|$|Dc {{photoconductivity}} {{characteristics of}} HgI 2 single crystals have been {{measured in the}} range of 1. 75 - 2. 75 eV, using CuI as a transparent electrical contact. <b>Hole</b> <b>and</b> electron photocurrents could be separately measured by applying different voltage polarities to the illuminated electrode. It is shown that charge carrier generation near the surface is highly extrinsic, as displayed by differences in the <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> electron photogeneration spectra. Analysis of the photoconductivity versus voltage characteristics indicates that the <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> electron bulk trapping times satisfy greater than 70 and 3 microsec, respectively. The <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> electron surface recombination velocities were 1. 0 x 10 to the 4 th cm/s and 8 x 10 to the 5 th cm/s, respectively...|$|R
60|$|Henry and Jonas both looked, {{and they}} saw a poor, forlorn-looking bee {{cautiously}} putting forth {{his head at the}} <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> then slowly crawling out. He came on until he was fairly out of the <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> then, extending his wings, rose and flew away through the air.|$|R
5000|$|Cap jewels {{are always}} paired with <b>hole</b> jewels, <b>and</b> always with a conically shaped pivot. The cap jewels are so called because they [...] "cap" [...] the <b>hole</b> jewels <b>and</b> control the axial {{movement}} of the arbor, preventing {{the shoulder of the}} pivot contacting the hole jewel. For a properly designed <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> cap jewel system, the arbor pivot bears on the cap jewel as a pin point on a thin film of oil. Thus, a <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> cap jewel offer lower friction and better performance across different positions compared with simply a hole jewel.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} three {{swimming}} holes, known collectively as the Powder Hole, on Big Wapwallopen Creek. As of 2001, these {{have the highest}} injury and death rate of any swimming hole in the area. Between 1986 and 2001, at least three people died at the swimming <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> three others were severely injured.|$|E
5|$|These are of {{particular}} interest {{because they are the}} first black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar-mass black hole and the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies. The mass of these intermediate mass black holes is proportional to the mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> their surrounding galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around manhole covers or through <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E

5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{a number}} of {{land-based}} gravitational wave detectors are in operation, and a mission to launch a space-based detector, LISA, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) which was launched in 2015. Gravitational wave observations {{can be used to}} obtain information about compact objects such as neutron stars and black <b>holes,</b> <b>and</b> also to probe the state of the early universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely built with concrete while the supports on the section between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly built with steel. Unlike the concrete supports, the steel supports flexed throughout the year, creating <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> {{gaps in the}} pavement on the deck above. The city of Rochester, which owns and maintains the section of NY31 within the city, closed the outer northbound lane of West Broad Street (westbound NY31) between Brown and Main Streets in June 2008 for this reason.|$|E

Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of the <b>holes,</b> <b>and</b> nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
