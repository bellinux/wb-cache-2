50|$|<b>Endomysium</b> {{combines}} with perimysium and epimysium {{to create}} the collagen fibers of tendons, providing the tissue connection between muscles and bones by indirect attachment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>endomysium,</b> meaning {{within the}} muscle, is a wispy layer of areolar {{connective}} tissue that ensheaths each individual myocyte (muscle fiber, or muscle cell). It also contains capillaries and nerves. It overlies the muscle fiber's cell membrane: the sarcolemma. <b>Endomysium</b> is the deepest and smallest component of muscle connective tissue. This thin layer helps provide an appropriate chemical {{environment for the}} exchange of calcium, sodium, and potassium, which {{is essential for the}} excitation and subsequent contraction of a muscle fiber.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>endomysium</b> is a {{layer of}} {{connective}} tissue that ensheaths a muscle fiber. The <b>endomysium</b> contains a form of transglutaminase called [...] "tissue transglutaminase" [...] or [...] "tTG" [...] for short, and antibodies that bind to this form of transglutaminase are called endomysial autoantibodies (EmA). The antiendomysial antibody test is a histological assay for patient serum binding to esophageal tissue from primate. EmA are present in celiac disease. They do not cause any direct symptoms to muscles, but detection of EmA is useful in the diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Connective {{tissue is}} present in all muscles as fascia. Enclosing each muscle is a layer of {{connective}} tissue known as the epimysium; enclosing each fascicle is a layer called the perimysium, and enclosing each muscle fiber is a layer of connective tissue called the <b>endomysium.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Polymyositis (PM) {{is a type}} {{of chronic}} {{inflammation}} of the muscles (inflammatory myopathy) related to dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis. Its name means [...] "inflammation of many muscles" [...] ( [...] + [...] + [...] ). The inflammation is predominantly of the <b>endomysium</b> in polymyositis, whereas dermatomyositis is characterized by primarily perimysial inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Type I {{collagen}} is {{the most}} abundant collagen {{of the human body}} which forms large, eosinophilic fibers known as collagen fibers. It is present in scar tissue, the end product when tissue heals by repair, as well as tendons, ligaments, the <b>endomysium</b> of myofibrils, the organic part of bone, the dermis, the dentin and organ capsules.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{three other}} {{antibodies}} were measured: anti-reticulin (ARA), anti-gliadin (AGA) and anti-endomysial (EMA) antibodies. ARA testing, however, is not accurate enough for routine diagnostic use. Serology may be unreliable in young children, with anti-gliadin performing somewhat {{better than other}} tests in children under five. Serology tests are based on indirect immunofluorescence (reticulin, gliadin and <b>endomysium)</b> or ELISA (gliadin or tissue transglutaminase, tTG).|$|E
50|$|Myoblasts in {{skeletal}} muscle {{that do not}} form muscle fibers dedifferentiate back into myosatellite cells. These satellite cells remain adjacent to a {{skeletal muscle}} fiber, situated between the sarcolemma and the basement membrane of the <b>endomysium</b> (the connective tissue investment that divides the muscle fascicles into individual fibers). To re-activate myogenesis, the satellite cells must be stimulated to differentiate into new fibers.|$|E
5000|$|Epimysium (plural epimysia) (Greek epi- for on, upon, {{or above}} + Greek mys for muscle) The epimysium is the fibrous tissue {{envelope}} that surrounds skeletal muscle. [...] It is {{a layer of}} dense irregular connective tissue which ensheathes the entire muscle and protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. [...] It is continuous with fascia and other connective tissue wrappings of muscle including the <b>endomysium</b> and perimysium. It is also continuous with tendons, where it becomes thicker and collagenous.|$|E
50|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system, the myelin sheath of each axon in a nerve is {{wrapped in a}} delicate protective sheath known as the endoneurium. Within the nerve, axons targeting the same anatomical location are bundled together into groups known as fascicles, each surrounded by another protective sheath known as the perineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood supply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. This grouping structure {{is analogous to the}} muscular organization system of epimysium, perimysium and <b>endomysium.</b>|$|E
50|$|This fibrous {{connective}} tissue interpenetrates and surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels of the body. It provides connection and communication {{in the form of}} aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone (periosteum and endosteum); cartilage (perichondrium), and blood vessels (tunica externa) and become specialized in muscles (epimysium, perimysium, and <b>endomysium)</b> and nerves (epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium). The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have.|$|E
50|$|Each muscle fiber {{contains}} myofibrils, {{which are}} very long chains of sarcomeres, the contractile units of the cell. A cell from the biceps brachii muscle may contain 100,000 sarcomeres. The myofibrils of smooth muscle cells are not arranged into sarcomeres. The sarcomeres are composed of thin and thick filaments. Thin filaments are made of actin and attach at Z lines which help them line up correctly with each other. Troponins are found at intervals along the thin filaments. Thick filaments are made of the elongated protein myosin. The sarcomere does not contain organelles or a nucleus. Sarcomeres are marked by Z lines which show {{the beginning and the}} end of a sarcomere. Individual myocytes are surrounded by <b>endomysium.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{disruption}} of muscle fibers triggers {{white blood cells}} to increase following induced muscle soreness, leading to the inflammatory response observation from induced muscle soreness. Elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded {{to be associated with}} inflammatory response. High tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and plasmalemma and its epimysium, perimysium, and/or <b>endomysium.</b> The mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in injured fibers and fiber bundles, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise. The products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines, kinins, and K+) accumulate outside cells. These substances then stimulate free nerve endings in the muscle; a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise, in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle [...]|$|E
5000|$|Collagen [...] is {{the main}} {{structural}} protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues in animal bodies. As {{the main component of}} connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. Depending upon the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be rigid (bone), compliant (tendon), or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. It is also abundant in corneas, cartilage, bones, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the <b>endomysium.</b> Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous muscles. The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen.|$|E
50|$|Dystrophin is {{a protein}} located between the {{sarcolemma}} and the outermost layer of myofilaments in the muscle fiber (myofiber). It is a cohesive protein, linking actin filaments to another support protein that resides {{on the inside}} surface of each muscle fiber’s plasma membrane (sarcolemma). This support protein on the inside surface of the sarcolemma in turn links to two other consecutive proteins {{for a total of}} three linking proteins. The final linking protein is attached to the fibrous <b>endomysium</b> of the entire muscle fiber. Dystrophin supports muscle fiber strength, and the absence of dystrophin reduces muscle stiffness, increases sarcolemmal deformability, and compromises the mechanical stability of costameres and their connections to nearby myofibrils; as shown in recent studies where biomechanical properties of the sarcolemma and its links through costameres to the contractile apparatus were measured, and helps to prevent muscle fiber injury. Movement of thin filaments (actin) creates a pulling force on the extracellular connective tissue that eventually becomes the tendon of the muscle.|$|E
50|$|The three-element Hill muscle {{model is}} a {{representation}} of the muscle mechanical response. The model is constituted by a contractile element (CE) and two non-linear spring elements, one in series (SE) and another in parallel (PE). The active force of the contractile element comes from the force generated by the actin and myosin cross-bridges at the sarcomere level. It is fully extensible when inactive but capable of shortening when activated. The connective tissues (fascia, epimysium, perimysium and <b>endomysium)</b> that surround the contractile element influences the muscle's force-length curve. The parallel element represents the passive force of these connective tissues and has a soft tissue mechanical behavior. The parallel element is responsible for the muscle passive behavior when it is stretched, even when the contractile element is not activated. The series element represents the tendon and the intrinsic elasticity of the myofilaments. It also has a soft tissue response and provides energy storing mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Skeletal {{muscles are}} {{sheathed}} by a tough layer of connective tissue called the epimysium. The epimysium anchors muscle tissue to tendons at each end, where the epimysium becomes thicker and collagenous. It also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. Within the epimysium are multiple bundles called fascicles, {{each of which}} contains 10 to 100 or more muscle fibers collectively sheathed by a perimysium. Besides surrounding each fascicle, the perimysium is a pathway for nerves and {{the flow of blood}} within the muscle. The threadlike muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes), and each cell is encased within its own <b>endomysium</b> of collagen fibers. Thus, the overall muscle consists of fibers (cells) that are bundled into fascicles, which are themselves grouped together to form muscles. At each level of bundling, a collagenous membrane surrounds the bundle, and these membranes support muscle function both by resisting passive stretching of the tissue and by distributing forces applied to the muscle. Scattered throughout the muscles are muscle spindles that provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. (This grouping structure is analogous to the organization of nerves which uses epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium).|$|E
5000|$|Congenital contractural {{arachnodactyly}} (CA) is a non-lethal {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder in cattle. [...] An autosomal recessive defect {{is a disease}} caused {{by the presence of}} two recessive mutant genes on an autosome. CA is classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue, specifically a disorder of the <b>endomysium</b> and perimysium. The defect in the muscle connective tissue results in a reduced range of elastic extension. CA is also known as 'Fawn calf syndrome'. CA is predominately associated with Angus cattle, however it has also been detected in other Angus associated breeds such as Murray Greys. CA was first identified in Victoria, Australia in 1998. However, it has now been discovered in many other countries. CA calves are almost always born alive, most being able to walk and suckle on their mother's teat leading to their survival in the early stages, although around 20% of CA calves die soon after birth. Differences in phenotypes are not normally noticeable and the weight of new born CA calves are seen to be normal, this means that CA is not always recognised. [...] CA is caused by a specific error in the DNA. This means it can be passed on from parents to offspring. Any cattle known to carry any category one genetic condition such as CA cannot be registered with cattle societies. The carriers of category 1 defects are all identifiable in the Australian Angus database. CA calves that survive are exposed to joint dislocation and early onset of arthritis. This is a result of their flexible joint laxity. Although CA is not as severe as other genetic diseases in cattle such as Mannosidosis (MA), Arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), CA is nonetheless a cause of calf deaths in herds where prevalence of the CA mutation in the herd is high and carrier sires are still being used. Diagnosis of CA can be made with a physical examination of new born calves. This should be done in the first 24 hours after birth, preferably done by a veterinarian or experienced breeder. Despite the variations between severe and non-severe cases, CA is easily diagnosed in a live new born calf. Both males and females can be affected. The following symptoms are observed: congenital proximal limb contracture, congenital distal limb hyperextension, congenital kyphosis and significant postnatal improvement in these clinical signs as the calf grows and matures. CA is not a difficult diagnosis however it requires careful physical examination of the calf followed by constant observation for improvement. Additional signs are present in the calves CA causes but can be more difficult to identify especially in mild cases. These include abnormal long leg bones resulting in a tall stature, loose jointedness, poor muscling and knee knocking [...] To prevent cattle being affected by CA, sires should be pedigree analysed to minimise the chance of the mutation. If CA is identified in a herd, other bloodlines which have tested negative for CA should be purchased. Some predominant Angus sires identified with CA are Rambo 465T of JRS, Te Mania Kelp K207, Bon View Bando 598, SAF 598 Bando 5175 and Boyd On Target 1083.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of IgA class reticulin and <b>endomysium</b> antibodies was examined {{with the standard}} immunofluorescence method in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. Similar high antibody frequencies were detected in 32 untreated adults (91 %) and 18 children (100 %) with coeliac disease and in 14 dermatitis herpetiformis patients with subtotal villous atrophy (reticulin antibodies 93 % and <b>endomysium</b> antibodies 100 %). The specificity of IgA class reticulin antibodies and <b>endomysium</b> antibodies was high because all 45 adult patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 24 non-coeliac children with abdominal symptoms and 99 / 100 healthy blood donors were negative for these antibodies. The only positive blood donor had both IgA class reticulin antibodies and <b>endomysium</b> antibodies but also she {{was found to have}} coeliac disease. IgA class reticulin antibodies and <b>endomysium</b> antibodies declined in parallel during treatment with a gluten free diet and increased on gluten challenge. This suggests that these antibodies can be used to screen for gluten sensitive enteropathy and to monitor dietary treatment. To characterise the tissue specificity of reticulin antibodies and <b>endomysium</b> antibodies four positive sera were absorbed with human and several rodent liver homogenates. Absorption with rat or other rodent livers removed the rodent-specific reticulin antibodies but not the reticulin antibodies detectable with human tissues or the <b>endomysium</b> antibodies detectable with monkey oesophagus. These results show that reticulin antibodies can be divided into the rat and human subtypes. The human subtype could not be separated from <b>endomysium</b> antibodies in the present absorption experiments...|$|E
40|$|The ultrastructural binding {{sites of}} <b>endomysium</b> antibodies, {{specific}} serological markers of gluten sensitive enteropathy, were investigated in the rabbit oesophagus using the immunogold technique. <b>Endomysium</b> antibodies from sera {{of patients with}} dermatitis herpetiformis and with coeliac disease bound in an identical manner in a non-fibrillar material closely associated with fine collagenous-reticulin fibrils and also with similar fibrils connecting smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue in the endomysial connective tissue. These observations suggest that IgA antibodies in sera from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease recognise a common antigen in an amorphous component associated with the reticular connective tissue of oesophageal lamina muscularis mucosae and thus confirm the probable identity of IgA class <b>endomysium</b> and jejunal antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The ultra {{structural}} binding {{sites of}} <b>endomysium</b> antibodies {{have been studied}} on human umbilical cord tissue. The sensitivity and specificity of IgA <b>endomysium</b> antibodies were compared with recently described methods using basement membrane of smooth muscle of monkey oesophagus. Thirty adults affected by coeliac disease (10 in remission) and 75 healthy adult controls with normal intestinal mucosa (35 false antigliadin positive) were investigated. Sensitivity and correlation of <b>endomysium</b> antibodies with total villous atrophy in untreated coeliac disease patients were 100 % on the human umbilical cord smooth muscles, and only 90 % on the muscular layer of primate oesophagus. Indirect immunofluorescence was superior to peroxidase staining in detecting these IgA antibodies. The easy availability and enhanced testing sensitivity of the umbilical cord is an advance towards a better diagnostic tool for coeliac disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Because of the {{different}} sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests, the search for silent celiac disease is usually performed with the combined or sequential use of several tests. Among these, the IgA-class <b>endomysium</b> antibody test has the highest specificity and positive predictive value, but it may overlook IgA-deficient patients. Methods: To test a new one-step screening approach, serum samples from 427 apparently healthy, 3 - to 6 -year-old Hungarian children were investigated for IEA-class and IgG-class <b>endomysium</b> antibodies using monkey esophagus and human jejunum as substrates. Results: Five new cases with flat mucosa were identified by strong <b>endomysium</b> antibody positivity and subsequent jejunal biopsy, yielding a celiac disease prevalence of 1 : 85. An additional child may have latent celiac disease (slight histologic changes at present). Two of the screening-detected celiac patients exhibited only IgG-class <b>endomysium</b> antibodies due to associated IgA-deficiency. Despite the young age of the screened population, antigliadin antibodies were positive in {{only three of the}} five celiac patients. Conclusions: Prevalence of celiac disease in the study population was much higher than expected on the basis of antigliadin antibody-based studies. The screening system used detected celiac cases in which there was IgA-deficiency and those in which there was not and also those negative for antigliadin antibodies. The findings suggest the importance of the primary testing of autoantibodies in future celiac disease screening policies...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin A (IgA) {{deficiency}} is 10 to 15 {{times more}} common in patients with celiac disease (CD) than in healthy subjects. Serological tests have become the preferred methods of diagnosing CD in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, commercially available serological methods are limited in that they detect only the IgA isotype of antibodies (with the exception of IgG gliadin assays); hence, IgA-deficient patients with CD may yield false-negative serology. Fifteen pediatric patients with CD and 10 IgA-deficient pediatric patients without CD were examined for IgA and IgG antibodies to <b>endomysium,</b> gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase. Twenty-five specimens from patients with IgA deficiency were examined. Fifteen were from patients with CD, and 10 were patients without CD. All 15 IgA-deficient patients with CD were positive for <b>endomysium</b> antibodies of the IgG isotype and for IgG gliadin antibodies. All {{but one of the}} IgA-deficient patients with CD were also positive for IgG tissue transglutaminase antibodies. None of the IgA-deficient patients without CD were positive for any of the antibody markers. All the specimens examined were also negative for IgA-specific antibodies to <b>endomysium,</b> gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase. IgG-specific antibody tests for <b>endomysium,</b> gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase are useful for the identification of IgA-deficient patients with CD. IgG antibody tests along with tests routinely being used in clinical laboratories can reliably detect all active patients with CD. In addition, the levels of these CD-specific IgG antibodies could be used to monitor patient dietary compliance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that tenascin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, contributes to fibrotic changes in dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: The localisation of tenascin in biopsy specimens of the hearts obtained from eight patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was examined using staining by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. RESULTS: (1) Perimysium and <b>endomysium.</b> Although positive staining for tenascin was observed in the enlarged perimysium and <b>endomysium</b> in all patients, moderately intense staining was characteristically observed near the replacement fibrotic lesions. In the narrow perimysium and <b>endomysium</b> of the myocardium not containing replacement fibrotic lesions, tenascin was not present, as in the control specimens. (2) Replacement fibrotic lesions. Non-homogeneous positive staining for tenascin was detected in all replacement fibrotic lesions examined. Intense tenascin deposition was observed in the peripheral portion of the replacement fibrotic lesions. The tenascin staining observed in the small replacement fibrotic lesions was more intense than that in the large lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Tenascin contributes {{to the development of}} the fibrotic changes seen in the dilated cardiomyopathic heart. Its characteristic location, specifically the distribution along the margin of the fibrosis, suggests that fibrotic change is a continuous process in hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|E
40|$|Coeliac {{disease is}} a T-cell-mediated {{autoimmune}} disease of the small intestine that is induced by ingestion of gluten proteins from wheat, barley, or rye. We postulate that Candida albicans is a trigger in the onset of coeliac disease. The virulence factor of C albicans - hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP 1) - contains aminoacid sequences that are identical or highly homologous to known coeliac disease-related α-gliadin and γ-gliadin T-cell epitopes. HWP 1 is a transglutaminase substrate, and is used by C albicans {{to adhere to the}} intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, tissue transglutaminase and <b>endomysium</b> components could become covalently linked to the yeast. Subsequently, C albicans might function as an adjuvant that stimulates antibody formation against HWP 1 and gluten, and formation of autoreactive antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and <b>endomysium...</b>|$|E
30|$|For the {{transverse}} sections, {{gaps between}} muscle fibers and bundles were visible in all shrimp samples, regardless of pre-cooking time (Figure[*] 3 b). The gaps might occur due to some degradation of muscle and <b>endomysium</b> connective tissue (Sotelo et al. 2004). Among all pre-cooked samples with different pre-cooking times, the higher shrinkage of muscle fibers {{was found in}} shrimp pre-cooked for 120 s. Collagen, around the muscle fibers (<b>endomysium)</b> and around the muscle bundles (perimysium), was postulated to convert to gelatin to a higher extent when being pre-cooked for a longer time (Niamnuy et al. 2008). When the proteins underwent thermal denaturation, the water was less imbibed or bound in their structure (Benjakul et al. 2008). The release of water from protein molecules might facilitate the muscle fiber to align closely, leading to the more compact muscle fibers. Nip and Moy (1988) reported the microstructural changes of the boiled meat of prawn (Macrobranchium rosenbergii).|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} between celiac disease and primary biliary cirrhosis {{has been described}} in several case reports and small screening studies, with varying prevalence rates. Stored sera from 378 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) A <b>endomysium</b> and tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Ten patients were positive for both antibodies (2. 6 %); five of these patients had had small bowel biopsies confirming celiac disease. A further 44 patients (11. 6 %) had raised titres of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody but were negative for IgA <b>endomysium</b> antibody. The increased prevalence of celiac-related antibodies in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis suggests that the two conditions are associated, although {{the reason for the}} association remains unclear. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis should be considered to be at high risk for celiac disease. Although liver biochemistry does not improve when these patients are fed a gluten-free diet, the complications of untreated celiac disease warrant the identification and treatment of the condition in this population...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{staining}} of the {{connective tissue}} and image {{analysis showed that}} in the extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles of the rat {{there was an increase}} in the thickness of the <b>endomysium</b> in both early growth and senility.

The stiffness (length-passive tension) of these muscles was found to increase throughout life. Log transforms of the length-passive tension plots had particularly steep slopes in the senile extensor digitorum longus muscle. Except in the senile soleus muscle, the increase in stiffness was closely correlated with the increase in <b>endomysium</b> and perimysium and with total muscle collagen (as measured biochemically) with age. The relationship between the initial length and the active tension in the extensor digitorum longus muscle changed with age. The older muscles showed a greater decline in tension for each decrement of length resulting from the increased development of the connective tissue...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Serologic {{methods have}} been used widely to test for celiac disease and have gained {{importance}} in diagnostic definition and in new epidemiologic findings. However, there is no standardization, {{and there are no}} reference protocols and materials. METHODS: The European working group on Serological Screening for Celiac Disease has defined robust noncommercial test protocols for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA gliadin antibodies and for IgA autoantibodies against <b>endomysium</b> and tissue transglutaminase. Standard curves were linear in the decisive range, and intra-assay variation coefficients were less than 5 % to 10 %. Calibration was performed with a group reference serum. Joint cutoff limits were used. Seven laboratories took part in the final collaborative study on 252 randomized sera classified by histology (103 pediatric and adult patients with active celiac disease, 89 disease control subjects, and 60 blood donors). RESULTS: IgA autoantibodies against <b>endomysium</b> and tissue transglutaminase rendered superior sensitivity (90 % and 93 %, respectively) and specificity (99 % and 95 %, respectively) over IgA and IgG gliadin antibodies. Tissue transglutaminase antibody testing showed superior receiver operating characteristic performance compared with gliadin antibodies. The K values for interlaboratory reproducibility showed superiority for IgA <b>endomysium</b> (0. 93) in comparison with tissue transglutaminase antibodies (0. 83) and gliadin antibodies (0. 82 for IgG, 0. 62 for IgA). CONCLUSIONS: Basic criteria of standardization and quality assessment must be fulfilled by any given test protocol proposed for serologic investigation of celiac disease. The working group has produced robust test protocols and reference materials available for standardization to further improve reliability of serologic testing for celiac disease.
