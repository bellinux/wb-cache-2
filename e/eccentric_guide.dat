6000|$|In 1865 the Prince and Princess of Wales descended this shaft, and Captain Jan {{was their}} amiable, {{not to say}} <b>eccentric,</b> <b>guide.</b> The Captain was {{particularly}} enthusiastic in praise of the Princess. He {{said that she was}} a [...] "fine intelligent young lady; that she asked no end of questions, would not rest until she understood everything, and afterwards undertook to explain it all to her less-informed companions." [...] A somewhat amusing incident occurred while they were underground.|$|E

50|$|By {{adding a}} set of <b>eccentrics</b> and <b>guide</b> slots to the axle of the supercharger, the Powerplus {{actively}} controls the position of these vanes, such that they maintain a constant small clearance from {{the walls of the}} housing. This is enough spacing to avoid friction, but close enough to keep pumping efficient.|$|R
50|$|Pilch's second novel, Spis cudzołożnic ("List of Adulteresses", 1993), {{tells the}} story of a failed <b>eccentric</b> writer <b>guiding</b> a foreign guest on a tour of Kraków and through a curio {{collection}} of national myths and the absurd socialist realities of the 1980s. In 1995, actor Jerzy Stuhr made the novel into a film as his directing debut (under the international title List of Lovers).|$|R
50|$|Chiquititas is a 2007 Portuguese telenovela, {{produced}} by Teresa Guilherme Produções and {{a version of}} the Argentine series Chiquititas Sin Fin. Premiered on June 2007, the show starred actress Marta Fernandes as the iconic character of Lili, an <b>eccentric</b> woman who <b>guides</b> a group of orphans while they struggle in the Do Monte Orphanage, filling their lives with joy and hope, while in the search for her lost son. Actors Nuno Pardal, Carlos Vieira, Luís Gaspar and Patrícia Tavares also star.|$|R
5000|$|Serge {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} {{with a variety of}} mental illnesses, and has been prescribed a [...] "cocktail" [...] of drugs to keep him stable. These are effective, but he often refuses to take them, since he dislikes their effects. Free from the drugs' influence, he quickly becomes manic and obsessive about trivial things; he frequently acts as an extremely <b>eccentric</b> tour <b>guide</b> for whoever happens to be handy. Despite his psychological disorders, Serge is for the most part a charismatic, likeable person (he {{can be viewed as a}} somewhat more liberal version of Joseph Heller's Yossarian). When an event or person offends his extremely strong (and subjective) sense of justice, however, he can quickly fly into a homicidal rage; he has committed a string of murders for which the police pursue him as a serial killer. Serge acts as an independent vigilante who dispenses rough, creative and immediate death penalties for low-life criminals, somewhat in the style of Death Wish (1974 film) (and its sequels) starring Charles Bronson.|$|R
50|$|Newhart is an American sitcom that {{aired on}} CBS from October 25, 1982 to May 21, 1990, {{with a total}} of 184 half-hour episodes {{spanning}} over eight seasons. The series stars Bob Newhart and Mary Frann as an author and wife who own and operate an inn located in a small, rural Vermont town that is home to many <b>eccentric</b> characters. TV <b>Guide,</b> TV Land, and A&E named the Newhart series finale {{as one of the most}} memorable in television history. Newhart was recorded on videotape for Season 1, with the remaining seasons shot on film. The theme music for Newhart was composed by Henry Mancini.|$|R
25|$|The broad {{narrative}} {{follows the}} misadventures {{of the last}} surviving man, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet {{to make way for}} a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford Prefect, a human-like alien writer for the <b>eccentric,</b> electronic travel <b>guide</b> The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by hitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters Trillian, another human that had been taken from Earth prior to its destruction by the President of the Galaxy, the two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the depressed Marvin, the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details were changed between the various adaptations.|$|R
25|$|The {{fourth and}} final season begins five months after Marissa's death in the car accident. Ryan starts the season in {{isolation}} as a broken, grieving man, seeking revenge on Volchok. With the help of Julie, both she and Ryan are able to track Volchok down in Mexico, and turn him into federal officials. The continued love of the Cohen family and {{the company of the}} <b>eccentric</b> Taylor Townsend <b>guide</b> him back to the light. Meanwhile, Seth and Summer face the problems of a long distance relationship as Summer leaves to attend college. The first half of the season focuses on the characters accepting the reality of Marissa's death. The second half focuses on the characters 'finding themselves' while facing a myriad of identity crises. This final season contains multiple surprises, such as a new addition to the Cohen family, a visit to an alternate universe in which Sandy becomes mayor, and a natural disaster that leaves Newport devastated.|$|R
5000|$|At the college, Polly and Derek, the <b>eccentric</b> campus tour <b>guides,</b> lead Tony and {{the other}} {{students}} around the school. Tony is late to the group session, where the lecturer, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the scarred man, is critical of Tony. Tony finds the girl from the club sitting three chairs away from him, who accuses the lecturer of trying to sleep with the college students. The girl leaves, followed by Tony. They walk around campus and the girl pushes him into the pool, despite his protests. She tells him to just float, which alleviates his fears. Later, Tony is found alone in the pool by Polly and Derek, who advise him not to follow the girl. Tony encounters the girl again on the tour, where she leads him into a lab full of fragile equipment and instructs him to walk across the room in the dark. Tony breaks the equipment, setting off an alarm, and the girl helps Tony run away by leading him to a dorm.|$|R
6000|$|The {{question}} of professions, in {{as far as}} they regard marriage, was only interesting to women until of late days, but it touches all of us now. Certainly, if I could help it, I would never marry a wife who wrote. The practice of letters is miserably harassing to the mind; and after an hour or two's work, all the more human portion of the author is extinct; he will bully, backbite, and speak daggers. Music, I hear, is not much better. But painting, on the contrary, is often highly sedative; because so much of the labour, after your picture is once begun, is almost entirely manual, and of that skilled sort of manual labour which offers a continual series of successes, and so tickles a man, through his vanity, into good humour. Alas! in letters there is nothing of this sort. You may write as beautiful a hand as you will, you have always something else to think of, and cannot pause to notice your loops and flourishes; they are beside the mark, and the first law stationer could put you to the blush. Rousseau, indeed, made some account of penmanship, even made it a source of livelihood, when he copied out the [...] "Héloïse" [...] for dilettante ladies; and therein showed that strange <b>eccentric</b> prudence which <b>guided</b> him among so many thousand follies and insanities. It would be well for all of the genus irritabile thus to add something of skilled labour to intangible brain-work. To find the right word is so doubtful a success and lies so near to failure, that there is no satisfaction in a year of it; but we all know when we have formed a letter perfectly; and a stupid artist, right or wrong, is almost equally certain he has found a right tone or a right colour, or made a dexterous stroke with his brush. And, again, painters may work out of doors; and the fresh air, the deliberate seasons, and the [...] "tranquillising influence" [...] of the green earth, counterbalance the fever of thought, and keep them cool, placable, and prosaic.|$|R
