Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E

25|$|Old Norse had {{a stress}} accent which {{fell on the}} first syllable.

Another recently advanced theory is that each Proto-Norse long syllable and every other short syllable received stress, marked by pitch, eventually leading {{to the development of}} the Swedish and Norwegian tonal accent distinction.

He immediately became controversial, no-balling Muralitharan seven times, and continuing to do so even when he switched to bowling legbreaks, which are regarded as being impossible to throw. This led to Muralitharan being dropped by Sri Lanka {{for the rest of}} the tour, as he was unable to bowl without being called. Emerson continued to officiate in ODIs for the next three years, standing in nine more games, all in Australia, but it was his last game which overshadowed <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>first.</b>|$|E

Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, the motif was already common. Coca-Cola was not <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: White Rock Beverages used Santa in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923, after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915. Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages. Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress Hilda Clark as its spokeswoman.|$|E
25|$|The scene {{gradually}} became increasingly {{common in the}} art of the Western church, and increasingly rare in Orthodox art. Various themes in theological exegesis of the event influenced the treatment in art. As the first drawing of Christ's blood, it was also seen as a forerunner of, or <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> scene of, the Passion of Christ, {{and was one of the}} Seven Sorrows of Mary. Other interpretations developed based on it as the naming ceremony equivalent to Christian baptism, the aspect which was eventually to become most prominent in Catholic thinking. Both in this respect and in terms of finding a place in a pictorial cycle, consideration of the circumcision put it in a kind of competition with the much better established Presentation of Jesus; eventually the two scenes were to be conflated in some paintings.|$|E
25|$|The Hewlett Packard HP 9830 {{was one of}} {{the first}} desktop {{computers}} in the early 1970s to use automatically controlled cassette tapes for storage.

Many of the earliest microcomputers implemented the Kansas City standard for digital data storage.

The five-day match started on 17 February 1982 at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium. Warnapura and English captain Keith Fletcher made the toss in the morning, which was won by Warnapura. He elected to bat first, and opened the batting for Sri Lanka with Sidath Wettimuny. He faced the first delivery of the match, and scored the first Test run for his country. According to a local newspaper, he was <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Sri Lankan batsman to get hit on the chest. However, he was dismissed for only 2 runs, when he was caught by David Gower off the bowling of Bob Willis. The first player to bat in a Test match for Sri Lanka had faced 25 deliveries during the 35 minutes he batted. During the Sri Lankan second innings, Warnapura made 38 runs off 155 deliveries – the second highest score in that innings. England won the match, and Warnapura's 38 would remain as his highest Test individual score.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} short: {{in the morning}} of the same day the Byzantines {{attacked}} and the squad of Aplakes engaged the Bulgarians first. It managed to inflict some casualties to the Bulgarians but from the very beginning most of the Byzantines were so frightened that they did not even engage their enemy. The Byzantines could not withstand <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Bulgarian counter-attack and when Khan Krum advanced with the Bulgarian heavy cavalry against the left flank of Byzantines they immediately ran away. The Anatolian squad was the first to flee followed by the entire army. The soldiers of Aplakes were left behind and most of them perished, including their commander. The battle took place in a valley and when the Bulgarians saw the retreating enemy which was in the higher positions they at first suspected a trap. In fact they also did not expect to achieve success so quickly and at first did not chase them. But when the Bulgarians were certain that the enemy was fleeing in panic, their heavy cavalry rushed after the Byzantines. Many of them perished during the flight, others hid in different fortresses which were taken by the Bulgarians one by one and the rest managed to reach Constantinople. The chief commanders of Byzantine army, including the Emperor Michael I Rangabe and Leo the Armenian, were the first to abandon the battlefield. The Bulgarians took the Byzantine camp and a rich prize including gold and weaponry.|$|E
25|$|New York City FC {{made their}} {{first trip to}} RFK Stadium, and the debutante side {{proved to be the}} tonic that D.C. United needed to break their spirit-crushing winless streak, which had begun at NYCFC's home field seven games earlier. When the game began, it seemed that United's losing ways were destined to continue. At the 45-second mark, Frank Lampard {{followed}} up the rebound of a David Villa shot, and gave the visitors a very early 1-0 lead. It was not <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time this season that United had fallen behind in the first minute, but that knowledge was probably little comfort. Over the next 70 minutes, both teams squandered chances, but D.C. finally broke through when Espindola scored off of a rebound that came when NYCFC goalie Josh Saunders made a diving stop on a long-range strike by Chris Pontius. In stoppage time, Pontius was dragged down making a long run, setting up a free kick for the home team. Espindola's service found its way to substitute Saborio, after a misplay by a NYCFC defender. Saborio delivered with a memorable game-winner for D.C. The 2-1 victory, D.C. United's first ever win over NYCFC, not only ended almost two months of frustration for the team, it also clinched a playoff spot for the team. This would be the first time since 2006 and 2007 that United would qualify for the playoffs in each of two consecutive seasons.|$|E
