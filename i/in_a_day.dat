5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> or two.|$|E

5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{ridership}} {{increased by}} 10 percent and by 12 percent the following year. In 1971 and 1972, it saw a 20-percent increase—the latter representing {{the first year}} with InterRail tickets. By then the annual ridership had reached 175,000. In 1970, an additional train was stationed at Flåm, which {{made it possible to}} travel a round trip between Flåm and Bergen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Between 1975 and 1982, NSB started running direct trains between Ål and Flåm. In 1978, the morning express trains on the Bergen Line started stopping at Myrdal, allowing better access for tourists to the Flåm Line. Traffic increased further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and then remained stable through the decade.|$|E
5|$|M-71 {{starts in}} {{downtown}} Owosso {{at the corner}} of Main Street (M-21) and Water Street. It follows Water Street southeasterly until it reaches Washington Street. The highway follows Washington Street south and over the Shiawassee River and turns southeasterly on Corunna Avenue. M-71 runs parallel to, and in between, the river and a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Corunna Avenue continues this way through the community of Middletown and into Corunna. M-71 turns south through downtown Corunna on Shiawassee Street to McNeil Street. It is along this stretch of the highway that the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measured the highest traffic volumes for M-71. In their 2009 survey, MDOT calculated that 10,577vehicles used this section of roadway in a measurement called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value is a count for the average traffic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for any average day of the year.|$|E

5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate {{for a period of time}} before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> in stereophonic sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place.

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} {{are found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide.

In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs.

5|$|The Sprouses began acting {{at the age}} {{of eight}} months {{following}} a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. The twins first appeared in a commercial for diapers, switching on-screen time every few seconds. As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed.
