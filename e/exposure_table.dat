40|$|The northern, James Ross Island {{region of}} the Larsen Basin, on the eastern, back-arc margin of the Antarctic Peninsula magmatic arc, {{includes}} one of the thickest and most complete Upper Cretaceous sedimentary successions exposed in the Southern Hemisphere. However, {{the southern part of}} the basin remains poorly known, mainly owing to inaccessibility and lack of <b>exposure.</b> <b>Table</b> Nunatak, an isolated, 1 -km-long, 400 -m-wide outcrop at the tip of Kenyon Peninsula, is the only known exposure of Upper Cretaceous or younger strata in this region. The 62 -m-thick succession exposed there is assigned to the newly defined Table Nunatak Formation. It consists mainly of sharp-based, amalgamated beds of fine-grained sandstone up to 2. 8 m thick, with subordinate intervals of intensely bioturbated mudstone. Wave ripples are present at some levels, and locally developed swaley cross-stratification provides evidence for storm-generated combined-flow deposition. However, most sandstone beds appear to be internally structureless apart from normal grading, and are interpreted as the direct suspension deposits of highly sediment-charged storm- and/or flood-related flows. The succession represents relatively nearshore deposition, probably at the mouth of a river or deltaic distributary channel. Charcoalified plant debris, abundant at the tops of some sandstone beds, suggests a periodically wildfire-swept hinterland forested largely by coniferous trees. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages indicate a late Santonian age, and suggest correlation with the basal part of the Lachman Crags Member of the Santa Marta Formation (Marambio Group) on James Ross Island. Palaeocurrents, sandstone petrography and the high sediment supply rate proposed for the Table Nunatak Formation, suggest a relatively high-relief source area to the west, with large-scale erosion of granitoid plutons and metamorphic rocks, possibly related to arc uplift during a mid-Cretaceous compressional episode. The formation is evidence of a major southward extension of the Upper Cretaceous strata exposed in the northern Larsen Basin, and suggests lateral continuity of shallow-marine deposition for at least 500 – 600 km along the Weddell Sea margin of the Antarctic Peninsula in Santonian times...|$|E

40|$|The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) {{determines the}} policy {{regarding}} radiation safety internationally. To the ICRP, hereditary changes {{as a result}} of either high or low doses, are of a major concern. The SA Forum for Radiation Protection recommended that a research project to determine the genetically-significant dose (GSD) for the South African population should be done as such a project has never been undertaken to date. This term was at first defined by UNSCEAR in 1958. The National Radiological Protection Board derived a formula from this definition as shown in the NRPB Report, NRPB-R 106 (1980). This formula was implemented in the project. It combines the frequency of radiological examinations obtained during the country-wide survey and estimates of gonadal doses for different examination types, together with population and child expectancy data. New procedures, techniques and data processing that were relevant to this project had to be developed because the available information and conditions are unique to South Africa. The task was set to find a model in order to draw the best representative sample of the population and it was determined in a unique way, namely the so-called Dollar Unit Sampling method. A sample of 27 institutions out of a possible 292 (9 %) was drawn in comparison, e. g., with the 8 % of France and 8 % in Great Britain. It was necessary to rely mainly on the calculation of gonad doses due to a shortage of manpower, contrary to other countries that were able to physically measure doses. Information obtained in the survey was used in this regard. The "RADCOMP Entrance Skin Exposure Software Program " of Nuclear Associates was used to produce parametric Free Air <b>Exposure</b> <b>tables</b> based on doses from Table B. 3, NCRP Report No. 102.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study {{conducted}} by Maree (1995) indicated that the genetically-significant dose (GSD) for the white, female population in South Africa was considerably higher than the GSD for females in Great Britain, France and the United States of America. Further to this finding, Maree's study demonstrated that the barium enema x-ray examination was the major contributor to the GSD for this population group. A study of barium enema examinations was embarked on in order to explain the findings of Maree. The study was designed to include dose-area product measurements on patients having the barium enema procedure. In addition patient data and technique factors were recorded. The x-ray equipment used for the investigation was one digital and two non-digital fluoroscopic systems in the Western Cape. The digital unit utilised an overhead tube as did one of the conventional units. The other unit had an undercouch fluoroscopic tube and an overhead tube used for the standard radiography views. Comparison of the dose-area product measurements demonstrated that the unit having an undercouch tube had a mean dose-area product of 99. 69 Gy cm² which culminates in a higher dose to the patient than the equipment utilising an overhead tube. The mean dose-area product of the two units with an overhead tube was 56. 57 Gy cm² and 51. 94 Gy cm² respectively. Free Air <b>Exposure</b> <b>tables</b> based on "RADCOMP Entrance Skin Exposure Software Program" (Nuclear Associates and Zamenhof, 1990) were used together with average technique factors to calculate skin entrance doses. These skin entrance doses were used to calculate gonad doses {{with the aid of a}} computer program from the Food and Drug Administration in the USA (Peterson and Rosenstein, 1989). The results were compared with the results of the barium enema component of the research conducted by Maree. The comparison indicated an average gonad dose for males of 242 μGy x 10 ⁻¹ (present study) compared to 485 μGy x 10 ⁻¹ (Maree) and an average gonad dose for females of 11185 μGy x 10 ⁻¹ (present study) compared to 16111 μGy x 10 ⁻¹ (Maree). Air-kerma at skin entrance was calculated using dose-area product measurements, recorded during the present study, for individual exposures and screening. These values were used to calculate the gonad dose. A discrepancy was demonstrated between the calculation of gonad dose from calculated as opposed measured skin entrance dose. The average gonad dose calculated by Maree is 16111 μGy x 10 ⁻¹ and the average gonad dose calculated for the present study using the measured skin entrance dose is 4236 μGy x 10 ⁻¹.

40|$|The {{results from}} the sound level measurements, the {{dosimeter}} recordings and the time-activity studies on four different air-rotary rigs indicate a wide variation of operator noise exposure during hole development.

Studies have documented that exposure to high sound levels {{for long periods of time}} can cause hearing loss. The results of this study help identify the loudest parts of the drilling cycle. Sound level measurements on the four rigs show that all the rigs generate sound levels that are 90 A-weighted decibels (dB(A)) and above within 6 feet around the rigs during drilling. It is easy to conclude that some type of noise protection, such as a cab, is needed to protect the operator from overexposure to noise for an eight-hour shift of uninterrupted drilling. However, even when rigs are outfitted with cabs, operators observed in this study are being exposed to sound levels above 90 dB(A) during some activities required to complete a drilling cycle.

Photometry in polarizers is presented for Type Ia Supernova 2012 bh during 20 days, starting on March 27, 2012. We find that the linear polarization of SN 2012 bh at the early stage of the envelope expansion was less than 3 %. Polarization measurements for the blazars OC 457, 3 C 454. 3, QSO B 1215 + 303, 87 GB 165943. 2 + 395846 at single nights are presented. We infer the degree of the linear polarization and polarization angle. The blazars OC 457 and 3 C 454. 3 were observed during their periods of activity. The results show that MASTER is able to measure substantially polarized light; {{at the same time it}} is not suitable for determining weak polarization (less than 5 %) of dim objects (fainter than 16 $^m$). Polarimetric observations of the optical emission from gamma-ray bursts and supernovae are necessary to investigate the nature of these transient objects.
