5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also {{spent a lot of time}} changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

60|$|So {{long as one}} had to {{consider}} the navigable balloon the aerial side of warfare remained unimportant. A Zeppelin is little good for any purpose but scouting and espionage. It can carry very little weight in proportion to its vast size, and, what is more important, it cannot drop things without sending itself up like a bubble in soda water. An armada of navigables sent against this island would end in a dispersed, deflated state, chiefly in the seas between Orkney and Norway--though I say it who should not. But these aeroplanes can fly all round the fastest navigable that ever drove before the wind; they can drop weights, take up weights, and do all sorts of able, inconvenient things. They are birds. As for the birds, so for aeroplanes; there is an upward limit of size. They <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very big, but they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>able</b> and active.

40|$|There is a {{significant}} international and feminist debate at present about prostitution and consent.

In the realm of work there is a general lack of freedom and choice for most workers, that is it is a realm of 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7 economic coercion.

However, there are some important reasons to reconsider this position. In particular, when sex workers get raped (by their clients, employers, pimps or others) it is important that their claims can be made visible in the criminal justice system.
