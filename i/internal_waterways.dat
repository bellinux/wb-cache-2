In 1893 Dresser joined Howley, Haviland and Company, a Tin Pan Alley music publisher based in New York City, as a silent partner. In 1896, after more than twenty years of traveling the country as a performer, Dresser grew tired of the theater and turned his attention to composing music and his music publishing business. By that time Dresser was a nationally-known talent who had traveled throughout the United States. While he occasionally returned to Terre Haute for performances and brief visits, Dresser's songs and letters to his friends often reminisced about Indiana and his childhood home.

40|$|Three U. S. {{companies}} are seeking authorization to build {{liquid natural gas}} (LNG) terminals in eastern Maine on Passamaquoddy Bay, across from New Brunswick, Canada. The three {{companies are}}: (1) Downeast LNG, which seeks to develop a terminal at Robbinston, Maine; (2) Quoddy Bay LLC, which seeks to develop an LNG terminal on Indian tribal land at Sipayik, Maine; and (3) North East Energy Development Company LLC, which seeks to develop a terminal on the Saint Croix River (a tributary to Passamaquoddy Bay) at Red Beach in Calais, Maine. To deliver the LNG {{to any one of}} these terminals, a 300 -meter-long tanker would travel {{at least once a week}} through Head Harbor Passage between the Canadian islands of Campobello and Deer Island, in Canadian waters, and then would return back through this same passage. If all three terminals were to open, an average of six LNG tanker passages would take place each week through Head Harbor Passage. Canada views Head Harbor Passage as an <b>internal</b> Canadian <b>waterway,</b> and in 1982 issued regulations limiting the amount of oil that can be transported through the passage. About 120 foreign-flag ships pass through Head Harbor Passage each year, usually to pick up paper pulp and other forest products destined for European ports. Some U. S. ships have used this passage in previous years, and, in the past few years, the United States has sent military vessels through Head Harbor Passage to Fourth of July celebrations in Eastport, Maine. The Canadian Government announced on February 14, 2007, that it would prohibit the “passage of LNG tankers through the environmentallysensitive and navigationally-challenging marine and coastal areas of the sovereign Canadian waters of Head Harbour Passage,” because such passage would “present risks to the region of southwest New Brunswick and its inhabitants that the Government of Canada cannot accept. ” Canada’s Ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson, expressed this opposition to LNG passage in a letter written to Joseph T. Kelliher, Chair of the U. S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This action followed months of statements explaining Canada’s concern over the LNG plans. On March 31, 2006, New Brunswick’s senior minister in the federal cabinet stated that the Canadian Government views LNG as dangerous cargo that can be banned from transport in Canadian waters. On September 26, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper was explicit in confirming this view to the House of Commons: Mr. Speaker, I gather there are some representatives of that project [Downeast LNG] lobbying around the Hill today, so let me be absolutely clear. This government believes that the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay are Canadian waters. We have defended that position for a long time. We oppose the passage of LNG tanker traffic through Head Harbour and we will continue to do so. Officials of the U. S. companies have asserted that their ships have the right of innocent passage through the Canadian waters that lead into Passamaquoddy Bay. Dean Girdis of Downeast LNG of Washington, D. C. asserted that the United States would not back down on the issue because it would set a dangerous international precedent. Speaking to the New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal, Girdis said, “[i]f Canada does not permit freedom of navigation in this particular site, it puts to risk several other places in the world where billions and trillions of dollars worth of cargo go through territorial seas, places like the Taiwan Strait or the Strait of Bahrain. ” After the Canadian announcement opposing the passage, Girdis noted that “the leading Canadian legal maritime expert, Ted McDorman... concluded Head Harbor Passage is, in fact, a territorial sea,” and thus that vessels have the right of innocent passage through this waterway. In a more formal document explaining its position, Downeast LNG has stated that “[t]he International Boundary Waters Treaty Act of 1909 between the U. S. and Canada and the United Nations Conventions of the Law of the Seas [sic] support the transit of Canadian waters by LNG tankers calling on a U. S. port (and vice versa). ” Those supporting the LNG shipments have argued that the Canadian position is inconsistent, because it allows LNG shipments to terminals in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and because, in their view, all cargo ships have a right of innocent passage through Head Harbor Passage pursuant to customary international law and the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (Law of the Sea Convention). An attorney for Quoddy Bay LLC has written: [Greg Thompson, Minister of Veterans Affairs in the Canadian Cabinet,] asserted his opposition to certain LNG projects (that is, only those in Maine but not those in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia)... [He] indicated that Canada would stop the passage of LNG carriers through Head Harbor Passage the same way they worked in the 19702 ̆ 7 s to stop the threat of oil tankers going on a similar route to the proposed Pittston refinery in Eastport.... Thompson’s statement that Canada can stop ships traveling through Head Harbor Passage may have overlooked Canada’s adoption in November 2003 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This treaty, which now binds Canada, requires that they give any ship the right of ‘innocent passage’ through that strait. Thus foreign vessels of any state must be allowed to pass from the high seas through Canada’s territorial waters to reach waters of the United States such as those in Passamaquoddy Bay. Quoddy Bay can only hope that Canada lives up to its treaty obligations and applies the same standards to LNG carriers moving through Head Harbor Passage as it will to those moving through the Canso Strait to Bear Head and other Canadian waters. Another U. S. ocean law expert, Professor Bernard Oxman of the University of Miami, has expressed the opinion that “Ottawa has consistently taken the somewhat liberal view of how it claims waters for its own. ” Oxman has also stated that “Canada likes to overlook certain parts of the treaty,” referring to the Law of the Sea Conention...|$|R

All met with opposition but in 1843 a bill was prepared for a new channel to an outfall at Wiggenhall St Germans, some 9 miles further down the Great Ouse, where low tide levels were 7 ft lower than at Salters Lode. The Bedford Level Corporation opposed the bill, as they felt that reducing the volume of water between Salters Lode and St Germans would lead to further deterioration of the river channel, but despite fierce opposition, the Act of Parliament (7 & 8 Vict. cap. 106) was passed in 1844. As well as powers to raise more rates, the Commissioners also received an annual payment from the Bedford Level Corporation, who no longer had to maintain Tongs Drain. The new main drain was completed in 1848.|$|E
40|$|Our {{main purpose}} is to discuss how {{prospects}} for China’s agri-food sector critically depend on the efficiency, commercial orientation, and responsiveness of China’s transportation system and intermediaries in the agri-food value chain. To provide context, we first examine the role that demographics play as a driver of growth and change in China’s agri-food sector and the economy at large. Two main findings stand out: (i) China’s population will become increasingly urban over the next 50 years; (ii) China’s economic “demographic dividend ” will expire in the late 2020 s. These two demographic drivers motivate the discussion that follows. An increasingly urban population means that China’s society and economy must continue to evolve from one based on subsistence and local conditions to one that is market based and responsive. But a market economy also requires a wellfunctioning, efficient and responsive transportation and handling network. China’s transportation infrastructure has been improving steadily. Improvements in its road and vehicular infrastructure have been {{some of the most}} important catalysts of growth and competition. Its <b>internal</b> <b>waterways,</b> although improving, remain significantly underutilized. China’s railways have made noteworthy improvements in their passenger service but arguably been the least responsive mode to commercial incentives for freight transport. China has not been able to fully exploit its comparative advantage in high value, labour intensive perishable agri-food products due to its underdeveloped transportation and handlin...|$|E
40|$|Under a {{pilot project}} {{with respect to the}} use of DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) the {{suitability}} and operational requirements of DGPS for inland waterways in the Federal Republic of Germany were investigated. Particular attention was given to describing not only the accuracy limiting factors of pure satellite measurement, but also the influence of and conditions to be attached to real-time transmission. The investigations have shown that a DGPS with a positioning accuracy of 1 - 2 m is a location procedure that is fully operational and suitable for various locating tasks. Prerequisite to a direct operational capability in the locating mode is that a functional and approved data transmission be found. If for a locating task the locating accuracy of 1 - 2 m is fully sufficient and it is sure that even in the future there will be no increased requirements, then a relatively cost-efficient single-frequency receiver is sufficient. If on <b>internal</b> <b>waterways</b> a future altitude measurement accuracy of Class I quality is desired for DGPS, either investment should be made in the expensive dual-frequency technology or a simple receiver should be used as a make-shift solution. If further development of the system provides an altitude measurement accuracy of few centimeters, a DGPS would be suitable for any locating purpose in terms of accuracy.
