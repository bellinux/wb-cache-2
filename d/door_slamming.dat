2500|$|The {{music for}} Law & Order was {{composed}} by veteran composer Mike Post, and was deliberately {{designed to be}} minimal to match the abbreviated style of the series. Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and clarinet. In addition, scene changes were accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as [...] "The Clang," [...] while Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the [...] "ominous chung CHUNG", actor Dann Florek (in a promo) as the [...] "doink doink", and Richard Belzer as [...] "the Dick Wolf Cash Register Sound." [...] The tone moves the viewer from scene to scene, jumping forward in time with all the importance and immediacy of a judge's gavel â€“ {{which is exactly what}} Post was aiming for when he created it. [...] "The Clang" [...] is an [...] of nearly a dozen sounds, including an actual gavel, a jail <b>door</b> <b>slamming,</b> and five hundred Japanese monks walking across a hardwood floor. The sound has become so associated with the Law & Order brand that it was also carried over to other series of the franchise.|$|E
60|$|Bang! {{that was}} the front <b>door</b> <b>slamming</b> behind both boys and bicycle, leaving the house quiet for a time, though the sound of voices outside {{suggested}} that a lively discussion was going on.|$|E

60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> behind him. Mr. Parker {{turned toward}} the inspector.|$|R
60|$|The landlord, who {{had already}} had his license {{endorsed}} for harbouring queer characters, feared a riot, and came outside the counter; but Jude, in his sudden flash of reason, had turned in disgust and left the scene, the <b>door</b> <b>slamming</b> with a dull thud behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well, then!' exclaimed Bob, {{with sudden}} determination. 'Now I know my doom! And {{whatever}} you hear of as happening to me, mind this, you cruel girl, {{that it is}} all your causing!' Saying this he strode with a hasty tread across the room into the passage and out at the <b>door,</b> <b>slamming</b> it loudly behind him.|$|E
60|$|He leapt for the <b>door,</b> <b>slamming</b> {{it behind}} him. The square was deserted. In {{front of the}} house was a baker's van. Evidently he was to have been taken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the house in Soho. The driver jumped to the {{pavement}} and tried to bar Tommy's way. Again Tommy's fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the pavement.|$|E

60|$|Nothing much {{happened}} at first; {{half a dozen}} hen's eggs rolled out upon the floor and then the locket closed with a sharp click. But the effect upon the nomes of this simple thing was astounding. General Guph, Kaliko, Pang and his band of executioners were all standing close to the door {{that led to the}} vast series of underground caverns which constituted the dominions of the nomes, and as soon as they saw the eggs they raised a chorus of frantic screams and rushed through the <b>door,</b> <b>slamming</b> it in Ruggedo's face and placing a heavy bronze bar across it.|$|E
6000|$|About half-past nine Jacob {{left the}} house, his <b>door</b> <b>slamming,</b> other doors slamming, buying his paper, {{mounting}} his omnibus, or, weather permitting, walking his road as other people do. Head bent down, a desk, a telephone, books bound in green leather, electric light.... "Fresh coals, sir?" ... "Your tea, sir."... Talk about football, the Hotspurs, the Harlequins; six-thirty Star {{brought in by}} the office boy; the rooks of Gray's Inn passing overhead; branches in the fog thin and brittle; and through the roar of traffic now and again a voice shouting: [...] "Verdict--verdict--winner--winner," [...] while letters accumulate in a basket, Jacob signs them, and each evening finds him, as he takes his coat down, with some muscle of the brain new stretched.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is otherwise, however, {{from the}} housekeeper's room. It {{is not so}} far down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled when the {{discharge}} is at very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this instance. It would not be very loud, and yet {{in the silence of}} the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen's room. She is, as she has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a <b>door</b> <b>slamming</b> half an hour before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the murder.|$|E

6000|$|What {{were her}} {{thoughts}} {{when he left}} her? She remained for hours after he was gone, the sunshine pouring into the room, and Rebecca sitting alone on the bed's edge. The drawers were all opened and their contents scattered about--dresses and feathers, scarfs and trinkets, a heap of tumbled vanities lying in a wreck. Her hair was falling over her shoulders; her gown was torn where Rawdon had wrenched the brilliants out of it. She heard him go downstairs {{a few minutes after}} he left her, and the <b>door</b> <b>slamming</b> and closing on him. She knew he would never come back. He was gone forever. Would he kill himself?--she thought--not until after he had met Lord Steyne. She thought of her long past life, and all the dismal incidents of it. Ah, how dreary it seemed, how miserable, lonely and profitless! Should she take laudanum, and end it, to have done with all hopes, schemes, debts, and triumphs? The French maid found her in this position--sitting in the midst of her miserable ruins with clasped hands and dry eyes. The woman was her accomplice and in Steyne's pay. [...] "Mon Dieu, madame, what has happened?" [...] she asked.|$|E
50|$|The song {{ends with}} the sound of a <b>door</b> <b>slamming.</b> According to {{producer}} Jeff Lynne, this was a metal fire door at Musicland Studios where the song was recorded.|$|E
50|$|These {{are usually}} {{efforts to get}} the {{offending}} party to go away, and if these behaviors do not work, the person with sumpong might choose to escalate them - foot stomping, <b>door</b> <b>slamming,</b> and shouting, for example.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{track is}} [...] "The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye", {{often cited as}} Morrissey's most {{misunderstood}} song ever recorded. The lyrics are describing the [...] "pain because of the strain of smiling" [...] and the dichotomy between one's public image and private personality. The music consists of a carnival-like synthesizer and also features sound effects {{like that of a}} <b>door</b> <b>slamming</b> and a camera lens snapping, along with piano accompaniment.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-throated scrubwren {{measures}} 12.5-15 cm (5-6 in) in length. The male bird has a black masked {{face and}} ear coverts, with yellow throat and eyebrow. The iris is reddish and upperparts brownish and underparts paler. The wing primaries are yellow and relatively long legs pinkish or cream. The female has a brownish face. Calls include a loud harsh chatter, and a lively song, the latter {{can be a}} response to a loud noise such as a car <b>door</b> <b>slamming.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile {{the butler}} is calling {{all of the}} {{relatives}} to a study telling them they have a phone call. After {{sitting in a chair}} and lifting the handset of the phone, the lights go out, there is a scream and a sound like a <b>door</b> <b>slamming,</b> and the relative is never seen again.
