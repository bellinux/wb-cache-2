40|$|Research {{investigating}} {{the role of}} two evolutionary constructs ??? perceptions of defeat and entrapment ??? in various psychological problems and processes has burgeoned over recent years. This meta-analysis quantitatively summarised the findings from 38 studies (11, 343 participants) which examined relationships between perceptions of defeat and entrapment and four psychological problems commonly encountered in NHS clinical services: depression, suicidality, anxiety problems and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). All correlations between defeat and entrapment and the four psychological problems were large by Cohen???s (1988) criterion. Correlations between defeat and entrapment and depression were larger than those for the other psychological problem groups, and significantly larger than those for anxiety problems and PTSD. The magnitude of the observed correlations introduces the possibility that defeat and entrapment, and perhaps other evolutionary constructs, may be integral components or driving forces behind all psychological problems. A robust approach to sensitivity analysis provided confidence that the population effect size estimates are robust and were not severely inflated by unpublished studies {{not included in the}} meta-analysis. As there was no significant between-study heterogeneity, moderator analyses were undertaken on an exploratory basis. Findings are generally consistent with theoretical predictions from the Involuntary <b>Defeat</b> <b>Strategy,</b> the theoretical model underpinning the literature. Overall, perceptions of defeat and entrapment appear to be strong risk factors for the four psychological problems examined, perhaps representing transdiagnostic processes that are common across various psychological problems. The potential role of defeat and entrapment in mental health assessment, formulation, intervention and evaluation, is considered in detail and limitations of this meta-analysis and of the literature on which it is based are discussed, highlighting areas of research where future work is needed...|$|E

40|$|Influential {{cognitive}} {{models of}} distressing symptoms in psychosis have been informed by evolutionary-based Social Ranking Theory. Social ranking theory views {{the formation and}} maintenance of symptoms as being significantly defined by ‘social mentalities’ that are operational during everyday social processes, such as when we compare ourselves to others. One framework of psychotic symptoms which has incorporated this social evolutionary perspective is the cognitive model of voices. The introduction of this thesis gives {{an overview of the}} nature of psychosis, and argues affective dysfunction and emotional factors are now included as a dimension of psychosis. It also draws attention to auditory hallucinations and persecutory beliefs and models of these symptoms are outlined. The cognitive model of voices is described and beliefs about the nature of voices, including their supposed omnipotence and power, are argued to be the critical determinants of affective and behavioural outcomes in voice hearers. For persecutory delusions, the deservedness of persecution is highlighted as a pertinent construct. The evolutionary basis of social defeat and rank is also outlined. Particular attention is drawn to the Involuntary <b>Defeat</b> <b>Strategy</b> (IDS) which is argued to automatically escalate when an individual encounters defeat and they perceive their social status to be lowered. The IDS is argued to be a dynamic mechanism, which may be attenuated when defeat is accepted. The current thesis is based on the rationale that the IDS is implemented in psychotic onset, affective dysfunction arising from the experience of psychosis, positive symptomology and relapse. Specifically, it argues that the specific nature of the IDS within the cognitive model of voices remains underdeveloped: there is a paucity of behavioural and ecologically valid support for the role of the core elements of the IDS contributing to beliefs and behavioural outcomes in relation to voices...|$|E

40|$|Light-duty diesel {{vehicles}} emit on {{the road}} substantially more nitrogen oxides than permitted by regulatory emissions standards. The European Commission addresses this problem by developing a complementary emissions test procedure for the type approval and in-service conformity testing of these vehicles. To facilitate the technical development, the European Commission established in January 2011 the Real-Driving Emissions - Light-Duty Vehicles (RDE-LDV) working group that {{is open to all}} stakeholders. This report presents the results of the technical assessment that was carried out by the RDE-LDV working group for two candidate procedures: (i) emissions testing with random driving cycles in the laboratory and (ii) on-road emissions testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). Both procedures are technically feasible. However, PEMS on-road testing appears to be more effective than random-cycle testing in limiting the pollutant emissions of light-duty vehicles because it (i) allows a wider range of driving conditions to be covered and (ii) might more effectively prevent the detection of emissions tests and the use of <b>defeat</b> <b>strategies.</b> Nonetheless, PEMS on-road testing faces practical challenges, including open safety issues, the currently limited availability of PEMS equipment, and potential climatic, geographical, and seasonal constraints for the execution of emissions tests. Random-cycle testing presents advantages over PEMS on-road testing in that already established laboratory equipment and know-how to be used. The present assessment is subject to uncertainty because the implementation and running costs as well as the overall effectiveness of the two candidate procedures depend on the definition of concrete boundary conditions (e. g., permitted test temperatures, severity of driving patterns). These definitions are not yet agreed. Accounting for the resulting uncertainty, it has been decided that the JRC will develop a PEMS-based test procedure. Vehicle manufacturers are given the opportunity to develop a random cycle-based test procedure. A decision will be made regarding the implementation for type approval and in-service conformity testing based on a comparison of the two fully developed test procedures by the end of 2013. JRC.

30|$|The {{question}} remains however, how do cultural differences in self-construal influence appraisals of trauma and consequently PTSD? To date, {{as far as}} we are aware, only one study has investigated the influence of cultural differences in self-construal on trauma appraisals. Research has demonstrated that appraisals of mental <b>defeat,</b> control <b>strategies,</b> permanent change and alienation are associated with PTSD (e.g. Dunmore et al. 2001; Ehlers et al. 2000; Ehlers et al. 1998). These appraisals focus on the self and one’s actions, autonomy and consistency across time (i.e. mental defeat, control, permanent change) and on the self in relationship to others (i.e. alienation). Jobson and O’Kearney (2009) found that trauma survivors with PTSD from Western, individualistic cultures reported more mental defeat, alienation, permanent change and less control strategies than non-PTSD trauma survivors from individualistic cultures. In contrast, for those from non-Western, collectivistic cultures only alienation appraisals differentiated between trauma survivors; those with PTSD had more alienation appraisals than those without PTSD. This finding provides preliminary support for cultural differences in self influencing the relationship between appraisals and posttraumatic psychological adjustment. Namely, as Jobson (2009) argues, if appraisals of trauma challenge one’s self-construal (i.e. either the culturally emphasised independent or interdependent self) this can have an impact on PTSD risk and maintenance.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMany of the "small wars" {{that have occurred}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Cold War fit the profile of insurgent conflicts: they pit a constituted state vs. a counter-state, the counter-state relies on a support structure within the population, and the center-of-mass of these conflicts is political and psychological rather than military in nature. The urbanization boom in many underdeveloped countries has stretched the social services and infrastructure of the cities beyond the breaking point, and this dynamic may contribute to the occurrence of insurgency. Increasingly, political entrepreneurs have operated within urban areas to enlist disaffected individuals in campaigns of political conflict. This study argues that the most effective way to counter an insurgency is through a strategy of indirect approach that seeks to dismantle the insurgent support structures. The United States can support friendly governments that are combating insurgent violence through a "vertically integrated" advisory effort spearheaded by Special Operations Forces (SOF).
