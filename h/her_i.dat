5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> would cry with her.|$|E

25|$|Tibullus's {{first book}} {{consists}} of poems written {{at various times}} between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius (Apol. 10) reveals that her real name was Plania. As regards her station, it should be noticed {{that she was not}} entitled to wear the stola, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the custodes placed over <b>her</b> (<b>i.</b> 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus's suit was favoured by Delia's mother, of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus's illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during estrangement (discidium), and the sixth after the return of the husband and during Delia's double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband's death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity to see her, and he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception—too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia. In addition, several elegies in Book I concern themselves with Tibullus's love for a boy, who is named Marathus.|$|E

Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E

500|$|Steve and Garry {{moved to}} WLS, but {{ultimately}} returned to WLUP where they stayed until their split in 1993.

Meier also blamed Dahl's alcoholism and unpredictable behavior. Dahl, for his part, blamed Fircak for the split, once saying on air [...] "When I met <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> knew the rules had just changed." ...|$|E

A few years earlier Fuseli had fallen for a woman named Anna Landholdt in Zürich, while {{travelling}} from Rome to London.
