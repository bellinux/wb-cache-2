5|$|The Swedish army {{surrounded}} Copenhagen, {{hoping to}} starve it <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> This failed when the Dutch Republic joined the conflict on the Danish {{side and a}} reinforcing fleet managed to smash {{its way through the}} Swedish naval forces in Øresund. Charles then tried a decisive assault on the city, hoping to conquer it and win the war; this plan likewise failed. Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then also joined the war against the Swedes.|$|E

5|$|The city, which {{suffered}} from fires {{caused by the}} Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish army on August 14. The entering forces, led by Bolesław, were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir's family: On 14 August, the city received Boleslav and Sventipolk , its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and from fear of us, the whole region was brought <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> When they arrived, the archbishop of that city received them, at the church of St Sophia, with relics of the saints {{and other kinds of}} ceremonial apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 <b>into</b> <b>submission</b> prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry {{to protect them from}} the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions. Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority. Henry's intervention was successful, and both the Irish and Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.|$|E

From 1797 until the early 19th century she had especial success against privateers, capturing a large number in the West Indies and in the Atlantic. She had a narrow escape from a superior French force in 1801, but was able to batter her pursuer, the 40-gun Bravoure <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> She was prevented from capturing her by the arrival of French reinforcements. Her last years were spent on a variety of stations, including at the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies. Laid up in 1807, she was sold for breaking up in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{civil war}} {{had broken out}} in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, {{resulting}} {{in a period of}} chaos known as the Anarchy. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded England during 1137 in support of her claim. Although Miles de Beauchamp declared himself in support of Stephen, the king decided to retake Bedford Castle before marching north. Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained advance warning of the attack and took in considerable supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle and left a force under the command of Hugh to starve it <b>into</b> <b>submission</b> whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, {{transports}} with artillery, siege tools, {{and some}} French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk, {{the northern end}} of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown. The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right. Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point. That day, Washington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be bombarded <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> The Americans and the French spent the night of the 28th sleeping out in the open, while work parties built bridges over the marsh.

The Parthians forced Armenia <b>into</b> <b>submission</b> from 37 AD but in 47 AD the Romans retook control of the kingdom and offered it client kingdom status. Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign between 55 and 63 AD against the Parthian Empire, which had again invaded Armenia. After gaining Armenia once more in 60 AD and subsequently losing it again in 62 AD, the Romans sent Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo in 63 AD into the territories of Vologases I of Parthia. Corbulo succeeded in returning Armenia to Roman client status, where it remained for the next century.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Porto Ferrajo was a French {{attempt to}} force the {{surrender}} of the Tuscan fortress town of Porto Ferrajo (now Portoferraio) {{on the island of}} Elba following the French occupation of mainland Tuscany in 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered, but received significant support from British Royal Navy forces who controlled the Mediterranean Sea and ensured that supplies reached the garrison and that French supply convoys were intercepted. The French began the siege with 1,500 men in May 1801, later reinforced to more than 5,000, but could not make an impression on the fortress's defences, instead seeking to starve the defenders <b>into</b> <b>submission</b> with the support of a squadron of French Navy frigates operating off the coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had reached}} a stalemate and Murad contemplated his next move. He was advised to pillage the countryside, but the surrounding fields had already been burned by Skanderbeg. The sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into the forests to prevent further casualties. Mehmed, Murad's son, proposed leaving Svetigrad to strike at Krujë. Murad sternly rejected this, reasoning that the supplies to take Svetigrad would have been wasted and that Krujë would be more strongly defended than Svetigrad. The sultan thus decided to remain at Svetigrad {{in an attempt to}} starve the garrison <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> Meanwhile, the garrison under the leadership of Peter Perlati made several successful sorties against the Ottomans, in order to ease the encirclement and strengthen his soldiers' morale.|$|E
5|$|The {{successor}} of von Diebitsch as Commander in Chief of Russian {{forces in}} Poland, Count Ivan Paskevich, {{decided to wait}} for the Polish forces on other fronts to be defeated before he resumed his march on Warsaw. In June 1831 General Antoni Giełgud's attack on Wilno failed, and his corps was forced to cross the border with Prussia to avoid complete destruction. Only a small detachment under General Henryk Dembiński managed to rejoin the main Polish force. This secured Paskevich's northern flank and allowed his forces to devise a new plan of attack. Instead of attacking the city directly and risking yet another defeat, he intended to surround Warsaw, cut it off from other Polish-controlled areas, and force it <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b>|$|E

However, the resistance was useless, and the city was captured and then razed to the ground, and its territory was divided between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens <b>into</b> <b>submission,</b> leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at peace with Alexander. With Macedon's vassals and allies once again peaceable, Alexander was finally free {{to take control of}} the stalled war with Persia, and in early 334 BC he crossed with an army of 42,000 men into Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|American {{casualties}} were climbing, both from frequent German counterattacks {{and the cost}} of storming pillboxes. The Germans had spent the night of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of Bardenberg into fortified pillboxes; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town <b>into</b> <b>submission.</b> On 12 October, the Germans launched a major counterattack against the American 30th Infantry Division. It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well-placed anti-tank defenses. At the village of Birk, a three-hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman; the Sherman managed to knock out an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw, but was soon attacked by others. This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division, and the Germans were driven from the town. The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front; nevertheless, it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended link-up with the 1st Infantry Division. To accomplish this, two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard-pressed 30th.|$|E
5|$|Hostilities did not {{end with}} the {{publication}} of the Dictum. The garrison at Kenilworth refused to accept the terms given, and held out until 14 December, when deprivation forced them to surrender. In April 1267, the earl of Gloucesterwho had been central both to the royal victory at Evesham and to the drafting of the Dictumturned against the king. He occupied the city of London, and set himself up as the champion of the disinherited. After negotiations involving both Edward and Ottobuono, Gloucester relented, and by June a settlement was reached. Gloucester had forced a change to the conditions of the Dictum, whereby the disinherited were allowed to recover their lands before they had paid their fines rather than after; an arrangement that made repayment much easier. In the summer of that year, Prince Edward moved at the Isle of Ely, where the last of the rebels still held out, and forced them <b>into</b> <b>submission</b> under terms favourable to the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In the Bishop's Wars castles {{that held}} out for the king against the Covenanters, {{including}} Caerlaverock and Threave in 1640, were slighted, with their roofs removed and walls breached to make them uninhabitable.

As a result, it was pounded <b>into</b> <b>submission</b> by the New Model Army's siege train, losing its end towers and ceasing to be a residence from that point. The sequence of Jacobite risings from 1689 threatened the Crown in Scotland, culminating in the rebellion in 1745. Stirling was able to withstand the Jacobite attack in 1745 and the siege of Blair Castle, {{at the end of the}} rebellion in 1746, was the final castle siege to occur in the British Isles. In the aftermath of the conflict Corgaff and many others castles were used as barracks for the forces sent to garrison the Highlands.
