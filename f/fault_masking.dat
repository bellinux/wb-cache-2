Most basically, this is provided by redundancy, particularly dual modular redundancy. Typically, components have multiple backups and are separated into smaller [...] "segments" [...] that act to contain a fault, and extra redundancy is built into all physical connectors, power supplies, fans, etc. There are special software and instrumentation packages designed to detect failures, such as <b>fault</b> <b>masking,</b> which is a way to ignore faults by seamlessly preparing a backup component to execute something as soon as the instruction is sent, using a sort of voting protocol where if the main and backups don't give the same results, the flawed output is ignored.|$|E

40|$|The Triple Modular Redundant (TMR) {{architecture}} {{is based on}} the triplication of application modules. To <b>mask</b> <b>faults,</b> copies of modules are mapped on processing units, capable of direct communication. In the approach used in this paper, each processing unit (or a processor) mapping a module, is equipped with a kernel. This kernel allows it to <b>mask</b> <b>faults</b> via an agreement protocol involving the two other processors (mapping the two other copies). <b>Faults</b> are <b>masked,</b> under user requests, through kernel primitives. Robot movements are observed when its path following controller is mapped on a TMR architecture. The output of the velocity controller is then submitted to an agreement. The study of resulted robot movements shows that single <b>faults</b> are efficiently <b>masked.</b> There is no perceptible difference among the robot behaviors, when using or not using fault-masking kernel, unless when processors faults occur.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the representation of safety specification on the complexity of adding <b>masking</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance to programs—where, in the presence of faults, the program 1) recovers to states from where it satisfies its (safety and liveness) specification and 2) preserves its safety specification during recovery. Specifically, we concentrate on two approaches for modeling the safety specifications: 1) the bad transition (BT) model, where safety is modeled as a set of bad transitions that should not be executed by the program, and 2) the bad pair (BP) model, where safety is modeled as a set of finite sequences consisting of at most two successive transitions. If the safety specification is specified in the BT model, then it is known that the complexity of automatic addition of <b>masking</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance to high atomicity programs—where processes can read/write all program variables in an atomic step — is polynomial in the state space of the program. However, for the case where one uses the BP model to specify safety specification, we show that the problem of adding <b>masking</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance to high atomicity programs is NPcomplete. Therefore, we argue that automated synthesis of fault-tolerant programs is likely to be more successful if one focuses on problems where safety can be represented in the BT model.

40|$|Understanding the {{application}} resilience {{in the presence}} of faults is critical to address the HPC resilience challenge. Currently, we largely rely on random fault injection (RFI) to quantify {{the application}} resilience. However, RFI provides little information on how fault tolerance happens, and RFI results are often not deterministic due to its random nature. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to quantify the application resilience. Our methodology is based on the observation that at the application level, the application resilience to faults is due to the application-level <b>fault</b> <b>masking.</b> The application-level <b>fault</b> <b>masking</b> happens because of application-inherent semantics and program constructs. Based on this observation, we analyze application execution information and use a data-oriented approach to model the application resilience.
