25|$|Liechtenstein {{follows a}} policy of {{neutrality}} {{and is one of}} the few countries in the world that maintain no military. The army was abolished soon after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. The demise of the German Confederation in that war freed Liechtenstein from its <b>international</b> <b>obligation</b> to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for one. The Prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenceless, but relented on 12 February 1868 and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colors of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at age 95.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} {{concluded that}} neither condition had been met. Neither the government nor the defendant had cited any statutory authority which authorized the President to act. Instead, the President {{claimed that the}} Optional Protocol and U.N. Charter implicitly gave him the authority to act. The Court disagreed: [...] "The President has an array of political and diplomatic means available to enforce international obligations, but unilaterally converting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is not among them." [...] The President also claimed that Congress had acquiesced {{in the exercise of}} presidential power by failing to act following the resolution of prior ICJ controversies. But, Roberts held, [...] "A review of the Executive's actions in those prior cases, however, cannot support the claim that Congress acquiesced in this particular exercise of Presidential authority, for none of them remotely involved transforming an <b>international</b> <b>obligation</b> into domestic law and thereby displacing state law." [...] The President also founded his action on [...] "related" [...] statutory responsibilities and an [...] "established role" [...] in litigating foreign policy concerns. But none of the examples cited in the government's brief supported that conclusion, the majority ruled, and none of the examples remotely indicated that the President may pre-empt state law.|$|E
