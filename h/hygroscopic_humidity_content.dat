40|$|A {{formula to}} {{estimate}} forest fuel flammability index (FI) is proposed, integrating three species flammability parameters: time to ignition, time of combustion, and flame height. Thirty-one (31) Moroccan tree and shrub species were tested within {{a wide range}} of fuel moisture contents. Six species flammability classes were identified. An ANOVA of the FI-values was performed and analyzed using four different sample sizes of 12, 24, 36, and 50 flammability tests. Fuel <b>humidity</b> <b>content</b> is inversely correlated to the FI-value, and the linear model appears to be the most adequate equation that may predict the hypothetical threshold-point of humidity of extinction.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} design {{vehicles}} with diminished CO 2 /km emissions level, car manufacturers-among alternatives-aim at reducing {{the weight of}} their vehicles. One of the solutions pursued consists in the replacement of metallic structural parts by light weight polymer based composites ones. Naturally, with these new parts, NHV (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) engineers now face the challenge to predict their vibrational responses. In the present study, focusing on PA 6 reinforced glass fiber oil pan, mechanical and microstructural characterizations, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and X-ray tomography measurements respectively were performed and evidenced that the complex modulus of the parent material not only depends on temperature and frequency but also on <b>humidity</b> <b>content</b> and loading direction. The effect of temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>content</b> was also evidenced on the vibratory response of the oil pan.

Water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) was evaluated using the quasi-isostatic method.
