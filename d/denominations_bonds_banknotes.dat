Our data span two financial crises: the 1997 [...] 98 Asian crisis and the 2007 [...] 09 global financial crisis.

On the other extreme, we find no notable differences between the 2007 - 09 financial crisis and tranquil times for both domestic and foreign issuers...|$|R
40|$|This paper re-examines the {{so-called}} coexistence puzzle {{in terms of}} {{a modified version of the}} legal restrictions hypothesis initially put forth by Bryant and Wallace (1980). The modification is in terms of dropping a questionable assumption in the original hypothesis; i. e., that large <b>denomination</b> government <b>bonds</b> cannot be intermediated by private banks. This restriction is replaced by one that is arguably more palatable; i. e., that the intermediated monetary instruments created by private banks are not universally acceptable as payment for all exchanges (unlike government money). The friction that gives rise to this latter restriction is one that is commonly employed in monetary models where fiat money is essential for exchange. ...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the last}} decade many {{traditional}} and new market participants have begun to apply current technology solutions to the municipal market remedying many of the latent problems associated with {{many aspects of the}} municipal bond market. The emergence of products like small <b>denomination</b> municipal <b>bonds,</b> for example, is a result of new bond financing platforms. Such products also open up the muni market to middle-income buyers who otherwise couldn't afford the large, $5,000 minimum price in which bonds are typically bundled. The general idea with modern platforms is to leverage technology to make the market more responsive to investors, more financially transparent and ultimately easier for issuers and buyers. Many believe that, in doing so, more people will compete to buy muni bonds and thus the cost of issuing debt will be lower for issuers.|$|R

Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany: in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued. As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest <b>bond</b> <b>denomination</b> available was 100 kronen.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} by the U. S. Treasury of inflation-indexed notes {{was one of}} the most widely publicized innovations in the U. S. capital markets in recent years. Since their introduction in January 1997, $ 57 billion in 5 -, 10 -, and 30 -year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) has been issued, and the Treasury has recently announced that TIPS will also be offered as small- <b>denomination</b> savings <b>bonds.</b> Because both the coupon and the principal of TIPS vary with the consumer price index, the Treasury believes these notes will appeal to risk-adverse investors seeking protection from inflation. Proponents of TIPS have argued that their issuance should also reduce the cost of borrowing to the Treasury and permit a clear measure of investors' forecasts of inflation. Despite their promise, it is doubtful whether inflation-indexed bonds have been a great success either in the United States or in other industrialized countries that have issued them. The authors analyze the characteristics of TIPS that might explain their limited acceptance. Their model indicates that TIPS should appeal primarily to risk-investors in high tax brackets who are pessimistic concerning inflation. Despite their unique design, however, TIPS are not unique in offering investors inflation-protected returns. Inflation-indexed bonds; Inflation (Finance); Bonds...|$|R

40|$|Case {{study of}} a {{financial}} institution (anonymous) where employees were required to process high <b>denomination</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> and interest due coupons according to strict security regulations. The security regulations appear at first glance to be compliable, but the study attempts {{to demonstrate that the}} ability to comply with the security regulations is illusory and the security regulations constitute a double bind. The study introduces the concepts of context and descriptors to identify a double bind condition imbedded in the communication transaction to which the employees are subjected. The study delves into the cause and effect of a double bind communication transaction and presents the view that double binds are not the result of a paradoxical injunction inherent in the message conveying the double bind, but in the context surrounding the communication transaction. The study includes an interview survey of 150 employees who work in the department where they are required to process bonds and bond interest due coupons in strict compliance with the security regulations. The questionnaire survey reveals pathological behavior patterns exhibited by the employees. The study offer insights into how to identify double binds in security regulations that employees are expected to follow. By being able to identify double bind situations which employees are subjected to as part of their working conditions a reader is able to avoid the error...|$|R

The finding that a shift from a unipolar to a multipolar international monetary and financial system has happened before suggests that it can happen again.

40|$|The IMF {{attempts}} to catalyze and stabilize private capital flows to emerging markets by providing public monitoring and emergency finance. In analyzing its role we contrast cases where banks and bondholders do the lending. Banks {{have a natural}} advantage in monitoring and creditor coordination, while bonds have superior risk sharing characteristics. Consistent with this assumption, banks reduce spreads as they obtain more information through repeat transactions with borrowers. By comparison, repeat borrowing has little influence in bond markets, where publicly available information dominates. But spreads on bonds are lower when they are issued in conjunction with IMF-supported programs, as if {{the existence of a}} program conveyed positive information to bondholders. The influence of IMF monitoring in bond markets is especially pronounced for countries vulnerable to liquidity crises.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between the {{cyclical}} patterns of macroeconomic and policy variables and the currency composition of domestic sovereign debt in emerging market countries. The empirical analysis is anchored in an equilibrium model, in which the dollarization of sovereign debt arises {{as a result of the}} optimal portfolio choices by risk-averse investors, and of a sovereign debt manager who takes fiscal policy as given. The model predicts that in countries where the exchange rate is countercyclical (i. e., the exchange rate depreciates during recessions), a more procyclical fiscal policy (i. e., expansionary in good times and contractionary in bad times) would lead, on average, to a more dollarized domestic sovereign debt. The empirical analysis using the Jeanne-Guscina EM Debt database (2006) on the currency structure of the central government debt in 22 emerging market countries over 1980 - 2005, supports these predictions.

40|$|We {{make use}} of micro-level data for over 45, 000 private bonds issued by over 5000 firms from 22 {{countries}} in 1990 - 2006 to analyze the impact that {{the launch of the}} EMU had on the currency <b>denomination</b> of the <b>bond</b> issues. To our knowledge, ours is the first systematic analysis of issue at the micro level. The use of the micro data allows us to distinguish between the response to the advent of the euro by new and seasoned bond issuers, and to condition on other issue characteristics. We find that the impact on new issuers is larger than on seasoned issuers and that most of the increase in the euro-denominated bond issuance was along the "extensive" margin. Insofar as new entrants to the bond market will define the overall currency composition in the long run, these results imply that aggregate studies might be underestimating the euro effect. We also find that to a large extent the increase in euro issuance was "at the expense" of U. S. dollar issuance, suggesting that the euro competes with the U. S. dollar as a currency of choice for international financial transactions. Bond market; Euro...|$|R
