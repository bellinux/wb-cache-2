5|$|Mercury <b>embrittlement</b> is {{the most}} common type of liquid metal <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chromium, unlike such metals as {{iron and}} nickel, does not suffer from {{hydrogen}} <b>embrittlement.</b> However, it does suffer from nitrogen <b>embrittlement,</b> reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides {{at the high}} temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.|$|E
5|$|Titanium <b>embrittlement</b> from {{cadmium-plated}} tool residues {{resulted in}} banishment of those tools (and {{the implementation of}} routine tool testing to detect cadmium contamination) in the A-12/SR-71, U-2, and subsequent aircraft programs that use titanium.|$|E
5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as <b>embrittlement,</b> which reduces {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the <b>embrittlement</b> of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The <b>embrittlement</b> decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal <b>embrittlement</b> if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth and {{transition}} metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the <b>embrittlement</b> of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen <b>embrittlement,</b> and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} <b>embrittlement,</b> the entire target chamber was {{designed}} to be easily rolled out of the center of the building on rails to the maintenance building where it could be rebuilt. The chamber was expected to last four years, and be replaced in one month. The optical system is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines themselves {{do not have to be}} realigned after chamber replacement.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen <b>embrittlement,</b> leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the <b>embrittlement</b> effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging <b>embrittlement</b> and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal <b>embrittlement</b> if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the process {{is its ability to}} overcome hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> problems, which is important for workpieces that have a hardness greater than HRC 40. Note that there still is some <b>embrittlement</b> of the workpiece. While this process does not cause problems with hydrogen <b>embrittlement,</b> and electroplating does, it still offers equivalent corrosion protection. There is a great cost savings in using mechanical plating over electroplating on hardened workpieces, because the electroplating processes requires a pre- and post-plating operation to overcome hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> problems. Moreover, because mechanical plating occurs at room temperature there is no tempering of hardened workpieces.|$|E
25|$|Neutron radiation, which {{over time}} leads to neutron {{activation}} and <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|MSR designs rely on nickel-based alloys to {{hold the}} molten salt. Alloys based on nickel and iron are prone to <b>embrittlement</b> under high neutron flux.|$|E
25|$|Gold– easily dissolves, forms brittle intermetallics, {{contamination}} above 0.5% causes sluggishness {{and decreases}} wetting. Lowers melting point of tin-based solders. Higher-tin alloys can absorb more gold without <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper, a high-purity copper that {{contains}} oxygen as an alloying agent, represents {{the bulk of}} electrical conductor applications because of its high electrical conductivity and improved annealability. ETP copper is used for power transmission, power distribution, and telecommunications. Common applications include building wire, motor windings, electrical cables, and busbars. Oxygen-free coppers are used to resist hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> when extensive amounts of cold work is needed, and for applications requiring higher ductility (e.g., telecommunications cable). When hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> is a concern and low electrical resistivity is not required, phosphorus may be added to copper.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the {{pressure}} tubes in the Pickering A reactors were replaced ahead of design life due to unexpected deterioration caused by hydrogen <b>embrittlement.</b> Extensive {{inspection and maintenance}} has avoided this problem in later reactors.|$|E
25|$|Maintain mercury at {{less than}} {{detectable}} limits (approximately 0.001 ppb by volume) primarily to avoid damaging equipment in the gas processing plant or the pipeline transmission system from mercury amalgamation and <b>embrittlement</b> of aluminum and other metals.|$|E
25|$|These {{thermocouples}} {{are well}} suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. Typical uses are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as vacuum furnaces. They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of <b>embrittlement.</b> A typical range is 0 to 2315°C, which can be extended to 2760°C in inert atmosphere and to 3000°C for brief measurements.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorus {{is also an}} {{important}} component in steel production, in the making of phosphor bronze, and in many other related products. Phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus-containing copper (CuOFP) alloys with a higher hydrogen <b>embrittlement</b> resistance than normal copper.|$|E
25|$|For {{long term}} use, each atom {{in the wall}} is {{expected}} to be hit by a neutron and displaced about a hundred times before the material is replaced. High-energy neutrons will produce hydrogen and helium by way of various nuclear reactions that tends to form bubbles at grain boundaries and result in swelling, blistering or <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Embrittlement</b> is a {{risk for}} many human remains, {{and as a result}} {{handling}} should be limited. When possible, artifacts should be lifted by their storage container or tray. To avoid transfer of oils to the remains, nitrile or latex gloves should be worn during their handling. If a body is to be lifted, it must be supported under all of its appendages.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{pipelines}} {{are more}} expensive than even long-distance electric lines. Hydrogen is about three times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy. Hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel (hydrogen <b>embrittlement),</b> which increases maintenance costs, leakage rates, and material costs. The difference in cost is likely to expand with newer technology: wires suspended in air can use higher voltage with only marginally increased material costs, but higher pressure pipes require proportionally more material.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, it {{has become}} {{understood}} that even delicate organic materials have some elasticity in their response to relative humidity (RH) fluctuations, allowing the materials to swell or contract as necessary. This phenomenon is naturally reversible within a range of 50% ± 15% RH. Destructive chemical and mechanical processes, such as hydrolysis at high RH and <b>embrittlement</b> and cross-linking at low RH, can be held to a minimum within a similar range for a general museum collection.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{is capable}} of greater {{work-hardening}} than is the case with pure copper, so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping. There is an increase in work-hardening capability with increasing percentage of arsenic, and it can be work-hardened over a wide range of temperatures without fear of <b>embrittlement.</b> Its improved properties over pure copper can be seen with as little as 0.5 to 2wt% As, giving a 10 to 30% improvement in hardness and tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, {{and they need to}} be replaced as plastic <b>embrittlement</b> occurs.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen has a clean {{flame and}} {{is good for}} use on aluminium. It can be used at a higher {{pressure}} than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and cutting. It is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The flame temperature is high, about 2,000°C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure, and up to 2800°C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (oxyhydrogen). Hydrogen is not used for welding steels and other ferrous materials, because it causes hydrogen <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface <b>embrittlement</b> and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and soak up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E
25|$|Increasing gas {{pressure}} improves the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see pressure vessel). Achieving higher pressures necessitates {{greater use of}} external energy to power the compression. The mass of the hydrogen tanks needed for compressed hydrogen reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle. Because {{it is a small}} molecule, hydrogen tends to diffuse through any liner material intended to contain it, leading to the <b>embrittlement,</b> or weakening, of its container. The most common method of on board hydrogen storage in today's demonstration vehicles is as a compressed gas at pressures of roughly 700bar (70MPa).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. <b>Embrittlement</b> or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
25|$|Moisture {{has strong}} effects on nearly all {{cultural}} heritage materials, with ceramics and glass being exceptions to these effects in most cases. Metals face {{the risk of}} corrosion as RH increases, a risk which is enhanced by surface contaminants and emphasizes the need for proper housing. Additionally, mold growth is far more likely as humidity increases, which not only could cause allergic reactions for viewers but it also weakens the collections afflicted and attracts other pests. In contrast to this requisite for dry conditions, if the atmosphere is not humid enough wooden objects could crack or warp, and many organic materials face <b>embrittlement</b> below 40% RH.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and other}} {{elements}} within iron act as softening agents that promote the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements—their formation in the iron hydride either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases—enables the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting iron hydride. Iron hydride's ductility compared to pure iron is only possible {{at the expense of}} strength, of which elemental iron has a relative deficiency. However, iron hydride is metastable and subject to the rapid formation of a precipitated phase of gaseous dihydrogen, a process known as hydrogen <b>embrittlement.</b> Thus, the material properties of iron hydride are time-sensitive. One alloying element intentionally added to modify the characteristics of iron hydride is titanium.|$|E
