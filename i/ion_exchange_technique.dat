40|$|Abstract. Composite {{materials}} made by {{metal clusters}} embedded in silicate glass matrices ex-hibit striking optical properties, interesting for photonic application, {{as well as}} important magnetic properties, such as superparamagnetism. These composites are also good candidates for appli-cation in catalysis and sensor technology. Furthermore, metal clusters can act as sensitizers in rare earths-containing glasses, important in telecommunication technology. Among the most inter-esting preparation methods of metal nanocluster composite glasses are those based on ion im-plantation or <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>techniques,</b> in combined methodologies that involve also subsequent annealing and/or irradiation of the metal-doped glass matrices. In this work, a short presentation is made of recent developments in the glass composites synthesis that use the combination of differ-ent methods, with special emphasis given to those based on ion implantation and <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>techniques.</b> Some example will be also presented, that show the effectiveness of combining differ-ent techniques for controlling the nanocluster structure and size and thus the material features. 1...|$|R

The efficiency of metal removal was determined after 100 min of treat-ment. Main effects and interaction effects of the four factors were analyzed using statistical techniques.
