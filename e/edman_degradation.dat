The primary structures of the isoproteins MT- 1 and MT- 2 were elucidated by peptide and amino acid sequence analysis. The amino-terminal part was deduced from automated <b>Edman</b> <b>degradations</b> of the pyridylethylated CNBr-cleaved derivatives. The remaining part of the sequence was established by a comparison of the carboxamidomethylated tryptic peptides to those from equine liver MT- 1 A and MT-PB. Peptides differing in either amino acid composition or retention time from high pressure liquid chromatography were further subjected to manual <b>Edman</b> <b>degradations</b> or carboxypeptidase Y digestion. The two isoproteins consist of 61 amino acids and show a sequence identity of 90 %. When compared with the primary structures of other mammalian MTs, the 20 cysteinyl residues are totally conserved, in agreement with their function as metal ligands. The two isoproteins contain Cu and Zn at a ratio of 3 : 4. Spectroscopic data reveaal bsorption properties typical for both Cu- and Zn-thiolate transitions. The marked differenceso f MT- 1 and MT- 2 in the Cuthiolate CD features canb e attributed to the six amiinoacid substitutions occurring exclusively in the amino terminal parts of the molecules. It is proposed that in bovine fetal MTs also the three copper ions are preferentially bound to the first 9 cysteinyl residues (cluster B) and the four zinc ions to the remaining 11 cysteinyl residues (cluster A) suggested previously by l 13 Cd NMR spectroscopy of calf liver MTs (Briggs, R.

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} reagents {{which can be used}} to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the <b>Edman</b> <b>degradation,</b> can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required. [...] So the amino acid {{does not have to be}} eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{structure}} of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The {{primary structure}} is held together by peptide bonds that are made {{during the process of}} protein biosynthesis. The two ends of the polypeptide chain are referred to as the carboxyl terminus (C-terminus) and the amino terminus (N-terminus) based {{on the nature of the}} free group on each extremity. Counting of residues always starts at the N-terminal end (NH2-group), which is the end where the amino group is not involved in a peptide bond. The primary {{structure of a}} protein is determined by the gene corresponding to the protein. A specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is read by the ribosome in a process called translation. The sequence of amino acids in insulin was discovered by Frederick Sanger, establishing that proteins have defining amino acid sequences. The sequence of a protein is unique to that protein, and defines the structure and function of the protein. The sequence of a protein can be determined by methods such as <b>Edman</b> <b>degradation</b> or tandem mass spectrometry. Often, however, it is read directly from the sequence of the gene using the genetic code. It is strictly recommended to use the words [...] "amino acid residues" [...] when discussing proteins because when a peptide bond is formed, a water molecule is lost, and therefore proteins are made up of amino acid residues. Post-translational modification such as disulfide bond formation, phosphorylations and glycosylations are usually also considered a part of the primary structure, and cannot be read from the gene. For example, insulin is composed of 51 amino acids in 2 chains. One chain has 31 amino acids, and the other has 20 amino acids.|$|E

The protein has an unusual amino acid composition: 42 % of the residues are alanine and only 14 of the 20 common amino acid residues are present. The primary structure consists of regions enriched in particular amino acid residues. The N-terminal region and a region close to the C-terminus are enriched in glycine. The rest of the protein is dominated by alanine, except for two short regions enriched in hydrophilic residues. Almost all the proline residues are situated in the alanine-rich regions in a conserved sequence 'A-A-P-A/V'.
