5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed <b>is</b> <b>called</b> pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this <b>is</b> <b>called</b> pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure <b>is</b> <b>called</b> cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
