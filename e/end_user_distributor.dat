40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>End</b> <b>users</b> and <b>distributors</b> of PV modules {{are often}} {{faced with the}} problem of how to verify the power output {{specification}} of a new shipment consisting of a larger number of PV modules. As a first step, claims can be based on the data sheet containing information on the nominal power output (related to STC) and the power output tolerance. The question then arises as to the evaluation of the shipment regarding fulfilment of the power output specifications. A control measurement of all modules is not realistic, so that in practice a certain sample size will be randomly selected and re-measured by a test institute. The issue is then whether the sample size is sufficient for a reliable inference and whether the test samples suitably represent the whole shipment. These questions often lead to disputes between module producers and consumers that not infrequently result in litigation. Accordingly, there is a great need for harmonised procedures suitable for evaluating whether the power output of a shipment lies within the manufacturer’s specifications. On the other hand, inferring from random samples to the properties of larger populations is a major task of applied statistics and falls within the field of significance testing. The latter is based on statistical hypotheses and includes so-called error probabilities in reference to both the producer’s risk and the consumer’s risk. On the basis of these statistical methods we developed sampling plans and acceptance criteria for two practical cases: a) STC performance data of modules (as measured by the manufacturer) are supplied with the shipment, and b) no information at all is provided. Furthermore, we distinguish between the case of a normal distribution of the total production population and the case where no specific distribution is assumed. Ou...|$|R
