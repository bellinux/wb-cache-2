Model results highlight important response differences among manure types and generally illustrate the diseconomies of manure production.

Policy scenarios limiting the manure application rate reduce manure value and excess phosphate application.

We hypothesize that the observed stronger expression of negative priming effect at higher compared to lower biochar rate at a fixed manure application rates (Fig.  2) was caused by increased labile C with <b>increasing</b> <b>manure</b> rate, which, upon mineralization released relatively higher level of CO 2 -C that saturated biochar sorption sites.

This, subsequently, resulted in higher net CO 2 evolution at the higher manure compared to the lower application rate at a fix biochar rate.|$|R

40|$|High-concentrate diets {{consisting}} of cereal grains and grain byproducts have {{high energy density}} compared with forage-based diets. To avoid digestive disorders, cattle must be adapted to concentrates, which often entails feeding a series of step-up diets that contain progressively less roughage over a 2 - to 3 -week period. This allows the microbial population to adapt to fermentation of the starches and sugars that are present in high-concentrate diets. If cattle are not properly adapted to concentrate-based diets, lactic acid, which is produced by opportunistic starch-fermenting bacteria like Streptococcus bovis, can accumulate, predisposing the animal to acidosis.
