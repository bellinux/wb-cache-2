The present study was therefore designed to assess the seroprevalence of human hydatidosis among occupa-tional risk groups in Punjab (India). One hundred and forty nine human serum samples from <b>dog</b> <b>handlers,</b> veterinarians/ para veterinarians, dairy farmers, patients with liver disorders, HIV positives and control group (visiting hospital for other problems) were collected and analyzed using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results revealed that 23 (15. 43 %) subjects were seropositive for human hydatidosis. High seropositivity were recorded in <b>dog</b> <b>handlers</b> (30 %), fol-lowed by the other risk group populations. Relative risk of being infected {{was found to be}} 4. 80 times high in <b>dog</b> <b>handlers</b> when compared to control group population. Future studies must be planned to determine the significance of these findings and the status of human hydatidosis in India...|$|R
