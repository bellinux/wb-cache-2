500|$|Following this award, Petry {{was asked}} to appear on talk shows and at other gatherings, {{starting}} with Good Morning America. In his spare time, he stayed physically active. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> golf, hunt, water ski, and drive all terrain vehicles with use of his prosthetic hand.|$|E
500|$|Werbin {{notes that}} while {{discounting}} products by 40percent set his business {{apart from the}} local competition in the 1970s, outlets such as Guitar Center now also offer discounts. [...] In response to questions about his strategy for competing with larger retailers such as Guitar Center and American Musical Supply, which also operate mail order and Internet businesses, Werbin states that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> operate on small margins to stay competitive: [...] "The mom-and-pop businesses that have survived have learned to operate on narrow margins." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the {{historical}} figure of the same name, is Bolívar's [...] "long-serving mayordomo". As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's [...] "total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel's frame". Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> live with his master's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts. Simultaneously, however, [...] Palacios is also the General's closest confidante, the person best able to read his moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bolívar's life is essential for García Márquez's recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, Goku and {{his friends}} {{participate}} in another fighting tournament, but set between two Gods of Destruction; Beerus and his brother Champa. During this tournament, Goku reveals that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> combine the perfect ki control of his Super Saiyan Blue form with his older technique, the Kaiō-ken; creating a variation called [...] "Super Saiyan Blue Kaiō-ken". Although Goku gives up after fighting his opponent, Hit, his team ends up winning the tournament. Later, Goku encounters an evil counterpart of himself known as [...] "Goku Black", who is terrorizing Future Trunks' timeline. Black is revealed to be Zamasu, who stole Goku's body and subsequently killed {{him and his family}} in another alternate timeline. After the omnipotent god from Future Trunks' timeline Zen-Oh is summoned by Goku, he erases the entire universe and Zamasu. Goku and the others present there manage to escape in their time machine, and later Goku and Future Trunks use the time machine again to bring Future Zen-Oh to the present timeline. Shortly afterwards, both Zen-Ohs want to see a multi-universal martial arts tournament and let the Grand Priest set up the tournament where all losing universes are destroyed. After enlisting nine of his allies to fight alongside him in the [...] "Tournament of Power", Goku ends up recruiting Freeza as well.|$|E

6000|$|A smile lighted up the countenance of {{the young}} Indian for a moment, as he listened to a {{compliment}} which gratified him much; but the grave expression which was natural to him instantly returned, as he said, [...] "Arrowhead has hunted in the Rocky Mountains where the men are treacherous; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> tread lightly there." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 6 March 1866, Bishop Crowther {{described}} Oko Jumbo as the [...] "most {{sensible and}} wealthy" [...] man in Bonny, {{and noted that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read {{the first chapter of}} St. Matthew. The next year <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> write, and enrolled thirteen of his children in school. He gave his support to the Christian missionaries, and on Easter Day 1867 joined King George in declaring that the Iguana, the traditional deity of Bonny, was no longer [...] "Bonny Juju".|$|R
6000|$|Who {{carries the}} gun? [...] A lad from London town. Then let him go, for well we know [...] The stuff that never backs down. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> joke at the powder smoke, [...] For {{he is the}} fog-smoke's son, And his heart is light and his pluck is right - [...] The man who carries the gun.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the Chief she loves?" [...] said Nombe to me, {{studying}} Anscombe {{with her}} steady eyes after Heda had gone. [...] "Well, {{he is no}} common man and brave, if idle; one, too, who may grow tall in the world, should he live, when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> think. But, Macumazahn, if she met you {{both at the same}} time why did she not choose you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A hat, an umbrella, a belt, a neckerchief. Otherwise stark naked. All {{in a day}} the hard-earned [...] "civilization" [...] has {{melted away}} to this. And even these {{perishable}} things must presently go. Indeed, there is but a single detail of his civilization that can be depended on to stay by him: according to the missionary, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> swear. This is art, and art is long, as the poet says.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{five minutes}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak softly, and to speak only once--a low, mellow, bell-like bark of a single syllable. Also, in this first five minutes, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> [...] "sit down," [...] as {{distinctly}} different from [...] "lie down"; and that he must sit down whenever he spoke, and that he must speak without jumping or moving from the sitting position, and then must wait until the piece of food was passed to him.|$|R

6000|$|... "When {{he comes}} from his home he is a savage, pure and simple. He [...] feels no shame at his nakedness and want of adornment. When he [...] returns home he does so well dressed, {{sporting}} a Waterbury watch, [...] collars, cuffs, boots, and jewelry. He takes with him one or more [...] boxes--["Box" [...] is English for trunk.]--well filled with clothing, a [...] musical instrument or two, and perfumery and other articles of [...] luxury <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> appreciate." ...|$|E

60|$|Man, {{before his}} heart is broken, counts time his own, and {{therefore}} he spends it lavishly upon every idle thing. His soul is far from fear, because the rod of God is not upon him; but when he sees himself under the wounding hand of God, or when God, like a lion, is breaking all his bones, then he humbleth himself before him, and falleth at his foot. Now <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> count every moment a mercy, and every small morsel a mercy.|$|E

"He went up {{the river}} to shoot {{crocodiles}} against my orders, {{when he was about}} twelve years old--not very long after his mother's death, and some wandering Mahdi tribesmen kidnapped him and sold him as a slave. I have been looking for him ever since, for the poor boy was passed on from tribe to tribe, among which his skill as a musician enabled me to follow him. The Arabs call him the Singer of Egypt, because of his wonderful voice, and it seems that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play upon their native instruments." ...|$|E
50|$|There is {{controversy}} as <b>to</b> how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{communicate with}} the Aboriginals, with one answer being that the North American cultural context was {{very similar to the}} African one.|$|R
60|$|But the man Moses {{was very}} meek. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> keep his temper. Indeed, the story {{seems to say}} that he never lost his temper really but once; and for that God punished him. Never man was so tried, save One, even our Lord Jesus Christ, as was Moses. And yet by {{patience}} he conquered. Eighty years <b>had</b> <b>he</b> spent in <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> keep his temper; and when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> keep his temper, then, and not till then, was he worthy to bring his people out of Egypt. That was a long schooling, but it was a schooling worth having.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{read and}} read a number of {{contemporary}} works on religion and history. From these, he developed his religious views that departed substantially from Catholic orthodoxy of the time.|$|R
60|$|If the {{introduction}} to his own identity was startling, there is nothing reassuring in the feeling that this strange acquaintanceship must last. For continue it does. It becomes an unsought intimacy he cannot shake off. Like to his own shadow he cannot escape it. To himself a man cannot but be at home. For years this alter ego haunts him, for he imagines it an idiosyncrasy of his own, a morbid peculiarity he dare not confide to any one, {{for fear of being}} thought a fool. Not till long afterwards, when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> live {{as a matter of course}} with his ever-present ghost, does he discover that others have had like familiars themselves.|$|E
6000|$|Edith writhed {{from her}} grasp, and stood flushed and defiant, with gleaming, angry eyes fixed upon her sister. [...] "You may speak evil of him now," [...] said she, [...] "but {{there was a}} time when Paul de la Fosse came to Cosford, and who so gentle and soft-spoken to him then as wise, grave, sister Mary? But <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love another; so now he is the wicked man, and it is shame to be seen under his roof! From what I see of my good pious sister and her {{cavalier}} it is sin for another to ride at night with a man at your side, but it comes easy enough to you. Look at your own eye, good sister, ere you would take the speck from that of another." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{his wife}} had given him up. She had given him up, not with disdainful rejection, nor with {{contempt}} in her eye, or censure in her voice, not with diminution of love or of outward respect. She had given him up as a man abandons his attempts to make his favorite dog take the water. He would fain that the dog he loves should dash into the stream as other dogs will do. It is, to his thinking, a noble instinct in a dog. But his dog dreads the water. As, however, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love the beast, he puts up with this mischance, and never dreams of banishing poor Ponto from his hearth because of this failure. And {{so it was with}} Mrs. Clavering and her husband at the rectory. He understood it all. He knew that he was so far rejected; and he acknowledged to himself the necessity for such rejection.|$|E
60|$|Deringham only nodded again, {{because this}} type of man was new <b>to</b> him, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> keep silent when in doubt; but Alton's big right hand closed into a fist.|$|R
