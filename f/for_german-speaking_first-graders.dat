40|$|This article {{assesses the}} {{relevance}} of Basil Bernstein <b>for</b> <b>German-speaking</b> Switzerland. It argues that Bernstein is potentially relevant <b>for</b> <b>German-speaking</b> Switzerland in light of contemporary studies which highlight a connection between social background and differential school achievement. After contextualising Bernstein's theoretical outlook and critically reflecting upon his use of a static concept of social class, it explores past and present applications of Bernstein.
