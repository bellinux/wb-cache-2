25|$|Pectins, {{also known}} as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several {{distinct}} polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterized {{by the presence of}} saccharide appendant residues (such as <b>D-xylose</b> or D-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and <b>D-xylose,</b> with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bacterial overgrowth {{can be made}} by physicians in various ways. Malabsorption can be detected by a test called the <b>D-xylose</b> test. [...] Xylose is a sugar that does not require enzymes to be digested. The <b>D-xylose</b> test involves having a patient drink a certain quantity of <b>D-xylose,</b> and measuring levels in the urine and blood; if {{there is no evidence of}} <b>D-xylose</b> in the urine and blood, it suggests that the small bowel is not absorbing properly (as opposed to problems with enzymes required for digestion).|$|E
2500|$|Pectin {{is mainly}} D-galacturonic acid {{connected}} by α (1-4) glycosidic linkages. The side chains of pectin may contain {{small amounts of}} other sugars such as L-fructose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and <b>D-xylose.</b> In jams, pectin is what thickens the final product via cross-linking of the large polymer chains.|$|E
2500|$|Breath {{tests have}} been {{developed}} to test for bacterial overgrowth, based on bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates to hydrogen and/or methane, or based on the detection of by-products of digestion of carbohydrates that are not usually metabolized. [...] The hydrogen breath test involves having the patient fast for a minimum of 12 hours then having them drink a substrate usually glucose or lactulose, then measuring expired hydrogen and methane concentrations typically over a period of 2–3 hours. [...] It compares well to jejunal aspirates in making the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth. [...] 13C and 14C based tests have also been developed based on the bacterial metabolism of <b>D-xylose.</b> [...] Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids. [...] The glycocholic acid breath test involves the administration of the bile acid 14C glychocholic acid, and the detection of 14CO2, which would be elevated in bacterial overgrowth.|$|E
50|$|A <b>D-Xylose</b> {{test can}} be performed, {{which is where}} the patient will consume 4.5g of <b>D-xylose,</b> a sugar, by mouth. The urine {{excretion}} of <b>D-Xylose</b> is then measured after 5 hours. The majority of <b>D-Xylose</b> is absorbed normally, and should be found in the urine. If the <b>D-Xylose</b> is found to be low in the urine, this suggests an intestinal malabsorption problem such as bacterial overgrowth of the proximal small intestine, Whipple's Disease, or an autoimmune with diseases such as Celiac's Disease (allergy to gluten) or Crohn's Disease (autoimmune disease affecting the small intestine). With empiric antibiotic treatment after an initial positive <b>D-Xylose</b> test, and if a follow-up <b>D-Xylose</b> test is positive (decreased urine excretion) after antibiotic therapy, then this would signify it is not bacterial overgrowth of the proximal small intestine. Since Whipple's disease is so rare, a follow-up positive <b>D-Xylose</b> test more likely indicates a non-infectious etiology and more likely an autoimmune etiology. Clinical correlation is recommended to rule out Whipple's disease.|$|E
5000|$|In enzymology, a xylose {{isomerase}} (...) is an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion ofD-xylose and D-xylulose. This enzyme {{belongs to the}} family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The isomerase has now been observed in nearly a hundred species of bacteria. Xylose-isomerases are also commonly called fructose-isomerases due to their ability to interconvert glucose and fructose. The systematic name of this enzyme class is <b>D-xylose</b> aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include <b>D-xylose</b> isomerase, <b>D-xylose</b> ketoisomerase, and <b>D-xylose</b> ketol-isomerase.|$|E
50|$|In normal individuals, a 25 g oral dose of <b>D-xylose</b> will {{be absorbed}} and {{excreted}} {{in the urine}} at approximately 4.5 g in 5 hours. A decreased urinary excretion of <b>D-xylose</b> is seen in conditions involving the GI mucosa, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Whipple's disease. In cases of bacterial overgrowth, the values of <b>D-xylose</b> absorption return to normal after treatment with antibiotics. In contrast, if the <b>D-xylose</b> urinary excretion is not normal after a course of antibiotics, then the problem must {{be due to a}} non-infectious cause of malabsorption (i.e., celiac disease).|$|E

50|$|It is {{desirable}} to ferment <b>D-xylose</b> to ethanol. This {{can be accomplished}} either by native xylose fermenting yeasts such as Scheffersomyces Pichia stipitis or by metabolically engineered strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pichia stipitis is not as ethanol tolerant as the traditional ethanol producing yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae {{on the other hand}} can not ferment <b>D-xylose</b> to ethanol. In attempts to generate S. cerevisiae strains that are able to ferment <b>D-xylose</b> the XYL1 and XYL2 genes of P. stipitis coding for the <b>D-xylose</b> reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), respectively were introduced in S. cerevisiae by means of genetic engineering. XR catalyze the formation of xylitol from <b>D-xylose</b> and XDH the formation of D-xylulose from xylitol. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and naturally ferment D-xylulose through the pentose phosphate pathway.|$|E
50|$|Another {{experiment}} {{comparing the}} two <b>D-xylose</b> metabolizing pathways {{revealed that the}} XI pathway was best able to metabolize <b>D-xylose</b> to produce the greatest ethanol yield, while the XR-XDH pathway reached a much faster rate of ethanol production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{activity}} of <b>D-xylose</b> isomerase was first observed by Mitsuhashi and Lampen in 1953 in the bacterium Lactobacillus pentosus.

[...] In 1957, the <b>D-xylose</b> isomerase activity on D-glucose conversion to D-fructose was noted by Kooi and Marshall. It is now known that isomerases have broad substrate specificity. Most pentoses and some hexoses are all substrates for <b>D-xylose</b> isomerase. Some examples include: D-ribose, L-arabinose, L-rhanmose, and D-allose.|$|E

50|$|In this pathway {{the enzyme}} xylose {{isomerase}} converts <b>D-xylose</b> directly into D-xylulose. D-xylulose is then phosphorylated to D-xylulose-5-phosphate {{as in the}} oxido-reductase pathway. At equilibrium, the isomerase reaction results {{in a mixture of}} 83% <b>D-xylose</b> and 17% D-xylulose because the conversion of xylose to xylulose is energetically unfavorable.|$|E

A xylonate dehydratase is splitting off a water molecule resulting in 2-keto 3-deoxy-xylonate.

50|$|The {{aim of this}} genetic {{recombination}} in the laboratory {{is to develop a}} yeast strain that efficiently produces ethanol. However, the effectiveness of <b>D-xylose</b> metabolizing laboratory strains do not always reflect their metabolism abilities on raw xylose products in nature. Since <b>D-xylose</b> is mostly isolated from agricultural residues such as wood stocks then the native or genetically altered yeasts will need to be effective at metabolizing these less pure natural sources.|$|E

50|$|<b>D-xylose</b> {{absorption}} test {{is a medical}} test performed to diagnose conditions that present with malabsorption of the proximal small intestine due to defects in {{the integrity of the}} gastrointestinal mucosa. <b>D-xylose</b> is a monosaccharide, or simple sugar, that does not require enzymes for digestion prior to absorption. Its absorption requires an intact mucosa only. In contrast, polysaccharides require enzymes, such as amylase, to break them down so that they can eventually be absorbed as monosaccharides.
