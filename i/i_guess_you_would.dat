6000|$|Nasmyth {{said he did}} not know, and Acton nodded. [...] "Any way," [...] he rejoined, [...] "we can {{ascertain}} it in the city. Now, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{like that}} man run right out of the neighbourhood? It would be safest, and it might perhaps be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crying!" [...] Of course I am crying, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be crying, [...] too, [...] If {{people were}} telling such stories as they tell about me, about YOU. [...] Oh yes, you can laugh {{if you want}} to, and smoke as you didn't care [...] how, [...] And get your brains {{softened}} like uncle's. Dr. Jones says you're [...] gettin' it now.|$|E
6000|$|Gordon laughed. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "I like that, naturally. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have taken}} their view of him once. Well, since {{you can put your}} pride in your pocket, you're evidently growing. There's just one way of putting {{anything}} through here, and that's to take hold and hang right on, no matter what it costs. I guess there's one of the boys wanting you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ralph, <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be busy {{altering}} Fairmead on opportunity, and {{now that}} your sister has {{turned it into a}} palace I should always be afraid of spoiling something; so I have arranged by mail to camp with Hudson, of the next preemption. His place is scarcely a mile away. Miss Lorimer, you don't realize the joys of living as a bachelor, or <b>you</b> <b>would</b> freely forgive me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so," [...] Guy said. [...] "I {{should have}} been here before, but I joined the procession, as <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be there also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jimmy, with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "I don't quite know. There were, you see, several reasons. To begin with, I had {{to come out of}} the mail-boat for my year's training, and when that was over there were a good many men on the Company's list to be worked off before they wanted me again. Trade is slack over there, and it seemed wiser to await my turn. After all, it doesn't cost so much to come across second-class and Colonist; and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be glad to see me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the last}} eight years of her life, Helen {{suffered}} from dementia but gained peace painting watercolors. “They’re abstract but just lyrical and beautiful,” said her daughter Alice in an October 2013 interview with Forbes. “I have two. One’s very happy and…oh, whimsical, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say. Then there’s one she did right before she died. I mean, you could almost tell. She knew.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On 27 February 2007, in an {{interview}} with thelondonpaper, Wolf raised questions about his sexuality: [...] "In the same way I don’t know if my sixth album {{is going to be a}} death-metal record or children's pop, I don’t know whether I’m destined to live my life with a horse, a woman or a man. It makes life easier." [...] In a 5 July 2007 interview with the Sydney Star Observer, he confirmed his sexuality: [...] "My sexuality is kind of liberal. I fall in love with men and women. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call me bisexual. I like to have sex and fall in love—I don't like giving terminology for my sexuality." [...] Later, in 2009, Wolf told The Guardian that though in the past he has had relationships with women, he currently identifies himself as gay. As an artist, Wolf reflects that he doesn't like to worry about whether he makes a record [...] "too gay or too straight or too this or too that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> {{think of}} me if I came over to your store and told your {{customers}} that I could sell them goods cheaper than <b>you</b> could? <b>I</b> rather <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be for running me out--and mighty lively, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be walking}} in this garden which joins {{on to that}} of the palace, and--none were about, and--the door in the wall was open. Indeed, it was almost as though I were left alone and unwatched of set purpose. So I came and sought--and found, having a {{question}} to put to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolly, Dolly," [...] the agonized mother cried, flinging herself {{upon her}} child's mercy, as it were; [...] "Don't {{be hard on}} me; don't be hard on me! My darling, how could <b>I</b> ever <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{look at it like}} this? How could <b>I</b> ever <b>guess</b> my {{daughter}} and his would see things for herself in so different a light from the light we saw them in?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, ma'am, they've just {{settled down}} and taken {{possession}} of the whole place. He says {{to me that he}} know'd you'd both want them to make themselves at home, just as if you was there, and they thought they'd better do it. He asked me did I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be home by Monday, and I said I didn't know, but <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> So says he to his wife, 'Won't that be a jolly lark? We'll just keep house for them here till they come. And he says he would go down to the store and order some things, if there wasn't enough in the house, and he asked her to see what would be needed, which she did, and he's gone down for 'em now. And she says that, as it was Saturday, she'd see that the house was all put to rights; and after breakfast she set me to sweepin'; and it's only by way of her dustin' the parlor and givin' me the little girl to take for a walk that I got off at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|Harold's job allowed Mamie Phipps Clark to live {{what she}} {{considered}} a privileged childhood. Black physicians were rare during that time. Her {{mother did not}} need to work to supplement the family income. Clark stated, “I had a very happy childhood. I really did. We were comfortable. How can I tell you I had a happy childhood? I enjoyed everything. I enjoyed school. I loved school. I enjoyed recreation. I enjoyed the little travelling we did. I was very happy. I can’t say it was impoverished, or—for me, it was privileged. For me. Now, by objective standards, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say it was just an average family. But it was a very privileged childhood.” (as cited in Lal, 2002, p. 1) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} I really meant to tell you, Elsa," [...] she said more quietly, [...] "not lately, at any rate. Oh, I dare say at first I did mean to hurt you--but a month has gone by and I was {{beginning}} to forget. People used to say of me that I was a good sort--it was the hurt that he did me {{that seems to have}} made a devil of me. [...] . . . And then--just now when I saw the other folk coming home in the procession and noticed that you and Andor weren't among them, <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be walking back together arm-in-arm--and that the whole world would be smiling on you both, while I was eating out my heart in misery." ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Nixon {{described}} his mother as [...] "a Quaker saint." [...] She is acknowledged to have exerted a tremendous {{effect on her}} son's outlook throughout his life. In Nixon's final remarks at the White House on August 9, 1974, he stated about her, [...] "Nobody will ever write a book, probably, about my mother. Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> all of <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say this about your mother -- {{my mother was a}} saint. And I think of her, two boys dying of tuberculosis, nursing four others in order that she could take care of my older brother for 3 years in Arizona, and seeing each of them die, and when they died, it was like one of her own. Yes, she will have no books written about her. But she was a saint." ...|$|R
5000|$|Talking {{about his}} character, Ben McKenzie stated [...] "Comparatively, perhaps he's {{in a better}} place than {{some of these other}} truly evil, evil people." [...] But as the season will be with him dealing with Cobblepot, Gordon [...] "doesn’t have a lot of good options. He has to either fight him {{directly}} or find allies to fight Penguin — surrogates to fight Penguin — which leads him down a dark path. So, that's kind of the way we start for him in season 4." [...] According to Stephens, [...] "We're going to see Jim make, in some ways, big steps toward <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call the commissionership. But also we're going to see Jim, in his quest to save the city, cross different ethical lines than he ever did before. It's going to bring him to an ethical nadir that we haven't seen him at, and it's going to be told through the context of a relationship that he has with Sofia Falcone, the daughter of Don Falcone, who's played by Crystal Reed this year. And that's going to be a really compelling and interesting relationship." [...] Sean Pertwee also stated that the season will also explore Alfred's mysterious past [...] "indirectly". The season premiere's title [...] "Pax Penguina" [...] is a play on the Latin phrase [...] "Pax Romana", meaning [...] "Roman peace".|$|R

[...] "But first, let's see all clear. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know," [...] he said, with {{imperious}} solemnity, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know {{the bottom is}} out of this Farallone speculation? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know it's right out? and if this old island hadn't been turned up right when it did, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know where you and I and Huish would have been?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, {{who seemed}} to {{recognize}} that protests would be useless, [...] "it's quite a long journey. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can afford it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Mr. Van Reinberg assented, [...] "but the fact's {{there all}} the same. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can stay where you are, Mr. Courage!" ...|$|R
