40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the elemental composition, microstructure, and hardness of commercially available reamers, K files, and <b>H</b> <b>files.</b> Five instruments of each type from different manufacturers (Antaeos, FKG, Maillefer, Mani, and Micromega) were embedded in epoxy resin along their longitudinal axis. After metallographic grinding and polishing, the specimens were chemically etched and their microstructure investigated under an incident light microscope. The specimens were studied under a scanning electron microscope, and their elemental compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The same surfaces were repolished and X-ray diffraction was performed. The same specimen surface was used for the assessment of the Vickers hardness (HV 200) by using a microhardness tester with a 200 -g load and 20 -s contact time. The hardness results were statistically analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (a = 0. 05). All files demonstrated extensively elongated grains parallel to longitudinal file axis because of cold drawing. The elemental composition of Maillefer and Mani reamers, Antaeos K files, and Mani <b>H</b> <b>files</b> were found in the range of AISI 303 SS, whereas all the rest were determined as AISI 304 SS. Two different phases (austenite SSt and martensite SSt) were identified with X-ray diffraction for all files tested. The results of hardness classified reamers in the following decreasing order (HMV 200) : Micromega = 673 +/- 29 (a), Mani 662 +/- 24 (a), Maillefer = 601 +/- 34 (b), Antaeos = 586 +/- 18 (b), FKG = 557 +/- 19 (c), and the K files (HV 200) : FKG 673 +/- 16 (a), Mani = 647 +/- 19 (a), Maillefer = 603 +/- 41 (b), Antaeos = 566 +/- 21 (cb), Micromega = 555 +/- 15 (c), and the <b>H</b> <b>files</b> (HMV 200) : Mani = 640 +/- 12 (a), FKG 583 +/- 31 (b), Maillefer = 581 +/- 5 (b), Antaeos = 573 +/- 3 (b), Micromega = 546 +/- 14 (b). Although only two stainless steel alloys were used for the production of endodontic files, the differences in hardness are independent to the alloys used, implying that other factors, such as the production method or the thermomechanical history of the alloys, play an important role on the mechanical properties of endodontic files...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the canal {{transportation}} and canal centering ability in the preparation of curved root canals after instrumentation with V-Taper 2 H, ProTaper Next (PN), and Hyflex CM files using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Materials and Methods: Thirty mesiobuccal canals of mandibular molars with an angle of curvature ranging from 20 to 40 were divided according to the instrument used in canal preparation into three groups of ten samples each: V-Taper 2 H (Group 1), PN (Group 2), and Hyflex CM (Group 3). The teeth were instrumented according to manufacturer's guidelines up to 30 no. apical preparation. Canals were scanned using a CBCT scanner before and after preparation to evaluate the transportation and centering ratio at 3 mm, 6 mm, and 9 mm from the apex. The amount of transportation and centering ability was assessed. The three groups were statistically compared with analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey test. Results: All instruments maintained the original canal curvature with significant differences between the different files. Data suggested that V-Taper 2 <b>H</b> <b>files</b> presented the best outcomes for both the variables evaluated. V-Taper 2 <b>H</b> <b>files</b> caused lesser transportation and remained better centered in the canal than PN and Hyflex CM files. However, it was seen that PN caused less transportation in apical level than Hyflex CM. Conclusion: The canal preparation with V-Taper 2 H showed lesser transportation and better centering ability than PN and Hyflex CM...|$|E
