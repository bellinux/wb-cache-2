50|$|In 1965, {{he joined}} the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota as an {{assistant}} professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. Schmidt's research focused on various aspects of the chemistry and engineering of chemical reactions on solid surfaces. Reaction systems of recent interest are catalytic combustion processes to produce products such as syngas, olefins, and oxygenates <b>by</b> partial <b>oxidation,</b> NOx removal, and <b>incineration</b> <b>by</b> total <b>oxidation.</b> One topic of his research is the characterization of adsorption and reactions on well-defined single-crystal surfaces. A second research topic is steady state and transient reaction kinetics under conditions from ultrahigh vacuum to atmospheric pressure. Schmidt also researches catalytic reaction engineering, in which detailed models of reactors are constructed to simulate industrial reactor performance, with particular emphasis on chemical synthesis and on catalytic combustion.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{principal}} myths regarding Kama is that of his <b>incineration</b> <b>by</b> Shiva, the Madana-bhasma (Kama Dahana). It occurs in its most developed form in the Matsya Purana (verses 227-255) but is also repeated with variants in the Shaiva Purana andother Puranas.|$|R
