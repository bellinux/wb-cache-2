5|$|During the off-season, while {{preparations}} were underway for the 1947 season, Grove was {{the subject}} of trade discussions. Most notably, White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president Bill Veeck discussed trading him for Indians pitcher Steve Gromek, but the deal was nixed when they could not come to an agreement. As the season began, Grove remained part of the rotation, which was led by Lopat and included Joe Haynes and Frank Papish. While Grove started off the season well, he struggled through the middle of the year, <b>going</b> <b>from</b> May 18 to August 2 without winning a game. As a result, he was benched, and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances. For the first time, Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4.00. He ended the season with six wins, eight losses, a 4.44 ERA, and six complete games. Grove spent the off-season working in the men's furnishings department of Henry C.

5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those <b>going</b> <b>from</b> the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|M-104 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan in the Western Michigan region of the state. It runs from Ferrysburg to Nunica in Ottawa County, passing through Spring Lake. The highway serves as a connector between Interstate96 (I-96) and US Highway31 (US31), helping connect Grand Haven with the Grand Rapids metro area. A related Connector104 runs between the M-104 and US31 in Ferrysburg. During the 1920s and 1930s, a different highway bore the M-104 designation. The current highway was previously a section of US16 until 1940 when that designation was shifted to a road <b>going</b> <b>from</b> Nunica to Muskegon; the orphaned highway was redesignated M-104 at the same time. Since then, two routing changes have caused short segments {{to be transferred to}} local control and removed from the highway.|$|E
5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings.

According to Svenska Dagbladet, support in 2011 was at 23 percent, and has risen somewhat significantly to 41 percent in September 2015, when only 39 percent of respondents were opposed to NATO membership. An October 2014 survey commissioned by TV4 News also showed slightly more respondents supporting membership than opposing it. In 2014, news that a military expert in Sweden had calculated that the country could hold out for a week if attacked temporarily lifted support for NATO membership in polls. A May 2017 poll by Pew showed that support for membership had risen to 47 percent.|$|E
