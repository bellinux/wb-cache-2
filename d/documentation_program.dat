40|$|<b>Program</b> <b>documentation</b> plays a {{vital role}} in almost all <b>programming</b> processes. <b>Program</b> <b>documentation</b> flows between {{separate}} tools of a modularized environment, and in between the components of an integrated development environment as well. In this paper we discuss the flow of <b>program</b> <b>documentation</b> between <b>program</b> development tools. In {{the central part of the}} paper we introduce a mapping of <b>documentation</b> flow between <b>program</b> development tools. In addition we discuss a set of locally developed tools which is related to <b>program</b> <b>documentation.</b> The use of test cases as examples in an interface documentation tool is a noteworthy and valuable contribution to the documentation flow. As an additional contribution we identify several circular relationships which illustrate feedback of <b>documentation</b> to the <b>program</b> editor from other tools in the development environment. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Lena Nichelle Wilson THE IMPACT OF A CLINICAL <b>DOCUMENTATION</b> IMPROVEMENT <b>PROGRAM</b> The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if the implementation of a Clinical <b>Documentation</b> Improvement <b>Program</b> will provide an impact to the patient’s acuity scores in a healthcare organization. These acuity scores, in combination with other metrics, are utilized in public reporting of healthcare institutions. By portraying the most accurate clinical picture possible, healthcare organizations have the potential to increase their Case Mix Index which could also bring in more revenue. At this time there is limited documentation available providing results benchmarking of Clinical <b>Documentation</b> Improvement <b>Programs.</b> The majority, if not all, of the literature explains the need to implement a program and how to structure and organize the efforts surrounding it. This study will look at the outcomes experienced at one facility to determine if their implementation provided improvements. Upon completion of this study, it was determined that the implementation of Clinical <b>Documentation</b> Improvement <b>Program</b> provided an impact to the facility in terms of their acuity scores. There was also an increase realized in their overall Case Mix Index. Therefore, as evidenced in this study, Clinical <b>Documentation</b> Improvement <b>Programs</b> are an important initiative to implement at any healthcare institution...|$|R

5000|$|Peterson {{is perhaps}} best remembered for {{establishing}} the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), a federal <b>documentation</b> <b>program</b> that is still active and which has spawned the Historic American Engineering Record and the Historic American Landscape Survey. On November 13, 1933, while he was the Chief of the Eastern Division for the National Park Service, Peterson wrote a memo to the director which became the charter for the program and successfully garnered funds from the Civil Works Administration the following month. HABS targeted unemployed architects, draftsmen, and photographers to make as complete a record as possible of [...] "the rapidly disappearing examples of early architecture and historic structures throughout the country." [...] This program was credited as [...] "the first major step upon {{the part of the}} Federal Government toward the cataloging and preservation of historic structures." [...] The first HABS survey work began in January 1934 and later that year was formalized as a joint agreement with the American Institute of Architects and the Library of Congress. The HABS program has continued nearly unabated to the present.|$|E

The Archive’s (5) nuclear weapons and intelligence <b>documentation</b> <b>program</b> is supported by the Prospect Hill Foundation, the New-Land Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which also funds the Archive’s (6) Russia/former Soviet Union program. The Archive’s (7) Iran program is supported by the Arca Foundation and through a partnership with MIT Center for International Studies. The Archive’s (8) publications program, creating public access to declassified documents both online and in book formats, relies on publication royalties from libraries that subscribe to the Digital National Security Archive through the commercial publisher ProQuest.|$|E
