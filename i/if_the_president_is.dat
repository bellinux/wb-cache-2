5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|Between May and June 1987, the appellants Chng Suan Tze, Kevin Desmond de Souza, Teo Soh Lung and Wong Souk Yee {{were arrested}} by the Internal Security Department (ISD) during Operation Spectrum for alleged {{involvement}} in a Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. Detention orders were made against the appellants under section 8(1)(a) of the Internal Security Act by the Minister for Home Affairs and Law, S. Jayakumar, directing that they be detained for one year. The provision empowers the Minister to make an order directing that a person be detained <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In the case, the Court {{examined}} {{whether it}} could review the executive's discretionary power under sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). Section 8 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order directing that a person be detained without trial <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore, while section 10 allows the Minister to suspend detention orders and to revoke suspensions {{as he or she}} thinks fit.|$|E
50|$|While {{historically}} {{the term}} {{has generally been}} {{used to refer to}} the wife of a <b>president,</b> there <b>were</b> occasions when another woman, such as <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> daughter, has filled the duties of First Lady as hostess in <b>the</b> White House, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> wife <b>was</b> unwilling, unable, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> a widower or bachelor.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{occasionally}} another woman, such as <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> daughter, {{has filled}} {{the duties of}} First Lady as hostess in <b>the</b> White House, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> wife <b>was</b> unwilling, unable, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> a widower or bachelor.

50|$|Inauguration of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Russia <b>is</b> {{conducted}} {{six years}} after the inauguration of <b>the</b> previous <b>president.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> elected in early elections, he takes the oath, thirty days after {{the announcement of the}} results.|$|R
5|$|The {{office of}} President falls vacant upon the expiry of the incumbent's six-year term or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> {{for some reason}} unable to {{complete}} his or her term; for example, due to death, resignation or removal from office for misconduct or mental or physical infirmity. If the office of President becomes vacant before the incumbent's term expires, a poll for an election must be held within six months. In other cases, an election can take place any time from {{three months before the}} expiry of the incumbent's term of office.|$|E
25|$|The Union Buildings are {{the site}} of presidential inaugurations. The {{official}} offices of the president are on the left-hand side of the Union Buildings, and the South African national flag is flown on the left-hand side <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> in office.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} {{states that}} the President is an elected office, there is no directly elected presidential line of succession. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> unable to execute his/her powers and duties, the Marshal of the Sejm will have the powers of a President for a maximum of 60 days until elections are called.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the film}} Dr. Strangelove, Senator Buford {{complains}} that the U.S. nuclear deterrent lacks credibility. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>were</b> {{killed in a}} decapitation strike, retaliation would be impossible. Wing Attack Plan R is devised to close this loophole.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> philosopher-king, {{what was}} he? After {{all he was}} a man who had spent much of his life at a University.

50|$|The {{presiding}} {{officers were}} {{at first the}} kings, but in historical times the ephors, and the voting was conducted by assessing the loudness of shouting in <b>the</b> crowd; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> doubtful as {{to the majority of}} voices, a division was taken and the votes were counted. Vote by shouting could be seen as the first type of range voting.|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> fully satisfied, on {{the basis}} of the report of the Governor of the {{concerned}} state or from other sources that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the Constitution, he can proclaim under Article 356 a state of emergency in the state. Such an emergency must be approved by the Parliament within a period of 2 months.|$|E
25|$|The Internal Security Act, {{among other}} things, authorizes the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order {{directing}} that a person be detained {{for up to two}} years at a time <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> satisfied that the detention is necessary to prevent the person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or the maintenance of public order or essential services. A detained person is entitled to make representations to an advisory board made up of a chairman appointed by the President who is or has been, or is qualified to be, a Supreme Court Judge, and two other members appointed by the President after consulting with the Chief Justice. An advisory board must consider the representations and make recommendations to the President within three months from the date of detention. If an advisory board recommends that a detainee be released, and the government authority on whose advice or order the person was detained disagrees with the board's recommendation, the President has a personal discretion as to whether the person should continue to be detained. The President's power in this area is restricted by the requirement that the board must recommend the detainee's release; if further detention is recommended, the President has no power to direct otherwise.|$|E
500|$|In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971), the High Court {{affirmed that}} {{with respect to}} the President's {{satisfaction}} that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore, mala fides or bad faith was [...] "not... a justiciable issue {{in the context of the}} Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc". Essentially, this means that the President's satisfaction is subjective, and not objective. The effect of this decision is that [...] "the Constitution left it to the executive, and not the judiciary, to decide what national security required". Subsequently, in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal took a different stand, holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. (Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended [...] "as the Minister sees fit", as well as to revoke such a direction.) The Court said that [...] "the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law" [...] because [...] "all power has legal limits", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 the {{parliamentary}} majority ultimately designated Lahoud as its presidential nominee [...] but the Hezbollah-led opposition refused {{to attend a}} legislative session to elect a new president, thus ensuring there <b>was</b> no quorum. <b>President</b> Michel Suleiman <b>was</b> later elected by consensus, after Hezbollah threatened not to yield to a state <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> Nassib Lahoud or any other candidate chosen by {{the parliamentary}} majority.|$|R
50|$|The Bogra {{framework}} also {{addresses the}} check and balance {{to avoid the}} permanent domination by any five provinces where a provision <b>was</b> made that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> elected from <b>the</b> four provinces then the Prime Minister was to be elected from East Bengal, and vice versa. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> to be elected for a term of 5 years from the indirect elections by the Electoral College formed by both houses: National Assembly and the Senate.|$|R

2500|$|The Government {{has so far}} only {{appeared}} to implicitly endorse, and not oppose, two categories of soft power: the President's private influence in politics, and his public involvement in non-political affairs. Minister for Law K. Shanmugam has stated that [...] "the quality of the advice given by the President... {{would depend on the}} quality of the person giving the advice". He referred to the President's ability to speak to the Prime Minister in private – in this way he may be able to influence policy to some extent. The Prime Minister, however, will only give due weight to the President's opinions and advice if [...] "the president has had substantial experience, is wise, knowledgeable and is trusted and respected by the PM". <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> one who [...] "commands little or no respect from the PM", then his influence would likely be [...] "limited". However, the President must keep these discussions confidential, or risk losing the confidence of the Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|The second lady's {{visibility}} in {{the public}} sphere has been a somewhat recent development. Although the role of the First Lady as White House hostess dates {{from the beginning of the}} republic (and was typically filled by another member of <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> family <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> unmarried or a widower), with a few exceptions, it was generally not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that vice-presidential wives took on public roles that attracted significant media attention.|$|R

50|$|However, {{there is}} no clear {{procedure}} for a declaration of incapacity other than the self declared incapacity; thus <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>were</b> to fall under a severe illness, and refused or were unable to sign a message to Congress spontaneously declaring his incapacity, {{there is no}} straightforward constitutional provision specifying the procedure required for the presidential impediment to be recognized. It is speculated that, if an incapacity were to exist, and if no spontaneous self declaration took place, it would fall to Congress to recognize such incapacity, but no procedure or quorum is clearly established.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} two weeks, Nasution presided over a busy MPRS General Session. Under his Chairmanship, the MPRS took {{measures}} such as banning Marxism-Leninism, revoking Sukarno's life presidency, and ordering a legislative election to be held by July 1968. The MPRS General Session also increased Suharto's power by officially ordering him to formulate a new cabinet.

50|$|The Constitution of the Dominican Republic {{has been}} amended many times, {{and in some}} {{instances}} the office of <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> had <b>been</b> eliminated to later be recreated.
