Roughness at scale larger than nanoscale will improve the wettability and penetration by adhesive, which can reduce material loss in <b>finishing</b> <b>machines</b> [19]. The typical roughness profiles of untreated and THM wood samples are presented in Fig.  3. It can be observed that in general, THM treatment with higher pressure yielded in smoother sample surface. Figure  3 also suggests that THM treatment improved the roughness parameters of the samples surface, which are shown in Table  3. Table  3 shows that THM process causes a considerable decrease in all roughness parameters with increasing CR, in comparison with untreated wood.

A new equipment, which combines the typical {{features of the}} drag <b>finishing</b> <b>machines</b> to hold the workpiece with the moving abrasives of fluidized beds, was designed. The equipment was validated by performing several experimental tests varying rotary speed and processing time. The evolution of the surface morphology of the workpieces, their mass loss and dimensional accuracy after processing were assessed after each finishing step. The designed equipments allowed to finish {{with a high level}} of accuracy and in short time range the brass rings. Material removals and out-of-tolerances of the workpieces could be limited once the appropriate settings of the process were selected. Low energy requirements, lack of any residuals after processing and facile operations make the fluidized bed assisted drag finishing industrially sustainable and very promising in several manufacturing domains. © 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

The grasping elements, formed by properly designed vacuum cups, have been developed according to a theoretical approach aimed at determining the optimal dimension of the vacuum area, in function of the porosity of the leather.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{precision}} mechanical components such as bearings, fuel injectors and gears, which are made of hardened steels, and have to be machined to a high degree of precision. Because of the stringent performance and functional requirements for these components, surface quality in terms of surface topography, microhardness, microstructure, and residual stresses must be specified and achieved through the appropriate manufacturing process sequence. The availability of hard cubic boron nitride (CBN) cutting tools has opened up the possibility of achieving these requirements by a <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process, while requiring little or no grinding. A study has been made of the nature of surfaces of M 2 high speed steel produced by <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> with CBN tools. This has involved measurement of forces, surface finish, residual stresses, form errors and metallurgical changes associated with CBN turning of hard steels. The force measurements have enabled a characterization of the mechanics of the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process in terms of the mechanical and thermal loads. It is found that the specific energy for machining M 2 steel is around 7 Joules/mm 3 which is ten times smaller than that found in grinding. Using forces, an estimate has been made of the friction coefficient at the tool-chip interface and the shear plane temperature. The surface finish and form measurements show that roughness values down to 0. 13 μ m Ra, and straightness, roundness, cylindricity, and parallelism values of 1 μm or smaller can be attained through the proper selection of process parameters. Various aspects of machining residual stresses have been investigated such as the effect of process parameters on the stress state, principal stresses, repeatability of the process in the context of residual stress generation and the evolution of residual stresses from heat treatment through to <b>finish</b> <b>machining.</b> A qualitative correlation has been established between work surface temperature and the residual stress state, just as in the grinding of hardened steels. The effect of process parameters on microhardness, microstructure and chip formation has also been investigated.
