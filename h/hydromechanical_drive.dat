40|$|Participation of Polish {{military}} contingent in peach a nd stabilization missions {{resulted in}} {{the need for new}} vehicles. Special vehicles – multiaxle ones of good protection abilities and high motion dynamics – have to be adjusted to operation in vari ous climate and terrain conditions. The work presents operation conditions of the wheeled armoured carriers resulting from the execution of required tasks. Threats resulting from driving on unpaved roads and wildern ess have been presented as well as their influence on the motio n dynamics, technical condition of vehic le chassis, durability and reliability. I t is particu larly important for th e passenger safety. A mathematical vehicle model, imitating special multiaxle vehicle, have been presented. Calculation abilities of original numerical software for the analysis of vehicle traction char acteristics have been presented. Mechanical and <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles can be analysed. Examples of calculation results, illustrated on the diagrams, have been also included. Influence of selected technic al – structural parameters on a multiaxle vehicle has been shown. Their influence on traction characteristics and dynamic loads affecting the vehicle, its internal equi pment and the passengers has been estimated...|$|E
40|$|Heart {{disease is}} the {{principal}} {{cause of death in}} most industrialised countries. In the U. S. A. for example, 2. 3 million individuals suffer from chronic heart failure, with an annual increase in numbers of 17 %. It is estimated that 17, 000 to 35, 000 of them per year will die from this disease if they are not given either a heart transplant or an artificial heart. Unfortunately, the numbers of heart donors cannot meet the demand for transplantation, and, at present, the artificial heart is a prohibitively expensive alternative. The total artificial heart (TAH) intended for the total replacement of the natural heart is still some years away from realisation. However, the ventricular assist device (VAD) which is used temporarily to maintain an ailing heart is available now, although only in restricted numbers due to difficulties in processing the biocompatible materials used during manufacture. Consequently, such devices are expensive, costing anywhere from AUS$ 30, 000 for the pump head to AUS$ 200, 000 for a complete system. In this study, the Australian designed $quot;Spiral Vortex$quot; VAD was used to investigate fabrication techniques for use in the eventual cost-effective manufacture of a pump head costing approximately AUS$ 4, 000. A second VAD originally designed at the Kolff Laboratory, University of Utah, U. S. A. was also used for comparative evaluation. The hard-shell Spiral Vortex VAD is intended to be used outside the body, while the soft-shell Kolff VAD has the advantage of being implantable for long-term use. They were cast from epoxy resin and vacuum formed from polyurethane, respectively. Several units of each were fabricated, including 60 of the Kolff VAD, for use in vitro and in vivo experiments. From these experiments it was found that both the Spiral Vortex and Kolff VADs could be fabricated to quality controllable standards. The Kolff VAD was used exclusively in chronic animal experiments, and was able to sustain sheep and goats for periods of up to five weeks. Furthermore, it became evident that techniques used in fabrication of the Kolff VAD could be adopted for use in the mass production of the Spiral Vortex VAD. The two other areas investigated in this study were the prosthetic heart valves and drive systems used for an artificial heart. A high percentage of the cost of an artificial heart is accounted for by the inflow/outflow valves. The trileaflet valve used in the Kolff VAD, which mimics the natural heart valve, was fabricated using inexpensive vacuum-forming techniques. Quality control was found to be adequate, with good flow characteristics which could be maintained for several weeks in animal experiments. Both the Spiral Vortex and Kolff VADs are pulsation pumps which require a pneumatic driver unit. This driver is the single most expensive component in a VAD system, costing upwards of AUS$ 150, 000. The theoretical efficiency of a compact <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> unit was investigated using a test rig to simulate an original design based primarily on proprietary components. Results obtained so far indicate that the proposed driver can operate only under limited conditions {{as a result of its}} severe reduction in size. By adopting mass production techniques wherever possible in the fabrication of the VAD (pump head) and valves, and by reducing the cost and size of the driver unit, it may therefore be possible to produce a cost effective ventricular assist device system...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality and}} costs of a machine are already {{influenced}} significantly in the early development phases. In most instances it is nessesary {{to fall back on}} a model of the machine in question - the so-called "virtual machine" - for accuratly defining attainable quality parameters during this development phases. Based on the example of forming machines with <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>drives,</b> this paper presents four subject areas for the use of model-assisted methods during the planning phase {{as well as in the}} subsequent phases such as commisioning or quality determination...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{electrical}} systems use a three-phase, 400 HZ, AC Bus {{supplied by}} engine driven generators. In {{an effort to}} simplify and improve the production of AC power for aircraft and to {{eliminate the need for}} <b>hydromechanical</b> constant-speed <b>drive</b> (CSD), a number of systems have been devised for producing 400 HZ three-phase electric power using electronic circuitry. This has been made possible by some of the major advances in solid-state technology developed in recent years. One of these systems is a DC-Link converter, which has a variable input frequency but a constant output frequency. This offer a viable alternative to the CSD as means of providing a constant frequency power supply from an aircraft generator. The ease of replacement and repair, the reduction in servicing needs, and the ability to locate the components of the electrical systems through the aircraft all combine to bring about a considerable reduction in the maintenance time required. This thesis discusses aircraft generating systems, variable speed constant frequency systems (VSCF) and the principle of the static frequency converter. The operation and design of a 1 KVA three-phase PWM inverter and its associated control circuitry to produce 400 HZ AC is described in detail. Finally a design of a power harmonic filter is given...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives the}} dynamic {{analysis}} of a <b>hydromechanical</b> transmission (HMT) <b>drive</b> train with regeneration and independent wheel torque control of a hydraulic hybrid passenger vehicle. From this analysis, we formulate the HMT control system, which {{is made up of}} high, mid and low-level control systems. The high-level consists of a state of charge management and the mid-level translates the storage requirement specified by the high-level into desired internal speed and gear ratio to be executed by the low-level. In this paper we focus on the lowlevel control analysis and design, where the actuation authority to regulate the internal speed variable comes from either the engine (mode 1) or the hydraulic system (mode 2). Experimental studies show good tracking performance of the proposed control systems and enable our vehicle system to be driven in the proposed HMT architecture...|$|R
