40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focus on}} noncooperative iris recognition, i. e., {{the capture of}} iris images at large distances, under less {{controlled}} lighting conditions, and without active participation of the subjects. This increases the probability of capturing very heterogeneous images (regarding focus, contrast, or brightness) and with several noise factors (iris obstructions and reflections). Current iris recognition systems are unable to deal with noisy data and substantially increase their error rates, especially the false rejections, in these conditions. We propose an iris classification method that divides the segmented and normalized iris image into six regions, makes an independent feature extraction and comparison for each region, and combines each of the dissimilarity values through a classification rule. Experiments show a substantial decrease, higher than 40 percent, of the false rejection rates in the recognition of noisy iris images.

Two closely coupled algorithm optimization techniques, {{referred to as the}} prime subspace periodicity transform (PSPT) and circular periodicity transform (CPT), are developed that significantly reduce computational complexity while enable the extraction of a wide spectrum of periodic features. The proposed PSPT-CPT algorithms lead to a parallel and resource-sharing VLSI architecture.

The explosive growth in database complexity combined with demand for fast analysis make the proposed framework a promising solution.

The results show accuracy estimated at 98 % when using 500 randomly selected images from the UBIRIS. v 2 partial database, and estimated at 97 % in a Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation (NICE. I) in an international competition that involved 97 participants worldwide involving 35 countries, ranking this research group in sixth position. This accuracy is achieved with a processing speed nearing real time. ^ The second part of this dissertation presents an innovative segmentation and recognition approach using video-based iris images. Following the segmentation stage which delineates the iris region through a novel segmentation strategy, some pioneering experiments on the recognition stage of the less-constrained video <b>iris</b> <b>biometrics</b> have been accomplished. In the video-based and less-constrained iris recognition, the test or subject iris videos/images and the enrolled iris images are acquired with different acquisition systems. In the matching step, the verification/identification result was accomplished by comparing the similarity distance of encoded signature from test images with each of the signature dataset from the enrolled iris images. With the improvements gained, the results proved to be highly accurate under the unconstrained environment which is more challenging. This has led to a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0 % and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 17. 64 % for 85 tested users with 305 test images from the video, which shows great promise and high practical implications for <b>iris</b> <b>biometrics</b> research and system design. ...|$|E
