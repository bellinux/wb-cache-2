40|$|The grass-parasitic ascomycete; ergot (Claviceps purpurea (Fr.)

During the Medieval Ages, <b>ergot</b> infection <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> (Secale cereale L.) was a cause of extensive epidemics with high mortality rate, characterised by painful convulsions and gangrene <b>of</b> limbs. <b>Ergot</b> extracts {{have been used in}} traditional medicine for a long time, and several isolated specific alkaloids as well as semi-synthetic derivates of these have proved to be useful remedies in modern medicine.

5000|$|Trehalose, {{also known}} as mycose or tremalose, is a natural alpha-linked {{disaccharide}} formed by an α,α-1,1-glucoside bond between two α-glucose units. In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an <b>ergot</b> <b>of</b> <b>rye,</b> [...] and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from trehala manna, a substance made by weevils, and named it trehalose. It can be synthesised by bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrate animals. It is implicated in anhydrobiosis—the ability {{of plants and animals}} to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. It has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food and cosmetics. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles, by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/rehydration cycle. Trehalose is not an antioxidant, because it is a non-reducing sugar and does not contain nucleophilic groups in its molecule. However, it was reported to have antioxidant effects.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the various triptan {{derivatives}} have been accepted as the most effective available agents for relieving migraine attacks. Prior to that, {{for a period of}} half a century, ergotamine was the only 2 ̆ 7 specific 2 ̆ 7 available for this purpose. In 1918, Stoll had isolated it from the various alkaloids present in extracts of the sclerotia of the fungus Claviceps purpurea (ergot), which grow on rye and, to a lesser extent, on other grasses. By 1925 ergotamine was beginning to be used to treat migraine attacks. However, as ergotamine was present in extracts of ergot, which had been used to treat migraine first, In Italy in 1862, and then by Edward Woakes (11868) in England, and after him by Albert Eulenburg in Germany (1883), the drug had actually come into unrecognised use for the disorder {{more than half a century}} before ergotamine itself was known to exist. Unfortunately, because of ergotamine 2 ̆ 7 s chemical and pharmacokinetic properties, extracts of <b>ergot</b> <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> were incapable of producing consistent therapeutic results, so that general acceptance that the first specific substance for migraine treatment existed had to wait until pure ergotamine was available for administration.

50|$|Peel {{had good}} timing {{getting into the}} ergot business, because {{supplies}} in the United States had been subject to disruption.

In an effort to ensure his supply of raw materials, Peel began a campaign to educate farmers on the importance <b>of</b> <b>ergot.</b> Eli Lilly and Company, one of Peel's major customers, also assisted in this effort by providing publicity. Universal Laboratories began receiving considerable amounts <b>of</b> ergotic <b>rye,</b> which was stored in a grain elevator in downtown Dassel.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} (60 Co) on the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> war determined using a chick growth assay. In vitro irradiation increased significantly the solubility <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> solids in water. Total protein (N X 6. 25) was not changed appreciably by irradiation but its {{solubility in water}} was increased. Compared with non-irradiated <b>rye,</b> the pH <b>of</b> irradiated <b>rye</b> suspension in water was reduced. In vitro digestibility <b>of</b> irradiated <b>rye</b> protein determined by a mixture of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and peptidase was increased. Solubility <b>of</b> carbohydrate from <b>rye</b> in water was increased and viscosity of a water extract was decreased by irradiation. In vitro a-amylolysis of water extracts of the grain indicated no beneficial effect of gamma irradiation for a-amylase activity. In vitro enzymatic digestibility of a diet containing 62. 55 % irradiated rye was enhanced by a combined pepsin-pancreatin treatment over a non-irradiated rye containing dye. Dry feces, expressed as percentage of dry matter consumed, were less for chicks fed irradiated rye diets than for those fed nonirradiated rye diets. The nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>rye,</b> based on a chick growth assay, was significantly increased by gamma irradiation (60 Co). Irradiation <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> decreased nitrogen and mineral excretion by chicks in relation to intake of these nutrients...|$|R
