An example of this word naming task is the Boston Naming Test, which has been used on various studies that examine the bilingual lexical access.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{can be useful}} for drying wood for {{construction}} and wood fuels such as wood chips for combustion. Solar is also used for food products such as fruits, grains, and fish. Crop drying by solar means is environmentally friendly as well as cost effective while improving the quality. The less money <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a product, the less it can be sold for, pleasing both the buyers and the sellers. Technologies in solar drying include ultra low cost pumped transpired plate air collectors based on black fabrics. Solar thermal energy is helpful {{in the process of}} drying products such as wood chips and other forms of biomass by raising the temperature while allowing air to pass through and get rid of the moisture.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit. The sidereal month is the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one complete orbit around Earth {{with respect to the}} fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.|$|E

25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone.

This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift {{in the way we}} approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

500|$|Talk of a {{potential}} sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release, but several outstanding issues precluded such a production. There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator. The production of James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns. Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures. Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems, Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar, head of Carolco, to bid for the rights: [...] "I reminded Mario that this is something that we've been looking for four years, and that it should be him that should go all-out, no matter what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this deal."
