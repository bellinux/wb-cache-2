25|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo. His process for composing the music consisted of him reading the game's story, {{to get an}} as full as possible understanding of the setting and the character personalities. He considered his first impressions of the game's emotional flow and events to be very important: he would write them down together {{with the kind of}} music he would want to use for each scene, and keep them in mind when composing the music. He said that this approach, while taking longer than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> designated songs to various places in the game, made for higher quality music with a better relation to the game's worldview.|$|E
500|$|While at the Strawberry Fields Festival in Canada in April 1970, band manager Shep Gordon {{contacted}} producer Jack Richardson, who {{had produced}} hit singles for the Guess Who. [...] Richardson was uninterested in producing the Alice Cooper band himself, {{and sent the}} young Bob Ezrin in his place. [...] Cooper recalled the junior producer as [...] "a nineteen-year-old Jewish hippie" [...] who reacted to meeting the outlandish band [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> opened a surprise package and found a box full of maggots".|$|E
500|$|H. W. Boynton, {{writing in}} The Atlantic in 1903, commented {{that only a}} century earlier {{children}} had had to be content with the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress, Paradise Lost, and Foxe's Book of Martyrs. But in his day [...] "A much pleasanter bill of fare is being provided for them". Boynton argued that with Just So Stories, Kipling did for [...] "very little children" [...] what The Jungle Book had done for older ones. He described the book as [...] "artfully artless, in its themes, in its repetitions, in its habitual limitation, and occasional abeyance, of adult humor. It strikes a child {{as the kind of}} yarn his father or uncle might have spun <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> happened to think of it; and it has, like all good fairy-business, a sound core of philosophy".|$|E
50|$|Matt {{explains}} to them how he rescued {{them and they}} conclude that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a psionic power: the ability to influence the optic nerves of anyone whose {{attention is focused on}} him. When he is excited or frightened, people focused on him are compelled to contract the pupils of their eyes, and thereby lose that focus to the point of short-term memory loss - even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> threatened them with a weapon.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought that}} he heard an answer, but was not certain, and again dashed forward, almost as speedily as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> but <b>just</b> started.|$|R
25|$|In the {{old school}} they use now for the Village Hall, below the clock that has stood always at one minute past ten, hangs a small dusty {{painting}} of a horse. He stands, a splendid red bay with a remarkable white cross emblazoned on his forehead and with four perfectly matched white socks. He looks wistfully out of the picture, his ears pricked forward, his head turned as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> noticed us standing there.|$|R
500|$|The game's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo, and features [...] "geometric music" [...] {{because of the}} game's theoretical and science fiction elements. Prior to composing the music, he read through the game's story, to understand the setting and each character's personality as much as possible. He would write his impressions of the plot, {{with a focus on}} the [...] "emotional flow" [...] and the events that occur throughout the story; he valued his first impressions as very important for this. According to Abo, this method takes longer time, but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to the game's world than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> designated different songs to different points of the game. Because he enjoyed the story, the music strongly reflects Abo's own musical tastes. The opening and ending themes of the PlayStation Portable version, titled [...] "Sen Oku no Hoshikuzu Furasu Yoru no Sora" [...] and [...] "Hokorobishi Hana", respectively, were performed by the band Asriel.|$|E
500|$|For the music, Nakazawa and the game's {{producer}} {{determined the}} amount and variety of tracks based on the budget and the game's content, and told Abo {{what kind of music}} they were imagining for the game. Sasanari was knowledgeable in music, so he helped Nakazawa with discussing the soundtrack. When composing the soundtrack, Abo used what he described as [...] "geometric music" [...] because of the theoretical and science fiction elements. Prior to composing the music, he read through the game's story, to understand the setting and each character's personality as much as possible. He would write his impressions of the plot, with a focus on the [...] "emotional flow" [...] and the events that occur throughout the story; he valued his first impressions as very important for this.

50|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} face of a smiling woman leaning up against a young cavalier who is holding a flask above his head as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> taken it from her, apparently as part of a joke. With his left hand, the young cavalier is holding the head of a dog. The couple stand before a partially open curtain which shows a room beyond with a smiling man carrying a dish and a burning fireplace behind him.|$|R

2500|$|According to Mordechai Eliyahu, {{former chief}} Rabbi of Israel, {{his meeting with}} Schneerson [...] "covered all {{sections}} of the Torah" [...] Eliyahu said [...] "The Rebbe jumped effortlessly from one Talmudic tractate to another, {{and from there to}} Kabbalah and then to Jewish law... It was as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> finished studying these very topics from the holy books. The whole Torah was an open book in front of him".|$|E
2500|$|... "having {{dismounted}} {{from his}} horse in an unguarded moment, [...] was espied and {{singled out by}} an old lady of Amazonian proportions, just from the wash tub, who, wiping her hands and mouth on her apron as she approached, seized him around the neck with the hug of a bruin, and bestowed upon him half a dozen kisses that were heard by nearly every man in the command, and when at length she relaxed her hold the Colonel looked as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come out a vapor bath".|$|E
2500|$|Baruch's grave {{became the}} subject of later legends. According to a Muslim {{tradition}} reported by sources including Petachiah of Ratisbon, an Arabian king once ordered it to be opened; but all who touched it fell dead. The king thereupon commanded the Jews to open it; and they, after preparing themselves by a three days' fast, succeeded without a mishap. Baruch's body was found intact in a marble coffin, and appeared as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> died. The king ordered that it should be transported to another place; but, after having dragged the coffin a little distance, the horses and camels were unable to move it another inch. The king, greatly excited by these wonders, went with his retinue to Muhammad to ask his advice. Arrived at Mecca, his doubts of the truth of the teachings of Islam greatly increased, and he and his courtiers finally accepted Judaism. The king then built a [...] "bet ha-midrash" [...] on the spot from which he had been unable to move Baruch's body; and this academy served for a long time as a place of pilgrimage.|$|E
60|$|He {{ordered the}} waiter {{to bring him}} the pie and the soup at the same time, {{and it seemed to}} Seth as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> but <b>just</b> begun before his partner was finished.|$|R
50|$|Jim {{was praised}} by the judges {{for a simple}} design with good execution. The judges did tell him that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> added <b>just</b> a little more depth to his outline, <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> wowed even more.|$|R
60|$|Plums, having ministered to his appetite, {{stretched}} {{himself at}} full length on the ground, {{and it seemed}} to Joe as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> but <b>just</b> assumed that position when his heavy breathing told that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fallen asleep.|$|R
2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his face as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,â Leno said. âYou hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I donât want to see all the fighting and all the 'Whoâs better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it isâConan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E

60|$|Tom, tired out by his active day, {{fell asleep}} soon, and slept soundly; {{it seemed to}} him as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> only <b>just</b> come to bed, when he waked to see his mother {{standing}} by him in the gray light of early morning.|$|R
60|$|For once I {{think the}} FÃ¼rstin miscalculated consequences. I think I should have engaged myself to Rachel before I went to America {{if it had}} not been for the FÃ¼rstin's revelation, but this so tore me that I could no longer go on falling in love again, {{naturally}} and sweetly. No man falls in love <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> been flayed.... I could no longer think of Rachel except as a foil to Mary. I was moved to marry her by a new set of motives; to fling her so to speak in Mary's face, and from the fierce vulgarity of that at least I recoiled--and let her go as I have told you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poke, at your service." [...] He {{pronounced}} the word slowly and very distinctly, as <b>if</b> what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> {{said of his}} self-confidence were true.

60|$|And {{he looked}} around with a smile as {{pleasant}} as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> invented a new sewing-machine.|$|E

60|$|Oliver tried, and {{admitted}} {{that it was}} good; then, observing that little Oscar <b>had</b> <b>just</b> finished his fourth venison steak, he politely handed him the trencher.

6000|$|... "You'll {{appreciate}} it later--you'll {{appreciate it}} very soon. I shall {{like you to}} appreciate it," [...] Mr. Carteret went on as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a <b>just</b> vision of the way a young man of a proper spirit should feel. Then he added; [...] "Your father would have liked you to appreciate it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>he</b> could <b>have</b> known <b>just</b> at {{that moment}} how long the cruise would really last it is very certain <b>he</b> would not <b>have</b> {{expressed}} such a desire.|$|R

60|$|Mordaunt {{was not at}} all austere, {{although}} he was not effeminate or luxurious.

It had been a bitter disappointment that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> inherited very little of Joseph Dearham's property, although none of his relations suspected this, for Mordaunt knew how to hide his feelings. He was stubbornly conservative and held tenaciously the traditions of his class.|$|R
