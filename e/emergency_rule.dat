5|$|In November 2007, Musharraf instituted <b>emergency</b> <b>rule</b> for {{six weeks}} (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, {{a few days after}} Bhutto's {{departure}} for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. <b>Emergency</b> <b>rule</b> was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the <b>Emergency</b> (<b>rule</b> by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E

The political role of Sharif returned to the fore after Benazir Bhutto's return a month earlier.

25|$|His {{party had}} joined a {{coalition}} led by PPP but the alliance had been strained by differences over {{the fate of}} judges Musharraf dismissed last year and over how to handle the unpopular president. Sharif won much public support for his uncompromising stand against Musharraf and for his insistence the judges be reinstated. The coalition successfully forced Musharraf's resignation. He also successfully pressured Zardari for the reinstatement of judges removed by Musharraf in <b>emergency</b> <b>rule.</b> This led to the courts cleansing Sharif of a criminal record rendering him eligible to re-enter parliament.|$|E
25|$|The Provisional Constitutional Order Judges case (shortened to PCO Judges case), {{refers to}} ongoing Pakistan Supreme Court cases begun in 2009. On 3 November 2007, then-President Pervez Musharraf {{declared}} a Provisional Constitutional Order, which {{declared a state}} of emergency and suspends the Constitution of Pakistan. Under this emergency law, all High court judges, including the Supreme Court justices, were asked to take oath under this Provisional Constitutional Order. Those who didn't were placed under effective house arrest. A seven-member bench issued a restraining order on the same day, barring the government from implementing <b>emergency</b> <b>rule</b> and urging other government officials to not help do so.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 the Indira Gandhi {{government}} proclaimed <b>emergency</b> <b>rule</b> in India, thereby suspending {{fundamental rights}} and curtailing {{the freedom of}} the press. This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of malpractices in the election. Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders including Gandhian Jayaprakash Narayan, were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them. RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution of Bangladesh {{established}} a unitary, Westminster-style parliamentary republic with universal suffrage. A {{member of parliament}} supported by a parliamentary majority (usually {{the chair of the}} largest party) is the Prime Minister, the head of government and of the cabinet. Bangladesh is governed by a 350-member parliament, known as the Jatiyo Sangshad. Three hundred of its members are elected on a first past the post basis, and 50 seats are reserved for female nominees by political parties. Although parliamentary elections are scheduled every five years, they have often been delayed by political crises, <b>emergency</b> <b>rule</b> or martial law. The President of Bangladesh is the head of state. From 1975 to 1990 the presidency had executive powers, but it has been reduced to a largely-ceremonial role by the Twelfth Amendment to the constitution.|$|E
25|$|Being at the {{forefront}} of Indian politics for decades, Gandhi left a powerful but controversial legacy on Indian politics. The main legacy of her rule was destroying internal party democracy in the Congress party. Her detractors accuse her of weakening State chief ministers and thereby weakening the federal structure, weakening independence of judiciary, and turning the cabinet into a joke by vesting power in her secretariat and her sons. Gandhi is also associated with fostering a culture of nepotism in Indian politics and in India's institutions. She is also almost singularly associated with the period of <b>Emergency</b> <b>rule</b> and the dark period in Indian Democracy that it entailed. Her actions in storming the Golden Temple alienated Sikhs for a very long time. She remains the only woman ever to occupy the office of the Prime Minister of India.|$|E

The original date for the judges to be restored was 30 April 2008 but after no decision on which basis both the PPP and the PML-N could bring back the judges collapsed, Nawaz Sharif announced a new date on 12 May 2008. As the deadlock expired, Nawaz Sharif met with Asif Ali Zardari in London on 11 May 2008 in the final set of discussions on how to resolve the deadlock, with no effective decision made, upon his return to Islamabad, Mr Sharif announced that his federal ministers would leave the federal government tomorrow {13 May 2008} and effectively left the coalition government.

25|$|In October 1999, {{after the}} Kargil Conflict {{ended with the}} {{unconditional}} withdrawal of the Pakistani forces from the Indian controlled peaks, the Pakistan Army overthrew a democratically elected government once more, resulting in additional sanctions being applied against Pakistan, leading to General Pervez Musharraf coming to power in a bloodless coup. However, this time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif sacked Musharraf {{when he was on}} his way to Pakistan from Colombo. He dismissed him as Chief of Army Staff and appointed General Ziauddin Butt to that position instead, when Musharraf's plane was in the air. That was not enough, the plane was not allowed to land at the airport in Karachi and barricades were erected on the runway. The corps commanders acted swiftly across Pakistan, particularly in Karachi and Islamabad. Brigadiar Muzaffar Usmani took control of the airport in Karachi and arrested the then Inspector General of Sindh Police, Rana Maqbool Ahmed. Musharraf stepped down as President in August 2008. On 30 July 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that Musharraf's imposition of <b>emergency</b> <b>rule</b> was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 2009, {{after hearing}} {{constitutional}} petitions concerning PCO judges, {{the appointment of}} judges, and the steps taken in declaring the 2007 Pakistani state of emergency, the Pakistan Supreme Court decided the declaration of <b>emergency</b> <b>rule</b> by Musharraf to be unconstitutional under Article 279 of the Constitution of Pakistan. The Supreme Court also declared the steps taken in declaring {{the state of emergency}} to be null and void, and specifically stated that the removal of judges was unconstitutional and illegal. This included the removal from office of the Chaudhry and other justices. The appointment of Dogar and of all justices between 3 November 2007 and 24 March 2008 was deemed unconstitutional. Musharraf's increase to the number of justices, accomplished through a finance bill, was declared unconstitutional, and the number of justices was set at seventeen. The verdict did not change the legality of the new government, nor that of the presidential oath taken by Zardari. The verdict also referred the issue of the Provisional Constitutional Order judges to the Supreme Judicial Council.|$|E
25|$|After India {{attained}} its {{freedom in}} 1947, Government of India lowered {{to the level}} of a despotic rule during the time of Emergency of 1975.

It was at this time Yuhanon Marthoma wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India criticizing emergency and requesting to follow ideals of constitution. There were strong rumors about anticipatory arrest of Yuhanon Marthoma. M.M.Thomas another Marthoma Syrian and theologian advocating Ecumenism of Churches had written many articles on the emergency situation. In spite of criticism from many Christian group, M.M. Thomas made his point in depicting the basic fact of violation of human rights and stressed the need of the democratic organization of the people for the realization of social justice in India. Marthoma Church also passed a resolution against Emergency and for restoration of democracy privately. Marthoma church was also closely associated with the land for the landless and home for the homeless movement much before Acharya Vinoba Bhave initiated Bhoodan movement.|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{question}} the relationship between security and liberty {{that lies at the}} heart of the current debates on European counter-terrorism policies. It analyses the statements reported in the press made by defenders of the <b>emergency</b> <b>rules</b> thesis and their rivals in the UK and France from September 2001 to June 2003. The findings reveal that, in both cases, the legitimation of the emergency measures rests upon a set of sovereignty-related arguments that reframe the notion of freedom and the place of human rights in contemporary democracies. The defenders of the human rights thesis denounce the reframing of civil liberties but fail to address the freedom issue. One of the key features of the counter-terrorism policies adopted by EU countries in the post-September 11 th era is the emergence of executive-inspired legislation that restricts individual freedoms in the name of the war against terrorism (EU Network of Independent Experts, 2003). Current counter-terrorism measures rest upon variously extended parallel legal frameworks that provide, namely, for the creation of terrorism-related criminal offences; for the extension of the powers of law enforcement agencies; for special procedures for the prosecution of terrorism-related offences; and for exceptional forms of detention. Although widely criticised, these temporary emergency measures have been further strengthened following the Madrid bombings, 1 creating a de facto permanent state of emergency that establishes the insecurity of the law in the name of the security of the state (Manessis, 1980). In this paradoxical situation, <b>emergency</b> <b>rules</b> are introduced to cope with exceptional circumstances but are gradually transformed into permanent elements of domestic legal frameworks (Payé, 2004, p. 62). Yet, this is not a new phenomenon. Since the Second World War, at least, European states faced with terrorism have usually dealt with it by introducing special laws and, occasionally, by declaring a state of emergency to provide fo...|$|R
