25|$|From the outset, {{money market}} funds fell under the {{jurisdiction}} of the SEC as they appeared to be more like investments (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> (cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers). Although {{money market funds}} are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, let the buyer beware attitude.|$|E

2500|$|Shanxi merchants ( [...] Jinshang) {{constituted}} a historical phenomenon {{that lasted for}} centuries from the Song to the Qing Dynasty. Shanxi merchants ranged far and wide from Central Asia to the coast of eastern China; by the Qing Dynasty they were conducting trade across {{both sides of the}} Great Wall. During the late Qing Dynasty, a new development occurred: the creation of piaohao (...) , which were essentially banks that provided services like money transfers and transactions, <b>deposits,</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans.</b> After the establishment of the first piaohao in Pingyao, the bankers in Shanxi dominated China's financial market for centuries until the collapse of Qing Dynasty and the coming of British banks.|$|E
40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> services is to view the differentials between actual <b>loan</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rates <b>and</b> appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> services. ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> services prices. This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> services prices in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> service prices which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual service prices in the Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI). Consequently, the paper concludes that {{it would be difficult to}} incorporate indirectly measured <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> service prices in the CSPI. * The author would like to thank Professor Takanobu Nakajima of Keio University for his useful comments during th...|$|R
