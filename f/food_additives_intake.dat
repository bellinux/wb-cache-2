40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine, on the animal model, the effect of modifi cation of diet {{composition}} and administration of selected food additives on water balance in the body. Material and methods. The study was conducted with 48 males and 48 females (separately for each sex) of Wistar strain rats divided into four groups. For drinking, the animals from groups I and III were receiving water, whereas the animals from groups II and IV were administered 5 ml of a solution of selected food additives (potassium nitrate &ndash; E 252, sodium nitrite &ndash; E 250, benzoic acid &ndash; E 210, sorbic acid &ndash; E 200, and monosodium glutamate &ndash; E 621). Doses of the administered food additives were computed taking into account the average intake by men, expressed per body mass unit. Having drunk the solution, the animals were provided water for drinking. Results. The mixture of selected food additives applied in the experiment was found to facilitate water retention in the body both in the case of both male and female rats, and differences observed between the volume of ingested fl uids and the volume of excreted urine were statistically signifi cant in the animals fed the basal diet. The type of feed mixture provided to the animals affected the site of water retention &ndash; in the case of animals receiving the basal diet analyses demonstrated a signifi cant increase in water content in the liver tissue, whereas in the animals fed the modifi ed diet water was observed to accumulate in the vascular bed. Conclusion. Taking into account the fact of water retention in the vascular bed, the effects of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> <b>intake</b> may be more adverse in the case of females...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Food</b> <b>Additives</b> <b>Intake</b> Model (FAIM) was {{developed}} {{as a tool for}} estimating chronic exposure to food additives. It {{was developed}} by EFSA to support applicants in the estimation of exposure to a food additive and to harmonise the submission of the related data. FAIM is based on food consumption data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. The exposure estimates calculated {{with the use of the}} FAIM tool are based on summary statistics of individual raw food consumption data available in the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database (EFSA Comprehensive Database), which was built from most recent national dietary surveys provided by competent organisations in the European Union‟s Member States. The FAIM tool includes food consumption data for children, adolescents, adults and the elderly for a total of 26 different dietary surveys carried out in 17 different Member States. The nomenclature used in the FAIM tool is the one used within the Food Classification System (FCS) presented in Part D of Annex II to the Regulation (EC) No 1333 / 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives. The FCS consists of four levels; however, for the sake of simplicity, data at level 2 of the FCS are in general provided within the FAIM. The food nomenclature used in the FAIM consists of 65 food groups The quality of the food consumption data included in the EFSA Comprehensive Database mainly depends on the methods used to collect individual food consumption data at national level. In the Guidance on the use of the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database in Exposure Assessment (EFSA, 2011 a) and in the scientific publication by Merten et al. (2011), the methodologies used within the available dietary surveys and their impact on exposure assessment are described in detail. For the purposes of FAIM, MPLs of use as set in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333 / 2008, and maximum reported use levels as provided by industry are the use levels mainly considered by EFSA in the application of the FAIM in exposure assessments. Concentration data from other sources i. e. analytical/monitoring data could also be considered, where suitable and available. The exposure estimates calculated with FAIM provide information on the mean and high level exposures per age class (toddlers, children, adolescents, adults and the elderly), summarised per dietary survey and food category. The approach used for estimating high percentiles of exposure from all contributing food sources is based on the assumption that an individual might be a high-level consumer of one food category only, and would be an average consumer of all the remaining food groups. This method consists of adding the highest high level of exposure from one food category (calculated for consumers only) to the mean exposure values for the remaining categories (calculated for the total population). Furthermore, the model provides information on the food groups contributing to the total mean exposure (% of contribution per food group and per dietary survey), with focus on the main contributing food groups (> 5 % of total exposure) across the EU countries (range of min-max of % contribution across dietary surveys) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} {{of a range}} of simple conceptual models designed specifically for the estimation of <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> <b>intakes</b> using probabilistic analysis was assessed. Modelled intake estimates that fell below traditional conservative point estimates of intake and above 'true' <b>additive</b> <b>intakes</b> (calculated from a reference database at brand level) were considered to be in a valid region. Models were developed for 10 <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> by combining <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> data, the probability of an additive being present in a <b>food</b> group and <b>additive</b> concentration data. <b>Food</b> <b>intake</b> and <b>additive</b> concentration data were entered as raw data or as a lognormal distribution, and the probability of an additive being present was entered based on the per cent brands or the per cent eating occasions within a food group that contained an additive. Since the three model components assumed two possible modes of input, the {{validity of}} eight (2 ^ 3) model combinations was assessed. All model inputs were derived from the reference database. An iterative approach was employed in which the validity of individual model components was assessed first, followed by validation of full conceptual models. While the distribution of intake estimates from models fell below conservative intakes, which assume that the additive is present at maximum permitted levels (MPLs) in all foods in which it is permitted, intake estimates were not consistently above 'true' intakes. These analyses indicate the need for more complex models for the estimation of <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> <b>intakes</b> using probabilistic analysis.

Several <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> (e. g. carboxymethylcellulose, carrageenan, maltodextrin) have been shown to cause intestinal inflammation, mucosal barrier alterations, and microbiome dysbiosis in animal models, therefore it has been hypothesized that these additives may be associated with disease activity in children with CD. This project evaluated <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> exposure in children with CD in an effort to understand <b>additive</b> <b>intake</b> among this population and to establish a methodology for future studies. A cohort of 135 children (ages 8 - 21) enrolled in a Philadelphia Children’s Hospital trial evaluating bone health completed 24 -hour dietary recalls at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. All recorded foods from the baseline visit were compiled into a database and organized into 31 distinct food groupings, and 4, 965 unique foods were examined for the presence of soy lecithin, carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum, maltodextrin, titanium dioxide, carrageenan, aluminosilicates, and polysorbate- 80 by evaluating ingredient labels. The additives with the highest number of mean exposures per day were soy lecithin (2. 71 ± 1. 34), xanthan gum (0. 96 ± 0. 72), maltodextrin (0. 95 ± 0. 77), and carrageenan (0. 58 ± 0. 63). The foods with the fewest mean exposures per day included titanium dioxide (0. 09 ± 0. 21), polysorbate- 80 (0. 07 ± 0. 16) and carboxymethylcellulose (0. 05 ± 0. 13), while no exposures to aluminosilicates were found. Of the eight additives of interest, participants were exposed to an average of 2. 7 different additives per recall day and experienced an average of 5. 4 total additive exposures per recall day. In evaluating the 24 -hour dietary recall results, grouping foods, and determining <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> content, unique recommendations were created for future studies assessing <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> exposure and the relationship to CD disease activity, including more precise 24 -hour recall intake and utilizing available ingredient databases...|$|R

In this research attitudes towards <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> were analyzed in three focus groups: common consumers, doctors and food industry experts by qualitative market research methods. It was observed that most consumers knew very little about <b>food</b> <b>additives.</b> While recognizing their technological importance, they are afraid of their health impairing effects. However, this fear is mostly theoretic; other quality characteristics and the price play a much more significant role when choosing foods.

40|$|Abstract. Food {{safety is}} an {{important}} issue related to the government regulatory authorities, food industry and food consumers. And the increasing use of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> has become a matter of public and administrative concern, so an extensive safety evaluation on <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> must be carried out {{and the use of the}} <b>additives</b> in <b>food</b> should be controlled by law. In the United States, the Congress has entrusted the FDA with the responsibility to ensure that new additives to be used in foods and the foods the consumers purchase are safe. This paper discusses the supervision and management system of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> in the United States. The conclusion is that FDA has developed a scientifically rigorous, sound and dependable system to assure the safety of food, thus a new <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> must be approved by FDA before it can be used in food.
