40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on the value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value. Two different sources <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management are investigated: short-term discretionary accruals and long-term discretionary accruals. A contribution {{of this paper}} is the development of models to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. The effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on the relative value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value depends on the source <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management. When examined independently, earnings management via either short-term or long-term discretionary accruals reduces the valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> but has no impact on the value relevance of book value. Examination of both measures simultaneously reveals the differential impact of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. Earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals has no impact, whereas earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals reduces the valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and increases the value-relevance of book value. This supports the conclusion that earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on the value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Prior studies provide mixed propositions {{on whether}} {{earnings}} levels or earnings changes provide the better explanatory power for variations of stock returns {{and whether the}} time-series behavior <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> affects the value relevance <b>of</b> both <b>earnings</b> variables. This paper aims to compare the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels with that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes in the return-earnings relations. Design/methodology/approach - The unobservable components model is used to estimate permanent and transitory components <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> Findings - The finding shows that the proxy ability <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes for unexpected earnings is sensitive to a firm's time-series earnings permanence property and is unstable and noisy when earnings contain predominantly transitory components, but that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels is not. The results support earnings levels are a stable and better value relevant proxy in the return-earnings relations. Research limitations/implications - The findings imply that the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels {{is important in the}} research relating to earnings components, earnings innovations, and equity valuation, especially when <b>earnings</b> permanence is <b>of</b> interest. Practical implications - The results provide a new understanding on the role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in many business decisions such as executive compensations, institutional investment and conservative accounting where they often involve the choice of using levels and/or changes <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> variables in making decisions. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the accounting literature by providing a new insight into the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in the return-earnings relations.

This study included an investigation of the moderating effect of intellectual capital on (i) the relationship between earnings and book value (individually and aggregate) and market price, and (ii) the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and cost <b>of</b> equity. The data for the study were based on annual financial reports, Datastream and Bloomberg of firms from the Technology, Trading and Services, Consumer Products and Hotel sectors listed in the main board of Bursa Malaysia from 2006 to 2010. The study employed multiple and moderated multiple regression to analyse data. The results showed that, firstly, firms with high quality <b>of</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> benefit more from lower cost of equity and there is no relationship between conservatism <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and cost <b>of</b> equity, Secondly, the moderating of intellectual capital has an effect on the relationship between earnings and book value with market price.
