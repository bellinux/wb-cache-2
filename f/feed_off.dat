5|$|Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their {{excrement}} {{is important}} for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E

5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
25|$|While Princess Cadence was {{preparing}} {{to be married to}} Shining Armor(the captain of the Royal Guard of Canterlot, and the brother of Twilight Sparkle) in Canterlot, changelings (creatures that can change their physical form, and <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the love of others) covertly snuck into the town. The changeling queen, Queen Chrysalises, imprisoned and impersonated Cadence, so she could <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> Shining Armor's love for her. Twilight Sparkle discovered this just before the imposter of Cadence and Shining Armor could be wed. She then freed Cadence, allowing Cadence and Shining Armor to defeat the Changelings with the power of their love, {{with the help of the}} bearers of the Elements of Harmony (the Mane 6 ponies).|$|E
25|$|The {{cracks and}} crevices in the wattle's bark are home for many insects and invertebrates. The rare Tasmanian {{hairstreak}} butterfly lays her eggs in these cracks, which hatch to produce caterpillar larva attended by ants (Iridomyrmex sp.) that <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the sweet exudates from the larva.|$|E

25|$|Acid {{rain has}} a much less harmful effect on the oceans. However, acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise, making it more {{difficult}} for different coastal species to create their exoskeletons that they need to survive.

25|$|Private or not, UT and Texas A {{were dead}} set against {{replacing}} Arkansas. The NCAA sanctions and Arkansas' departure made the conference appear broken to fans in Texas. Texas and Texas A's leaderships felt {{the conference was}} inherently flawed, with too many mouths to <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> too few TVs. Adding a single school {{was not going to}} change that dynamic, it would only create the public perception of a healed conference and prolong UT and Texas A's suffering.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to simulate the sense antenna by tapping a <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the loop {{it would have been}} associated with. This is normally accomplished by placing a center tap in the tuning inductor, and then feeding that signal into the circuit as if it were from another antenna. Since the center-tap causes the signal from both vertical sections to be balanced, it creates a signal similar to a single vertical mast. When used with aperiodic windings, the sense circuit has to be wired into the receiver side, along with the tuning capacitor.|$|E
25|$|German and Soviet armies {{relied heavily}} on work horses to pull {{artillery}} and supplies. Horses {{seemed to be a}} cheap and reliable transport especially in the spring and fall mud of the Eastern Front but the associated costs of daily feeding, grooming and handling horses were staggering. In theory horse units could <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the country, but grazing on grass alone rendered horses unfit for work and the troops had no time to spend searching the villages for fodder. Hard-working horses required up to twelve pounds of grain daily; fodder carried by the troops made up a major portion of their supply trains.|$|E

Here {{there are a few}} pubs and restaurants that <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the traffic traveling to and from Faneuil Hall and the Garden. The residential areas that have been rebuilt are primarily upscale highrises, though the neighborhood is currently making strides to re-establish the close knit community that once was. The West End Museum currently has a permanent exhibition outlining the history of the neighborhood and its residents, while the West End Community Center hosts classes and events, in addition to putting on the annual West End Children's Festival.|$|E
25|$|The first labyrinthodonts {{were all}} large to {{moderately}} large animals, {{and would have}} suffered considerable problems on land despite their members ending in toes rather than fin-tayes. While they retained gills and fish-like skulls and tails with fin rays, the early forms can readily be separated from Rhipidistan fish by the cleithrum/scapula complex being separate from the skull to form a pectoral girdle and carry {{the weight of the}} front end of the animals. They were all carnivorous, initially eating fish and possibly going ashore to <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> washed up carrion of sea animals caught in tidal ponds, only later turning into predators of the large invertebrates of the Devonian at the waters edge. The various early forms are for convenience grouped together as Ichthyostegalia.|$|E
25|$|The second {{trophic level}} (primary consumers) is {{occupied}} by zooplankton which <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the phytoplankton. Together with the phytoplankton, they form {{the base of the}} food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|E

50|$|The Cape sugarbird is a {{specialist}} nectar feeder {{when it comes}} to <b>feeding</b> <b>off</b> Proteaceae. Its long, sharp beak is used to reach the nectar of a variety of species of protea with its long brush-tipped tongue. The staple diet of this sugarbird is nectar; however, it will also eat spiders and insects. The characteristic strong winds in the Cape may make <b>feeding</b> <b>off</b> protea heads difficult, but the Cape sugarbird has adapted to this with the development of sharp claws.|$|R
25|$|The female {{blue-footed booby}} lays {{two or three}} eggs. Eggs are laid about four to five days apart. Both male and female take turns {{incubating}} the eggs, while the non-sitting bird keeps watch. Since the blue-footed booby {{does not have a}} brooding patch, it uses its feet to keep the eggs warm. The incubation period is 41–45 days. Usually, one to two chicks are hatched from the two to three eggs originally laid. The male and female share parental responsibilities. The male will provide food for the young {{in the first part of}} their life because of his specialized diving. The female will take over when the demand is higher. Chicks <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> the regurgitated fish in the adult's mouth. If the parent blue-footed booby does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{way they}} find Patrick Danville, a young man imprisoned by someone who calls himself Joe Collins but is really a psychic vampire named Dandelo. Dandelo feeds off the {{emotions}} of his victims, and starts to <b>feed</b> <b>off</b> of Roland and Susannah by telling them jokes. Roland and Susannah are alerted to the danger by Stephen King, who drops clues directly into the book, enabling them to defeat the vampire. They discover Patrick in the basement, and find that Dandelo had removed his tongue. Patrick is freed and soon his special talent becomes evident: his drawings and paintings become reality. As their travels bring them nearer to the Dark Tower, Susannah comes {{to the conclusion that}} Roland needs to complete his journey without her. Susannah asks Patrick to draw a door she has seen in her dreams to lead her out of this world. He does so and once it appears, Susannah says goodbye to Roland and crosses over to another world.|$|E
