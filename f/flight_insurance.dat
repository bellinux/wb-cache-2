40|$|The {{publication}} of Judge Keeton 2 ̆ 7 s important article “inventing” the reasonable expectations doctrine in 1971 is notable for infusing {{a good deal}} of intellectual energy into the study of insurance law, particularly judicial decisions about insurance coverage. Keeton 2 ̆ 7 s article, which deduced from cases the principle that courts tended to interpret policies to vindicate the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured, has rightly been viewed as a milestone. It clarified an area of law long seen as inconsistent or result-oriented. It spurred additional important scholarship in the area and elevated insurance caselaw from something of a backwater to at least a respectable academic discipline, even if not quite an exciting one. But as important as Keeton 2 ̆ 7 s article was, it to some extent perhaps even understated the extent to which courts had long utilized the reasonable expectations concept without mentioning it by that name. It also tended to underplay the degree to which courts construed insurance contracts in light of their intended purpose, irrespective of whose expectations were involved. Most important for purposes of this Symposium topic, Keeton 2 ̆ 7 s seminal article cited Lachs v. Fidelity 2 ̆ 6 Casualty Co. of New York only in passing. The short treatment seems unusual in that Lachs is a most interesting case from the then-largest state in the nation, a case that utilized not only the reasonable expectations principle, but also an array of contract concepts designed to illuminate the apt meaning of the insurance policy. Furthermore, Keeton arguably mischaracterizes Lachs as a case that is straining to construe the insurance policy to provide coverage. He suggested that Lachs had “tortured” the policy language and in effect applied a sub silentio strong form of the reasonable expectations doctrine that protects policyholder expectations {{even in the face of}} clear contrary policy language. To be sure, Lachs utilized the reasonable expectations approach and did so nearly twenty years before Keeton coined the term and introduced the reasonable expectations concept to the academic world. But Lachs used other contract construction tools to appropriately find coverage and, in my view, hardly “tortured” the policy language. Rather, Lachs took a comprehensive, context-sensitive, eclectic approach to policy construction, an approach in which policyholder expectations were a part of the analysis rather than a trump card for the policyholder. Unfortunately, Lachs has long been either overlooked or treated as something of a novelty case because of its subject matter - “vending machine” or “self-service” <b>flight</b> <b>insurance.</b> On closer examination, Lachs provides not only an interesting (if tragic) fact pattern but also illustrates with understated grace the appropriate approach to resolving insurance coverage disputes with consideration to questions of text, party intent, purpose, expectations, and public policy...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} the evaluation of the economic risk bound to the insurance of an aircraft is presented. Such process is built from two potentially complementary methodologies, used for risk and fault analyses (ERC and FMECA), combined with a cooperative agreement between <b>flight</b> and <b>insurance</b> companies, that meets the recent tendencies on aviation Safety Management Systems. This innovative procedure should allow the periodic update of the economic risk bound to the insurance while lowering the general costs for risk evaluation thus resulting in a lower insurance premium and increased competitiveness...|$|R

50|$|From December 2008 {{through to}} October 2010 Viking Airlines {{operated}} regular flights to Iraq, serving Erbil, Baghdad and Sulaymaniyah from London Gatwick Airport connecting in Sweden before continuing {{on to their}} destination in Iraq. Gatwick based Cabin Crew would operate these flights. The services into Iraq were operated via Sweden in conjunction with sanctions at the time preventing aircraft from the United Kingdom flying into the war torn country, {{for a short time}} during that period flights were stopped due to a report of a Swedish aircraft being shot at during take off from Sulaymaniyah International Airport, however restrictions were lifted and <b>flights</b> resumed, life <b>insurance</b> policies were granted to the Cabin Crew and Flight Crew operating these flights due to the high risk zone in which the aircraft were flying into, they were also only able to operate services into the country during the night and had to ensure that all aircraft lights were switched off inside and out to make the aircraft less visible during approach.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{problems}} {{are only part}} of the difficulty of achieving a price per pound of less than $ 1, 000 to low earth orbit (LEO). Insurance and range costs can each cost more than $ 1, 000 per pound if no effort is put into reducing them. Achieving low cost to LEO also requires solving problems associated with the economic limitations of chemical rockets, lack of business planning, and failure to identify a workable path that will take us from an immature to a mature launch industry. A mature launch industry would exhibit low cost to LEO and significant flight rates by reusable vehicles with long lifetimes. When today’s factors, limitations, and reality denials are combined, we believe that they prolong the difficulties of achieving low cost, routine flights to LEO. In other words, we end up inadvertently supporting the status quo.
