The 2010 Global Hunger Index ranks the situation as “alarming”. Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger, although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight. Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment; limited access to <b>farm</b> <b>inputs,</b> extension services and credit; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} multi-faceted {{problems}} in Occidental Mindoro's economy. In rice farming, {{the biggest issue}} confronting the producers is {{the high cost of}} production. This is attributed mainly to the spiraling prices of <b>farm</b> <b>inputs.</b> A study concluded that from 1997 to 2003, the cost of production rose by 47 percent, while the income derived from marketing rice maintained 1997 levels. There are also confused reports that the average production rate has declined due to the reduced application of necessary farm chemicals. In street language, this means that the farmers simply cut the amount of inputs because they cannot afford the high capital requirements of following all the recommended inputs in the farming calendar.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{estimate}} {{the economic impact of}} <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing and value-added agricultural processing in the North Dakota economy. Economic impacts for these agriculturally-linked sectors are in addition to those for direct agricultural (crops and livestock) production. This analysis will provide state-level estimates of key economic indicators including levels of business activity, retail trade, personal income, secondary employment and tax revenues associated with these agriculturally-linked sectors. A survey of the 76 <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing and 160 agricultural processing firms in North Dakota was conducted to obtain expenditure patterns. In-state outlays by these firms were allocated to sectors of the economy and divided by their respective number of employees to obtain a per employee expenditure for each economic sector. Per worker expenditures for the <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing sector were multiplied by that sector's total employment (2, 418) to estimate the industry's total expenditures. Agricultural processing per worker outlays were also multiplied by total employment (7, 104) to estimate the total expenditures for this sector. Total expenditures for <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing were estimated to be $ 146. 8 million in 2002, and total agricultural processing expenditures were $ 361. 9 million. These expenditures were applied to the North Dakota Input-Output Model to estimate economic impacts. The North Dakota Input-Output Model is a tool for tabulating and describing the linkages or interdependencies between various industrial groups within an economy. This model uses interdependence coefficients, or multipliers, to measure the total level of economic activity generated in each sector from an additional dollar of expenditures in a given sector. Total business activity generated from the in-state expenditures amounted to $ 482. 2 million for the <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing firms and $ 1, 201. 4 million for agricultural processing firms, giving a total of $ 1, 683. 6 million. Retail sales for the <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing and agricultural processing firms were $ 105. 2 million and $ 243. 2 million, respectively. Total retail sales were estimated to be $ 348. 4 million for the two agriculturally-linked sectors. Another indicator of the economic impact, personal income, was estimated to be $ 174. 3 million for <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing, $ 380. 9 million for agricultural processing, with a total of $ 555. 2 million. In addition to the 9, 522 direct workers employed by these firms, another 16, 272 secondary (indirect and induced) jobs were created. State revenue was enhanced by $ 27. 4 million as the result of sales and use, personal income, and corporate income tax collections resulting from the business activity for the <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing and agricultural processing firms. economic impact, <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> manufacturing, value-add agricultural processing, economic indicators, Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} the farm-level impacts of Malawi’s <b>Farm</b> <b>Input</b> Subsidy Programme (FISP) on fertiliser use and maize yields {{in central and}} southern Malawi. Using multiple rounds of panel data and an instrumental variable regression strategy to control for endogenous selection into the subsidy programme, we found positive and statistically significant correlations between participation in the FISP and fertiliser-use intensity. The results are broadly robust to the inclusion of previous fertiliser intensity to control for household-specific differences in fertiliser use. We combined these results with those from a maize production function to calculate programme-generated changes in average maize availability, accounting for estimated subsidy-induced changes in crop area. Our findings have implications for the way input subsidy programmes are designed and implemented. Key words: <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> subsidy programme; maize yields; fertiliser use; Malawi 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relative importance of five drivers of adoption for 15 different precision agricultural services offered by <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> suppliers. These drivers included: expected benefits, firm resources, strategic fit, technology complexity/uncertainty and market conditions. ^ To test these hypotheses, 357 Midwestern <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> suppliers were interviewed by phone and asked questions about precision technology, firm and customer characteristics, and general market conditions. Firms were also asked whether or not they offered each of 15 different precision services. ^ Adoption of precision services was measured by the firm 2 ̆ 7 s adoption status of the 15 individual precision technology service offerings. Adoption was first explored by looking at the drivers impacting adoption of individual precision service offerings using logit models. Exploratory factor analysis was then used to identify bundles of precision technology services. Four primary bundles were identified: a basic precision bundle, a manual variable rate application bundle, a single nutrient controller-driven application bundle (liquid nutrients and pesticides), and a multi-nutrient controller-driven application bundle. The results suggested yield monitor sales/rental and satellite imagery were not part of any of the bundles. Firms were then categorized by their adoption level of each bundle: no adoption, partial adoption or complete adoption. These adoptions categories were then explored for each bundle using multinomial logit models to determine which drivers were motivating adoption. ^ Those <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> suppliers who were facing strong competitive pressure, had developed their own long-term strategy, and had significant firm-level resources were most likely to adopt a complete basic precision bundle. Cooperatives were especially likely to offer a full service precision package. Firms who did not have a focused long-term strategy and who were more uncertain about the technology but who did perceive some benefits for precision technology tended to adopt components of the bundle. This implies manufacturers of precision components need to be aware of the competition level in the local market, firm-level strategy and organizational structure as they market their equipment to <b>farm</b> <b>input</b> suppliers. ...|$|R
