5|$|As <b>few</b> <b>other</b> {{persons in}} the Confederate {{government}} were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department, {{as well as the}} navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was very much the product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and Hydrography. Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title {{until the end of the}} war. A <b>few</b> <b>other</b> functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.|$|E
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had <b>few</b> <b>other</b> employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men to serve in the Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E
5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with <b>few</b> <b>other</b> sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, a {{wilderness}} study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% {{of the area}} of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation. Unlike a <b>few</b> <b>other</b> parks, Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as wilderness, but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision. Ninety-three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as wilderness, even though it has not been officially designated.|$|E

The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It became a leading grassroots action group promoting environmental protection, natural resource conservation and the safeguarding of life in all its forms.|$|E
