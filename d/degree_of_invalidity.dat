Among these the surgical treatment of heart-valvedysfunctionby valve replacement has become possible (Murray, 1956; Ross, 1962; Starr and Edwards, 1961; Barrett-Boyes, 1964). Today transplantation of valves is an accepted surgical treatment next to corrective valve surgery and conservative therapy in the management of heart-valve disease. Heart-valve replacement becomes a necessity in case of congenital or aquired stenosis or insufficiency, if conservative treatment cannot prevent a progression of the lesions.

30|$|Based on some evidence, IELTS LCT {{suffers from}} some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> (Aryadoust 2012). Along the same line, in our study, the two methods, i.e., Mantel Haenszel method {{detected}} 15 DIF items and CDM flagged at most 12 {{and at least}} 6 DIF items (TablesÂ  9 and 10). A closer look at sub-sections reveals all items (six DIF items) of diagram labeling flagged by MH and just two DIF items of diagram labeling were detected by CDM; of course, {{the difference in the}} number of DIF items detected by these two methods needs some reflection. That is to say, based on MH, diagram labeling revealed six items (all items) and CDM just two DIF items on diagram labeling. Also, on gap filling, seven DIF items (half of the items) and five DIF items were detected by MH and CDM, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Vasospasm is the {{principal}} cause of a poor outcome in patients with SAH. The aim {{of the study is}} to establish the effect of the therapeutic modalities on vasospasm, to establish morbidity and mortality of patients with SAH, as well as the causes of the poor outcome. The study is prospective and analyzes 192 patients treated at C ward of the INH KCS. Vasospasm incidence was 22. 40 %. Therapeutic modalities depended on prescribed quantities of colloid solutions and MgSO 4 solution. Differences in the vasospasm incidence between the groups were not significant, the reason probably being that the maximal doses of colloid solutions were prescribed mostly to the higher graded patients. In patients who received MgSO 4 vasospasm was less frequent, but not statistically significant (11. 11 % vs. 23. 56 %) Of 192 patients, 78. 1 % completely recovered, 9. 9 % had a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> and 12. 0 % did not survive.

40|$|Feature-based process {{planning}} has been popular in academia and industry owing to its ability rigorously to integrate design and manufacturing. In {{spite of this}} benefit, feature-based {{process planning}} {{has been difficult to}} implement because {{it is not easy to}} extract even simple features from the design data automatically and efficiently. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to construct the temporal precedence relationships among the extracted features with regard to plan alternatives and sequence options. The objective here is to present elaboration and validation methodologies for AND/OR graph-based non-linear process plans that help users construct, validate or modify a controller-friendly process plan easily and efficiently. An elaborated process plan created by a CAPP or an experienced process planner should be validated with respect to various validation criteria, such as the shape of a finished part, feature interaction, feature interference, feature manufacturability and flexibility for shop floor control. For each validation criteria, the invalid indicator matrix proposed here can quantify the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> of the process plan. The invalid indicator matrix will help the process planner fix and refine rapidly the elaborated process plan. The methodologies proposed will save cost and time in the production of a controller-friendly process plan. Initial results are promising. 1...|$|E

Sample consisted of 112 subjects {{with a mean age}} of 53 years, divided between Lazio (48 %) and Sicily (52 %) e with <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> worker <b>invalidity</b> inclusive among 30 % and 100 %.

Infliksimab was injected intravenously (average dose of 6, 8 Â± 2, 3 mg/kg/per injection) by a standard scheme (0, 2, 6, and each 8 following weeks). Together with antibcytokine therapy children still received immunity depressants (cyclosporine, methotraksat, leflunomid, peroral glucocorticoids). Research results prove that infliximab has pronounced hormone like anti-inflammatory effect after first injection for both patients with early and delayed articular JA variants. It reserved articular syndrome, reduced laboratory activity parameters, reduced <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> improved quality of patients' lives. At the same time after three first infusions 88 % of patients with system JA the effect was neutralized, articular syndrome activity increased, laboratory activity parameters increased, systematic indicators recurred. On the contrary, patients with both early and delayed JA variant the medication quickly and efficiently reduced activity of articular syndrome, personal estimations of pain levels and disease activity. Index of life quality was significantly improved, much like the selfbservice ability. Medication effect was registered after the first injection and remained over the whole period of observation (up to two years) in 61 % cases of delayed and 93 % of early articular ja variant. Thus, infliximab therapy is a reasonable, efficient and safe treatment of patients with both early and delyed articular JA. Key words: juvenile arthritis, infliximab, treatment. </strong...|$|E

40|$|It can be {{concluded}} from the Tele 2 judgment of 2016 that i) the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> the provisions {{contained in a}} directive inevitably affects the legal act of transposition into the legal order of the Member States, and ii) a Member State cannot resort to the Directive 2002 / 58 to impose a generalised and undifferentiated obligation to conserve traffic and location data following the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> Directive 2006 / 24.

The purpose of this thesis is the analysis and explanation of the process of foundation and incorporation of a business company and the closely associated question of acting on behalf of the company before its incorporation, i. e. before it acquires legal personality. This thesis also seeks to clarify the dilemma <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> business companies.

50|$|As to {{the power}} of the court to give {{retrospective}} effect to its order <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> Sachs held that a general declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> with retrospective effect would impact negatively on good government by rendering unlawful all searches conducted after the retrospective date specified. This could create considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of proceedings conducted on the basis of evidence obtained as a result of such searches. It could also give rise to delictual claims by persons subjected to searches and seizures after that date, adding further burdens to a health budget already under considerable strain.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{application}} was in substance an application for direct access.

50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{declaration}} <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> had to be made retrospective to 27 April 1994, but that it did not apply to any completed transfer of ownership to an heir who had no notice of a challenge to the legal validity of the statutory provisions and the customary-law rule in question. Furthermore, anything done pursuant to the winding-up of an estate in terms of the Act, other than the identification of heirs in a manner inconsistent with this judgment, would not be invalidated by the order <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> in respect <b>of</b> section 23 of the Act and its regulations.|$|R

50|$|Judicial {{review is}} an {{incident}} {{of the separation}} of powers, under which courts regulate and control the exercise of public power by the other branches of government. Before the interim Constitution came into force, in April 1994, the principles of judicial review were developed through the âcrucibleâ of the common law. Since the adoption of the interim Constitution, public power is controlled by the written Constitution, which is the supreme law. The common-law precedent continues to inform the law {{only to the extent that}} it is consistent with the Constitution. Consequently, there is only one system of law. Thus, orders <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> under the courtsâ powers of judicial review are orders <b>of</b> constitutional <b>invalidity.</b> If the order <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> relates to conduct of the President, section 172(2) of the Constitution requires that it be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.|$|R
