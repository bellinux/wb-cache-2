40|$|AbstractYucca GRAS-labelled {{saponins}} {{have been}} and are increasingly used in food/feed, pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries. Existing techniques presently used for Yucca steroidal saponin quantification remain either inaccurate and misleading or accurate but time consuming and cost prohibitive. The method reported here addresses {{all of the above}} challenges. HPLC/ELSD technique is an accurate and reliable method that yields results of appropriate repeatability and reproducibility. This method does not over- or under-estimate levels of steroidal saponins. HPLC/ELSD method does not require each and every pure standard of saponins, to quantify the group of steroidal saponins. The method is a time- and cost-effective technique that is suitable for routine <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses.</b> HPLC/ELSD methods yield a saponin fingerprints specific to the plant species.

This is the case of the maritime industries we analysed in this article. These decisions should not be based on current market circumstances but the expected circumstances when the decisions become effective in markets. Nobody actually knows exactly what will happen in the future, but the best way is to perform foresight and prospective futures studies. In this article, we discussed one promising way to do these kinds of prospective <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses.</b> This study and some other Finnish background studies, which have utilized the Boston Consulting Group framework, clearly show that the Delphi-BCG approach is suitable regional foresight and development tool.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{systematic}} error exists in sedimentation techniques used for measuring particle diameters. This intrinsic shortcoming overesti-mates sizes of fine particles and underestimates coarse particles, and thus decreases {{the spread of}} particle sizes as estimated by sieving and other methods. This paper develops a method for estimating the con-tact area between a particle and the fluid, which is critical in calcu-lating the nondimensional drag coefficient (CD). When a spherical par-ticle falls in noncompressible, thermally homogeneous, and static fluid conditions, CD {{is a function of}} the Reynolds number and the contact area of the particle. Beyond the Stokes range, CD varies with the par-ticle Reynolds number and the nature of the resistance. This theory is tested using glass spheres and natural eolian dune deposits falling in a still-air settling tube. Empirical equations for estimating CD values are developed. The measured aerodynamic-equivalent diameters of spher-ical particles equal their geometric diameters with a shape factor of unity. The aerodynamic-equivalent diameters of irregularly shaped particles are smaller than that of spherical particles for given geomet-ric diameters of particles having the same mass, volume, and density. The findings have wide applications in sedimentary, environmental, and <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses...</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{result of}} our efforts is the {{development}} and successful application of the theoretical model of laser induced plasma (LIP) that allows a back-calculation of {{the composition of the}} plasma (and the condensed phase) based on the observable plasma spectrum. The model has an immediate experimental input in the form of LIP spectra and a few other experimentally determined parameters. The model is also sufficiently simple and, therefore, practical. It is conveniently interfaced in a graphical user-friendly form for using by students and any laboratory personnel with only minimal training. In our view, the model opens up the possibility for absolute analysis, i. e. the analysis which requires no standards and tedious calibration. The other parts of this proposal (including plasma diagnostics) were somewhat subordinate to this main goal. Plasma diagnostics provided the model with the necessary experimental input and led to better understanding of plasma processes. Another fruitful direction we pursued was the use of the correlation analysis for material identification and plasma diagnostics. Through a number of computer simulations we achieved a clear understanding of how, where and why this approach works being applied to emission spectra from a laser plasma. This understanding will certainly improve the quality of forensic and <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses</b> where fast and reliable material identification and sorting are required...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{a number of}} approaches for the fabrication of prototype screen-printed electrochemical (bio) sensors together with selected applications {{in the areas of}} biomedical, environmental and <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses.</b> Novel methods of immobilizing the bio-recognition elements of the biosensors have been emphasized and it is clear that researchers are designing simpler methods of manufacture. One example of this has been the one-step fabrication of a glucose biosensor using a water-based carbon ink incorporating both mediator and enzyme. It is believed that portable electrochemical instruments will become more readily available allowing measurements to be made outside of the laboratory. In one example, the discussion has collaborated with several organizations to develop an automatic instrument for use with a biosensor to determine NH 4 + in sewage effluent. It is mentioned that there is a flexible hand-held electrochemical instrument on the market, which can be programmed to be used in a variety of voltammetric/amperometric modes in the field. Although the majority of biosensor applications described in this chapter are for single analyte detection, it is very likely that future directions will involve development of biosensor arrays for multi-analyte determinations. One example of this approach has been described in an earlier section, where five organophosphates could be monitored with an array of biosensors based on mutant forms of acetylcholinesterase from D. melanogaster. This array has considerable potential for monitoring the quality of food, such as wheat and fruit...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} has been to develop a {{computer}} based simulation model for the timber drying process in progressive kilns and to use this model for {{an analysis of the}} process, with special emphasis on energy and cost efficient drying. The software, TorksimLC, is based on the same principles as our corresponding models for batch kilns. In this way direct comparisons between different drying methods can be made. TorksimLC includes both the single stage and the both common types of two stage progressive kilns. The software has been verified and validated based on experimental results from drying tests in full scale. The model accuracy {{has been shown to be}} comparable to the accuracy of the corresponding models for batch kilns. It is judged that this accuracy is sufficient for <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses</b> at the sawmills. The analysis of the drying process has clearly shown that the temperature level, at which the drying is performed, has an utmost importance regarding both the energy consumption and the drying costs. Even a small increase in the temperature level has a positive effect. A comparison of different types of dryers has shown that two stage progressive kilns are more cost efficient than single stage kilns, although the energy consumption is about the same. Compared to batch kilns the progressive kilns require longer drying times but both the energy consumption and the drying costs are clearly lower. The progressive kilns have a good potential for both energy and cost efficient timber drying. Progressive kilns can not in all respects replace the batch kilns, but it seems that this potential is not fully utilised today.

40|$|The modern {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} a rapidly developing sector of the fisheries industry. Among the fish species reared in marine waters Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) shares a significant part. Nowadays, the largest salmon producing countries are Norway, Chile and Scotland. The common technology used in the salmon production is a sea cage, which is presented in a form of floating plastic rings or robust metal installations fastened to a barge. In both cases, the fish {{is placed in the}} net in the open sea, and therefore, production is highly dependent on the external factors, such as environmental conditions, disease and parasites presence. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have been used to supply smolts for further production of market-size salmon at sea. Nowadays, this system is suggested to provide the whole production cycle from smolt- to market-size in the closed environment with optimal biological conditions. Nonetheless, the existing projects require higher initial investment costs than the conventional net pen farm. In the present work, comparison analysis of net pen system and RAS has been performed {{on the basis of the}} economic analysis of salmon aquaculture farm suggested by Trond Bjørndal and Frank Asche in “The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture”, 2 nd edition (2011) and report “Profitability analysis of the NIRI technology for land-based salmon farming” (2008) by Krisin Roll, Arve Gravdal and Asbjørn Bergheim. The analysis includes compilation of biological and bio-economical models for the both systems. Missing or out-of-date information has been replaced by new data from additional sources such as research articles, industrial reports and expert opinions. The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are the main measures that have been used in analysis. The overall conclusion from the comparison has shown that RAS is around 12 mil NOK less profitable than net pen farm in ten years time horizon, while NPV in both cases is positive. However, other findings from the research revealed an unreliability of the scaling method in respect to RAS, without detailed description of the farm production capacity and equipment. Besides, investment costs estimation is dependent on many factors that are complex and require a thorough investigation. At the same time, in spite of scientific and <b>industrial</b> <b>analyses</b> show lower impact on the environment from RAS in comparison to the net pen aquaculture system, it may be questioned in terms of RAS location and power source use...|$|E

40|$|Service work {{is often}} (mis) {{represented}} within western sociology through hyperbolic language, as its increasing incidence and changing character {{is seen as}} symptomatic of profound social change. This paper argues that many recent empirical investigations into, and the dominant representations of, the service encounter (employment involving employee-customer interaction which is represented as a particularly 'new' form of work) exaggerate its novelty as 'cultural' work. Through a critical analysis of some recent empirical accounts of the service encounter and drawing upon one example from the author's own ethnographic research into service encounters within north- eastern England, {{it is argued that}} the dominant representations over-emphasise the cultural, and underplay both the economic and gendered, dynamics of the employment experience. More specifically, we argue that it is the active combination of 'the economic' and 'the cultural' - the way in which gendered demands for employees to develop particular norms, values, personalities and identities are embedded within inequitable economic relationships - which can shape the employment experience of service employees. Dominant representations of the service encounter also reject the contemporary relevance of 'traditional' <b>industrial</b> sociological <b>analyses</b> of employment relations. However, given the weak empirical foundations of 'the cultural turn', we argue that this contention cannot be supported. In fact, it is suggested that many 'traditional' <b>industrial</b> sociological <b>analyses</b> precisely examine the interplay between economic, gendered and cultural relations and therefore continue to have relevance for understanding contemporary employment. Finally, our arguments are located within debates about the cultural turn within the wider sociological discipline...|$|R
