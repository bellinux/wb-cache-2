40|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> {{actuated}} active <b>suspension</b> benefits {{active control}} and energy harvesting from vibration {{at the same}} time. However, the rotary type <b>electromagnetic</b> actuated active <b>suspension</b> introduces a significant extra mass on the unsprung mass due to the inertia of the rotating components of the actuator. The magnitude of the introduced unsprung mass is studied based on a gearbox type actuator and a ball screw type actuator. The geometry of the suspension and the actuator also influence the equivalent unsprung mass significantly. The suspension performance simulation or control logic derived should take this equivalent unsprung mass into account. Besides, an extra force should be compensated due to the nonlinear features of the suspension structure and it is studied. The active force of the actuator should compensate this extra force. The discovery of this paper provides a fundamental for evaluating the rotary type <b>electromagnetic</b> actuated active <b>suspension</b> performance and control strategy derived as well as controlling the <b>electromagnetic</b> actuated active <b>suspension</b> more precisely...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the model of}} the <b>electromagnetic</b> active <b>suspension</b> consisting of an electromagnetic actuator and a mechanical spring. Furthermore, the authors investigate the effects of two crucial parameters, which are the spring stiffness and actuator force, on performances of the suspension.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of hybrid and fully electric vehicles, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>suspensions</b> have shown {{great potential for}} capturing energy while offering high-level ride comfort. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop an electromagnetic-based vehicle suspension system that allows for regeneration of road-induced vibration energy and supplies better dynamics control. A small-scale proof-of-concept system consisting of a mass-spring-damper system, ball screw mechanism, and direct current (DC) machine was designed. The vibration energy in the mass-spring-damper system caused vertical motion of sprung mass and the ball screw mechanism to convert the translational motion into rotary motion, which resulted in the generation of back electromotive force of the DC machine. Systematic optimization methodologies were utilized to provide for selective adaption of suspension parameters, such as spring constant (rate) and damping coefficient, according to different road surface conditions, including harmonic and stochastic waveforms. By maximizing the average of power generation or minimizing the root-mean-square of the sprung mass’s absolute acceleration by selecting optimal parameters, the suspension allowed operation in either energy-oriented mode or control-oriented mode. Furthermore, a bandwidth enhancement technique utilizing cubic nonlinearities was demonstrated to improve the energy harvesting capability of the suspension system. A self-powered regenerative Skyhook control strategy was proposed to overcome the trade-off between passive control (insufficient control) and active control (external energy demand) for the suspension system...|$|R
