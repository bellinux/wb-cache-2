5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed {{to deal with}} {{at the time of}} his accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in a dire fiscal situation that Macrinus needed to address.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the <b>issues,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E

25|$|One {{exception}} to this came in 2005, {{when he was asked}} to testify before the Texas Legislature in support of proposals to extend technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He also supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making e-books available and by allowing schools to buy books at the local level instead of going through the state.

According to Nader, he asked John Kerry to choose any three of the issues and highlight them in his campaign; should Kerry meet these conditions Nader would not contest the election. On February 22, 2004, having not heard back from Kerry, Nader announced that he would run for president as an independent.|$|E

500|$|Thomas G. Melish was a {{prominent}} Cincinnati businessman, who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. [...] Melish was also a coin collector, {{who came up with}} an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control. At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. The result was the 1936 Cincinnati Music Center half dollar, an issue controlled by Melish and issued to commemorate a fiftieth anniversary that did not exist. Melish sold only a few coins at the issue price, which was high, keeping back most for later sale once scarcity drove the price higher. By 1936, the market for U.S. commemorative coins had become, according to Q. David Bowers, [...] "as hot as a volcano", and [...] "Congress gave [...] permission to have his own commemorative coins minted and to charge the public whatever he liked for them!" [...] Melish, who had friends in Congress, had in early 1936 also tried to get lawmakers to authorize other commemorative <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would control. [...] The only one of these that came to fruition was the Cleveland Centennial half dollar.|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B+". Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, was also {{relatively}} positive towards the episode. While calling the reveal of the rapist [...] "out of left field", {{he noted that}} there was some material in [...] "My Big Fat Greek Rush Week" [...] that pointed to this conclusion. In addition, he praised Parker rescuing Veronica and the start of the Dean O'Dell mystery, writing [...] "Rob quite cleverly threw the start of the new mystery into {{the tail end of the}} first one." [...] However, there were several plot <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found as well as that the nine-episode storyline didn't fully do the reveal justice, opining that Thomas and the crew had to rush to give the audience important information in this format. Cortney Martin of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the major roles played by Wallace, Mac, Weevil, Piz, and Parker in the episode, writing [...] "the show belongs to Veronica's sidekicks this week." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune gave praise as well. While being lukewarm regarding the season as a whole, she thought that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was [...] "appropriately suspenseful." [...] In addition, she enjoyed that Veronica was less sarcastic and contemptuous in the episode, in contrast to previous episodes of the season.|$|E

[...] In 1977, he became director of the newly created Resource Systems Institute of the East-West Center in Hawaii where he turned full time to work on understanding and influencing the interactions of energy, mineral, and food systems in the Asia-Pacific Region, themes he had developed in his books since the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|A {{prominent}} {{critique of}} Foucault's thought concerns {{his refusal to}} propose positive solutions to {{the social and political}} <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive—even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher Jürgen Habermas to describe Foucault's thinking as [...] "crypto-normativist", covertly reliant on the very Enlightenment principles he attempts to argue against. A similar critique has been advanced by Diana Taylor, and by Nancy Fraser who argues that [...] "Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives." [...] Likewise, scholar Nancy Pearcey points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: [...] " [...] states {{that it is impossible to}} attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cranston {{had very}} little {{political}} experience {{when he was first}} elected as governor of the colony upon the resignation of Walter Clarke in March 1698. [...] The <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> dealt with during his first three years in office were so critical, that the continued existence of the Rhode Island colony was at stake. [...] One of the major issues of his early tenure was that of piracy, as many privateers who were active in the recent war with France turned to piracy. [...] The crown wanted piracy stopped, while many colonists were sympathetic to the pirates, and Cranston had to make difficult political decisions to satisfy the home country on this issue. [...] Another ongoing issue was the disputed boundary between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies. [...] The Narragansett country was given to both colonies by their respective charters, creating many decades of friction. [...] During Cranston's tenure as governor, the dispute was finally ended, entirely in Rhode Island's favor.|$|E
