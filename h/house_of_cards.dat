5|$|Early reviews {{were largely}} positive, {{noting that the}} second season had a darker tone than the first. Molly Parker was praised as an {{addition}} to the cast.

The season earned thirteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and three nominations at both the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards.

5|$|Netflix {{had ordered}} two seasons of 13 episodes when {{it made its}} {{original}} commitment to the series in 2011.

Like the first season, the second season was largely filmed in the Baltimore area. Although production was publicized as being in Baltimore, Season 1 had based production in Harford County, Maryland, and season 2 also had its production office in Edgewood and a Joppa sound stage.

In last decade, four devastating earthquakes of world have been occurred in India, and low to mild intensities earthquakes are shaking our land frequently. It has raised the questions about the adequacy of framed structures to resist strong motions, since many buildings suffered great damage or collapsed. A number of multi-storey car parking structures in urban India are constructed at airports, railway stations, etc. in regular and irregular shape for architectural, aesthetic or economic reasons to reduce the problem of parking. The materials being used for the structures may be having same properties and in some times it may vary in strength, mass etc. To evaluate the performance of framed buildings under future expected earthquakes, a non-linear static pushover analysis has been conducted on a typical multi-storey car parking structure. To achieve this objective, a 3 D framed multi storey car parking structure (G+ 3) is modeled in SAP 2000 in which the structure is open in all stories with rigid floors. Such features are highly undesirable in buildings built in seismically active areas because of lesser mass of the structures, this has been verified in numerous experiences of strong shaking during the past earthquakes.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} iron oxide-montmorillonite and its structural stability test with various concentration of sulfuric acid were conducted. Synthesis {{was performed by}} treating Na-montmorillonite clay with oligocations of iron, followed by calcinating the intercalation compound of oligocations-montmorillonite at 200 oC for 24 hours. Calcined product was then characterized to determine the iron content, basal spacing and its porosities distribution. To test structural stability againts strong acid (i. e. sulfuric acid), the composites were dispersed into solution of sulfuric acid with various concentration, i. e: 1, 2 and 3 M for 24 hours. The characterization result, especially from x-ray-diffractometry analysis, demonstrated that modification of montmorillonite using iron (III) oxide produced so called <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>card</b> structure as indicated by its broad, low intensity reflection at 2 θ  = 5 - 6 o.
