50|$|In Algeria, {{the most}} {{important}} sources of government revenue have been oil and gas royalties. Taxation in Algeria has been streamlined through the replacement {{of a number of}} different taxes by a value-added tax (VAT), a personal income tax, and a corporate profits tax. The corporation tax was 45% on distributed profits and 20% on reinvested earnings. Many fiscal advantages have been granted to developing and expanding industries, especially to private investment. For <b>established</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> and commerce there is a tax on production (a single tax that was passed on to the consumer) and a tax on industrial and commercial activities.|$|E
50|$|With its newfound use in microbiology, agar {{production}} quickly increased. This production {{centered on}} Japan which produced {{most of the}} world's agar until World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II many nations were forced to <b>establish</b> <b>domestic</b> agar <b>industries</b> {{in order to continue}} microbiological research. Around the time of World War II, approximately 2,500 tons of agar were produced annually. By the mid-1970s, production worldwide had increased dramatically to approximately 10,000 tons each year. Since then, production of agar has fluctuated due to unstable and sometimes over-utilized seaweed populations.|$|R
25|$|Fianna Fáil's {{economic}} programme {{marked a}} sharp break with their predecessors in Cumann na nGaedheal. Instead of Free Trade, which benefited mainly substantial farmers, Fianna Fáil pursued the nationalist aim of <b>establishing</b> Irish <b>domestic</b> <b>industries,</b> which were protected from foreign competitors by tariffs and subsidies. Fianna Fáil made it mandatory for foreign companies {{to have a}} quota of Irish members on their boards. They also set up {{a large number of}} semi-state companies such as the Electricity Supply Board and the Turf Development Board. While this state-led strategy had some positive results, emigration remained high throughout this period, with up to 75,000 leaving for Britain in the late 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} {{renewable}} energy development in Spain is both a mixed and unfinished one. Under previous subsidies the country expanded its renewable base rapidly and helped <b>establish</b> a <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> in both wind turbine and solar energy. However, support was drastically cut back following the global financial crisis and new installations stagnated between 2012 and 2015. The debts incurred during the boom period have led to tougher and retrospective revisions of contracts to providers {{of renewable energy}} reducing returns considerably. In {{being one of the}} first-to-market countries, Spain faces the challenge of powerful competitors from countries such as Denmark, Germany and China and ironically a cheaper and more mature renewable energy sector which Spain itself helped to pioneer.|$|R
40|$|Fuel cells (FCs) are {{considered}} essential future energy technologies by {{developed and developing}} economies alike. Several countries, including the United States, Japan, Germany, and South Korea have established publicly funded R&D and market transformation programs to develop viable <b>domestic</b> FC <b>industries</b> for both automotive and non-automotive applications. Important non-automotive applications include large scale and small scale distributed combined heat and electrical power, backup and uninterruptible power, material handling and auxiliary power units. The U. S. FC industry is {{in the early stages}} of development, and is working to establish sustainable markets in all these areas. To be successful, manufacturers must reduce costs, improve performance, and overcome market barriers to new technologies. U. S. policies are assisting via research and development, tax credits and government-only and government-assisted procurements. Over the past three years, the industry has made remarkable progress, bringing both stack and system costs down by more than a factor of two while improving durability and efficiency, thanks in part to government support. Today, FCs are still not yet able to compete in these markets without continued policy support. However, continuation or enhancement of current policies, such as the investment tax credit and government procurements, together with continued progress by the industry, appears likely to <b>establish</b> a viable <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> within the next decade...|$|R
50|$|On April 15, 2005, the Canadian Minister of Trade, Jim Peterson, {{announced}} {{that the federal government}} would provide Canadian softwood lumber associations with $20 million in compensation for their legal expenses stemming from the dispute with the United States. That same year, another NAFTA Chapter 19 panel reviewed a determination made by the USITC that the U.S. lumber industry was under a threat of injury due to Canadian imports. Since the United States ceded jurisdiction to the World Trade Organization, it was necessary for the U.S. government to <b>establish</b> that a <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> was suffering injury, or faced a threat of injury, before countervailing duties can be imposed. The NAFTA panel found the USITC's determination invalid. In addition, the panel made the controversial decision to deny the USITC to reopen the administrative record, ordering the USITC to issue a negative determination based on the existing record. Unlike the panel during the Lumber III stage, this panel's decision was unanimous. However, the U.S. government challenged its decision before an extraordinary challenge committee, which, on August 10, 2005, issued a unanimous decision against the United States, finding that the NAFTA panel's determination was not sufficiently invalid to require vacatur or remand, under the standards of NAFTA.|$|R
50|$|These {{quotations}} of Adam Smith instruct {{that foreign}} trade will just give half the encouragement to <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> or the productive labor of the nation, but favoring domestic commerce will assist <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> in ways foreign commerce could not.

30|$|Regarding {{the other}} variables, the {{estimated}} coefficient in each region regression model is nearly consistent, {{which indicates that}} capital, labor, and R&D have a relatively stable influence on the <b>domestic</b> <b>industry</b> added value.

40|$|The {{question}} {{whether and how}} a country’s institutional environment affects unilateral and bilateral venture capital flows in an international context has so far received little attention in the academic literature {{although it has been}} the subject of much political debate. Using data on VC investments in 55 countries from 1995 to 2008, this dissertation contributes to that debate by examining the effect of a country’s legal, regulatory, and fiscal environment on VC investments. In addition, I explore whether governments can <b>establish</b> a <b>domestic</b> VC <b>industry</b> or attract foreign VC funding via targeted policy reforms. The results of this study suggest that VC investment flows are significantly affected by a country’s institutional environment. In addition, they suggest that the judicial independence of a country’s courts and the adaptability of its laws have a strong influence on the country’s attractiveness for VC investors. Moreover, VC investments are strongly affected by macroeconomic, political, and cultural factors, confirming the results of prior studies in the VC literature. Finally, I show that bankruptcy law reforms, VC-related pension fund regulations, and fiscal reforms are important tools whereby governments can attract and retain domestic and foreign VC investors – a result that should be of much interest to policy makers. A series of sensitivity checks reveals that my results are highly robust to alternative sample compositions, estimation methods, and variable definitions.
