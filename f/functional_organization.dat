25|$|One {{can think}} of system {{architecture}} {{as a set of}} representations of an existing (or future) system. These representations initially describe a general, high-level <b>functional</b> <b>organization,</b> and are progressively refined to more detailed and concrete descriptions.|$|E
25|$|Auditory {{processing}} deficits {{have also}} been proposed {{as a cause of}} stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by masking, delayed auditory feedback (DAF), or frequency altered feedback. There is some evidence that the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.|$|E
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>functional</b> international <b>organizations</b> has occurred without adequate reorganization and coordination efforts {{due to a}} lack of central global governance to ensure accountability of such organizations. As a result, a pattern of decentralization could be observed among <b>functional</b> international <b>organizations</b> to the present day. For example, the League of Nations’ effort to coordinate <b>functional</b> international <b>organizations</b> in the field of social and economic cooperation through establishment of UN Economic and Social Council has been futile. As a result, the idea of decentralization prevails to the present day except in cases of special cooperative relationships between Economic and Social Council and some <b>functional</b> <b>organizations.</b> Subsequently, summits such as the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, The Millennium Summit in 2000 and World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 were held to address and coordinate functional cooperation, especially regarding the social and economic aspects.|$|R

The reasoning in rosa combines hierarchical classification, case-based reasoning, and qualitative spatial reasoning. The {{goal of the}} system is twofold: formalizing and building a case base holding on farm spatial and <b>functional</b> <b>organizations,</b> and helping the analysis of new cases. Domain knowledge and cases are modeled {{with the help of the}} so-called spatial organization graphs (sogs), and represented within a description logic system. Hierarchical casebased reasoning, involving classification and qualitative spatial reasoning, is used to compare and explain farm spatial structures modeled by sogs. An example of case retrieval is proposed, followed by a global discussion on case-based reasoning in the rosa system and related work...|$|R

This agreement between invasive localization of cortical tissue and MEG recordings shows the effectiveness of MEG analysis and indicates that MEG may substitute invasive procedures in the future.|$|E
25|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have shown that}} substantial changes occur in the lowest neocortical processing areas, and that these changes can profoundly alter the pattern of neuronal activation in response to experience. Neuroscientific research indicates that experience can actually change both the brain's physical structure (anatomy) and <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> (physiology). , neuroscientists {{are engaged in a}} reconciliation of critical-period studies (demonstrating the immutability of the brain after development) with the more recent research showing how the brain can, and does, change in response to hitherto unsuspected stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{modeling}} {{is a tool}} used in mathematical {{psychology and}} cognitive psychology to simulate behavior. This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Connectionism uses neural networks to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.|$|E

Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a functional structure, which makes producing {{a limited amount of}} products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost. For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them.|$|E

2500|$|Complex systems biology (CSB) is a {{field of}} science that studies the {{emergence}} of complexity in functional organisms {{from the viewpoint of}} dynamic systems theory. The latter is also often called systems biology and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as [...] "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a category theory of biological relations, as well as an algebraic topology of the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex networks of metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic processes and signaling pathways. Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.|$|E
