5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was <b>held</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise.

This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is <b>held</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E
