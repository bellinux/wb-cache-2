This explains the improvement and development of various new honing techniques. These different honing processes generate surfaces with various texture features characteristics (roughness, valleys depth, cross hatch angle, etc.). This paper addresses a comparison of ring-pack friction for cylinder surfaces produced by plateau honing and helical slide honing. It takes in consideration the mutual effect of superficial plateau roughness amplitude and honing angle. A numerical model is developed to predict friction within the cylinder ring-pack system in mixed lubrication regime. The results show the effectiveness of helical slide honed surface texture in comparison to plateau <b>honed</b> <b>bore</b> surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of increased oil consumption, blow-by, and scuffing have frequently been encountered and reported in heavy duty turbo-charged diesel engines [1]. One cause, first {{reported in the}} 1960 s [2], is a wear phenomenon known as bore polishing which entails the generation of a bright mirror-like appearance on the cylinder liner surface along with full or partial loss of the <b>honing</b> pattern. <b>Bore</b> polishing {{has been attributed to}} either hard carbonaceou...|$|R

In <b>bore</b> <b>honing</b> for example, the stone moves along two paths simultaneously. The stones are pressed radially outward {{to enlarge the}} hole while they simultaneously oscillate axially. Due to the oscillation, each slice of the honing stones touch a large area of the workpiece. Therefore, imperfections in the honing stone's profile cannot transfer to the bore. Instead both the <b>bore</b> and the <b>honing</b> stones conform to the average shape of the honing stones' motion, which {{in the case of}} <b>bore</b> <b>honing</b> is a cylinder. This averaging effect occurs in all honing processes; both the workpiece and stones erode until they conform to the average shape of the stones' cutting surface. Since the honing stones tend to erode towards a desired geometric shape, {{there is no need to}} true them. As a result of the averaging effect, the accuracy of a honed component often exceeds the accuracy of the machine tool that created it.|$|R
5000|$|Eudell Jackobson of GM {{engineering}} {{pointed out}} one of the early problems with unexplained scuffing and discovered excessive pressure on the <b>bore</b> <b>hones</b> was causing the silicon to crack. This need to both develop and actually manufacture the engine was a product of the program schedule. He said, [...] "...We were trying to put a product into production and learning the technology simultaneously. And the pressure becomes very, very great when that happens. The hone-pressure problem was solved before engines actually went out the door, affecting pre-production engines only." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for <b>honing</b> cylinder <b>bores</b> of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|R
5000|$|When fitting new rings to a used engine, special [...] "ridge dodger" [...] {{rings are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} top compression ring, to improve compression and oil consumption without reboring the cylinder. These have a small step of iron removed from the top section to avoid making contact with any wear ridge {{at the top of}} the cylinder, which could break a conventional ring. These are not widely recommended, however, as they are usually not required and may give inferior oil consumption. A more acceptable method is to remove the wear ridge with a [...] "ridge reamer" [...] tool before lightly <b>honing</b> the <b>bore</b> to accept new rings. In fact, if the [...] "ridge [...] " [...] is measured it will generally be apparent it is not really a ridge but a relatively local hollow caused by the top ring near the ring reversal point. The upper edge of this hollow will take the form of a [...] "ramp" [...] about 2mm long from the point of maximum wear to the point of zero wear. In this case, there is not actually any ridge to hit, so light honing may be all that is required.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{production}} of cylinder bores has received much attention by manufacturers. The finishing processes used include <b>boring,</b> <b>honing</b> and plateau honing. A feature of the surface changes which occur during running {{is related to the}} wearing action caused by the piston ring on the bore. This action very rapidly causes a 2 ̆ 2 transitional topography 2 ̆ 2 where the surface generated exhibits the influence of the piston ring which modifies the machined surface. The transitional surface although modified still retains significant characteristics of its initially machined state. Plateau honing is a finishing process which attempts to impart a transitional topography which may be considered partially 2 ̆ 2 run in 2 ̆ 2 and hence provides a condition which is part way towards the fully run-in state. In this paper the methods of producing engine bores are considered, the surface profiles obtained by these methods are examined and attempts to characterize their surface topography are made. The effects of wear are studied and from a consideration of the surface topography of the initial machining process a characterization technique is proposed. It is shown in the paper that the assessment of Ra, or preferably Rq, is sufficient to monitor final machining and functional wear on a cylinder bore provided that the general shape of the initial surface is known. ?? 1982...|$|R
