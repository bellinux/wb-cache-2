(Some partnerships use [...] "reverse" [...] signals, meaning that a noticeably high card discourages that suit and a noticeably low card encourages that suit, thus not [...] "wasting" [...] a potentially useful <b>intermediate</b> <b>card</b> in the suit of interest.) ...|$|E

40|$|National audienceThis paper studies a new {{spectral}} analysis strategy for detecting, characterizing and classifying the different “spectral structures” {{of an unknown}} stationary process. A “spectral structure” {{is defined as a}} sinusoidal wave, a narrow band signal or a noise peak. The {{spectral analysis}} strategy is based on the use of several successive and complementary spectral analyses. Then, the proposed methodology provides a way to calculate a “spectral identity card” of each spectral structure, similarly to a real I. D. card. This I. D. card including all information related to this structure results from the fusion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>cards,</b> which are obtained from different spectral analysis algorithms. The I. D. card permits the classification of the detected spectral structure into one of the following four classes: Pure Frequency, Narrow Band, Alarm and Reject...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper studies a new {{spectral}} analysis strategy for detecting, characterizing and classifying spectral structures {{of an unknown}} stationary process. The spectral structures we consider are defined as sinusoidal waves, narrow band signals or noise peaks. A sum of {{an unknown number of}} these structures is embedded in an unknown colored noise. The proposed methodology provides a way to calculate a spectral identity card, which features each of these spectral structures, similarly to a real I. D. The processing is based on a local Bayesian hypothesis testing, which is defined in frequency and which takes account of the noise spectrum estimator. Thanks to a matching with the corresponding spectral window, each I. D. card permits the classification of the associated spectral structure into one of the following four classes: Pure Frequency, Narrow Band, Alarm and Noise. Each I. D. card is actually the result of the fusion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>cards,</b> obtained from complementary {{spectral analysis}} methods...|$|R
40|$|When High Energy Physics meets {{high speed}} electronics, and {{state of the}} art methods fail to deliver the {{required}} performance, alternative methods have to be developed. This paper presents a novel solution for hardware trigger processing. Analog signals from 112 inputs are converted into high speed serial data with 12 bit resolution, representing a bandwidth of 53. 76 Gb/s of trigger data streamed into a single Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA node. The system automatically corrects for clock phase misalignments of 112 channels, each of those being received at 480 Mb/s. This solution has been implemented in the Trigger Region Unit (TRU) of the ALICE Photon Spectrometer (PHOS) detector, a highly integrated board for processing analogue signals received via <b>intermediate</b> Front-End Electronics <b>cards</b> from a large matrix of PWO crystals...|$|R
40|$|Interest in the {{induction}} and measurement of positive affective states in non-human animals is increasing. Here, {{we used a}} test of cognitive (judgement) bias, based on the finding that individuals experiencing different affective states judge ambiguous stimuli differently, to measure whether a positive low arousal affective state (e. g. ‘satisfaction’/’contentment’) could be induced in domestic dogs {{as a result of}} their experiencing a food-based rewarding event. In this rewarding event, subjects (1 yr old female Beagles) had to search for small amounts of food randomly placed within a maze arena. Using a balanced within-subjects design, the dogs (N= 12) received a cognitive bias test either without experiencing the rewarding event (the ‘Neutral’ treatment), or directly after experiencing the rewarding event (the ‘Post-consumption’ treatment). In the test, dogs were trained that one visual cue (e. g. dark grey card) predicted a positive event (food in a bowl) while a different cue (e. g. light grey card) predicted a relatively ‘negative’ event (empty bowl). We hypothesised that dogs tested after experiencing the rewarding event, and in a presumed post-consummatory positive affective state, would be more likely to judge visually ambiguous stimuli (<b>intermediate</b> grey <b>cards)</b> positively, compared to dogs in the ‘Neutral’ treatment. In contrast, we found that they took significantly longer to approach an intermediate ambiguous stimulus, suggesting that they were less likely to anticipate food (a negative judgement) compared to dogs in the ‘Neutral’ treatment group. Various explanations for the observed results are discussed, in particular how reward acquisition and consumption may influence positive affective state induction in animals...|$|R
