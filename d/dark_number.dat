He made over fifty television appearances between 1960 and 1967 including: eighteen episodes of Dr Finlay's Casebook (as Constable Dickie), ten episodes of The Flying Swan, eight episodes of The George Kidd Show, The <b>Dark</b> <b>Number,</b> Compact, The Saint, William, The Other Man, North Flight, Kipling, No Thoroughfare, Pack Up Your Troubles, The Big Pull, and Gideon's Way.|$|E
5000|$|The Prophet's Song was {{composed}} by May (working title [...] "People of the Earth"). On the show In the Studio with Redbeard, which spotlighted A Night at the Opera, May {{explained that he}} wrote the song after a dream he'd had about a great flood while he was recovering from being ill while recording the Sheer Heart Attack album, and {{is the source of}} some of the lyrics. He spent several days putting it together, and it includes a vocal canon sung by Mercury. The vocal, and later instrumental canon was produced by early tape delay devices. It is a heavy and <b>dark</b> <b>number</b> with a strong progressive rock influence and challenging lead vocals. At over eight minutes in length, it's also Queen's longest studio song (not counting the untitled instrumental track on [...] "Made in Heaven").|$|E

40|$|We study a {{mechanism}} where the <b>dark</b> matter <b>number</b> density today arises from asymmetries {{generated in the}} dark sector in the early universe, even though total <b>dark</b> matter <b>number</b> remains zero {{throughout the history of}} the universe. The dark matter population today can be completely symmetric, with annihilation rates above those expected from thermal WIMPs. We give a simple example of this mechanism using a benchmark model of flavored dark matter. We discuss the experimental signatures of this setup, which arise mainly from the sector that annihilates the symmetric component of dark matter. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{presents}} the results of an in-depth analysis of the production of statistics by Eurostat on formally identified victims of trafficking in human beings in Europe. He concludes that the concept of an identified victim of trafficking in human beings has different meanings in different European Union member States and that the identification process is organized differently as well. On the basis of those regional results, he argues that statistics on the number of recorded victims of human trafficking cannot be used as a reliable measurement of the extent of trafficking in human beings in a country, neither in the European Union nor elsewhere. As follow-up to this critical assessment, the author argues in favour of a worldwide programme for the collection of survey-based estimates of human trafficking and, to that end, presents a methodological strategy combining various modes of data collection. Keynotes: identification of victims of trafficking in human beings, Eurostat, cross-country differences, <b>dark</b> <b>number</b> studies, multi-mode strategies...|$|E

50|$|Arabian Nights booster packs contain eight cards, {{two from}} the {{uncommon}} sheet and six from the common sheet. The set as a whole consists of 78 cards. 19 of these cards are U3, meaning they appear three times on the uncommon sheet, and 32 cards are U2 and are thus usually dubbed the rares of the set, although they are only 33% less common than U3 cards. Of the commons 9 are C5 and 16 are C4. Additionally the Arabian Nights Mountain is C1 and Desert is C11. When counting the commons with smaller, darker mana symbols as separate cards Arabian Nights {{is a set of}} 92 cards. The smaller <b>darker</b> <b>numbers</b> in the casting cost are referred to as series (a) and the lighter and larger numbers are referred to as series (b).|$|R
40|$|The sexual victimization of {{children}} has always drawn great attention from experts and criminal policy makers {{due to the}} nature of the violent behavior and the developmental specific characteristics of the victims which enjoy special criminal law protection in a developed society. The high <b>dark</b> <b>number</b> and sex offender recidivism, as referenced by the frequent media reports about new cases of sexual violence towards the youngest memebers of society, highlight the need to search for the most appropriate social response to this form of sexual offending. The establishment of a register of convicted sex offenders for acts of sexual violence committed against minors, as one approach with a primary special preventive purpose, found its application in criminal law theory and practice of the Republic of Serbia. The aim of the paper is to present the results of an attitudinal survey of professionals employed in the field of justice and social welfare in the Republic of Serbia on the provisions of the special measures to prevent the commission of crimes of sexual abuse against juveniles and the establishment of the register of sex offenders...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish an isolated microspore culture (IMC) protocol in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for use in genetic studies and to evaluate its potential for routine use in the Brazilian Wheat Breeding Program at Embrapa Wheat. Important steps of the method were identified and plant physiology of microspore mother plants and ovary co-culture were considered as key factors for effective establishment. Three Brazilian wheat genotypes were tested (Toropi, BRS 194 and F 1 wheat cross 020037 × 020062), and two other genotypes were used as controls (Bobwhite and Fielder). Spikes containing uninucleated microspores were subjected to cold pretreatment (4 °C) for 21 days in the <b>dark.</b> <b>Number</b> of embryos, green and albino plants were recorded for each genotype. The method was successfully established, and several fertile green plants were produced by using tissue culture and responsive controls. However, the results greatly differed among Brazilian wheat genotypes, suggesting a strong genotype-dependent effect. Microspore induction medium alone did not promote embryogenesis; ovary co-culture was a necessary step for embryo development and green plant formation, for all genotypes. The F 1 wheat cross (020037 × 020062) produced a total of 85 green plants (out of 108 spikes), 64 % of which were spontaneous diploids. BRS 194 produced many embryos, exhibiting a good androgenic response, but only a few grew into green plants. Toropi behaved as a recalcitrant genotype, and zero plants were produced. To our knowledge, this is the first report on wheat IMC from Brazilian genotypes resulting in androgenic embryogenesis and plant regeneration. 201...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model in}} which dark matter is a composite baryon of a dark sector governed by SU(3) gauge theory, with vector-like quarks also charged under U(1) _Y. The model provides simple answer to the dark matter stability problem: it {{is a result of}} the accidental <b>dark</b> baryon <b>number</b> conservation. And with an analogy to QCD, all physical quantities of the dark matter can be calculated by rescaling the QCD experimental results. According to the thermal freeze-out mechanism the mass of the dark matter is predicted to be O(100) TeV in order to achieve a correct relic abundance. Such heavy dark matter is in general hard for detection due to small <b>dark</b> matter <b>number</b> density in the universe. However, <b>dark</b> baryon <b>number</b> in our model is not necessarily strictly preserved thanks to operators suppressed by the Planck scale, and such decay operator results in a decay lifetime marginal to the current detection bound. We show our model with O(10 ^ 27) s dark matter decay life time can explain the AMS- 02 anti-proton data, if it is experimentally interpreted as an access, although some theoretical uncertainty may weaken its significance. We also investigate other phenomena of this model such as the extragalactic gamma ray and neutrino signatures. Comment: 14 pages, 43 figures, published in JHE...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} report of a mutual {{interference}} between luminance and numerical value in magnitude judgments. Instead of manipulating the physical size of compared numbers, which is the traditional approach in size congruity studies, luminance levels were manipulated. The results yielded the classical congruity effect. Participants took more time to process numerically larger numbers when they were brighter than when they were darker, and more time to process a <b>darker</b> <b>number</b> when its numerical value was smaller than when it was larger. On the basis of neurophysiological studies of magnitude comparison and interference between semantic and physical information, it is proposed that the processing of semantic and physical magnitude information is carried out by a shared brain structure. It is suggested that this brain area, the left intraparietal sulcus, subserves various comparison processes by representing various quantities on an amodal magnitude scale...|$|R
