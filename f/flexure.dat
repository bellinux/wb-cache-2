5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of duodenum {{is a thin}} muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal <b>flexure</b> to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery. It {{is also known as}} the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal <b>flexure,</b> although the attachment is quite variable.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic <b>flexure.</b> This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the <b>flexure</b> becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{ligament}} {{contains a}} slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending {{parts of the}} duodenum. When it contracts, by virtue of connections to {{the third and fourth}} parts of the duodenum, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal <b>flexure,</b> allowing movement of the intestinal contents.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There is {{a greater}} demand for {{developing}} a monolithic 3 - axis accelerometer. The main challenges for developing a 3 -axis accelerometer are- the size factor, realizing z-axis sensing, and decoupling the motions of the structure in three mutually perpendicular directions. With this motivation, we analyze structures using different <b>flexures</b> and evaluate their compliance and natural frequencies in three orthogonal directions. In this paper, the analytical and numerical study of different <b>flexures</b> such as straight-beam <b>flexures,</b> crab-leg <b>flexures,</b> serpentine <b>flexures,</b> and folded <b>flexures</b> is done. First, the concept of lumped parameter is described in brief, then numerical simulation of <b>flexures</b> is done using software ANSYS. Finally, {{a comparison of the}} analytical and numerical results is presented. Index Terms—MEMS Accelerometer, Simulink Model...|$|R
40|$|Nanopositioner {{design is}} a crucial aspect in {{increasing}} the scanning speed of an Atomic Force Microscope. The scanning speed {{is dependent on the}} resonance frequency, thus on stiffness and mass of the nanopositioner. A detailed study of the design parameters of a nanopositioner is presented to investigate the effect of each parameter on stiffness and mass of the structure. It is shown that the use of tapered <b>flexures</b> reduces the central mass of the stage resulting in a higher natural frequency as compared to straight <b>flexures</b> for the same travel range. Analytical framework for stiffness calculations of tapered <b>flexures</b> is also presented. Designs incorporating the two types of <b>flexures</b> with similar bending and out-of-plane stiffness are presented and compared. It is observed that there is a 25 %increase in the natural frequency with tapered <b>flexures.</b> Limitations and future work are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{suspensory}} {{muscle is}} derived from mesoderm and {{plays a role in}} the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal <b>flexure.</b> Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally-short suspensory muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal <b>flexure.</b> Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area. It is simplified when each <b>flexure</b> is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal <b>flexure</b> arises {{at the point where}} the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric <b>flexure.</b> Similarly, the hepatic <b>flexure</b> is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic <b>flexure</b> is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic <b>flexure</b> is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic <b>flexure</b> occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every <b>flexure,</b> a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{precision}} engineering (especially high-precision motion control), <b>flexures</b> have several key advantages. High precision alignment tasks might not be possible when friction or stiction are present. Additionally, conventional bearings or linear slides often exhibit positioning hysteresis due to backlash and friction. <b>Flexures</b> are able to achieve much lower resolution limits (in some cases measured in the nanometer scale), because they depend on bending and/or torsion of flexible elements, rather than surface interaction of many parts (as with a ball bearing). This makes <b>flexures</b> a critical design feature used in optical instrumentation such as interferometers.|$|R

25|$|The {{inferior}} {{surface of}} the pancreas is narrow on the right, broader on the left, and covered by peritoneum; it lies upon the duodenojejunal <b>flexure</b> and on some coils of the jejunum; its left extremity rests on the splenic <b>flexure</b> of the colon.|$|E
25|$|A {{dynamically}} tuned gyroscope (DTG) is a rotor {{suspended by}} a universal joint with <b>flexure</b> pivots. The <b>flexure</b> spring stiffness {{is independent of}} spin rate. However, the dynamic inertia (from the gyroscopic reaction effect) from the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to {{the square of the}} spin speed (Howe and Savet, 1964; Lawrence, 1998). Therefore, at a particular speed, called the tuning speed, the two moments cancel each other, freeing the rotor from torque, a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope.|$|E

It is an autosomal-dominant pigmentary disorder that may appear in adolescence or adulthood. This condition is due to mutations in structural/desmosomal proteins found within stratified squamous epithelium.|$|R

Interestingly, we noticed the typical sulci and gyri pattern in the skin lesions of pemphigus vegetans over the <b>flexures</b> of the body.
