5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, <b>hot</b> <b>filament,</b> arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a <b>hot</b> <b>filament</b> involved.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Diamond films was {{deposited}} on cemented carbide tools with two-step pretreatment method under different distances between the substrates and <b>hot</b> <b>filaments,</b> {{and the effect}} of the distance between the substrates and <b>hot</b> <b>filaments</b> on the crystallographic orientation of diamond films and the characteristics of diamond coated tools was investigated in bias-enhanced HFCVD system in this paper. The cutting performance of diamond coated tools was verified by the experiments of cutting particles reinforced aluminum base composite material with 15 vol. % Si as compared with uncoated ones. The quality of diamond film was analyzed by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The optimization deposition processing was obtained. The relative intensity ratio of (111) facet and (220) facet in the film tested by XRD was one third. The cutting performance of diamond coated tool was improved significantly when machining the Si particle reinforced aluminum-based metal matrix composite; its lifetime was 30 times longer than that of uncoated one. The work done in this paper was of great practical significance to accelerate the industrialization of diamond films coated WC–Co substrates...|$|R

He {{was one of the}} first scientists to work with plasmas, and he was the first to call these ionized gases by that name because they reminded him of blood plasma.

25|$|The {{gas fill}} must {{be free of}} traces of water. In the {{presence}} of the <b>hot</b> <b>filament,</b> water reacts with tungsten forming tungsten trioxide and atomic hydrogen. The oxide deposits on the bulb inner surface and reacts with hydrogen, decomposing to metallic tungsten and water. Water then cycles back to the filament. This greatly accelerates the bulb blackening, in comparison with evaporation-only.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a <b>hot</b> <b>filament</b> or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the <b>hot</b> <b>filament</b> or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as Cunife and Fernico) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These {{made it easy to}} construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.|$|E

30|$|Hot-wire {{chemical}} vapor deposition (HWCVD), {{also referred}} to as catalytic {{chemical vapor deposition}}, has been studied extensively for the deposition of silicon-related thin films under low substrate temperatures. It was demonstrated that HWCVD has the advantages of conformal film deposition on small objects with high-aspect ratio structure [24, 25] and no ion bombardment, which make it suitable for fabrication of devices with SiNW structure. Moreover, HWCVD technique can be used to form shallow doping layer (less than 10  nm in depth) on single-crystal silicon surface at temperatures less than 350 °C by catalytically generated phosphorous radicals from <b>hot</b> <b>filaments</b> [26 – 29].|$|R

Instruments easy to use: operate under ordinary ambient atmospheric conditions, without need to use messy liquid solvents or install and remove witness plates, and without need to cut specimens from surfaces to be inspected. Principle of detection involves sweeping pure, activated gas across surface spot inspected, then monitoring light emitted at wavelengths characteristic of excited molecules formed by chemical reactions between activated gas and contaminants.

25|$|A {{very small}} amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can {{significantly}} affect lamp darkening. Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the <b>hot</b> <b>filament.</b> The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle. The equivalent of {{a drop of water}} distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening. Small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.|$|E

500|$|The CVD growth {{involves}} substrate preparation, feeding varying {{amounts of}} gases into a chamber and energizing them. The substrate preparation includes choosing an appropriate material and its crystallographic orientation; cleaning it, {{often with a}} diamond powder to abrade a non-diamond substrate; and optimizing the substrate temperature (about [...] ) during the growth {{through a series of}} test runs. The gases always include a carbon source, typically methane, and hydrogen with a typical ratio of 1:99. Hydrogen is essential because it selectively etches off non-diamond carbon. The gases are ionized into chemically active radicals in the growth chamber using microwave power, a <b>hot</b> <b>filament,</b> an arc discharge, a welding torch, a laser, an electron beam, or other means.|$|E
50|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of diffusion pumps is {{the tendency to}} backstream oil into the vacuum chamber. This oil can contaminate surfaces inside the chamber or upon contact with <b>hot</b> <b>filaments</b> or electrical discharges may result in carbonaceous or siliceous deposits. Due to backstreaming, oil diffusion pumps are not suitable for use with highly sensitive analytical equipment or other applications which require an extremely clean vacuum environment, but mercury diffusion pumps {{may be in the}} case of ultra high vacuum chambers used for metal deposition. Often cold traps and baffles are used to minimize backstreaming, although this results in some loss of pumping ability.|$|R

2500|$|Nixie tubes were {{superseded}} in the 1970s by {{light-emitting diodes}} (LEDs) and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), {{often in the}} form of seven-segment displays. The VFD uses a <b>hot</b> <b>filament</b> to emit electrons, a control grid and phosphor-coated anodes (similar to a cathode ray tube) shaped to represent segments of a digit, pixels of a graphical display, or complete letters, symbols, or words. Whereas Nixies typically require 180 volts to illuminate, VFDs only require relatively low voltages to operate, making them easier and cheaper to use. VFDs have a simple internal structure, resulting in a bright, sharp, and unobstructed image. [...] Unlike Nixies, the glass envelope of a VFD is evacuated rather than being filled with a specific mixture of gases at low pressure.|$|E
