40|$|<b>Heartbeat</b> <b>intervals</b> during atrial {{fibrillation}} are commonly believed {{to form a}} series of almost independent variables. The series extracted from 24 h Holter recordings show a nonstationary behavior. Because of nonstationarity {{it is difficult to}} give a quantitative measure of independence. In this paper, we use and compare two methods for this. The first is a classical method which models a nonstationary series using a linear Gaussian state space model. In this framework, the independence is tested on the stationary sequence of the residuals. The second method codes data into permutations and tests the uniformity of their distribution. This test assumes as null hypothesis a weaker form of independence which we call symbolic independence. We discuss some advantages of symbolic independence in the context of heartbeat series.

40|$|When humans {{perform a}} {{response}} task or timing task repeatedly, fluctuations in measures of timing from one action {{to the next}} exhibit long-range correlations known as 1 /f noise. The origins of 1 /f noise in timing have been debated for over twenty years, with one common explanation serving as a default: Humans are composed of physiological processes throughout the brain and body that operate {{over a wide range}} of timescales, and these processes combine to be expressed as a general source of 1 /f noise. To test this explanation, the present study investigated the coupling versus independence of 1 /f noise in timing deviations, key-press durations, pupil dilations, and <b>heartbeat</b> <b>intervals</b> while tapping to an audiovisual metronome. All four dependent measures exhibited clear 1 /f noise, regardless of whether tapping was synchronized or syncopated. 1 /f spectra for timing deviations were found to match those for key-press durations on an individual basis, and 1 /f spectra for pupil dilations matched those in <b>heartbeat</b> <b>intervals.</b> Results indicate a complex, multiscale relationship among 1 /f noises arising from common sources, such as those arising from timing functions versus those arising from autonomic nervous system functions. Results also provide further evidence against the default hypothesis that 1 /f noise in human timing is just the additive combination of processes throughout the brain and body.

Evidence of multifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported [Ivanov et al., Nature 399, 461 (1999) ].

On the other hand, scale invariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart rate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 178103 (2004) ].
