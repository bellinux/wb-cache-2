50|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to Surface-to-Air missiles (SAMs). Modern missiles are commonly <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing.</b> They need the firing unit to actively illuminate the target with a missile fire-control director throughout the flight. If a guiding director shuts down then the missiles still in flight will self-destruct. So {{the number of}} intercepts a unit can simultaneously prosecute {{is limited by the}} number of directors possessed. The use of directors exposes the firing unit to counterattack.|$|R

50|$|Thunderbird had {{performance}} {{similar to}} other semi-portable missiles like the US MIM-23 Hawk and fully mobile Soviet 2K11 Krug, although it pre-dates both of these systems and offered greater range over them, but have slower speed compared to the soviet 2K11 Krug. After its mid-life upgrades, which shared several components with the RAF's Bristol Bloodhound, Thunderbird featured a continuous-wave radar <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> system that was highly resistant to Radar jamming and deception, {{and was able to}} track targets even at very low altitudes.|$|R
50|$|TVM {{guidance}} {{requires a}} radar ground station and a missile with a radar receiver. As with <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> missiles, the ground-based radar illuminates the target with radar energy {{which is then}} reflected off the target and detected by the missile. However, unlike a SARH missile, the missile itself does not compute interception with this information. Instead, data from the radar returns is relayed {{back to the ground}} station via a data link which also serves for passing the guidance commands to the missile.|$|R
50|$|Aimed at {{addressing}} the major flaws of the AA.20, specifically {{the fact that}} the missile could not be used at night or in poor weather, the French developed the AA.25, which was essentially a radar-beam riding version of the AA.20, using the target-tracking beam of the CSF Cyrano Ibis radar fitted to the Mirage IIIC. Many AA.20 missiles were converted to AA.25 standard. A further version of the missile, designated the AA.26, with <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> was planned but the competing R.511 missile was adopted instead.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} F-102A had the Hughes MG-3 {{fire control}} system, later upgraded {{in service to}} the MG-10. It had a three-segment internal weapons bay under the fuselage for air-to-air missiles. Initial armament was three pairs of GAR-1/2/3/4 (Later re-designated as AIM-4) Falcon missiles, which included both infrared <b>homing</b> and <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> variants. [...] The doors of the two forward bays each had tubes for 12 FFARs (for a total of 24) with initially 2in (5.1cm) being fitted and later 2.75in (70mm) replacing them. The F-102 was later upgraded to allow the carrying of up to two GAR-11/AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon missiles in the center bay. The larger size of this weapon required redesigned center bay doors with no rocket tubes. Plans were considered to fit the MB-1 Genie nuclear rocket to the design, but although a Genie was test fired from a YF-102A in May 1956, it was never adopted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> systems {{combine a}} passive radar {{receiver}} on the missile {{with a separate}} targeting radar that [...] "illuminates" [...] the target. Since the missile is typically being launched after the target was detected using a powerful radar system, {{it makes sense to}} use that same radar system to track the target, thereby avoiding problems with resolution or power, and reducing the weight of the missile. <b>Semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> (SARH) {{is by far the most}} common [...] "all weather" [...] guidance solution for anti-aircraft systems, both ground- and air-launched.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} F-102A had the Hughes MG-3 {{fire control}} system, later upgraded {{in service to}} the MG-10.

5000|$|The second {{generation}} of Standard missile, the Standard Missile 2, was developed for the Aegis combat system, and New Threat Upgrade program that was planned for existing Terrier and Tartar ships. The destroyer [...] served as the test platform {{for the development of}} the CG/SM-2 (ER) missile program project. The principal change over the Standard missile 1 is the introduction of inertial guidance for each phase of the missile's flight except the terminal phase where <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> was retained. This design change was made so that missiles could time share illumination radars and enable equipped ships to defend against saturation missile attacks.|$|R
50|$|Although {{designed}} for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided AIM-9 Sidewinder, they replaced the AIM-4 Falcon IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching fighter plane at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed {{in the direction of}} the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in air-to-air combat.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the more}} {{effective}} methods used to defeat <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> radar are flying techniques. These depend upon the pilot knowing that a missile has been launched. The global positioning system allows a missile to reach the predicted intercept with no datalink, greatly increasing lethality by postponing illumination {{for most of the}} missile flight. The pilot is unaware that a launch has occurred, so flying techniques become almost irrelevant. One difficulty is testing, because this feature creates public safety risks if a fault prevents datalink self-destruct signals when a missile is heading in the wrong direction. Most coastlines are heavily populated, so this risk exists at test centers for sea based systems that are near the coastlines.|$|R
50|$|Vessels of the California-class cruisers, Virginia-class cruisers and Kidd-class {{destroyer}} {{had their}} Tartar systems upgraded to modification 14 or 15 standard which {{enabled them to}} employ the Standard Missile 2 {{as part of the}} New Threat Upgrade (NTU) program. The New Threat Upgrade equipped vessels could utilize the inertial guidance systems on the SM-2 and time share illumination radars for <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> in the terminal phase of the intercept, increasing the number of targets the Tartar system could attack at the same time. The New Threat Upgrade Tartar ships could function nearly as well as Aegis Combat System equipped vessels, except for dealing with saturation missile attacks. The NTU still requires the AN/SPG-51 radar to acquire a lock on the target and illuminate it just before intercept.|$|R
2500|$|The 9M38 uses a {{single-stage}} X-winged design {{without any}} detachable parts; its exterior design {{is similar to}} the American Tartar and Standard surface-to-air missile series, which led to the half-serious nickname of Standardski. The design had to conform to strict naval dimension limitations, allowing the missile to be adapted for the M-22 SAM system in the Soviet Navy. Each missile is [...] long, weighs [...] and carries a relatively large [...] warhead which is triggered by a radar proximity fuze. In the forward compartment of the missile, a <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> radar head (9E50, [...] ), autopilot equipment, power source and warhead are located. The homing method chosen was proportional navigation. Some elements of the missile were compatible with the Kub's 3M9; for example, its forward compartment diameter (33cm), which was less than the rear compartment diameter.|$|R
50|$|Some 17 further ex-AMARC {{aircraft}} {{were also}} procured along with six ex-Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16BMs for training purposes (Combat Capable) along with 16 ex-Belgian F-16AM/BM in MLU (Mid Life Update, Block 20) standard in 2009, Another 2 ex-Spanish Mirage F1CE/EE aircraft were procured in 2006. In July/Aug 2011 RJAF received another 9 ex-Belgian F-16AM/BM MLU standard, thus boosting the RJAF's own multi-role capabilities.RJAF pilots {{have participated in}} 'Bright Star' in Egypt against regional F-16 Fighting Falcons and have improved their skills considerably, especially in defining critical areas of upgrading. The AIM-120 AMRAAM has been procured by the RJAF and will improve combat capabilities of the basic F-16. Unlike the AIM-7M Sparrow III the AMRAAM is lighter and more versatile with superior ECM/ECCM and capable of engaging high-g targets, along with an active radar homing warhead (unlike the <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> warhead of the 'Sparrow III') with standard datalink for mid-course guidance and correction purposes.|$|R
50|$|The RIM-66C/D Standard MR (SM-2MR Block I) was {{developed}} in the 1970s and was {{a key part of the}} Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade (NTU). The SM-2MR introduced inertial and command mid-course guidance. The missile's autopilot is programmed to fly the most efficient path to the target and can receive course corrections from the ground. Target illumination for <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> is needed only for a few seconds in the terminal phase of the interception. This capability enables the Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade equipped vessels to time share illumination radars, greatly increasing the number of targets that can be engaged in quick succession. Mk 41 VLS adopts modular design concept, which result in different versions that vary in size and weight. There are three lengths: 209 in for the self-defense version, 266 in for the tactical version, and 303 in for the strike version. The empty weight for an 8-cell module is 26800 lb for the self-defense version, 29800 lb for the tactical version, and 32000 lb for the strike version.|$|R
