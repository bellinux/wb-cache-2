5|$|Michigan did not {{participate}} in any postseason tournaments, ending a streak of four consecutive NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament appearances. Following the season, Spike Albrecht had offseason surgery on his right <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> correct for a genetic condition that may also necessitate left hip surgery. Albrecht and Irvin were voted team co-MVPs. On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Fowler could miss the rest of the 2007–08 season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought. Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture in order for the <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> heal properly. Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback {{at the end of the}} season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad. He did not feature in the game in and thus did not receive a runners-up medal having not made an appearance in the competition.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E

5|$|In April 2015, Spike Albrecht had offseason {{surgery on}} his right <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> correct for a genetic {{condition}} that may also necessitate left hip surgery. Following the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament several pollsters (including ESPN, USA Today, NBC Sports) omitted Michigan from the expected preseason top 25, however some that immediately projected Caris LeVert to return to Michigan included Michigan in the rankings: CBS Sports (#18) and Sports Illustrated (#16). Bleacher Report ranked Michigan at 25 noting lower expectations if LeVert declared himself eligible for the 2015 NBA draft. On April 21, LeVert {{announced that he would}} return for his senior season. That same day, Max Bielfeldt was released from his athletic scholarship with one year of eligibility remaining. Despite all 13 of its scholarships being committed at the time, Michigan continued to recruit five-star 2015 McDonald's All-American Jaylen Brown and four-star Kenny Williams for the class of 2015.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by General Manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy.|$|E
5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E

25|$|Vinatieri {{appeared}} in only six {{games for the}} Colts in 2009 due to injury. In July 2009, Vinatieri had surgery on his right <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> alleviate a nagging injury, but the Colts expected {{that he would be}} ready for the season. However, Vinatieri struggled early in the season and complained of soreness in his knee. Doctors found loose cartilage in an MRI, and Vinatieri underwent arthroscopic surgery during the Colts' bye week. During this season, punter Pat McAfee assumed Vinatieri's kickoff duties, something he has done ever since. He was expected to miss 4–8 weeks while recovering. The Colts signed former Baltimore Ravens kicker Matt Stover to replace him. There was speculation over whether the Colts could cut Vinatieri, but Colts president Bill Polian stated that Vinatieri would return when he was 100% healthy. Vinatieri would remain injured for the entire 2009 regular season as well as throughout the Colts' postseason run to Super Bowl XLIV. Vinatieri did not play in Super Bowl XLIV, which the Colts lost to the New Orleans Saints.|$|E

25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari tucked into the {{waistband}} of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E

In Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the protagonists, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: [...] "No longer {{from head to foot}} than from <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her." [...] The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself.

500|$|After {{capturing}} the knoll, the two platoons—reinforced by two {{sections of the}} 2/4th Commando Squadron—dug in to await an expected Japanese counter-attack. At about 03:30 on 23 May, a Japanese light machine gun fired into the Australian position. [...] Derrick sat upright to see if his men were all right, and was hit by five bullets from the gun's second burst; striking him from his left <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> the right of his chest. His runner, [...] "Curly" [...] Colby, dragged him behind cover, but Derrick could not be immediately evacuated as Japanese troops attacked at about 04:00. Derrick was in great pain, and told Colby that he had [...] "had it". Despite his wounds, he continued to issue orders for several hours. When day broke, {{it was discovered that}} Derrick's platoon were directly overlooked by a Japanese bunker—though this would not have been visible during the assault late the previous evening.|$|E

500|$|Albrecht {{was named}} co-captain of the 2014–15 team along with Caris LeVert. On November 29, he contributed a career-high 7 assists against Nicholls State. Then on December 2, Albrecht posted {{a new career}} high with 9 assists and broke a 6363 {{deadlock}} with a 31 seconds remaining to lead Michigan to a 6865 victory over Syracuse. On December 6 in an upset loss against NJIT Highlanders, Albrecht raised his streak of assists without a turnover to 19, but Albrecth had 4 turnovers on December 9 against the EMU Eagles. On January 3, 2015 against Purdue, Albrecht tied his career high with 17 points. On February 1 Albrecht tallied a career-high 18-points in the rivalry game against Michigan State. The March 3 double-overtime loss against Northwestern marked Albrecht's 8th consecutive double-digit scoring game as {{he picked up the}} scoring slack in the absence of Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton, who missed their 11th and 9th consecutive games. On March 7 against Rutgers, the streak ended, but Albrecht posted a career-high 9 assists. In April 2015, Albrecht had offseason surgery on his right <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> correct for a genetic condition that may also necessitate left hip surgery. [...] On December 2, Albrecht was named an Allstate Good Works Team nominee.|$|E
500|$|Thorpe's {{comeback}} {{attempt in}} the 200m freestyle {{came to an}} abrupt end on day 2 of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, on 16 March 2012. No longer allowed to wear the full-body racing suit (covering from neck to ankles and wrists) with which he set all of his world records– but are now banned by FINA rule changes– he competed wearing just the [...] "jammer" [...] (<b>hip</b> <b>to</b> thigh) racing shorts. He swam very well in the morning heats, cruising to 1:49.18, a time which placed him equal fifth fastest. However, in the semi-finals that evening he faded over the last 100 meters, finishing in 12th place at 1:49.91. Speaking to reporters immediately afterwards, Thorpe said, [...] "The last 100 was a struggle, I'm not sure why. This was slower than what I swam this morning, probably the inexperience of racing in the last 18 months held me up. The fairytale has turned into a nightmare." [...] In the 100m freestyle on day 3 (17 March), Thorpe won his heat (the 9th of 12) but failed to break 50 seconds and did not advance to the semi-finals with the top 16 sprinters. Thus, his bid to qualify for the London Olympics officially ended.|$|E
500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{noted that}} the album is a brave comment on the chilly, tragic {{detachment}} of sex under AIDS. Stylus Magazine commented that each song has its own energy. He also noted that [...] "Erotica was too sophisticated for a mainstream besotted with [...] and a college-radio claque eager to praise R.E.M.'s opaque dirges for the wisdom that Madonna's club fodder showed with less fuss and with a better rhythm section". Robert Christgau commented that [...] "The singer doesn't have great pipes, but because she's too <b>hip</b> <b>to</b> belt , she doesn't need them. She's in control, all understated presence and impersonal personality except when she's flashing some pink. [...] "Love your sister, love your brother" [...] thing, the lyrics are not stupid.

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine recognized that [...] "Pettibone's beats might be time-stamped with the sound of a genre that ruled a decade of one-hitters before being replaced by commercialized hip-hop" [...] and classified Madonna's voice as [...] "nasal and remote". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly declared that Erotica may be the most joyless dance music of all time, while criticizing Madonna's [...] "soulless" [...] voice. Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that the album is far from Madonna's best album, as the hip-hop songs lack the [...] "musical breadth and confessional poignancy" [...] of Like a Prayer, the record that established Madonna as a mature pop songwriter.|$|E
