To assess this effect, we compare the job mismatch probabilities of <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> and <b>German</b> natives and the employment probability in jobs that vary by the qualifications they require. Our results suggest that <b>ethnic</b> <b>Germans</b> are disadvantaged upon arrival, yet almost completely assimilate to comparable natives considering these two job quality measures.

This paper analyses the economic performance of <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> migrants to West Germany in comparison with native born West <b>Germans.</b> <b>Ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> from Eastern Europe display lower levels of education, lower rates of self-employment and higher unemployment rates than natives and immigrants from East Germany. Similar to foreign guest-workers, <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> are more likely to work in blue collar jobs; they do, however, eventually reach earnings parity with native Germans. This study therefore demonstrates, in contrast to analyses of the economic performance of guest-workers, that despite substantial persistence in economic stature, the German economy does not exclude immigrants from economic prosperity.

40|$|Introduction]. This paper {{explores the}} ethnic {{dimension}} of structural change, i. e. the shift towards service sector employment in Germany. To some extent structural change in OECD countries {{is a reflection}} of differences in relative productivity growth rates, and should thus be regarded as a sign of successful economic development (Rowthorn and Ramaswamy(1997)). On the other hand, it can be associated with the reorganisation and ‘casualisation’ of the work process, and the generation {{of a large number of}} low skill jobs, in which minorities are more likely to be found for a variety of reasons. As Sassen puts it in her analysis of the urban US economy: [N]ew employment regimes are becoming apparent in these services-dominated urban economies which create low-wage jobs and do not require particularly high levels of education. This paper examines whether a process similar to the one described by Sassen applies to either Southern European minority, or <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrant</b> employment in services in Germany. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel (GSOEP), we analyse (1) the impact of the shift towards service employment on minority employment patterns, (2) the employment patterns of ethnic German immigrants who settled in Germany in the 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|Parentification (adolescents' {{adoption}} of adult family roles by providing instrumental or emotional {{support for their}} parents) {{is assumed to be}} higher in immigrant than native families. An often discussed reason for parentification is the adolescent-parent acculturation gap in immigrant families whereby immigrant adolescents acculturate faster and outperform their parents socio-culturally. The aim of this multi-informant, multi-group study was to investigate levels, predictors, and psychosocial outcomes of instrumental and emotional parentification. The sample comprised 197 native (adolescents: mean age 14. 7 years, 52 % female) and 185 <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrant</b> (adolescents: mean age 15. 7 years, 60 % female) mother-adolescent dyads. Results revealed higher levels of emotional and instrumental parentification among immigrant adolescents. Parents' partnership dissatisfaction predicted instrumental and emotional parentification only in the native German sample. Among immigrants, language brokering related to instrumental and emotional parentification, and a larger mother-adolescent acculturation gap was associated with higher levels of emotional parentification. The positive psychosocial outcome, self-efficacy, was predicted by instrumental parentification in both adolescent groups. Exhaustion, the negative outcome, however, was related to higher levels of instrumental and lower levels of emotional parentification only in the immigrant group. The results of this study highlight that family systems can change due to migration to another country, with adolescents becoming more responsible for family matters than is normative for their age. However, only some of these premature responsibilities carry a risk of maladaptation, with others seeming to provide opportunities for positive developmental growth...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{relative}} economic performance of immigrants compared to the native born population in Germany.

Our results show that immigrants are quite heterogeneous with respect to their economic performance but, overall, non-ethnic <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> are net payers to the social security system. The two subgroups substantially benefiting from the income redistribution are "pure" Aussiedler and East Germans. By this measure, immigrants of non-German nationality are not an economic burden to the native-born population. ...|$|R

Results revealed more developmental than acculturative change, as immigrants and natives mostly showed a similar rate of change in autonomy expectations. Acculturative change was found only for oppositional autonomy among late adolescent immigrants, whose later expectations approached those of their native age-mates over time...|$|R
40|$|The {{years after}} the end of World War II were {{characterized}} by the constant arrival of new Canadians. Between 1946 and 1960, Canada opened its doors to over two million immigrants and approximately 13 per cent of them were German. The first ten years of German immigration to Canada were dominated by the arrival of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Germans.</b> <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Germans,</b> or Volksdeutsche, were <b>German</b> speaking <b>immigrants</b> who were born in countries other than the Germany of 1939. This thesis explores the identity of those <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrants.</b> It has frequently been noted that <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> to Canada were inordinately quick to adapt to their new society. As a result, studies of <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> in Canada have tended to focus on the degree and speed with which they adopted the social framework of the dominant society. The present work seeks to place the <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> experience in the context of rapidly changing Canadian social and economic realities. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Germans</b> have a history that has subjected them to rapid changes in political, family, and economic reality. They came to a Canadian society that was increasingly urbanized, with a growing consumer orientation and accompanied by changes in self-perception. Using archival sources and a variety of personal stories in the form of memoirs, personal interviews, letters to newspapers and published materials, the thesis explores the processes of <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> identification. Conceptually the argument follows Fredric Barth's suggestions that culture should be thought of as a process. Ethnic identity should not be thought of as static but rather as a constant process of social construction. The coherence of features of ethnic identity is constantly in flux, and it is these processes that should engage the student of culture. The processes of labelling, memory, socialization and the social construction of family, work, and associations provide the structure for the chapters that follow. For <b>ethnic</b> <b>Germans,</b> each of these processes became arenas where identities were formed and coherence was enhanced or discarded in favour of new social realities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} wage {{assimilation of}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> to Germany. We use unique administrative data {{that include a}} standardized measure of immigrants' pre-migration wage based on occupation, industry, tenure, qualification, and the German wage structure. We find that immigrants experience a substantial initial wage disadvantage compared to natives. During their first 15 years in the host country they manage to close a considerable part of this gap, though assimilation is only partial. A 10 % higher pre-migration wage translates into a 1. 6 % higher wage in Germany when also controlling for educational attainment, thus pointing at partial transferability of human capital acquired in the source country to the host country's labor market. We also find that wage assimilation is significantly accelerated for immigrants with a higher pre-migration wage. Our results {{are in line with}} strong complementarities between general skills and host country-specific human capital, in particular proficiency in the host country's language...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we measure the effects of recent {{immigration}} on the Western German labor market looking at both wage and employment effects. Refining administrative data for the period 1987 - 2001 to account for <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> and immigrants from Eastern Germany, {{we find that the}} substantial immigration of the 1990 's had very little adverse effects on native wages and on their employment levels. Instead, it had a sizable adverse employment effect as well as a small adverse wage effect on previous waves of immigrants. These asymmetric results are partly driven by a higher degree of substitution between old and new immigrants in the labor market. In a simple calculation we show that the largest aggregate effect of new immigration on natives and old immigrants comes from the increased costs of unemployment benefits to old immigrants. Those costs could be eliminated in a world of wage flexibility and no unemployment insurance in which immigration would not have any negative employment effect but only moderate wage effects.

2500|$|A rich wheat farming district, {{the area}} around Windsor first drew {{permanent}} residents in the early 1870s. Two factors were to {{play a critical role}} in stimulating Windsor's early development: irrigation and the railroad. Irrigation increased crop variety and production and the railroad shipped this bounty to market. The town was platted in 1882, the same year the Windsor Railroad Depot was built, and incorporated in 1890. It was named for the Rev. Samuel Asa Windsor. By 1900, tariffs on foreign sugar had created a market for new sources of sugar. Research in the improved cultivation of sugar beets was taking place at Colorado Agricultural College in Fort Collins, and the capital to advance production and manufacture of beet sugar was coming together. In 1903 a factory for producing sugar from sugar beets was built in Windsor. Sugar beet cultivation required large numbers of [...] "stoop laborers," [...] a need that was met by <b>ethnic</b> <b>German</b> <b>immigrants</b> from Russia. With large families and a strong work ethic, the German-Russians who settled in Windsor and other sugar beet areas would achieve financial success within one generation and own the highest producing beet farms. The Great Western Sugar Company fueled Windsor's economy through the mid-1960s, when the Windsor factory closed. Plentiful water and land drew Kodak to Windsor where it opened a manufacturing plant on the heels of the sugar factory's closing.|$|R
