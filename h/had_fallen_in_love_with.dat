5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that {{he had become a}} vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Between 1715 – {{the year}} of Louis's death – and 1723, power {{transferred}} to the Régence; the regent, Philippe d'Orléans, maintained the prison but the absolutist rigour of Louis XIV's system began to weaken somewhat. Although Protestants ceased {{to be kept in}} the Bastille, the political uncertainties and plots of the period kept the prison busy and 1,459 were imprisoned there under the Regency, an average of around 182 a year. During the Cellamare Conspiracy, the alleged enemies of the Regency were imprisoned in the Bastille, including Marguerite De Launay. While in the Bastille, de Launay {{fell in love with a}} fellow prisoner, the Chevalier de Ménil; she also infamously received an invitation of marriage from the Chevalier de Maisonrouge, the governor's deputy, who <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> her himself.|$|E

5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, {{that is the only}} expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|In 1656 {{relations}} between Rupert and Charles Louis deteriorated badly. Rupert <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Louise von Degenfeld, {{one of his}} sister-in-law's maids of honour. One of Rupert's notes proffering his affections accidentally fell into the possession of Charles Louis' wife Charlotte, who believed it was written to her. Charlotte was keen to engage in an affair with Rupert and became unhappy when she was declined and the mistake explained. Unfortunately, von Degenfeld was uninterested in Rupert, but was engaged in an affair with Charles Louis—this was discovered in due course, leading to the annulment of the marriage. Rupert, for his part, was unhappy that Charles Louis could not endow him with a suitable estate, and the two parted on bad terms in 1657, Rupert refusing to ever return to the Palatinate again and taking up employment under Ferdinand III in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Crowley {{travelled}} to Mexico via the United States, {{settling in}} Mexico City {{and taking a}} local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later {{claimed to have been}} initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested {{that the purpose of the}} trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery (1903).|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to {{play a significant role in}} the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the back room of The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E
