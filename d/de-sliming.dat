40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{optimisation}} of platinum-group metals recovery at the Mimosa Mine in Zimbabwe. The {{first part of}} this research investigates how collector performance can be improved by using collector combinations (mixtures) of the standard sodium iso-butyl xanthate with a secondary collector. The synergistic effect of the sodium-iso-butyl-xanthate (SIBX) combined with trithiocarbonates (TTCs) or dithiophosphates (DTP) was investigated. The short chain and the long chain TTCs were investigated. These collector combinations were studied at various molar percent ratios. The SIBX:DTP combination was studied at a 1 : 1 mass ratio or molar ratio of 1 : 1. 3. Amongst all the collector combinations, it was established that the SIBX/DTP combination improved sulphur recoveries by 10 % and subsequently the PGE+Au recovery by 10 % compared to when the SIBX was used on its own. The C 4 -TTC showed poor performance in the sulphur recovery; however an improvement in PGE + Au recovery was noticeable. There was generally no significant metallurgical improvement with respect to final grades and recoveries with C 10 and C 12 TTC mixtures with SIBX. However, the 6. 25 molar per cent substitution of SIBX by C 12 TTC appeared to show some improvement on sulphur but not on PGM+Au recovery and grade. It was therefore concluded that the SIBX/DTP combination at 1 : 1 mass ratio (total moles of 0. 64) showed a potential to improve the grades and recoveries of the Mimosa Mine. The Mimosa ore is characterised by an unusually large amount of talc, which often causes problems during the flotation of the PGM minerals {{due to the fact that}} talc consumes high amount of reagents. Therefore the purpose of the second part of this thesis was to investigate the possibility of removing talc prior to the flotation process by <b>de-sliming.</b> Two cyclones (36. 9 mm and 76. 0 mm) were used for <b>de-sliming</b> the flotation feed. <b>De-sliming</b> the ore was able to reduce the depressant dosage up to 300 g/t as opposed to 500 g/t that is used at Mimosa Mine.

40|$|The complex {{copper oxide}} ore sample {{was taken from}} Deerni copper deposit, Qinghai Province of China. Batch {{flotation}} tests had been conducted to upgrade the copper concentrate by conventional amyl xanthate reagents under 73 % - 74 μm of the particle size; however, the unsatisfied results (Cu grade of 18. 21 % and recovery of 59. 25 %) were obtained. Also there are {{a large amount of}} slimes trapped in the concentrate and high-dosages consumption of reagents, for example, more than 2. 5 kg/t sodium sulfide and 1. 5 kg/t sodium silicate at only one-staged roughing. Based on the analysis of the sample, most of gangues are clay, feldspar and mica, which may easy to over-grind and deteriorate the flotation process either on reagents consumption or slurry fluidity or viscosity. A hydro-cyclone had been introduced to pre-concentrate the oxide ore by scrubbing the slime before flotation, which can result obviously in reducing the dosages of sodium sulfide from 2. 5 Kg/t to 1 Kg/t, and raising the grade of Cu in the concentrate from 18. 21 % to 26. 65 % at the expense of about 1 % recovery of Cu. In this paper, the effects on the recovery of Cu by the different dosages of flotation reagents with or without <b>de-sliming</b> were studied, with the objective of determining the different effects on the functions of flotation reagents by slime during flotation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSedimentary {{phosphate}} occurs largely at Gafsa mining basin. Among these occurrences Jebel Alima (Redeyf region) is an {{open pit}} quarry. After extraction, raw phosphate requires several stages of treatments to become concentrated: crushing, grinding, scrubbing, sizing, attrition, <b>de-sliming</b> and flotation. The coarse reject, generated from {{the first step of}} ore processing, constitutes the main pollution source in the mining area around the washing plant. Since composition contains a host of environmentally hazardous chemical elements such as Cd, U, Pb…. The results of the chemical characterization also show that the raw sample can achieve P 2 O 5 grade of 13. 52 %. After 170 scrubbing tests, with 4 kg of solid waste for each test, the liberated fraction showed a content of 24. 33 % P 2 O 5. After sieving, the fraction under 315 microns was recovered for flotation, whereas the fraction greater than 315 microns goes through grinding. 11 grinding tests were carried out taking into account the parameter variations (rotational speed, grinding time, solid concentration and load). The result of the optimum grinding is: Load: 7 / 1; speed: 60 tr / min; time: 5, 5 min; Cs: 45 %. The liberated fraction content is 20. 24 %. Before the reverse flotation, the product from scrubber outlet (fraction 315 microns) were mixed. The feed material has a content of 22. 44 % P 2 O 5. The beneficiation of waste reject was carried out by reverse flotation in acid medium with amines and esters. The content reached 28. 16 % P 2 O 5 with carbonation rate of 1. 6. This content is very close to 29 % (content of commercial phosphates). Therefore the coarse waste reject could be considered as potential reserves for the future...|$|E
40|$|Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio (CBA) has bauxite {{processing}} plants at Poços de Caldas and Itamarati de Minas, {{and a new}} processing plant at Miraí that has been operating since June, 2008; {{all of them are}} in the State of Minas Gerais. The plants haveunits for the crushing, scrubbing and screening operations. The screened oversize is the concentrate or washed bauxite. At Itamarati de Minas, the fines are <b>de-slimed</b> and concentrated by gravity separation of the iron-titanium minerals in Reichert spirals followed by HIWMS. The tailings still contain bauxite, which can be separated by reverse froth flotation (flotation of the quartz and depression of the bauxite), using starch as a depressant and amine as a promoter; the pH must be around 10. 0. The iron and titanium bearing minerals are depressed with the bauxite and an additional magnetic separation operation is necessary on the depressed bauxite.

40|$|The {{development}} of plasma-jet spray-coating techniques for producing clad ceramic fuel plates is discussed. Conditions for spraying fused UO/sub 2 / powder were established by depositing cones on stationary substrates. It {{was found that}} the arc-gas flow range within which deposition occurs is very narrow. Coatings were made from [...] 200 + 325, [...] 270 + 325, and <b>de-slimed</b> - 325 mesh fused UO/ sub 2 / powders. To provide data regarding the economics of the process, deposition rates and efficiencies were determined under various conditions. The effects of powder size, power input, arcgas flow rate, spray distance, traverse rate, power feed rate, powder-gas flow rate, and cover-gas flow rate on deposition efficiency are discussed. Oxygen-to-uranium ratios of coatings made for evaluation of density were determined by gravimetric and volumetric methods.

40|$|Anglo American Kumba Iron Ore, {{a member}} of the Anglo American plc group, owns {{high-quality}} resource bases in both South Africa and Brazil. One of these, Sishen iron ore mine, is a South African mine, where lumpy high-grade hematite ore is treated. As these easily treatable resources depletes, alternative processing methods need to be investigated to ensure sustainability. Low-grade iron ores are commonly beneficiated by a combination of magnetic separation, gravity separation and direct- or reverse flotation. Fine size iron ore fractions, less than 150 micron, requires flotation to be beneficiated to high-grade saleable iron ore product for pelletizing. Three flotation routes have been developed for iron ores outside of Africa: (i) reverse cationic flotation of quartz; (ii) direct anionic flotation of iron oxides; and (iii) reverse anionic flotation of activated quartz. Although vast ores of increasingly complex nature have been identified in Africa, existing literature does not mention any iron ore flotation practices that are currently employed or investigated on this continent. The aim {{of this study was to}} prove that low grade Sishen banded iron ore can be upgraded to a saleable iron product by froth flotation. This was proven by a mineralogical study of banded low grade Sishen iron ore; the evaluation of suitable reagent suites; flotation cell conditions; additional beneficiation circuit stages; evaluation of the developed flotation regime on varied feed compositions and determination of correlations between the mineral liberation analysis and flotation results. The fundamental mechanism for selective flotation of hematite is attributed to the selective depression of hematite, where quartz particles may be removed from hematite in a narrow pH range. In this pH range, amine collectors form an ion-molecular complex, which induces hydrophobicity on the surface of quartz particles and attain its frothing character. Reverse cationic flotation is the most-common approach for hematite-quartz separation. Amines are used as collecting reagent; two amine variants supplied by Clariant, have been identified to exhibiting superior silica collecting performance. Starch is the most commonly employed hematite depressant. The ore characterisation of seven clearly identified low grade banded iron formation, BIF, iron ore samples from Sishen iron ore mine, and an equal blend of these seven BIF samples comprises of Chemical composition (by x-ray fluorescence, XRF), mineralogical composition (x-ray diffraction, XRD and mineral liberation analysis, MLA), particle size distribution (sieve tests and laser diffraction) and mineral liberation (by scanning electron microscopy, SEM and MLA). Baseline flotation parameters for reverse flotation of low grade Sishen iron ore BIF, which included bench-scale laboratory flotation tests were established by the evaluation of the depressant type, depressant dosage and depressant dosing stage, dispersant type and dispersant dosage, collector dosage and mixed collector ratio, grinding size and flotation circuit configuration. Results from this investigation identify hematite as the main iron bearing mineral in low grade Sishen iron ore and quartz as the main gangue mineral, with limited amounts of annite and kaolinite. The iron content ranges between 25 % and 39 % for the received individual samples. The particle size distribution, with 80 % passing 1. 1 mm, was too coarse for flotation. Grinding curves were constructed to produce a fine flotation, medium flotation and coarse flotation particle size range. Laboratory bench scale flotation tests confirm strong pH dependence for the recovery of hematite, where a natural hydrophobicity is exhibited at pH 7. These tests confirmed that caustisized starch is a suitable depressant for hematite minerals in a low grade Sishen BIF iron ore and that the addition of sodium silicate dispersant may improve the iron product grade. The depressant dosage has a minor effect on the flotation results, and the depressant mechanism is largely dependent on the flotation pulp pH. Froth stability is greatly influenced by a change in the amine collector dosage, where excessive amounts of fine particles also over stabilise the froth bed and it is not possible to control the froth bed height at collector dosages of larger than 25 g/t/stage. Alteration of the flotation circuit, from a six stage rougher float to a nine stage rougher float and six stage scavenger float, after additional milling and depressant dosing, yielded the required target of at least 64 % Fe and 30 % recovery to the tails(iron product). With no preparation by <b>de-sliming,</b> an iron recovery of 34. 7 % to the iron product can be achieved by flotation alone. At 66. 4 % iron, MLA analysis confirmed the iron product to be of a saleable high grade. The MLA analysis also showed the limit of flotation performance to be an excessive entrainment of iron-containing particles after the second scavenger flotation stage. The use of this reagent suite on individual BIF ores shows that more than 98. 5 % of the silicate materials can be removed to the froth phase. As with the composite BIF material, an additional scavenger stage is required to reach the target percentage iron recovery of 30 %.
