In this pattern, the horns of each side are fused with the corresponding arm, filling the space between them, and resulting in a much thicker body. Also arms and feet of each side are partially fused, giving a more rounded aspect. T. rorschachi (Figure  8 h,i,j,k,l,m,n) may be distinguished from T. galaga by the feet squared and the <b>horns</b> further <b>fused</b> to each other, filling the central concavity.

50|$|The African forest buffalo is {{a smaller}} variety of African buffalo. Cape buffalo weigh {{anywhere}} from 400 to 800 kg (880-1760 lbs), whereas African forest buffalo are much lighter, weighing in at 250 to 320 kg (550-705 lbs). Weight {{is not the}} only differentiation, however; this subspecies has reddish brown hide that is darker in the facial area. The shape and size of the horns distinguish forest buffalo from other subspecies. African forest buffalo have much smaller horns than their savanna counterparts, the Cape buffalo. Cape buffalo horns often grow and fuse together, but forest buffalo <b>horns</b> rarely <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The mare has two ovaries, usually [...] {{in length}} and [...] thick, that {{generally}} tend to decrease in size as the mare ages. In equine ovaries, unlike in humans, the vascular tissue is cortical to follicular tissue, so ovulation can only occur at an ovulation fossa near the infundibulum. The ovaries connect to the fallopian tubes (oviducts), which serve to move the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. To do so, the oviducts are lined {{with a layer of}} cilia, which produce a current that flows toward the uterus. Each oviduct attaches to one of the two horns of the uterus, which are approximately [...] in length. These horns attach to the body of the uterus ( [...] long). The equine uterus is bipartite, meaning the two uterine <b>horns</b> <b>fuse</b> into a relatively large uterine body (resembling a shortened bicornuate uterus or a stretched simplex uterus).

5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls.

5000|$|W. Franklin Dove {{acknowledged}} that horns don't actually grow from the skull, but instead, {{they are actually}} unattached bits of tissue that eventually root {{their way into the}} skull. He also did more in-depth research about horns and learned that people before him have been creating [...] "unicorn" [...] animals. For example, some sheep were made into single horned sheep by branding two- or three-month-old lambs on their horn buds and then treating them with a mixture of oil and soot while they were healing so that the horns grew {{from the middle of the}} skull. So, Dove reasoned that the positioning of the horns is quite open to natural or artificial variation which would mean that [...] "unicorns" [...] were not a total contradiction of the laws of nature. To test his theory, he took a day old calf and surgically removed its horn buds and cut them so that they would fit together, and then implanted them in the center of the calf's head. The circular horn buds were trimmed flat at their point of contact so as to provide a larger [...] surface. It was expected that the two <b>horn</b> buds would <b>fuse</b> together to form one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located somewhat between the eyes to mimic the horn of the unicorn. The experiment was proven to be successful as the bull grew the <b>horn</b> buds <b>fused</b> together and started to form a single, straight horn about a foot in length. The horn functioned very well for the bull, perhaps even better than the normal horns the bulls have. The bull eventually became the leader of its herd and was rarely challenged. An interesting side effect of this horn was the bulls abnormally docile personality. He also created [...] "unicorns" [...] out of goats as well as cows. Besides making [...] "unicorns" [...] he also made tri-horned animals.|$|R
5000|$|Monoclonius was Edward Drinker Cope's third named ceratopsian, after Agathaumas and Polyonax. Several fossils {{were found}} by Cope, {{assisted}} {{by a young}} Charles Hazelius Sternberg, {{in the summer of}} 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana, only about a hundred miles (some 150 km) from the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, fought that June. The finds did not represent a single, let alone articulated, skeleton, but came from different locations. Together they included elements of most parts of the animal (only the feet were entirely missing), including the base part of a long nasal horn, part of the skull frill, brow <b>horns,</b> three <b>fused</b> cervical vertebrae, a sacrum, a shoulder girdle, an ilium, an ischium, two thighbones, a shinbone, a fibula and parts of a forelimb. Just two weeks after leaving Montana, Cope hastily described and named these finds on 30 October 1876 as the type species Monoclonius crassus. The specific name means [...] "the fat one" [...] in Latin. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The skull frill he interpreted as an episternum, an ossified part of the breastbone, and the fused cervicals he assumed to be anterior dorsals.|$|R
50|$|The Navajo-Churro breed rams {{can have}} two, four, six, or more horns. This {{is because they}} possess the polycerate gene, which {{is also found in}} old {{heritage}} breeds like the Jacob Sheep. They also have the ability to have <b>fused</b> <b>horns.</b> Ewes also can have horns, or nubs called scurrs. The color can be black, white, or striped. The growth of rams’ horns is slow. A full rack takes at least four to five years to grow out. A ewe's horns can also grow large, but not to the extent of the rams. The horns often curl around to the front, and should be away, and not close to the face. The horn quality is essential to getting good genetics in a flock; bad horns in the sire will continue down through his offspring. Horns can break, and as they are living at the base, they will bleed.|$|R

500|$|The horned dinosaurs {{discovered}} by Horner exemplified this phenomenon.

50|$|On March, 1933, an {{operation}} {{was performed on}} a day-old male Ayrshire calf.

The frontal periosteum it was expected that the two <b>horns</b> would <b>fuse</b> together into one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located above and between the eyes. The experiment was successful, at the age of two years the two buds have formed together into one large horn molded into the forehead for support. What makes this unicorn different from the other ones is all in the horn, unlike the other unicorns the horn spike grew from the skull instead of upon. A single united sheath covers the horn spike, the horn curves slightly upward toward the tip and gracefully extends the curve of the back and neck when the animal stands at attention. Like that of a mythical unicorn described by Ctesias and Fresnel, the horn sheath is white or grayish-white at the base and is tipped with black. (Had the unicorn been a female, the horn would be tipped with red, since the color appears as a sex-limited factor in this particular breed. This Ayrshire bull, whose Scottish ancestors flourished under King James VI, who, as James I of England put the unicorn on England's coat of arms, is a true unicorn. Although it is an animal with the hereditary potentiality for two horns, he recognizes the power of a single horn which he uses as a prow to pass under fences and barriers in his path.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, {{the study}} by Horner e.a. tried {{to account for the}} fact that within a limited {{geological}} period of time, about half a million years, there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. One possible explanation could be that this had been caused by a series of invasions, the new animal types replacing the old ones. Horner however, noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not real species but transitional forms. This was confirmed by the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. A further indication was the failure to identify true autapomorphies, unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal, original, into more derived or advanced characters.The horned dinosaurs discovered by Horner exemplified this phenomenon. In the lowest layers of the formation [...] "Transitional taxon A" [...] was present.
