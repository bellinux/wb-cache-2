The specification of these heavy metals does usualy prevent a utilization. Hence a special solvent extraction process has been developed for the removal and the recovery of Hg(II) from acid <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> solutions. The process is based upon extraction of chloromercurat complexes {{by means of the}} anionexchanger Aliquat 336 solved in a mixture of n-paraffins and 1 -decanole. After multiple washing stages the mercury is stripped using an aqueous ethylenediamine solution. The process was tested on a semi-technical scale for feed solutions containing hydrochloric acid in a concentration range of 0. 5 - 5 mole/l. Model solutions as well as <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> solutions from the TAMARA test incinerator for municipal solid waste have been used. The mercury can easily be recovered out of the stripping phase by electrolysis. The described solvent extraction process can also be applied to the recovery of cadmium and zinc. (orig.)

40|$|Electric power {{generation}} {{represents one of}} the largest sources of CO 2 emissions in North America. A major issue in the analysis of CO 2 mitigation options is the fact that over 45 % of total electric {{power generation}} in North America is from coal. These existing coal-based power plants have the highest CO 2 emissions of any power systems yet are the lowest cost electric generators. Retrofit CO 2 reduction or recovery of existing coal-based power plants has definite advantages—using the existing site infrastructure, having facilities that are mostly paid-off or amortized, and having high baseline CO 2 emissions. However, retrofits also have disadvantages—significant capacity and efficiency losses that require replacement capacity addition, and increased fuel use depending on the choice of CO 2 mitigation technology. TransAlta is a major coal-based electric power generator in Canada and the United States. As discussed at www. transalta. com in the Sustainable Development section under “Our Actions,” TransAlta has a goal of zero net greenhouse gas emission (including trading and offsets) for its Canadian operations by 2024. As part of this ambitious goal, TransAlta funded site-specific analysis by engineering vendors of two noteworthy PC retrofit CO 2 capture options: <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> (amine) and oxygen combustion with <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> recycle.

40|$|The project {{objective}} is to demonstrate removal of 90 [...] 95 % {{or more of the}} SO{sub 2 } at approximately one-half the cost of conventional scrubbing technology; and to demonstrate significant reduction of space requirements. In this project, Pure Air has built a single SO{sub 2 } absorber for a 528 -MWe power plant. The absorber performs three functions in a single vessel: prequencher, absorber, and oxidation of sludge to gypsum. Additionally, the absorber is of a co- current design, in which the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>scrubbing</b> slurry move in the same direction and at a relatively high velocity compared to conventional scrubbers. These features all combine to yield a state- of-the-art SO{sub 2 } absorber that is more compact and less expensive than conventional scrubbers. The project incorporated a number of technical features including the injection of pulverized limestone directly into the absorber, a device called an air rotary sparger located within the base of the absorber, and a novel wastewater evaporation system. The air rotary sparger combines the functions of agitation and air distribution into one piece of equipment to facilitate the oxidation of calcium sulfite to gypsum.

It was predicted that the efficiency penalty for CO 2 capture for PC plant with <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> using an amine solvent can be reduced to 20 per cent (from 28 per cent) with improved thermodynamic integration and lower-energy solvent, giving a 10 per cent reduction in electricity costs, from $ 63. 5 /MWh to $ 57. 4 /MWh, and a 25 per cent reduction in the cost of CO 2 avoided, from $ 45 /t to $ 34 /t. These values are both lower than predictions for the gasifier-based coal power plant in the original IEA GHG study. Reductions in the average cost of electricity of 6 – 7 per cent were estimated using solvent storage, giving a cost of electricity of $ 56. 73 /MWh and $ 33 /t CO 2 avoided for an integrated plant with monoethanolamine (MEA) as the solvent.

40|$|The minimisation {{of water}} {{consumption}} in waste-to-energy (WtE) plants {{is an outstanding}} issue, especially in those regions where water supply is critical and withdrawals come from municipal waterworks. Among the various possible solutions, the most general, simple and effective one is the reuse of process water. This paper discusses the effectiveness of two different reuse options in an Italian WtE plant, starting from the analytical characterisation and the flow-rate measurement of fresh water and process water flows derived from each utility internal to the WtE plant (e. g. cooling, bottom ash quenching, <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> wet <b>scrubbing).</b> This census allowed identifying the possible direct connections that optimise the reuse scheme, avoiding additional water treatments. The effluent of the physical–chemical wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located in the WtE plant, was considered not adequate to be directly reused because of the possible deposition of mineral salts and clogging potential associated to residual suspended solids. Nevertheless, to obtain high reduction in water consumption, reverse osmosis should be installed to remove non-metallic ions (Cl, SO 4 2) and residual organic and inorganic pollutants. Two efficient solutions were identified. The first, a simple reuse scheme based on a cascade configuration, allowed 45 % reduction in water consumption (from 1. 81 to 0. 99 m 3 t M 1 SW, MSW: Municipal Solid Waste) without specific water treatments. The second solution, a cascade configuration with a recycle based on a reverse osmosis process, allowed 74 % reduction in water consumption (from 1. 81 to 0. 46 m 3 t M 1 SW).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Because direct mercury {{measurements}} are difficult throughout the postcombustion flue gas environment, it is practical to use mercury reaction kinetics to theoretically determine mercury speciation based upon coal composition, plant equipment, and operating conditions. Elemental mercury cannot be captured in wet scrubbers; however, its oxidized forms can. Mercury-bromine oxidation kinetics {{have been studied}} with electronic structure calculations using {{a broad range of}} ab initio methods. Reaction enthalpies, equilibrium bond distances, vibrational frequencies, and rate constants have all been predicted using density functional theory as well as coupled cluster methods. Upon the basis of comparisons to available experimental and high-level theoretical data in the literature, quantum-basedmethods for the following Hg-Br reactions have been validated: Hgþ BrTHgBr, Hgþ Br 2 THgBrþ Br, and HgBrþ BrTHgBr 2. The use of these methods for predicting forward and reverse rate constants for the following Hg-Br reactions has been carried out for the first time: Hg þ HBrT HgBr þ H, HgBr þ Br 2 T HgBr 2 þ Br, and HgBr þ HBrT HgBr 2 þ H.

40|$|The use of {{synthesis}} gas fed sulfate-reducing bioreactors to simultaneously remove both oxidized sulfur compounds and metals shows great potential to treat wastewaters generated {{as a result}} of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> mining activities and galvanic processes. Detailed information about the phylogenetic and functional composition of the microbial communities within these bioreactors however was limited prior of this study. In order to understand and enable the effective control of performance of these bioreactors, an increased understanding of the microbial aspects of sulfate-reducing {{synthesis gas}} fed bioreactorsis required. 16 S rRNA gene analysis demonstrated that the bacterial communities were dominated by the sulfate-reducing genera Desulfovibrio and Desuifomicrobium. Archaeal communities were comprised of microorganisms belonging to the methanogenic genus Methanobacterium. Synthesis gas fed bioreactors however were also able to sustain a diverse bacterial community, not limited to hydrogenotrophic microorganisms. Abundant 16 S rRNA clones were also found which showed affiliation to the proteolytic microorganism Proteiniphilum acetatigenes and uncultured Thermotogales, while other clones clustered within the Chloroflexi subphylum I. A putative role for these organisms as scavengers of dead microbial cells was hypothesized. Due to the relatively short sludge retention time in these bioreactors hydrogen threshold concentrations are not reached, and instead Monod kinetic parameters controls hydrogen competition. As a result of fluctuations in operating conditions at full-scale a continuous state of hydrogen limitation may not be reached, resuiting in suppression of methanogenesis being a slow process. Limiting the carbon dioxide feed rate appeared to be a very effective selective tool to control methanogenesis at full scale, although it did not lead to the complete removal of methanogens from the system. Heterotrophic SRB and homoacetogens were able to coexist when H 2, CO 2 and sulfate were supplied as the sole substrates as they were not limited by the same substrate; homoacetogens being hydrogen limited, while heterotrophic SRB were acetate limited. This consortium was able to compete effectively with methanogens, as the growth rate of even autotrophic methanogens is negatively affected by the lack of acetate. Even though homoacetogens are reported to have a high hydrogen threshold and a low ?™, they posses a high affinity (K 5), which gives them a kinetic advantage over methanogens with intermediate growth rates (0. 15 - 0. 50 day" 1) at 300 CAs growth of methanogens is affected by the availability of acetate, limiting the addition of acetate to the feed of synthesis gas fed bioreactors may provide an additional tool to selectively control methanogenesis. In conclusion,the increased understanding of the microbial communities ofsu!fate-reducing synthesis gas fed bioreactors has provided greater insight into the competition for hydrogen and possibilities to control unwanted methanogenesis. Furthermore, the performance and stability of a full-scale reactor over a period of 128 weeks, demonstrate that this technology can be used successfully at full scale to treat sulfate and metal rich wastewaters...|$|E

The increase of the wood biomass humidity from the value of 10 % to 60 % with the outlet temperature of <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> from the boiler 120 °C causes an increase in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss of the boiler from the value 8. 37 % to 12. 43 %, similarly the increase of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss by 200 °C from 15. 19 % to 22. 55 %, or the increase of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss by 7. 36 %...|$|R
40|$|New <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> {{desulfurization}} (FGD) <b>scrubbing</b> technologies {{create a}} dry, solid by-product material consisting of excess sorbent, reaction product that contains sulfate and sulfite, and coal fly ash. Generally, dry FGD by-products {{are treated as}} solid wastes and disposed in landfills. However, landfill sites are becoming scarce and tipping fees are constantly increasing. Provided the environmental impacts are socially and scientifically acceptable, beneficial uses via recycling can provide economic benefits to both the producer and the end user of the FGD. A study titled ''Land Application Uses for Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization By-Products'' was initiated in December, 1990 to develop and demonstrate large volume, beneficial uses of FGD by-products. Phase 1 and Phase 2 reports have been published by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Palo Alto, CA. Phase 3 objectives were to demonstrate, using field studies, the beneficial uses of FGD by-products (1) as an amendment material on agricultural lands and on abandoned surface coal mine land, (2) as an engineering material for soil stabilization and raid repair, and (3) to assess the environmental and economic impacts of such beneficial uses. Application of dry FGD by-product to three soils in place of agricultural limestone increased alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and corn (Zea may L.) yields. No detrimental effects on soil and plant quality were observed...|$|R

40|$|This project {{dealt with}} use of {{condensing}} heat exchangers to recover water vapor from <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> at coal-fired power plants. Pilot-scale heat transfer tests were performed to determine the relationship between <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> moisture concentration, heat exchanger design and operating conditions, and water vapor condensation rate. The tests also determined {{the extent to which}} the condensation processes for water and acid vapors in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> can be made to occur separately in different heat transfer sections. The results showed <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> water vapor condensed in the low temperature region of the heat exchanger system, with water capture efficiencies depending strongly on <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> moisture content, cooling water inlet temperature, heat exchanger design and <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and cooling water flow rates. Sulfuric acid vapor condensed in both the high temperature and low temperature regions of the heat transfer apparatus, while hydrochloric and nitric acid vapors condensed with the water vapor in the low temperature region. Measurements made of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> mercury concentrations upstream and downstream of the heat exchangers showed a significant reduction in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> mercury concentration within the heat exchangers. A theoretical heat and mass transfer model was developed for predicting rates of heat transfer and water vapor condensation and comparisons were made with pilot scale measurements. Analyses were also carried out to estimate how much <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> moisture it would be practical to recover from boiler <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and the magnitude of the heat rate improvements which could be made by recovering sensible and latent heat from <b>flue</b> <b>gas...</b>|$|R
