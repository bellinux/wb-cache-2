50|$|In geology, an <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surface</b> is {{a surface}} of {{constant}} density. Isopycnic surfaces occur especially {{in connection with}} cratons which are very old geologic formations {{at the core of}} the continents, little affected by tectonic events. These formations are often known as shields or platforms. These formations are, relative to other lithospheric formations, cooler and less dense but much more isopycnic.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in a near-eddy-resolving model of the Southern Ocean (FRAM) are investigated. A streamwise coordinate system is used, rather than a more conventional approach of considering zonally averaged quantities. The motivation for this approach is the large deviation from a purely zonal flow made by the current. Comparisons are made with a zonal-mean analysis of the same model. It is found that the topographic form drag is the main sink of the momentum that is input by the wind. However, {{in contrast to a}} zonal-mean analysis other terms, namely, horizontal mixing, bottom friction, and advection of momentum, are no longer negligible. The total effect of transient eddies is to produce a drag on the mean flow, again in contrast to the zonally averaged case. The vertical penetration of stress is considered. A generalized formula is derived for the interfacial form stress averaged along a convoluted path and that includes nonquasigeostrophic effects. The interfacial form stress is found to be related not only to the local wind stress but also to changes in stratification and the Coriolis parameter along the path of integration. The vertical gradient of the extra terms is found to be proportional to the quasimeridional velocity averaged along an <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surface.</b> Using the model data, the nonquasigeostrophic effects are found to be important, particularly toward the northern flank of the ACC. Relating the vertical shear of the flow to the interfacial form stress, it is shown that the vertical structure of the flow is set by a combination of the wind stress and the meridional overturning. There is, therefore, an intimate linking of the wind and thermohaline-driven circulations...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "isopycnic" [...] is {{commonly}} {{encountered in the}} fluid dynamics of compressible fluids, such as in meteorology and geophysical fluid dynamics, astrophysics, or the fluid dynamics of explosions or high Mach number flows. It may also be applied to other situations where a continuous medium has smoothly-varying density, {{such as in the}} case of an inhomogeneous colloidal suspension. In general <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces</b> will occur in fluids in hydrostatic equilibrium coinciding with equipotential surfaces formed by gravity.|$|R
5000|$|A {{barotropic}} flow is a {{generalization of}} a barotropic atmosphere. It is a flow {{in which the}} pressure {{is a function of}} the density only and vice versa. In other words, it is a flow in which isobaric <b>surfaces</b> are <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces</b> and vice versa. One may have a barotropic flow of a non-barotropic fluid, but a barotropic fluid will always follow a barotropic flow. Examples include barotropic layers of the oceans, an isothermal ideal gas or an isentropic ideal gas.|$|R
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that {{observed}} zonal currents in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn correspond {{to a state of}} permanent rotation, and that the angular velocity is constant on cylindrical surfaces parallel to the rotation axis. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a rotating planet is solved under these restrictive assumptions, and the effect of the hypothesized rotation state on the planet's gravity harmonics and external shape is investigated. Spacecraft data on zonal currents are used to derive nearly model-independent corrections to the first four zonal gravity harmonic coefficients, which can be used to correct observed gravity harmonics to values appropriate for solid-body rotation. If the assumed rotation state is applicable, then zonal currents lead to measurable topography of <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces</b> with respect to the reference figure defined by the magnetospheric rotation period and the gravity harmonics. The amplitude of the topography is on the order of 5 km for Jupiter and 60 km for Saturn...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{behavior}} of fluid particles/parcels that move along <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The aim {{is to show that}} the diffusive process of mixing by eddies causes such particles to move toward regions of greater isopycnic layer thickness or, equivalently, weaker stratification. This is illustrated using a wind-driven eddy-resolving isopycnic layer model in a zonal channel configuration. Particles and tracers are integrated to demonstrate that their centers of mass move up the layer thickness gradient. In particular, a field of uniformly distributed particles is seen to move toward regions of large layer thickness, so the distribution of particles becomes asymmetric. The asymmetry is most obvious when the gradient of layer thickness is large in comparison to the volume of the layer. In the ocean, in the absence of other influences such as advection and varying diffusivity, one might expect isopycnic floats released in the upper thermocline to show a similar asymmetric behavior...|$|R
50|$|The world's oceans {{are made}} up of many {{different}} water masses. Each have particular temperature and salinity characteristics {{as a result of the}} location in which they formed. Once formed at a particular source, a water mass will travel some distance via large-scale ocean circulation. Typically, the flow of water in the ocean is described as turbulent (i.e. it doesn't follow straight lines). Water masses can travel across the ocean as turbulent eddies, or parcels of water usually along constant density (<b>isopycnic)</b> <b>surfaces</b> where the expenditure of energy is smallest. When these turbulent eddies of different water masses interact, they will mix together. With enough mixing, some stable equilibrium is reached and a mixed layer is formed. Turbulent eddies can also be produced from wind stress by the atmosphere on the ocean. This kind of interaction and mixing through buoyancy at the surface of the ocean also plays a role in the formation of a surface mixed layer.|$|R
40|$|Using a two-layer model {{driven by}} the annual change in wind stress, Isobe and Imawaki (2002) {{suggested}} that the topographic effect of Izu-Ogasawara Ridge generates the baroclinic activity through the impinging process due to the barotropic response over the bottom slope, {{but there is no}} observed evidence for such process. 　To seek the indirect evidence of the impinging process in this study, seasonal variations of isopycnic vertical displacement over the ridge are investigated through analysis of monthly sea level at Chichijima and hydrographic data around the Ogasawara islands. 　Although annual signals of sea level and density field were largely masked by the westward propagating synoptic eddies with several-month time scale, we could detect annual cycle of <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces</b> around the permanent pycnocline out of phase with that of sea surface mixed layer, i. e., it moves downward in summer (May to July) and upward in winter (November to January). 　Furthermore, this annual cycle was relatively amplified along the eastern hydrographic line at the intruding side of westward propagating barotropic waves. 　These results indirectly support the seasonal occurrence of impinging over the ridge...|$|R

40|$|Oceanic teleconnections {{between the}} low and {{midlatitudes}} {{are a key}} mechanism to understanding the climate variability. Spiciness anomalies (density-compensated anomalies) {{have been shown to}} transport temperature and salinity signals when propagating along current streamlines in the subtropical gyres of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The generation mechanism of spiciness anomalies in the North Atlantic sub-tropical gyre is investigated using an analytical model based on the late-winter subduction of salinity and temperature anomalies along isopycnal surfaces. The keystone of this approach is the change of the coordinates frame from isobaric to <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces,</b> suited for subduction problems. The isopycnal nature of spiciness anomalies and the use of a linear density equation allows for the analytical model to depend only upon surface temperature and salinity anomalies, the mean thermocline currents, and the surface density ratio. This model clarifies and above all quantifies the mechanism by which surface temperature and salinity anomalies are modulated by density ratios to produce fully different isopycnal temperature and salinity anomalies. A global run from the ocean GCM (OGCM) Océan Parallélise ́ (OPA) over the period 1948 – 2002 provides the reference data in which the North Atlantic subtropical thermocline spiciness variability is analyzed.

50|$|<b>Isopycnic</b> {{typically}} describes <b>surfaces,</b> not processes. Unless {{there is}} a flux of mass into or out of a control volume, a process which occurs at a constant density also occurs at a constant volume and is called an isochoric process and not an isopycnic process.|$|R
40|$|During CTD and {{plankton}} {{surveys in}} the Nordic Seas in November 1991 - 1994, a CTD section has been worked across the Arctic Front between the Lofoten and Greenland Basins. Along this front <b>Isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces</b> slope down from upper layers on its cold {{side in the}} Greenland Basin to intermediate depths of 800 to 1000 m in the warmer waters of the Lofoten Basin. While it earlier has been concluded that intermediate water masses are formed in the Greenland and Iceland Seas during winter, {{it has not been}} clear whether intermediate water sinks in to the Norwegian Sea along the Arctic Front to the northeast of Jan Mayen. The present sections show that such formation may occur in November. This is indicated by narrow filaments of water which is less saline than the ambient water. This water seems to be brought to the front by mesoscale eddies on its cold side. The heaviest water is supplied at depths between about 100 and 500 m. It is therefore not affected by summer warming so that sinking plumes may in principle occur in all seasons. The occurrence of such plumes in two of the four sections suggest that such events may be rather frequent although they are episodic. In general, this may therefore be an important mechanism for formation of intermediate water...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{equations}} of hydrodynamics, which include both collisional and collisionless ideal fluids, the special case of pseudo-barotropes with anisotropic pressure distribution along tangential or vertical direction (in {{respect to a}} ``vertical'' rotation axis) is considered. We find that vertical motions are equivalent to an imaginary rotation, and call ``pseudo-rotation'' the combination of rotation and real or imaginary peculiar circular motions. By use of {{a necessary condition for}} equilibrium, i. e. the coincidence of the boundary with an isopotential (gravitational + rotational centrifugal + real peculiar or imaginary peculiar centrifugal) surface, a new method of finding bifurcation points from axisymmetric to triaxial pseudo-barotropic sequences [...] discussed in an earlier paper [...] is dealt with for the systems under discussion. A simple application to the special case where the <b>isopycnic</b> <b>surfaces</b> are spheroidal discloses that, on one hand, steadily pseudo-rotating, heterogeneous spheroids, cannot be equilibrium configurations and, on the other hand, the same results obtained by use of the virial technique hold when the current method can work. Then the coincidence of the boundary with an isopotential surface and the validity of the virial equations of the second order make two independent (necessary) conditions for equilibrium and both must be satisfied. Under the further assumptions of steady rotation and homeoidally or focaloidally striated distribution of matter, the configurations for which a bifurcation point must necessarily occurr, are determined. In the former alternative a connection is also established, between local (on the boundary) and global anisotropy of pressure distribution; in particular, it is found that local isotropy (on the boundary) involves global isotropy and vice versa. In both cases, the right amount of of anisotropy turns out to yield violation of a threshold for stability, {cal E}_rot = - - E_rot / E_pot <= 0. 14, conjectured by Ostriker and Peebles (1973). This result gives additional support to a conclusion established in an earlier paper: it seems more germane to speak about Ostriker-Peebles conjecture for stability in connection with visible bodies of galaxies, instead of Ostriker-Peebles criterion for stability in connection with self-gravitating fluids...|$|R
