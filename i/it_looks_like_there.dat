50|$|She is strong-headed, impulsive, {{curious and}} {{slightly}} foolish. Aspects of her character that come naturally {{with a young}} teenager who enters puberty, and a great plot device since her repeated stubbornness and inobedience {{is the source of}} many an adventure. Since her emotions and human shortcomings often overpower her rationality, she is sensitive to paranormal and mystical happenings that are routinely dismissed by the others. Her relationship with Spike (both are considered orphans) is mostly one between siblings, although at times <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> are more feelings under the surface, as she can get quite jealous and querulous when Spike gets female attention. Suzy is also a brave girl, {{especially when it comes to}} defending her doll Muffin, for whom she shows unconditional motherly love. Despite her difficult character at times, she appears contrite and righteous. She carries her heart in the right place and won't hesitate to battle injustice.|$|E
5000|$|Next morning Andy (Laws) {{had to give}} a {{group of}} new pilots some {{practise}} flying {{before we went to}} the target range; so as I was badly in need of some practise too I went for a little cross-country jaunt in my machine, familiarising myself with our present sector of operations. While I was up I could hear distant voices over the R/T which I knew were those of Andy and the pilots he was flying with. When I heard them plainly I could tell it was usually Andy giving one of the others some order, or coaching them on their flying. I didn't pay much attention to what was being said, but I noticed that when I was returning to the airdrome Control seemed to be calling [...] "Yellow One" [...] and having difficulty in getting a reply."The leader of Yellow section was Andy, and he wasn't having trouble with his R/T.

After half an hour's dumb sad waiting around the telephone in our pilots' hut we heard the story.

Nels had managed to land safely at another airdrome, as his machine wasn't badly damaged.|$|E
