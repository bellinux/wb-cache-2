50|$|Many small kits {{will come}} with a tissue paper {{covering}} that then gets covered with multiple layers of plane dope which coats and strengthens the fuselage and wings in a plastic-like covering. It has become more common to cover planes with <b>heat-shrinking</b> plastic films backed with heat-sensitive adhesive. These films are generally known as 'iron-on covering' since a hand-held iron allows the film to {{be attached to the}} frame; a higher temperature then causes the film to tighten. This plastic covering is more durable and makes for a quick repair. Other varieties of heat shrinkable coverings are also available, that have fibrous reinforcements within the plastic film, or are actual woven heat shrinkable fabrics.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} quantum theory of {{distances}} along a curve, {{based on a}} linear line element that {{is equal to the}} operator square root of the quadratic metric of Riemannian geometry. Since the linear line element is an operator, we treat it according to the rules of quantum mechanics and interpret its eigenvalues as physically observable distances; the distance eigenvalues are naturally quantized. There are both positive and negative eigenvalues, which requires interpretation. Multi-element curves are defined as direct sums of line elements, and behave much like systems of spin half electrons in a magnetic field. For a curve of many elements an entropy and energy and temperature are quite naturally defined, leading via standard statistical thermodynamics to a relation between the most probable curve length and temperature. That relation may be viewed as a universal <b>heat-shrinking</b> property of curves. At this stage of the theory we do not include bodies or particles in the mix, do not suggest field equations for the quantum geometry, and questions of interpretation remain. The theory might conceivably be testable using observations of the early Universe, when the temperature of space was presumably quite high. In particular cosmogenesis may be thought of as time stopping at an infinite temperature as we go backwards in time to the beginning.

40|$|Surfaces with {{controlled}} micro and nanoscale topographical cues {{are useful}} as smart scaffolds and biointerfaces for cell culture. Recently, use of thin-film and surface wrinkling {{is emerging as}} a rapid unconventional method for preparing topographically patterned surfaces, especially suited {{for the production of}} smart patterns over large area surfaces. On the other hand, there is an increasing interest in employing conducting polymers as soft, biocompatible, conductive biointerfaces or as parts of bioelectronic devices. A novel convenient and versatile method is presented for producing anisotropic topographical cues at the micro- and nanoscale on conducting polymer surfaces. Micro and nanowrinkles were formed during the <b>heat-shrinking</b> process of a thermo-retractable polystyrene substrate. Surface wrinkling was due to the mismatch between the mechanical properties of a conducting polymer ultrathin film and the substrate. Various geometries of wrinkled structures were prepared, demonstrating the tunability of topography depending on the thickness of the conductive film. A method for patterning the conductive properties of the wrinkled substrates was also presented. Such surfaces acted as smart scaffolds for the functional alignment of cells, envisioning their electrical stimulation. Cell adhesion and proliferation were evaluated, comparing different topographies, and a preferential anisotropic alignment of C 2 C 12 murine skeletal muscle cells along wrinkles was demonstrated. The observed trends were also confirmed concerning the formation of aligned myotubes in C 2 C 12 differentiation stage. Furthermore, improved results in terms of aligned and mature myotube formation were obtained by co-culturing C 2 C 12 cells with a fibroblasts feeder layer. The combination of living cells and tunable conductive nanowrinkles will represent a unique tool for the development of innovative biomedical devices...|$|E

The <b>heat-shrink</b> packaging scheme is extremely robust and can with-stand> 2000 mmHg (266. 6 kPa) without leakage. Three different valve geometries were investigated and evaluated with theoretical and finite-element modeling analyses. Repeated flow regulation experiments on a fully packaged, hydrated valve demonstrated flow regulation between 25 and 2000 mmHg (3. 33 – 266. 6 kPa) and leak-free closure up to 500 mmHg (66. 7 kPa) of reverse pressure with no observed stiction.

50|$|<b>Heat-shrink</b> tubing (or, commonly, {{heat shrink}} or heatshrink) is a {{shrinkable}} plastic tube used to insulate wires, providing abrasion resistance {{and environmental protection}} for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in electrical work. It {{can also be used}} to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. <b>Heat-shrink</b> tubing is ordinarily made of nylon or polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Polyolefin tubes, {{the most}} common kind, have maximum continuous-use {{temperatures}} from -55 to 135 °C, and are used by the military, aerospace and railway industries. They are flexible and fast-shrinking, and manufactured {{in a wide range}} of colors (including clear), which can be used for color-coding wires. With the exception of black, they tend to have lower resistance to ultraviolet light; accordingly, only black is recommended for outdoor applications. Polyolefin tubing shrinks at 143°C. Polyolefin <b>heat-shrink</b> tubing typically shrinks 2:1 diametrically, but high-grade polyolefin <b>heat-shrink</b> is also available with a 3:1 ratio. Polyolefin tubing may withstand being touched with a soldering iron.|$|R

40|$|The balloon {{catheters}} produced by Boston Scientific are manufactured using a laser bonding process. The behaviour {{of the materials}} during this laser welding process is not very well understood. In this work a computational model of this process was created which will help predict the behaviour of the materials during bonding and will increase understanding of the laser bonding process. The two parts being bonded are cylindrical and are both made of a thermoplastic polymer called PEBAXÂ®. During the bonding process, these cylindrical parts are surrounded by a <b>heat-shrink</b> tubing which applies a pressure to the PEBAXÂ® parts when heated. The heat and pressure cause the PEBAXÂ® to melt and flow. Modelling the <b>heat-shrink</b> tubing and the melt flow during the laser welding process are key aims of this work. A thermal model of the process was created by modelling the laser absorption and heat transfer through the assembly. This was compared with previous work and validated with experimental data. The PEBAXÂ® was modelled as a viscoelastic material which transitions from relatively rigid to very compliant as it passes its melting temperature. Extensive experimental testing was performed to characterise the <b>heat-shrink</b> tubing. The <b>heat-shrink</b> tubing was modelled using two shape memory models from the literature. These two models were implemented into Abaqus FEA using two user defined material subroutines (UMATs). A thermo-mechanical finite element model of the bonding process was then created in Abaqus FEA {{and the results were}} compared with experimental data. This model captures the overall behaviour of the materials during the bonding process, providing predictions of melt flow. The results are compared with the experimentally observed melt flow providing new knowledge on the thermo-mechanical behaviour during the laser bonding process of {{balloon catheters}}...|$|R
