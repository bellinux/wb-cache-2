5|$|In particular, δ is an <b>infinitely</b> {{differentiable}} distribution.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of such graphs, with simultaneously increasing values of both parameters, gives <b>infinitely</b> many incomparable graphs (an antichain in the homomorphism preorder).|$|E
5|$|If i < j, {{it follows}} from the {{definition}} that s'j ≡ 1 (mod s'i). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's sequence are relatively prime. The sequence {{can be used to}} prove that there are <b>infinitely</b> many prime numbers, as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence. More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the sequence can be used to prove that there are <b>infinitely</b> many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).|$|E
5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; that is, every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In both cases, all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can {{be generalized to}} infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with <b>infinitely</b> many rows and columns, see below.|$|E
5|$|He {{waited for}} a {{solution}} to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied {{the solution to the}} problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation {{that could be used to}} solve the <b>infinitely</b> nested radicals problem.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of <b>infinitely</b> small radius, and a line may be thought of an <b>infinitely</b> large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
5|$|The single live cell of the {{starting}} configuration is a sawtooth pattern. This {{means that in}} some time steps the numbers of live cells grow arbitrarily large while in others they return to only two live cells, <b>infinitely</b> often.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Citizen Kane, that mysterious, dark, and <b>infinitely</b> deep world {{of space and}} memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the {{starting}} point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being <b>infinitely</b> divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which <b>infinitely</b> large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E
5|$|Super Smash Bros. has {{received}} praise for its multiplayer mode. Nintendo Power listed the series as {{being one of}} the greatest multiplayer experiences in Nintendo history, describing it as <b>infinitely</b> replayable due to its special moves and close-quarters combat. There were criticisms, however, such as the game's scoring being difficult to follow. In addition, the single-player mode was criticized for its perceived difficulty and lack of features.|$|E
5|$|The {{inception}} of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg, Born and Jordan led to studying matrices with <b>infinitely</b> many rows and columns. Later, von Neumann {{carried out the}} mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, by further developing functional analytic notions such as linear operators on Hilbert spaces, which, very roughly speaking, correspond to Euclidean space, but with an infinity of independent directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are <b>infinitely</b> many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} {{was thought}} lost until {{the discovery of}} the Archimedes Palimpsest in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses infinitesimals, and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of <b>infinitely</b> small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written {{in the form of a}} letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Moon III {{involved}} {{a completely new}} set of systems, up to date, and <b>infinitely</b> more capable than those previously installed. An entire new aircraft sub-variant, the B-57G, was developed for the purpose with a redefined nose to house the new sensor package. Development of the aircraft experienced major delays during which it was equipped with a laser target designated {{to be used with}} the then new first-generation Pave Way laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|When {{started with}} a smaller field of random cells {{centered}} within a larger region of dead cells, many small patterns similar to Life's glider escape from the central random area and interact with each other. The Critters rule can also support more complex spaceships of varying speeds as well as oscillators with <b>infinitely</b> many different periods.|$|E

25|$|The {{system has}} <b>infinitely</b> many solutions.|$|E
25|$|There exist <b>infinitely</b> many {{primitive}} Pythagorean triples {{in which}} the hypotenuse and the longer of the two legs differ by exactly two. Generalization: For every integer k > 0, there exist <b>infinitely</b> many primitive Pythagorean triples {{in which the}} hypotenuse and the odd leg differ by 2k2.|$|E
25|$|On Jack Arnold's sci-fi 1957 {{feature film}} The Incredible Shrinking Man during Grant Williams' final voice-over, the Sombrero Galaxy is among several images that depict his {{thoughts}} on the life ahead of him, and {{the similarities between the}} <b>infinitely</b> large and the <b>infinitely</b> small.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, a {{singular}} point has delta invariant δ if it concentrates δ ordinary double points at P. To make this precise, the blow up process produces so-called <b>infinitely</b> near points, and summing m(m−1)/2 over the <b>infinitely</b> near points, where m is their multiplicity, produces δ.|$|E
25|$|Four higher perfect {{numbers have}} also been discovered, namely those for which p = 42643801, 43112609, 57885161, and 74207281, though there may be others within this range. It is not known whether there are <b>infinitely</b> many perfect numbers, nor whether there are <b>infinitely</b> many Mersenne primes.|$|E
25|$|The Poisson {{distributions}} are <b>infinitely</b> divisible probability distributions.|$|E
25|$|God {{is defined}} as an <b>infinitely</b> perfect being.|$|E

25|$|Computers cannot {{directly}} store arbitrary real {{numbers with}} <b>infinitely</b> many digits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infinitely</b> many uniform 5-polytope constructions {{based on}} duoprism {{prismatic}} families: ××.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many deep and wide ranging conjectures in number theory whose proofs seem too {{difficult}} for current techniques, such as the Twin prime conjecture which asks whether there are <b>infinitely</b> many primes p such that p+2 is prime. On the assumption of the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture it has been proven recently that there are <b>infinitely</b> many primes p such that p+k is prime for some positive even k at most12. Also, it has been proven unconditionally (i.e. not depending on unproven conjectures) that there are <b>infinitely</b> many primes p such that p+k is prime for some positive even k at most246.|$|E
25|$|Its {{density is}} <b>infinitely</b> differentiable, indeed supersmooth of order 2.|$|E
25|$|The {{infinite}} Fibonacci word is recurrent; that is, every subword occurs <b>infinitely</b> often.|$|E

25|$|<b>Infinitely</b> {{varied in}} her effects, nature is only simple in her causes.|$|E
25|$|So {{convergence}} is not quadratic, {{even though}} the function is <b>infinitely</b> differentiable everywhere.|$|E
25|$|Other conjectures {{deal with}} the {{question}} whether an infinity of prime numbers subject to certain constraints exists. It is conjectured that there are <b>infinitely</b> many Fibonacci primes and <b>infinitely</b> many Mersenne primes, but not Fermat primes. It is not known {{whether or not there}} are an infinite number of Wieferich primes and of prime Euclid numbers.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, all locally {{integrable}} functions {{satisfying the}} (volume) mean-value property are both <b>infinitely</b> differentiable and harmonic.|$|E
25|$|Dedekind's second {{contribution}} is his proof of Cantor's second theorem. Dedekind sent Cantor this proof in reply to Cantor's letter that announced the uncountability theorem and proved it using <b>infinitely</b> many sequences. Before Dedekind's proof arrived, Cantor {{wrote that he}} had found a simpler proof that did not use <b>infinitely</b> many sequences. So Cantor had a choice of proofs and chose to publish Dedekind's.|$|E
