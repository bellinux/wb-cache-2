40|$|This paper {{presents}} a statistical approach to synthesizing <b>emphasized</b> speech based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Context-dependent HMMs are trained using <b>emphasized</b> speech data uttered by intentionally <b>emphasizing</b> an arbitrary accentual phrase in a sentence. To model acoustic characteristics of <b>emphasized</b> speech, new contextual factors describing an <b>emphasized</b> accentual phrase are additionally considered in model training. Moreover, to build HMMs for synthesizing both normal speech and <b>emphasized</b> speech, we investigate two training methods; one is training of individual models for normal and <b>emphasized</b> speech using {{each of these}} two types of speech data separately; and the other is training of a mixed model using both of them simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) HMM-based speech synthesis is effective for synthesizing <b>emphasized</b> speech and 2) the mixed model allows a more compact HMM set generating more naturally sounding but slightly less <b>emphasized</b> speech compared with the individual models. 1...|$|R
