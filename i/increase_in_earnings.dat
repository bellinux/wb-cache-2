40|$|Many {{dividend}} theories {{imply that}} changes in dividends have information content about the future earnings of the firm. The authors investigate this implication and find only limited support for it. Firms that <b>increase</b> dividends <b>in</b> year 0 have experienced significant <b>earnings</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> years - 1 and 0, but show no subsequent unexpected earnings growth. Also, {{the size of the}} dividend increase does not predict future earnings. Firms that cut dividends in year 0 have experienced a reduction <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> year 0 and in year - 1, but these firms go on to show significant <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> year 1. However, consistent with Lintner's model on dividend policy, firms that increase dividends are less likely than nonchanging firms to experience a drop <b>in</b> future <b>earnings.</b> Thus, their <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> concurrent <b>earnings</b> can be said to be somewhat 'permanent'. In spite of the lack of future earnings growth, firms that increase dividends have significant (though modest) positive excess returns for the following three years.
