5|$|A CIA {{agent and}} head of Division X, a {{government}} agency working with the X-Men. Vaughn had considered his friend Dexter Fletcher for the part, but the studio felt the cast <b>had</b> <b>too</b> many British actors, and Fletcher himself declined, to direct Wild Bill.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game <b>had</b> <b>too</b> many redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they {{lost control of the}} action.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the bogies. The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives <b>had</b> <b>too</b> high fuel consumption and the bogies had faults, as they <b>had</b> <b>too</b> high track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also had problems with overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the oil cooler and the brakes. The on-board computer failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the committee's work was subject of great debate.

Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike. It was ultimately replaced by The Empty Planet as the production team was concerned it <b>had</b> <b>too</b> much of {{the feel of the}} 1970s Gerry Anderson science-fiction series, UFO.|$|E
5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat <b>had</b> <b>too</b> many obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the rear guard. The regiment {{often had to}} fight dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition was exhausted, and then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc <b>had</b> <b>too</b> many characters and required too much effort. Hoshino {{was pleased with}} her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams {{were taken}} out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen trams {{were taken out}} of service due to radial run-out. The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still <b>had</b> <b>too</b> short platforms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Beatty regained {{control over his}} ships, after having boarded , the German ships <b>had</b> <b>too</b> great a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase. Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the {{destruction}} of Blücher and the near sinking of Seydlitz, and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor. Rear Admiral Eckermann was removed from his post and Admiral Ingenohl was forced to resign. He was replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, the {{government}} fined Rutter Brothers Dairy for <b>having</b> <b>too</b> much butterfat in its milk.

5|$|Hermes o Logios faced serious {{financial}} problems during this period. When the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 ended, Ignatios {{was forced to}} resign and leave Bucharest and its main sponsor, the Philological Society, ceased to exist. In an announcement published as an appendix to the issues of 1813 (dated April 1, 1813), Alexandros Vasileiou, a supporter of Korais and influential personality within the Greek community of Vienna, states this fact, as well as that the periodical <b>had</b> <b>too</b> few subscribers. He therefore called on all readers to canvass for new subscribers; moreover he called upon all scholars to send in their contributions.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses. Candidates who receive more than 25% of a quota (i.e. 12.5% {{of the total}} votes; 221,471 votes) at any stage {{are entitled to a}} refund of election expenses to a maximum of €200,000. Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four <b>had</b> <b>too</b> few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his campaign would be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E

Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he <b>had</b> <b>too</b> much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5000|$|Queuing {{problems}} are usually due {{to too many}} servers or too little servers. Although <b>having</b> <b>too</b> many servers cause rapid service, workers become idle and equipment becomes under-utilized. On the other hand, <b>having</b> <b>too</b> little servers creates long queues, frustrates customers, and congests areas. Thus, correct and balanced queue management is necessary.|$|R

50|$|An {{eye that}} <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much {{or too little}} {{refractive}} power to focus light onto the retina has a refractive error. A myopic eye <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much power so light is focused in front of the retina. Conversely, a hyperopic eye <b>has</b> <b>too</b> little power so when the eye is relaxed, light is focused behind the retina. An eye with a refractive power in one meridian that is different from the refractive power of the other meridians has astigmatism. Anisometropia is the condition in which one eye has a different refractive power than the other eye.|$|R
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships <b>had</b> <b>too</b> much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brant's {{force was}} part of a {{combined}} British and Indian army being raised to counter Clark's offensive. Brant <b>had</b> <b>too</b> few men to challenge Clark, but when he intercepted messengers traveling between Clark and Lochry, he learned about Lochry's smaller group bringing up the rear. When Lochry landed to feed his men and horses, Brant launched his overwhelmingly successful ambush. Because Clark had been able to recruit {{only a fraction of the}} men he needed for his campaign, the loss of Lochry's men resulted in the cancellation of Clark's expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912. Consideration was given to {{equipping}} the new ships with triple turrets mounting the 30.5cm (12in) guns of the preceding s, but after examining the gun turrets of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the , {{it was determined that}} the triple gun turrets still <b>had</b> <b>too</b> many problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E

5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they <b>had</b> <b>too</b> few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it <b>had</b> <b>too</b> many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves <b>had</b> <b>too</b> small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
