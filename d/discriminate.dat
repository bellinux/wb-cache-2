5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon {{their ability to}} hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct.

Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to <b>discriminate</b> sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.|$|E

30|$|We {{discuss the}} {{calculation}} of <b>discriminating</b> kernel for the discrete-time dynamic game and continuous-time dynamic game (namely differential game) using the viability kernel and reachable set. For the discrete-time dynamic game, we give an approximation of the viability kernel by the maximal reachable set.

For the differential game, we compute an underapproximation of the viability kernel by the backward reachable set from a closed target. Then, we put forward an algorithm of the <b>discriminating</b> kernel using the relationship of the <b>discriminating</b> and viability kernels. This means that the victory domain can be computed because it is computed by the <b>discriminating</b> kernel. The novelty is that we give two algorithms of the <b>discriminating</b> kernel for a dynamic game that contains two control variables, not one control variable as in differential inclusion.|$|R

5|$|Nest mate {{recognition}} is widespread in many eusocial insects. However, {{when there are}} no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials, many can no longer <b>discriminate</b> nest mate from other conspecifics. Recently, however, it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to <b>discriminate</b> relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non-relative counterpart. Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus, former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring. Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives. In Polistes exclamans, it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non-relatives, even having lived in identical environments, is possible. This was found by Allen, Schulze Kellman, and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments. As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased, the more clumps were formed in the box. This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative, an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} that looks for the most <b>discriminating</b> points in horizontal, vertical, velocity and pressure trajectories. Then based on these <b>discriminating</b> points, we have made two composite feature sets i. e. (horizontal, vertical) and (velocity, pressure). Out of these two composite feature sets, one will be declared as the most <b>discriminating</b> composite feature set during the training phase. Finally the verification based on the selected <b>discriminating</b> composite feature will be performed. We believe that every signer has some <b>discriminating</b> points that a forger cannot mimic with certain pressure and velocity whereas these points are maintained by the genuine signer. So the verification based on these <b>discriminating</b> points can lead us to a better performance of the verification system. For a reliable verification system, comparison between forgery and genuine signer should {{be made on the}} basis of <b>discriminating</b> points rather than using all the sample points of each trajectory in the verification which means that all the points are given equal weights and there is always a possibility that the non-discriminating points can overshadow the effect of <b>discriminating</b> points. Experimental results demonstrate superiority of our approach in On-line signature verification in comparison with other techniques. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} idea of superdense coding {{is to find}} as many gates {{as possible}} such {{that they can be}} perfectly <b>discriminated.</b> In this paper, we consider a new scheme of discrimination of quantum gates, called ancilla-assisted discrimination, in which a set of quantum gates on a d-dimensional system are perfectly <b>discriminated</b> with assistance from an r-dimensional ancilla system. The main contribution of the present paper is two-fold: (1) The number of quantum gates that can be <b>discriminated</b> in this scheme is evaluated. We prove that any rd+ 1 quantum gates cannot be perfectly <b>discriminated</b> with assistance from the ancilla, and there exist rd quantum gates which can be perfectly <b>discriminated</b> with assistance from the ancilla. (2) The dimensionality of the minimal ancilla system is estimated. We prove that there exists a constant positive number c such that for any k≤ cr quantum gates, if they are d-assisted discriminable, then they are also r-assisted discriminable, and there are c^'r(c^'>c) different quantum gates which can be <b>discriminated</b> with a d-dimensional ancilla, but they cannot be <b>discriminated</b> if the ancilla is reduced to an r-dimensional system. Thus, the order O(r) of the number of quantum gates that can be <b>discriminated</b> with assistance from an r-dimensional ancilla is optimal. The results reported in this paper represent a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla system plays in discrimination of quantum gates as well as the power and limit of superdense coding...|$|R
