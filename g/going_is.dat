500|$|The Yankees, who {{selected}} sixth, also rated Jeter highly. Yankees scout Dick Groch, {{assigned to}} scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter {{participate in an}} all-star camp held at Western Michigan University. Though Yankees officials were concerned that Jeter would attend college instead of signing a professional contract, Groch convinced them to select him, saying, [...] "the only place Derek Jeter's <b>going</b> <b>is</b> to Cooperstown". The second through fifth picks were Paul Shuey, B. J. Wallace (who never played in the majors), Jeffrey Hammonds, and Chad Mottola (125 career MLB at-bats and over 5,000 at-bats at AAA); those five would combine for two All-Star Game appearances (Nevin and Hammonds). The Yankees drafted Jeter, who chose to turn pro, signing for $800,000.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{influence}} that the apparent death of Steve Rogers has on Carter, Atwell explained that [...] "It's only been a year and she's grieving him and I think what keeps her <b>going</b> <b>is</b> he was the greatest person she ever knew ... she's also determined {{to make sure that}} his work wasn't in vain." [...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E

500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person when you meet him; the only thing that's keeping him <b>going</b> <b>is</b> the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything else around him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m <b>going</b> <b>is</b> predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
500|$|When Fenmore {{and female}} {{character}} Summer Newman (Hunter King) were rapidly aged to teenagers {{at the same}} time, Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment previewed: [...] "These two kids may learn {{about some of the}} insane things their parents have done – as fans know, that says a lot!" [...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s <b>going</b> <b>is</b> – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus. It’s going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. [...] rippling effect, like every good story." [...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, [...] "This is real; this is what happens". People need to know the truth {{of what is going on}} out there." ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> Ving {{construction}} occurs only 36 {{times in}} the 1, 000, 000 -word Great Britain component of the ICE corpus. Yet, its context of use is multifaceted. The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to part may express intentionality (“When you go to Italy <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> doing art”), expectation/probability (“And these little cartilages at the back actually move the vocal folds when they <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> vibrating”) or something in between these two notions (“Could you just play the notes that I <b>'m</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> doing”). The be Ving part may encode a durative event (“You <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> transcribing all of this are you”; “are we <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> eating at your parents’ or here”), a repeated event (“And I said well I think Rebecca <b>'s</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> into her M Phil lectures”) or a punctual event (“And I <b>was</b> just <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> telling people what to do which was fine”). This construction does not necessaritly express the notion of ‘progressive aspect’, as it may also encode non-durative events.
