5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo <b>for</b> <b>millennia.</b> While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices.

There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the A303, such as {{the section}} past Stonehenge, have been a right of way for people, wagons, and later motor {{vehicles}} <b>for</b> <b>millennia.</b> Portions of it follow the Harrow Way, an ancient trackway across Wessex {{that is one of}} Britain's oldest roads, reportedly being used as long ago as 3,000 BC. Other sections run on part of the Fosse Way, a Roman road between Exeter and Lincoln constructed around 49 AD.|$|E

5|$|Vegetable oils are {{triglycerides}} {{extracted from}} plants.

Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in oil lamps and as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally <b>for</b> <b>millennia</b> and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about {{the current state of the}} atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>millennia,</b> archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E

5|$|Active <b>for</b> <b>millennia,</b> Mount Redoubt has erupted {{four times}} {{since it was}} first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two {{questionable}} eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000ft (14,000m). It caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume. After the plane descended 13,000 feet, the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage. The ash blanketed an area of about 7,700sqmi (20,000km2). The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in <b>for</b> <b>millennia</b> (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E
5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala <b>for</b> <b>millennia</b> and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, {{in one form or}} the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E

5|$|People {{have been}} living in deserts <b>for</b> <b>millennia.</b> Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were {{originally}} hunter-gatherers. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth. Other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} vampirism has existed <b>for</b> <b>millennia.</b> Cultures {{such as the}} Mesopotamians, Hebrews, Ancient Greeks, and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are {{considered}} precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe, when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, {{but they can also}} be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.|$|E
5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead {{poisoning}} became {{common in the}} work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; <b>for</b> <b>millennia</b> before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood {{lead poisoning}} occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E
