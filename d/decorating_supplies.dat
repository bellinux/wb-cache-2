50|$|Entering {{the covered}} eastern gateway {{on the north}} bank of the Sarkhej lake, the {{building}} to the right with a handsome stone pavilion in front of it, is the mausoleum of Shaikh Ahmed Khattu Ganj Bakhsh. This, the largest {{of its kind in}} Gujarat, has along its whole length its sides filled with stone trellis work, and inside, round the tomb, has a beautifully cut open metal screen. Across the courtyard on the left are two mausoleums with a connecting porch, the east mausoleum containing the tombs of Mahmud Begada, and of his son Saltan Muzaffar ll, and the west, the tomb of Rajbai, Muzaffar's queen. Beyond the Ganj Bakhsh mausoleum is a courtyard, covering more than an acre of ground, surrounded by cloisters, with a mosque only slightly smaller than the Jama mosque. The want of minarets and the shallowness of its caves rather mar the outside effect. But inside 'it is the perfection of simple grace unrivalled in India except by the Moti mosque at Agra.' Looking across the lake the ruined buildings at the south-west corner are Mahmud Begada's palace and harem. The Sarkhej lake covers 17 acres. Oblong in shape, it is surrounded by flights of stone steps, and has a most richly <b>decorated</b> <b>supply</b> sluice.|$|R

No greater obsequies of greatness and pomp will be done him than this. On the 22nd, at 7:30 in the morning, Viceroy Don Pedro Mendinueta left for Spain....|$|R

40|$|The {{suburban}} villa rose {{to prominence}} in the eighteenth century. Burlington, Pope and others built large houses {{on the outskirts of}} London as expressions of their wealth and taste, using them to showcase collections, entertain friends or escape from the gaze of the city. Many others acquired rather more modest houses which they used as a convenient and comfortable base for engaging in London life. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these smaller villas have attracted relatively little attention: overshadowed by the grandeur of their rural, and the showiness of their metropolitan, counterparts they contained few artistic treasures or architectural innovations. Yet they were an important element of elite life and material culture. This paper explores one such house in detail: Grove House in Kensington Gore, the property of the Honourable Mary Leigh. Drawing on a large collection of bills, I examine the processes of <b>decorating,</b> furnishing and <b>supplying</b> Grove House {{around the turn of the}} nineteenth century. This provides insights into the operation of the suburban villa and the ways in which its material culture and habitation were linked to its country equivalent...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the very}} hasty move-out from the White House in late 1948, the B. Altman and Company {{department}} store offered {{to move and}} store the more valuable White House furnishings in their climate-controlled warehouses, for a nominal sum. The government deemed it to be [...] "in {{the interests of the}} United States" [...] and therefore not subject to public bidding requirements. [...] The store later offered their interior design, <b>decorating,</b> and furniture <b>supply</b> services at true cost with no profit or ability to advertise the work. The government also deemed this to be in the public interest. The Commission provided a budget for the furniture, rugs, draperies, and special wall fabric of just $210,000, 10% less than the cost to provide temporary sheds during construction. This budget for 66 rooms allowed for no sourcing of any authentic antiques and resulted in a less than satisfactory furniture selection of antique furniture. However, Benjamin Altman and Company delivered the highest quality furniture possible designed and built by a talented cadre of furniture makers. This included Charles Fiesel, renowned furniture maker, who eventually became the head of interior decorating at B. Altman and Company. Originally from Alsace Lorraine, Mr. Fiesel traveled from his Garden City, New York home on sourcing expeditions throughout America in search of the finest wood available (white maple, cherry, oak, and other varieties)designated for furniture that was in design/build status. Furniture that was considered new at the time is now considered masterful and classic American.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "anchor" [...] for the Carville Historic District is the Indian Camp Plantation House, {{the antebellum}} main {{house of a}} sugar {{plantation}} {{which is the only}} surviving building from the plantation. It wasdesigned and built by New Orleans architect Henry Howard (and perhaps his partner Albert Diettel) in 1859 for sugar planter Robert C. Camp. It is a raised stucco over brick transitional Greek Revival Italianate mansion featuring a central mass with a hexastyle double gallery and flanking two story wings. Fluted Corinthian columns over heavily rusticated pillars support the gallery. Column capitals are correctly fashioned from double rows of acanthus leaf carvings with volutess or scrolls springingfrom the centers. Rather thin, molded and <b>decorated</b> abacus blocks <b>supply</b> the transition from columns to architrave. / The facade is well detailed with Italianate features, including rows of brackets, segmental openings, and panels. Above the gallery is a busy entablature with a bracketed, dentiled frieze under a projecting cornice and a segmented, paneled parapet. The bracket and dentil motif of the principal frieze continues around the returning entablature to terminate at the juncture of the house and gallery, only to reappear in a modified form of elongated brackets spaced across the wings, down the sides, and onto the rear. Meanwhile, the square, post and lintel fenestration of the central block contrasts with segmental openings in the wings. These features, together with the deep rustication of the central pillars and the heavy cast-iron gallery railings, impart a heavy sculptural quality to the facade. From every angle, front and rear, a certain dynamism emerges from broken up surfaces and contrasting motifs.|$|R
