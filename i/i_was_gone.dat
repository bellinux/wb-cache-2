500|$|Both Compton and Groves {{proposed}} that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-{{proposed that}} the semiworks be {{operated by the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to {{be found at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university [...] would be operating an industrial facility [...] from its main campus. James B. Conant told him that Harvard University [...] "wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T. Filbey, took a different view, and instructed Compton to accept. When University President Robert Hutchins returned, he greeted Compton with [...] "I see, Arthur, that while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> you doubled the size of my university".|$|E

2500|$|Sometime later, Harvey meets a {{young woman}} outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rejects him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an {{overhead}} branch, hitting Harvey on the shoulder. He loses his balance {{on the ice and}} falls backward over a cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as [...] "the lovely bones" [...] that grew around her absence. As the film concludes, Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: [...] "My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here {{for a moment and then}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> I wish you all a long and happy life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harras also commented, [...] "As soon as I saw {{the sketch}} by Walter [...] and heard Louise's take on him, I {{knew we had}} the {{character}} I wanted. Jackson [...] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's." [...] Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: [...] "The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe {{there was even a}} character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> and others had that concern." [...] Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: [...] "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels {{at the end of one}} of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit." ...|$|E
