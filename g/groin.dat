5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a <b>groin</b> injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the <b>groin</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season Hašek {{injured his}} <b>groin</b> after playing just 14 games. On January 9, {{he and the}} team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager Ken Holland {{that he would not}} accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he {{announced}} {{that he was not going}} to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent <b>groin</b> surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.|$|E
40|$|Abstracted-Three {{dimensional}} Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) {{model are}} intend {{to investigate the}} flow patterns around <b>groins</b> under different conditions. Used k- turbulent model and VOF method to predict the complex flow around <b>groins.</b> The initial part of this study con-cerns to the experimental investigations of flow patterns. The results from the measurements in terms of water elevation, velocity magnitudes according to <b>groins</b> are showed. These were used to validate the Computational Fluid Dynamic model. The results of CFD models showed good agreements with the corresponding experimental measurements. Many aspects were conducted on the CFD model for most important design parameters, such as, Contraction ratio (Lg/B), and Orientations. Results showed that, the Reattachment length is about 12 - 13 times the impermeable <b>Groins</b> length; <b>Groins</b> with (Lg/B) more than 20 % will increased the velocity and shear stress by 76, and 99 % respectively, <b>Groins</b> oriented either normal to the flow or slightly downstream for best performance. <b>Groins</b> oriented on downstream reduces scour (shear stress) {{at the end of}} the <b>groins</b> by 50 %...|$|R

40|$|For {{preventing}} bank erosion due to ship waves, many stream-wise <b>groins</b> {{have been}} {{installed in the}} downstream region of Arakawa River, Japan. However, the bank erosion still occurs at some locations even though similar-type <b>groins</b> are installed. In this study, field investigation at three locations on Arakawa River and numerical simulation were conducted. At each field investigation site, wave height, particle distribution of bed material and amount of sediment movement due to ship waves were measured. Amount of sediment volume increased with decreasing cross slope. As for numerical simulation on the flow around <b>groins,</b> total energy flux of ship waves by a ship was decreased due to installation of <b>groins.</b> The observed amount of bank erosion also decreased according to the decrement of the total energy flux. In addition, the amount of bank erosion increased with decreasing cross slope. These {{results indicate that the}} location with mild slope and steep slope has tendency to be accumulated or eroded, respectively, even after the <b>groins</b> were installed...|$|R
5|$|Lesnar {{had a great}} showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 {{a minivan}} {{collided}} with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled <b>groin.</b> Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the <b>groin</b> injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 {{it was reported that}} he was nearly recovered from his <b>groin</b> injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the <b>groin.</b> This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the <b>groin.</b> Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and <b>groin</b> are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E

5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from axilla (armpit) to <b>groin,</b> averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from axilla to <b>groin</b> along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the fourth toe of the right foot, there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that provide traction for geckos. The escutcheons (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs, varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E
40|$|The Albuquerque Projects Office of the Bureau of Reclamation {{installed}} <b>groins</b> on the Middle Rio Grande {{to provide}} bank protection at a severe bend located near Santa Clara Indian Pueblo, approximately 75 miles (121 kIn) upstream of Albuquerque, New Mexico. During {{the first season}} of operation of the <b>groins,</b> a discharge near the 2 year design flood of 7, 600 ft. 3 /s (215 m 3 /s) was experienced at the site. Many of the <b>groins</b> showed damage following the recession of the runoff, but performed well at the site. Replacement of riprap will be accomplished before the next runoff season...|$|R
