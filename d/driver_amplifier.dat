50|$|The simple form of AFIL using {{a general}} purpose {{amplifier}} suffers from some disadvantages. The loop <b>driver</b> <b>amplifier</b> requires some additional circuits to overcome these. Using {{anything other than}} a correctly designed loop <b>driver</b> <b>amplifier</b> is not only unsatisfactory, but may result in a loop installation that can generate harmonics when driven into distortion, and these will cause radio interference. This must be prevented, both for sound quality and for legal reasons as it is illegal to cause such interference in these circumstances. In Europe, the EMC Directive applies, and it is also illegal to supply or install unsuitable electronic and electrical equipment.|$|E
5000|$|An optical {{communication}} system transmitter {{consists of a}} digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a <b>driver</b> <b>amplifier</b> and a Mach-Zehnder-Modulator. The deployment of higher modulation formats (> 4QAM) or higher Baud rates (> 32 GBaud) diminishes the system performance due to linear and non-linear transmitter effects. These effects can be categorised in linear distortions due to DAC bandwidth limitation and transmitter I/Q skew as well as non-linear effects caused by gain saturation in the <b>driver</b> <b>amplifier</b> and the Mach-Zehnder modulator. Digital predistortion counteracts the degrading effects and enables Baud rates up to 56 GBaud and modulation formats like 64QAM and 128QAM with the commercially available components. The transmitter digital signal processor performs digital predistortion on the input signals using the inverse transmitter model before uploading the samples to the DAC.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{modulators}} {{based upon}} carrier depletion {{have proven to}} be effective at achieving high speed operation in silicon. However, when incorporated into Mach-Zehnder Interferometer structures they require electronic <b>driver</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to provide peak to peak drive voltages of a few volts in order to achieve a large extinction ratio. For minimal performance degradation caused by the electrical connection between the driver and the modulator monolithic integration in {{the front end of the}} process is the preferred integration route. The formation of electronic <b>driver</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in BiCMOS is advantageous over CMOS in terms of achievable performance versus cost. In this work the first monolithic photonic integration in the electronic front-end of a high-performance BiCMOS technology process is demonstrated.
