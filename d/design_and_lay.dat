40|$|The new GSI {{accelerator}} facilities (FAIR project) {{are planned}} to deliver heavy ion beams of increased energy and highest intensity [1]. Whereas the energy is {{planned to be}} increased roughly {{by a factor of}} 30, the ion beam intensities are planned to be enlarged by three orders of magnitude. To achieve highest beam intensities, medium charged heavy ions (e. g. U 28 +) are accelerated. Since the ionization cross sections for these ions are comparably high, a UHV-accelerator system with a base pressure in the low 10 - 12 mbar regime is required, even under the influence of ion beam loss induced desorption processes.

40|$|The new European {{framework}} directive contains {{a number of}} policy objectives {{in the area of}} net neutrality. In support of these objectives, the universal service directive includes a transparency obligation for ISPs. This paper proposes a multi-stakeholder model for the implementation of this transparency obligation. The model is a multi-stakeholder model {{in the sense that it}} treats the content and form of the transparent information in close connection with the parties involved in the provision of the information and the processes in which they take part. Another crucial property of the model is that it distinguishes between technical and user-friendly information. This distinction makes it possible to limit the obligation to ISPs to the information for which they are in the best position to provide: the technical information on the traffic management measures that they apply, e. g., which traffic streams are subject to special treatment? Which measures are applied and when? The public availability of this technical information creates the opportunity for the other parties in the model to step in and contribute to the formulation of the user-friendly information for end users: which applications and services receive special treatment? When is their effect noticeable? It is expected that the involvement of other parties will lead to multiple, complementary routes for the formulation of the user-friendly information. Thus, the user-friendly information emerges in ways driven by market players and stakeholders that would be difficult to <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> down in advance in the transparency obligation.

40|$|MR fluids {{are smart}} {{materials}} that {{respond to a}} magnetic field by changing their rheological properties. This change in the yield shear stress of MR fluids {{is proportional to the}} magnetic field applied. Dampers with MR fluid as the working fluid have a damping response comparable to conventional synthetic oil dampers. The smart nature of MR fluid enables real time semi-active control of damping, which makes them particularly suitable for motorcycle steering. This project involves the study of MR fluid, its application as a shock absorbing device and the total design and manufacture of an MR fluid steering damper for a motorcycle. Motorcycle steering and the causes of erratic steering motions are investigated and a comparison between a manually adjustment damper and the proposed MR damper are discussed. The design principles are discussed and applied to optimize the design of the MR valve using finite element analysis. A full chapter is dedicated to a total bottom-up design of an MR fluid steering damper, while the chapter on design covers every aspect of the design, including the concept, the selection of material and components, design embodiment, the design of structural members, and technical production drawings. The testing stage enabled the working range and functionality of the completed damper to be established and documented, and served to investigate any shortcomings in the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> the groundwork for further improvement in areas such as the damping force range, optimization of the MR valve, size and weight reduction, and reliability. Finally, the project was concluded on an understanding that this design {{can be used as a}} foundation for future work with the aim of a commercial damper design that is effective (as an controllable damper in semi-active suspension systems), lightweight, aesthetically appealing, reliable, and at the same time be commercially viable by having a low production cost...|$|E
40|$|We present {{experimental}} results of emission factors from {{a suite of}} domestic coal-burning braziers (lab fabricated and field collected) that span the possible range of real-world uses in the Highveld region of South Africa. The conventional bottom-lit updraft (BLUD) method and the top-lit updraft (TLUD) method were evaluated using coal particle sizes between 20 mm and 40 mm. Emission factors of CO 2, CO and NOx were {{in the range of}} 98 – 102 g/MJ, 4. 1 – 6. 4 g/MJ and 75 – 195 mg/MJ, respectively. Particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) emissions were in the range 1. 3 – 3. 3 g/MJ for the BLUD method and 0. 2 – 0. 7 g/MJ for the TLUD method, for both field and lab-designed stoves. When employing the TLUD method, emission factors of PM 2. 5 /PM 10 reduced by up to 80 % compared with those when using the BLUD method. Results showed the influence of ventilation rates on emission factors, which reduced by ~ 50 % from low to high ventilation rates. For energy-specific emission rates, the combined (3 -h) PM 10 emission rates were in the range of 0. 0028 – 0. 0120 g/s, while the combined average CO emission rates were in the range of 0. 20 – 0. 26 g/s, with CO 2 emission rates in the range of 0. 54 – 0. 64 g/s. The reported emission factors from coal braziers provide the first comprehensive, systematic set of emission factors for this source category, and fill a major gap in previous efforts to conduct dispersion modelling of South African Highveld air quality.

40|$|Soil thermal {{resistivity}} {{plays an important}} role in the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>laying</b> of high-voltage buried power cables, oil and gas pipelines, nuclear waste disposal facilities, ground-modification techniques employing heating and freezing, etc. For these situations, it is important to estimate the resistance offered by the soil mass in dissipating the heat generated. Several investigators have tried to develop mathematical and theoretical models to estimate soil {{thermal resistivity}}. However, these models are not always capable of predicting thermal resistivity of soils. This is mainly due to the fact that thermal resistivity of soil is a complex phenomenon that depends upon various parameters, viz. type of the soil, particle-size distribution, compaction characteristics, etc. As such, none of the relationships available in the literature are suitable for estimating the thermal resistivity of all soils. This paper deals with the details of fabrication of a "laboratory thermal probe" which has been used to evaluate thermal resistivity of various soils.
