40|$|The {{success of}} nifurtimox-eflornithine {{combination}} therapy (NECT) {{for the treatment}} of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has renewed interest in the potential of nitro drugs as chemotherapeutics. In order to study the implications of the more widespread use of nitro drugs against these parasites, we examined the in vivo and in vitro resistance potentials of nifurtimox and <b>fexinidazole</b> and its metabolites. Following selection in vitro by exposure to increasing concentrations of nifurtimox, Trypanosoma brucei brucei nifurtimox-resistant clones designated NfxR 1 and NfxR 2 were generated. Both cell lines were found to be 8 -fold less sensitive to nifurtimox than parental cells and demonstrated cross-resistance to a number of other nitro drugs, most notably the clinical trial candidate <b>fexinidazole</b> (∼ 27 -fold more resistant than parental cells). Studies of mice confirmed that the generation of nifurtimox resistance in these parasites did not compromise virulence, and NfxR 1 remained resistant to both nifurtimox and <b>fexinidazole</b> in vivo. In the case of <b>fexinidazole,</b> drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the parent drug is rapidly metabolized to the sulfoxide and sulfone form of this compound. These metabolites retained trypanocidal activity but were less effective in nifurtimox-resistant lines. Significantly, trypanosomes selected for resistance to <b>fexinidazole</b> were 10 -fold more resistant to nifurtimox than parental cells. This reciprocal cross-resistance has important implications for the therapeutic use of nifurtimox in a clinical setting and highlights a potential danger in the use of <b>fexinidazole</b> as a monotherapy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), {{also known}} as {{sleeping}} sickness, is a fatal parasitic disease caused by trypanosomes. Current treatment options for HAT are scarce, toxic, no longer effective, or very difficult to administer, in particular for the advanced, fatal stage of the disease (stage 2, chronic HAT). New safe, effective and easy-to-use treatments are urgently needed. Here it is shown that <b>fexinidazole,</b> a 2 -substituted 5 -nitroimidazole rediscovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) after extensive compound mining efforts of more than 700 new and existing nitroheterocycles, could be a short-course, safe and effective oral treatment curing both acute and chronic HAT {{and that could be}} implemented at the primary health care level. To complete the preclinical development and meet the regulatory requirements before initiating human trials, the anti-parasitic properties and the pharmacokinetic, metabolic and toxicological profile of <b>fexinidazole</b> have been assessed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Standard in vitro and in vivo anti-parasitic activity assays were conducted to assess drug efficacy in experimental models for HAT. In parallel, a full range of preclinical pharmacology and safety studies, as required by international regulatory guidelines before initiating human studies, have been conducted. <b>Fexinidazole</b> is moderately active in vitro against African trypanosomes (IC against laboratory strains and recent clinical isolates ranged between 0. 16 and 0. 93 microg/mL) and oral administration of <b>fexinidazole</b> at doses of 100 mg/kg/day for 4 days or 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days cured mice with acute and chronic infection respectively, the latter being a model for the advanced and fatal stage of the disease when parasites have disseminated into the brain. In laboratory animals, <b>fexinidazole</b> is well absorbed after oral administration and readily distributes throughout the body, including the brain. The absolute bioavailability of oral <b>fexinidazole</b> was 41 % in mice, 30 % in rats, and 10 % in dogs. Furthermore, <b>fexinidazole</b> is rapidly metabolised in vivo to at least two biologically active metabolites (a sulfoxide and a sulfone derivative) that likely account for {{a significant portion of the}} therapeutic effect. Key pharmacokinetic parameter after oral absorption in mice for <b>fexinidazole</b> and its sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites are a C(max) of 500, 14171 and 13651 ng/mL respectively, and an AUC of 424, 45031 and 96286 h. ng/mL respectively. Essentially similar PK profiles were observed in rats and dogs. Toxicology studies (including safety pharmacology and 4 -weeks repeated-dose toxicokinetics in rat and dog) have shown that <b>fexinidazole</b> is well tolerated. The No Observed Adverse Event Levels in the 4 -weeks repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs was 200 mg/kg/day in both species, with no issues of concern identified for doses up to 800 mg/kg/day. While <b>fexinidazole,</b> like many nitroheterocycles, is mutagenic in the Ames test due to bacterial specific metabolism, it is not genotoxic to mammalian cells in vitro or in vivo as assessed in an in vitro micronucleus test on human lymphocytes, an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test, and an ex vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rats.

40|$|Beside typical human trypanosomes {{responsible}} {{of sleeping}} sickness in Africa and Chagas disease in Latin America, {{there is a}} growing number of reported atypical human infections due to Trypanosoma evansi, a livestock parasite, or Trypanosoma lewisi, a rat parasite, especially in Asia. Drugs available for the treatment of T. brucei ssp. in humans are obviously of choice for the control of T. evansi because it is derived from T. brucei. However, concerning T. lewisi, there is an urgent need to determine the efficacy of trypanocidal drugs for the treatment in humans. In a recent study, pentamidine and <b>fexinidazole</b> were shown to have the best efficacy against one stock of T. lewisi in rats. In the present study suramin, pentamidine, eflornitine, nifurtimox, benznidazole and <b>fexinidazole,</b> were evaluated at low and high doses, in single day administration to normal rats experimentally infected with a stock of T. lewisi recently isolated in Thailand. Because none of these treatments was efficient, a trial was made with the most promising trypanocide identified in a previous study, <b>fexinidazole</b> 100 mg/kg, in 5 daily administrations. Results observed were unclear. To confirm the efficacy of <b>fexinidazole,</b> a mixed infection protocol was set up in cyclophosphamide immunosuppressed rats.

New, safe, effective and easy-to-use treatments are urgently needed. Many nitroimidazoles possess antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity and examples such as tinidazole are used to treat trichomoniasis and guardiasis, but concerns about toxicity including genotoxicity limit their usefulness. <b>Fexinidazole,</b> a 2 -substituted 5 -nitroimidazole rediscovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) after extensive compound mining of public and pharmaceutical company databases, {{has the potential to}} become a short-course, safe and effective oral treatment, curing both acute and chronic HAT.

40|$|Neglected {{tropical}} diseases (NTDs) are a {{group of}} communicable diseases mostly affecting people in developing countries. These diseases are responsible for {{a major part of}} the global morbidity, mortality and poverty. There is no doubt that the well-being of people in the developing world can only be improved if the NTDs are controlled. An important tool for disease control is the drug treatment. The few available drugs are unsatisfactory because of the limited efficacy, adverse effects and the high price. Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis belong to this group of NTDs. They are caused by infections with protozoa of the family Trypanosomatidae. For these three diseases new drugs are urgently needed. By definition there is no commercial market for drugs against NTDs. Drug research and development (R&D) for NTDs is mainly driven by the public sector, the so-called product development partnerships (PDPs). Drug R&D is a very long (10 - 15 years), risky and therefore expensive process. Three different series of compounds (agrochemicals, marketed drugs and nitro-heterocyclic compounds) were tested for their antiparasitic effects, with the aim to identify new lead compounds or even clinical candidates against leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease. Agrochemicals are used worldwide on a large scale in food production. They undergo a rigorous toxicological testing prior to launch. Over 600 compounds were screened for their antiparasitic activity. Agrochemicals are not optimized for use in mammals, yet a significant number of molecules were found with good and selective in vitro activity. Some of them showed also efficacy in the corresponding rodent model. These results indicate that agrochemicals can provide very interesting starting structures for drug research against parasitic diseases. Drugs or drug-like compounds are an ideal starting point for antiparasitic drug discovery, because very often pharmacokinetic and toxicological data are available. A number of drugs, including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and anti-psychotics were assayed for antiparasitic activity. Some of the drugs tested showed selective antiparasitic activity. These compounds can be regarded as new lead structures and should be further investigated. Nitroheterocycles belong to a well- known class of compounds with the stigma of being mutagenic or genotoxic. Over 700 compounds, mainly nitroimidazoles, have been systematically tested for their antiparasitic activity, and their pharmacokinetics and mutagenicity was investigated. A number of effective, non-mutagenic and non- genotoxic compounds was identified. So <b>fexinidazole</b> was rediscovered, a drug that had been in clinical development already in the 70 ’s as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug. <b>Fexinidazole</b> is rapidly metabolized to fexinidazole-sulfoxide and -sulfone. The parent compound and the two principle metabolites showed in vitro trypanocidal activity against all (sensitive and resistant) tested T. brucei strains (IC 50 of 0. 2 - 0. 9 ug / ml). <b>Fexinidazole</b> cured the first stage mouse model with a 4 -day oral treatment of 100 mg/kg/day and the 2 nd stage mouse model with a 5 -day oral treatment of 200 mg/kg/day. The two metabolites are mainly responsible for the good efficacy in animal models. Both reach very high concentrations in blood and brain tissue. <b>Fexinidazole</b> has successfully completed preclinical development and Phase I clinical trials and is currently in a clinical phase II / III study. With the approach of phenotypic screening of compounds that have been developed for other purposes, new leads for drug R&D against Chagas’ disease, leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis were identified. <b>Fexinidazole</b> is the first drug candidate in clinical Phase II / III trials since decades. It would be the first oral drug for the treatment of stage 1 and 2 of human African sleeping sickness. If <b>fexinidazole</b> overcomes all obstacles, this would be a major breakthrough in the fight against African sleeping sickness.

Parasitemia was monitored throughout, and cures were detected by parasitological and PCR assays. The results were compared with those achieved with benznidazole treatment at the same doses. <b>Fexinidazole</b> metabolites were effective in reducing the numbers of circulating para-sites and protecting mice against death, compared with untreated mice, but without providing cures at daily doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg.

40|$|Sleeping sickness, {{caused by}} Trypanosoma brucei, is a deadly disease that affects {{some of the}} poorest {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the disease prevalence is declining, strengthening of the current control efforts, including introduction of more adequate chemotherapeutic options, is needed to prevent the re-emergence of yet another epidemic. Nitroaromatic compounds, such as nifurtimox (in combination with eflornithine) and <b>fexinidazole</b> (in clinical trials), have been recently introduced {{for the treatment of}} the second stage of sleeping sickness. These compounds are believed to act as pro-drugs that require intracellular enzymatic activation for antimicrobial activity. Here, the role of the bacterial-like nitroreductase TbNTR as a nitrodrug activating enzyme is examined through overexpression and knock-out studies in T. brucei. Multiple attempts to purify soluble recombinant TbNTR from E. coli were unsuccessful, because the recombinant protein was found to be membrane associated. In keeping with the role of TbNTR in nitrodrug activation, loss of an NTR gene copy in T. brucei was found to be one, but not the only, mechanism that may lead to nitrodrug resistance. Furthermore, in the bloodstream form of T. brucei, resistance was relatively easy to select for nifurtimox, with no concurrent loss of virulence and at clinically relevant levels. More worryingly, nifurtimox resistance led to a decreased sensitivity of these parasites to other nitroaromatic compounds, including a high level of cross-resistance to <b>fexinidazole.</b> Conversely, generation of <b>fexinidazole</b> resistance resulted in cross-resistance to nifurtimox. Should these findings translate to the field, emerging nitrodrug resistance could reverse all recent advances in the treatment of sleeping sickness, made since the introduction of eflornithine 20 years ago. Therefore, all efforts should be made to ensure nitroaromatic drugs are used only in drug combination therapies against sleeping sickness, in order to protect them from emerging resistance.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the role of}} parasite clearance time induced by benznidazole, <b>fexinidazole</b> and posaconazole treatments upon mice infection with a benznidazole-resistant Trypanosoma cruzi strain in the pathological outcomes. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mice were treated with different drugs and parasite clearance time was detected by blood and tissue qPCR, to determine the dynamic relationship between {{the efficacy of the}} treatments and the intensity of heart lesion/serum inflammatory mediators. Our results indicate that anti-T. cruzi treatments were able to reduce parasite replication and consequently induce immunomodulatory effects, where the degree of the immunopathology prevention was related to the time of parasite clearance induced by different treatments. Nevertheless, in benznidazole and posaconazole treatments, parasite rebounding was detected with parasitism reaching levels similar to infected and non-treated mice; the time for parasitic rebound being earlier among benznidazole-treated mice. In parallel, an increase of cardiac lesions and plasma chemokine levels was also detected and was more accentuated in benznidazole-treated animals. Interestingly, in the presence of parasitological cure (<b>fexinidazole</b> treatment), basal levels of these inflammatory mediators were evidenced as well as an absence of cardiac inflammation or fibrosis. Overall, our data indicate that all treatments have positive effects on the clinical evolution of T. cruzi infection, with success in preventing cardiac alterations being drug-dependen...|$|E

Ronidazole, satranidazole and <b>fexinidazole</b> {{were the most}} active compounds being 2. 8, 2. 0 and 2. 0 times more active than tinidazole respectively and warrant further investigation as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The results obtained in mice are consistant with the known activity of nitroimidazoles in man. There was a strong positive correlation between these results and previous in-vitro studies obtained using a 3 H-thymidine uptake assay, indicating that in-vitro studies are of value in predicting in-vivo responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} new drugs against {{tropical}} parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei is persistent since problems with resistance and toxicity are jeopardizing the currently available medicines. Public-private partnerships aiming to develop new medicines for malaria and sleeping sickness have, over the past 12 years, brought forward several drug candidates that have entered clinical trials. These are the synthetic peroxide OZ 439 and the spiroindolone NITD 609 against P. falciparum, <b>fexinidazole</b> and the oxaborole SCYX- 7158 against T. brucei. A further class of high chemotherapeutic potential are the diamidines, novel members of which may serve as back-up compounds against trypanosomes and other parasites.

40|$|Background: The current {{treatments}} for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis (collectively {{referred to as}} the kinetoplastid diseases) are far from ideal but, for some, there has been significant recent progress. For HAT the only advances in treatment {{over the past two decades}} have been the introduction of an eflornithine/nifurtimox co-administration and a shorter regime of the old standard melarsoprol. Sources of data: PubMed. Areas of Agreement: There is a need for new safe, oral drugs for cost-effective treatment of patients and use in control programmes for all the trypanosomatid diseases. Areas of controversy: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is not on the agenda and treatments are lagging behind. Growing points: There are three compounds in development for the treatment of the CNS stage of HAT: <b>fexinidazole,</b> currently due to entry into phase II clinical studies, a benzoxaborole (SCYX- 7158) in phase I trials and a diamidin...|$|E
40|$|To review {{current and}} {{emerging}} tools for Gambiense HAT control and elimination, and propose strategies that integrate these tools with epidemiological evidence.; We reviewed {{the scientific literature}} to identify contemporary and emerging tools and strategies for controlling and eliminating Gambiense HAT. Through an iterative process involving key stakeholders, we then developed comprehensive scenarios leading to elimination, considering both established and new tools for diagnosis, case treatment and vector control.; Core components of all scenarios include detecting and treating cases with established or emerging techniques. Relatively more intensive scenarios incorporate vector control. New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with <b>fexinidazole</b> or oxaboroles.

40|$|Purpose of review: This review covers recent {{developments}} towards novel treatments for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Recent findings: Within the past decade, some important {{advances in the}} treatment of HAT have been made. One old drug, melarsoprol, previously administered over a period of a month or more, is now given in a 10 -day regimen greatly reducing hospital costs. A combination chemotherapy, eflornithine alongside nifurtimox, has been introduced to decrease the time frame and overall dosing of eflornithine and reducing the risk of drug resistance emerging. One new, orally available diamidine prodrug, pafuramidine, that recently completed phase III clinical trials, disappointingly was halted in its progress to clinic when unforeseen toxicity issues emerged. The diamidine series, however, has recently yielded representatives that cure second-stage central nervous system (CNS) -involved infections in experimental animals while showing less tissue accumulation in mammals and thus offer considerable promise. A nitroheterocycle, <b>fexinidazole,</b> whose trypanocidal activity was first shown nearly 30 years ago, has entered clinical trials. Another approach, grounded in the use of pharmacokinetic data, has brought another new class of compound based on the oxaborole scaffold forward for clinical candidacy. Furthermore, several target-based and whole organism-based chemical compound screening campaigns have identified promising hits for lead development. Summary: The new developments in trypanocidal drug discovery mean that new compounds could become available within the next 5 years to support the WHO declared campaign to eliminate HAT. </p...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{discovery}} pipelines for the "neglected diseases" are now {{heavily populated}} with nitroheterocyclic compounds. Recently, the bicyclic nitro-compounds (R) -PA- 824, DNDI-VL- 2098 and delamanid {{have been identified}} as potential candidates for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Using a combination of quantitative proteomics and whole genome sequencing of susceptible and drug-resistant parasites we identified a putative NAD(P) H oxidase as the activating nitroreductase (NTR 2). Whole genome sequencing revealed that deletion of a single cytosine in the gene for NTR 2 that is likely to result in the expression of a non-functional truncated protein. Susceptibility of leishmania was restored by reintroduction of the wild-type gene into the resistant line, which was accompanied by the ability to metabolise these compounds. Overexpression of NTR 2 in wild-type parasites rendered cells hyper-sensitive to bicyclic nitro-compounds, but only marginally to the monocyclic nitro-drugs, nifurtimox and <b>fexinidazole</b> sulfone, known to be activated by a mitochondrial oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase (NTR 1). Conversely, a double knockout NTR 2 null cell line was completely resistant to bicyclic nitro-compounds and only marginally resistant to nifurtimox. Sensitivity was fully restored on expression of NTR 2 in the null background. Thus, NTR 2 is necessary and sufficient for activation of these bicyclic nitro-drugs. Recombinant NTR 2 was capable of reducing bicyclic nitro-compounds in the same rank order as drug sensitivity in vitro. These findings may aid the future development of better, novel anti-leishmanial drugs. Moreover, the discovery of anti-leishmanial nitro-drugs with independent modes of activation and independent mechanisms of resistance alleviates many of the concerns over the continued development of these compound series...|$|E
40|$|For {{over fifty}} years, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, {{sleeping}} sickness) {{has been treated}} with suramin, pentamidine and the very toxic organo-arsenical melarsoprol {{that was the only}} drug available for effective treatment of the second stage of the disease. Recently there have been significant efforts using molecular and biochemical approaches to drug design, including high-throughput screening, but the number of lead compounds with promising activity against T. brucei spp. and an acceptable toxicity index has remained astonishingly small. Clinical research continues to be difficult due to the economic constraints and the complexity of trials on a low prevalence disease in remote and impoverished African regions. Despite those limitations the situation for the patients is improving thanks to the combination of a number of critical factors. By the late 1990 s the disease had reached epidemic levels that triggered political support. WHO would sign a donation agreement with the manufacturers for all drugs to treat HAT. A result of this agreement was that eflornithine which is much safer than melarsoprol became available and widely used by non-governmental organizations. The Impamel I and II programmes demonstrated that against all odds the conduct of clinical trials on HAT was feasible. This allowed the initiation of trials on combination therapies which eventually resulted in the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment (NECT). This combination is currently being introduced as first line treatment, and there is even the prospect of having a new compound, <b>fexinidazole,</b> in the development pipeline. This review summarizes the key information about the existing drugs and gives a comprehensive summary about the recent and currently ongoing efforts towards new drug...|$|E
40|$|Advocacy {{for better}} drugs {{and access to}} {{treatment}} has boosted the interest in drug discovery and development for Chagas disease, a chronic infection caused by the genetically heterogeneous parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. in this work new in vitro assays were used {{to gain a better}} understanding of the antitrypanosomal properties of the most advanced antichagasic lead and clinical compounds, the nitroheterocyclics benznidazole, nifurtimox and <b>fexinidazole</b> sulfone, the oxaborole AN 4169, and four ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors -posaconazole, ravuconazole, EPL-BS 967 and EPL-BS 1246. Two types of assays were developed: one for evaluation of potency and efficacy in dose-response against a panel of T. cruzi stocks representing all current discrete typing units (DTUs), and a time-kill assay. Although less potent, the nitroheterocyclics and the oxaborole showed broad efficacy against all T. cruzi tested and were rapidly trypanocidal, whilst ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors showed variable activity that was both compoundand strain-specific, and were unable to eradicate intracellular infection even after 7 days of continuous compound exposure at most efficacious concentrations. These findings contest previous reports of variable responses to nitroderivatives among different T. cruzi strains and further challenge the introduction of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors as new single chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of Chagas disease.
