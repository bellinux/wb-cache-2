I have given you one example of Gothic ornament, meant to be seen close; now {{let me give you}} one of Gothic ornament intended to be seen far off. Here (fig. 16) is a sketch of a niche at Amiens Cathedral, some fifty or sixty feet high on the façade, and seven or eight feet wide. Now observe, in the ornament close to the eye, you had six figures and a whole wreath of roses {{in the space of a}} foot and a half square; but in the ornament sixty feet from the eye, you have now only ten or twelve large leaves in a space of eight feet square! and note also that now there is no attempt whatsoever at the refinement <b>of</b> line and <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> which there was in the other example. The sculptor knew that, at the height of this niche, people would not attend to the delicate lines, and that the broad shadows would catch the eye instead. He has therefore left, as you see, rude square edges to his niche, and carved his leaves as massively and broadly as possible: and yet, observe how dexterously he has given you a sense of delicacy and minuteness in the work, by mingling these small leaves among the large ones. I made this sketch from a photograph, and the spot in which these leaves occurred was obscure; I have, therefore, used those of the Oxalis acetosella, of which the quaint form is always interesting.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is the study of}} the effect <b>of</b> the <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> glass when it has a {{structural}} function. Experimental investigations carried out for glass specimens are presented. Various series of annealed glass beam were tested, with cut edge and with ground edge. The glass specimens are tested in four-point bending performing flaw detection on the tested specimens after failure, in order to determine glass strength. As a result, bending strength values are obtained for each specimen. Determining some physical parameter as the depth of the flaw and the mirror radius of the fracture, after the failure of a glass element, it could be possible to calculate the failure strength of that. The experimental results were analyzed with the LEFM theory and the glass strength was analyzed with a statistical study using two-parameter Weibull distribution fitting quite well the failure stress data. The results obtained constitute a validation of the theoretical models and show the influence <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> processing on the failure strength of the glass. Furthermore, series with different sizes were tested in order to evaluate the size effect...|$|R

50|$|Another {{way to make}} key {{elements}} of ceramic tile in the Spanish Revival tradition is {{through the process of}} extrusion. Unfired clay, usually dark red clay in the Spanish Revival tradition, is pushed under high pressure through a die or mold that extrudes a certain shape. After the pieces are extruded, they either glazed and fired or just fired, thereby retaining their dark red color. As illustrated in the original Malibu Potteries catalog, such shapes included quarter rounds and bullnose, and other shapes that <b>finished</b> the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> tiles or enabled the tile to change directions, {{as can be seen in}} the pictures below of the bench and in the Star fountain.

Conventional tumble deburring processes {{have been used}} for years in the surface finishing industries. The manual process is tedious, inconsistent and inaccurate. Automation in the finishing process has been proved very beneficial. Integration of robots in the process provides more flexible and convenient process. We investigate the off-line simulation <b>of</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>edges</b> using the Product Life Cycle tool DELMIA®. The process extracts the feature to generate a part finishing process plan. Collisions with the environment are detected and avoided through the simulation of cutting the path before the path is downloaded to the actual hardware. Either the tool or the part is being fixed on the robot’s end effector and simulated with respect to the defined path. This study presents the complete off-line simulation of the Part in Hand as well as Tool in Hand approaches for the deburring process...|$|R

Oscillations having a frequency above 15 kHz are imparted {{to one of the}} processed components (9), in the region of the molten phase (16) and to a filler material that is added to the region of the molten phase. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A transducer (8) clamped to the component being processed, imparts oscillation to the component. Alternatively, an oscillating jet of liquid is directed at a surface of the component to impart oscillation. Alternatively, gas with a superimposed oscillation is directed at the region of the molten phase, for imparting oscillation. The oscillations are tuned to a resonance range of the molten phase. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for thermal processing apparatus. USE - For thermal processing of workpieces e. g. thermal soldering, welding, cutting. ADVANTAGE - The method enables improving the quality of weld beads and cut edges that are formed and also increasing processing rate. Groove formation in the cut edges is avoided, thus eliminating the necessity for mechanical <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> the cut <b>edges</b> in laser beam cutting process. High speed cutting of thick sheet metal is enabled. In thermal welding process, the interfaces between the weld bead and the component substrate are formed homogeneously and with better mechanical properties, especially in terms of strength.
