So the day appointed was come, and the townsmen met together; Emmanuel also came down in his chariot, and all his captains in their state attending him, on the right hand and on the left.

60|$|Secondly: By {{bringing}} {{to mind the}} tragedy of this day, and the consequences that have arisen from it, we shall be convinced how necessary it is for those in power to curb, in season, all such unruly spirits as desire to introduce new doctrines and discipline in the Church, or new forms of government in the state. Those wicked Puritans began, in Queen Elizabeth's time, to quarrel only with surplices and other habits, with the ring in matrimony, the cross in baptism, and the like; thence {{they went on to}} <b>further</b> <b>matters</b> of higher importance, and, at last, they must needs have the whole government of the Church dissolved. This great work they compassed, first, by depriving the bishops of their seats in Parliament, then they abolished the whole order; and, at last, which was their original design, they seized on all the Church-lands, and divided the spoil among themselves; and, like Jeroboam, made priests of the very dregs of the people. This was their way of reforming the Church. As to the civil government, you have already heard how they modelled it upon the murder of their King, and discarding the nobility. Yet, clearly to shew what a Babel they had built, after twelve years' trial and twenty several sorts of government; the nation grown weary of their tyranny, was forced to call in the son of him whom those reformers had sacrificed. And thus were Simeon and Levi divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel.|$|E

50|$|After Chief Martial Law Administrator (later President) and Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq came {{to power}} (see Operation Fair Play), further advancements were made to enrich uranium and {{consolidate}} the nuclear development programme. On March 11, 1983, PAEC under Munir Ahmad Khan carried out the first successful cold test of a working nuclear device near at the Kirana Hills under codename Kirana-I. The test was led by CERN-physicist Ishfaq Ahmad, and was witnessed by other senior scientists belonging to Pakistan Armed Forces and the PAEC.

5000|$|Tatekawa {{acted as}} a key-player in the Mukden incident. Because of the {{increasing}} tension between the Kwantung Army in Manchuria and the Chinese troops, Emperor Hirohito ordered on September 11, 1931 the Minister of War, General Jiro Minami (南 次郎), to intervene and prevent the Kwantung Army from making any precipitous movement that would involve Japan in a war with China. Minami gathered the General Staff to discuss the situation in Manchuria. General Major Tatekawa was also present. He stated that the Kwantung Army was intelligent enough not to commit such action on their own initiative. It got decided that Tatekawa {{would be sent to}} Mukden to curb the militarist behavior of the Kwantung Army. Two letters would be delivered in person by Tatekawa to the head commander of the Kwantung Army, Lieutenant General Shigeru Honjo (本庄 繁). One letter was written by General Jiro Minami, another by General Kanaya Hanzo. These letters contained a warning for the Kwantung Army not to take any actions without consulting Tokyo. Tatekawa’s assistant, Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto (橋本 欣五郎), announced the mission of Tatekawa’s visit by a secret message to Colonel Seishiro Itagaki (板垣 征四郎) of the Kwantung Army. Informed of the arrival of Tatekawa, Colonel Itagaki and Lieutenant Colonel Kanji Ishiwara (石原 莞爾) decided to act earlier on their plot and kindly welcoming Tatekawa at the same time. Colonel Itagaki waited for Tatekawa. Tatekawa immediately informed the Colonel about the concern Tokyo had about the reckless behavior of the young Kwantung officers but he added that he would wait until the next day to discuss <b>further</b> <b>matters.</b> Tatekawa’s train arrived in Mukden on September 18, 1931, where he got escorted to a Japanese restaurant. He spent the night with geisha, sake and was fast asleep by 9pm. That same night at 10:22 PM a part of the railway near Liutiaogou, property of and exploited by Japan, got blown up by a Japanese commando. The explosion’s damage was minimal, however the effects had major consequences. The Japanese military command immediately blamed the Chinese army for the sabotage and took over Mukden City the next day. Five months later the Kwantung Army occupied the whole of Manchuria.|$|E

Various factors and theories, which influence the location of a PIRC, are analysed by means of a literature study, personal investigation and practical experience.
