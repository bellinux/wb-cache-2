The Academy's tour of the West Indies was cut short on 24 February for Cook who only appeared in the first innings, scoring only 6, before being called up, alongside James Anderson and Owais Shah, to the England tour of India to replace captain Michael Vaughan, who was suffering from a knee injury, and opener Marcus Trescothick, who was suffering from stress. Unlike Shah and Anderson, Cook was welcomed straight into the England XI and made his Test debut aged 21, days after he had flown in from the West Indies. He made an instant <b>impact,</b> <b>opening</b> with Andrew Strauss and scoring a half century in the first innings before being bowled just before tea on the first day for 60 runs from 160 balls being the second top scorer after 134 from Paul Collingwood. The second innings would prove to cement him in cricket history as he went on to score 104 not out before England declared, making him the sixteenth Englishman to score a century on his debut Test and an even more exclusive list of five to score 100 and 50 in their first Test. His hundred was also the 3,000th century in Test cricket. Despite being known for a patient style of play, an impending declaration forced Cook to play quickly to bring up the century; regardless, the match was drawn. After a mediocre outing in the losing second Test, scoring 17 and 2, he missed the Third Test due to a stomach illness and was omitted from the one-day series.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} {{we have shown}} how to use individuals’ {{mobility}} behavior for a novel and challenging task: predicting the future presence of flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough and cold. To this end, we used the mobility information collected by mobile phones and the daily self-reported flu-like symptoms of 29 individuals in the time interval from February 20 to March 21 of 2013. Previous work has exploited the use of mobility features to predict mental health and well-being dimensions such as positive and negative emotions, stress level, and depression symptoms. To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first study that utilizes inference algorithms to predict the presence of influenza-like symptoms by only looking at the mobility behaviors of a specific individual. Our results represent a promising starting point for dealing with influenza-like public health issues.

30|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} {{the mobility of}} individuals {{is of paramount importance}} for public health. In particular, mobility characterization is key to predict the spatial and temporal diffusion of human-transmitted infections. However, the mobility behavior of a person can also reveal relevant information about her/his health conditions. In this paper, we study the impact of people mobility behaviors for predicting the future presence of flu-like and cold symptoms (i.e. fever, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle pain, malaise, and cold). To this end, we use the mobility traces from mobile phones and the daily self-reported flu-like and cold symptoms of 29 individuals from February 20, 2013 to March 21, 2013. First of all, we demonstrate that daily symptoms of an individual can be predicted by using his/her mobility trace characteristics (e.g. total displacement, radius of gyration, number of unique visited places, etc.). Then, we present and validate models that are able to successfully predict the future presence of symptoms by analyzing the mobility patterns of our individuals.

30|$|The {{utilization}} of testbeds {{to evaluate the}} performance of IEEE 802.11 technologies to transmit data over vehicles has been addressed in previous work. In [5], a testbed is created to assess the capabilities of IEEE 802.11 standards in terms of Round Trip Time and packet losses. The results include {{an evaluation of the}} performance of VTV and RTV multi-hop communications based on the IEEE 802.11 b standard, revealing that distance and line of sight communication are the two factors that mainly affect network communications. In the same way, in [6], it was demonstrated the feasibility of using IEEE 802.11 b networks for transfer control protocol and user datagram protocol communications with moving cars. The authors conduct experiments in a friendly environment, with no obstacles or interferences from other radios and vehicles. Therefore, the results can be interpreted as a first approach to vehicular communications. There also exist other interesting testbeds that use IEEE 802.11 p, in which this article is focused on. For instance, in [7], it was established a relationship between theoretical measures and the ones obtained with a testbed. According to the authors, their experiments lead to the first public data available from real measurements using NEC Linkbird-MX IEEE 802.11 p cards, which showed that the results obtained were closely related to the theoretical figures. These results had a great <b>impact,</b> <b>opening</b> the possibility of evaluating IEEE 802.11 p-based testbeds without requiring to perform measurements on the road.|$|E
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the {{research}} in biology and in particular in regenerative medicine, it is widely requested the ability to perform measurements that have a low impact on the observed biological systems. Many measurements imply sample modifications and also sample fixation avoiding living samples measurements. In this doctoral thesis it is presented the realization of an advanced optical multimodal microscope that integrates coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation and two-photon excitation fluorescence techniques in a single powerful tool. The combination of all these microscopy techniques in a single microscope allows gathering more information during samples imaging, implementing fluorescence technique with label free techniques. A description of the experimental setup of the realized multimodal microscope is presented together with the metrological characterization of the instrument, evaluating the main uncertainty sources that influence the measurement processes. Label free microscopy techniques allow performing measurements on biological samples with low invasiveness, since to image the specimens it is not demanded any specific sample preparation. This characteristic leads to measurements on living samples with a true low <b>impact,</b> <b>opening</b> new avenues on the research in biology and in particular way in regenerative medicine. Novel applications of these microscopy techniques are presented to study the extracellular matrix production in both fixed and living samples, as well as to characterize the scaffolds topology and the scaffold-cells interactions in a time-lapse experiment using living samples. This doctorate thesis is composed by a state of the art chapter in which are discussed the advanced nonlinear optical microscopy techniques from a theoretical point of view, the main experimental implementations of CARS microscopy and the main parameters and properties to be measured relevant in regenerative medicine applications and products. A chapter is dedicated to the experimental setup for the realization of the multimodal CARS-SHG-TPEF microscope at the I. N. Ri. M. laboratory. A specific chapter is dedicated {{to the study of the}} main sources of uncertainty of the measurements using CARS, TPEF and SHG techniques. A chapter in which are discussed the biological experiments realized using the multimodal CARS-SHG-TPEF microscope and at the end a final chapter with the conclusion of this doctorate thesis. This study has been conducted at the Italian institute of metrology (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica, I. N. Ri. M.) as part of the projects REGENMED, METREGEN and ACTIVE with funding respectively from the UE (ERA-NET plus Grant Agreement No 217257) and from Piedmont Region on UE under the programs CIPE 2007 - converging technologies, grant 0126000010 -METREGEN and POR-FESR I-I. 1. 3 -I 1. 1 - ACTIVE.

40|$|Abstract: The anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anti-convulsant {{properties}} of benzodiazepines (BDZs) require modulation of distinct GABAA receptor α-subtypes. BDZ modulation of GABAA receptors {{is often described}} in terms of increased opening frequency, and contrasted with the increased open durations occurring with barbiturate modulation. Several studies spanning single channel, rapid kinetic, and whole cell techniques have suggested that BDZs effect this observed change in frequency through increased affinity for GABA. BDZ-sensitive αβγ isoforms exist at extrasynaptic as well as synaptic locations, where they encounter markedly different concentration and time-course of GABA exposure. Interestingly, this affinity-based mechanism (specifically, decreasing the GABA unbinding rate) is only predicted to increase opening frequency under conditions that allow the unbinding and rebinding cycles typical of prolonged exposure to low GABA concentrations, which are more likely to occur at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. In contrast, when rebinding is less likely, such as may occur in certain synaptic conditions, the number, but not the frequency, of channel openings increases in response to BDZ modulation. In conclusion, not only can multiple kinetic mechanisms alter channel opening frequency, but a single mechanism – increased affinity – <b>impacts</b> <b>opening</b> frequency differently under different contexts of GABAA receptor activation...|$|R
