It is invested in a gypsum or phosphate-bonded investment material, allowed to set then put into a furnace where the wax is completely burnt out leaving a hole for the gold to be poured in. Once the crown has cooled, the technician can remove the sprue, fit and polish the crown ready for cementation. The crown is returned to the dentists office where they can remove any temporary crown and cement the finished gold crown.|$|E

40|$|Tooth {{segmentation}} on <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> is {{an essential}} step of computer-aided-design systems for orthodontic virtual treatment planning. However, fast and accurate identifying cutting boundary to separate teeth from <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> still remains a challenge, due to various geometrical shapes of teeth, complex tooth arrangements, different <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> qualities, and varying degrees of crowding problems. Most segmentation approaches presented before {{are not able to}} achieve a balance between fine segmentation results and simple operating procedures with less time consumption. In this article, we present a novel, effective and efficient framework that achieves tooth segmentation based on a segmentation field, which is solved by a linear system defined by a discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A set of contour lines are sampled from the smooth scalar field, and candidate cutting boundaries can be detected from concave regions with large variations of field data. The sensitivity to concave seams of the segmentation field facilitates effective tooth partition, as well as avoids obtaining appropriate curvature threshold value, which is unreliable in some case. Our tooth segmentation algorithm is robust to dental models with low quality, as well as is effective to dental models with different levels of crowding problems. The experiments, including segmentation tests of varying dental models with different complexity, experiments on dental meshes with different modeling resolutions and surface noises and comparison between our method and the morphologic skeleton segmentation method are conducted, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our method...|$|E

The aims were to focus on procedures that students will routinely undertake during work-placements and clinical rotations and to build upon the core skills taught in the preceding year. The procedures were selected from suggestions made by employers, graduates and students and included: • Otoscopic examination • Ophthalmic examination including direct ophthalmoscopy, Schirmer tear test and application of eye drops • Dermatology: skin scrape, tape strip and Diff Quick stain of slides • Dentistry: ultrasonic scaling, dental charts and making a basic <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> • Intermediate level suturing techniques: cruciate, intradermal and Aberdeen knot A range of models and instruction booklets were developed. This included an ocular model from Bristol Medical Pro Limited and an ear made from Tubigrip and plastic piping. Fruit was also utilized e. g. an eyelid cut into a lime, that simulated tear flow. The dental scaling model was based on Lumbis et al. 1 with input from the School of Oral and Dental Sciences, University of Bristol. In each practical, groups of 30 students visited stations during a 90 minute period. Feedback was gathered using Post-it® notes. Student comments were overwhelmingly positive with the sessions being considered ‘enjoyable’ and ‘helpful’. The value of using models prior to exposure to live animals was highlighted, while spending time making the basic <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> was seen as ‘therapeutic’. Some students requested more time, particularly for suturing.
