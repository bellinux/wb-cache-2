5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, it was {{revealed}} that the county had budgeted $13.5 million for the land, or about $1.7 million per acre for 8 acres, mistakenly assuming they could acquire it for roughly the <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> of the 2004 option agreement between the city of Minneapolis and Land Partners II (the investment group which owned Rapid Park). The <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> on that deal had been $12.9 million, though the deal had also included 5 acres of adjacent land. Effectively, it would have paid for only three acres of the 8-acre site that Hennepin County now needed to acquire, at a proposed price of $4.3 million per acre.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} total <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> of fraud is {{committed by the}} health insurance companies themselves. There are numerous studies and articles detailing examples of insurance companies intentionally not paying claims and deleting them from their systems, denying and cancelling coverage, and the blatant underpayment to hospitals and physicians beneath what are normal fees for care they provide. Although difficult to obtain the information, this fraud by insurance companies can be estimated by comparing revenues from premium payments and expenditures on health claims.|$|E

25|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program will {{electrify}} {{the main}} line between San Francisco and the San Jose Tamien Station, allowing transition from diesel-electric locomotive power to fully electric rolling stock. Proponents say electrification would improve service times via faster acceleration, allow better scheduling and reduce air pollution and noise. Electrification would also allow future expansion to downtown San Francisco. Electrified vehicles require less maintenance, but electrification will increase required track maintenance by about the same <b>dollar</b> <b>amount,</b> at least initially. The plan calls to electrify the system between San Francisco 4th and King Street Station and San Jose Tamien Station. Originally scheduled for completion by 2020, the schedule had slipped {{after three months of}} construction to December 30, 2021 and then April 22, 2022. At that point, Caltrain plans to use electric multiple units and increase service to six trains per hour in each direction.|$|E
25|$|Outstanding debts became heavier, because {{prices and}} incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts {{remained}} at the same <b>dollar</b> <b>amount.</b> After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday. Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers {{did not have time}} or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending. Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.|$|E

[...] "Filling a permit" [...] is when a contestant fulfills the requirements to become a WPRA card holder, which includes purchasing a permit and earning a minimum <b>dollar</b> <b>amount</b> at sanctioned rodeos.

500|$|MFP {{funding in}} the 2010-2011 fiscal year totaled $3,308,741,821. That amount divided evenly among 696,444 public school {{students}} in Louisiana would work out to $4,750 per pupil. But some students cost more to educate than others. Rather than increasing the <b>dollar</b> <b>amount,</b> the MFP formula artificially increases {{the number of students}} it funds.

50|$|By adding <b>dollar</b> <b>amounts</b> that {{represent}} different amounts of purchasing power, the resulting sum is misleading, {{as one would}} be adding 10,000 dollars to 10,000 Euros to get a total of 20,000. Likewise subtracting <b>dollar</b> <b>amounts</b> {{that represent}} different amounts of purchasing power may result in an apparent capital gain which is actually a capital loss. If a building purchased in 1970 for $20,000 is sold in 2006 for $200,000 when its replacement cost is $300,000, the apparent gain of $180,000 is illusory.|$|R
