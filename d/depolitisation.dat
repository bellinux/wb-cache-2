This forms part of Ionesco's severe and succinct review of the careers of Legionary-inspired intellectuals, many of them his friends and former friends, in a letter he sent to Tudor Vianu. In 1946, Ionesco indicated to Petru Comarnescu {{that he did not want}} to see either Eliade or Cioran, and that he considered the two of them [...] "Legionaries for ever"—adding [...] "we are hyenas to one another".|$|E
50|$|In March 2007, {{the first}} issue of the new Spex from Berlin came out. At that time, the paper became bi-monthly. This choice was driven by the {{in-depth}} transformation of the magazine's content and the decision to emphasise analysis of wider musical and artistic trends over news coverage. Spex is no longer focused on listing new releases, but also on critical analysis of modern social evolutions. It has more pages, longer articles, and fewer but more detailed record reviews. The conditions of the production of art are a topic of interest, with special reports on globalisation, the rise of digital culture, <b>depolitisation</b> and the difficulties of the music industry. There are many reasons for those editorial changes. In the last years of the Cologne period, readers complained about a degradation of the editorial quality, claiming that the magazine was losing its trademark wit and just compiling record reviews indifferently every month. In that sense, Spex was no longer a voice distinct from other music magazines such as Intro, Uncle Sally or Musikexpress. In addition, the financial difficulties of the music industry, meaning declining ad buy figures, might have decided Spex to diversify the subjects covered. Today, Spex in Berlin has outgrown the initial difficulties, with a solid financial situation and positive feedback from its readers and peers: with an 18,400 circulation in early 2007, it grew to 21,349 copies one year later, a 14% raise.

40|$|<b>Depolitisation</b> and {{professionalisation}} of {{the administration}} {{are some of the}} basic principles of administrative reform, which are implementing since 2004., in order to achieve the most important European standards in the Republic of Serbia. However, the new legislative framework in the field of civil service system is not fully completed, because it has to be finished the reform of the provincial and local civil service system, but there also appeared certain deviations from the <b>depolitisation</b> and professionalisation, as prescribed standards on the state level, which significantly depart a reform of public administration from desired and set goal. Frequent changes of government {{are one of the most}} important reasons which influenced that despite strict legal solutions, in practice, the process of <b>depolitisation</b> and professionalisation of public administration has ignored, what is reason why almost half of the civil servants on the position are not selected on the basis of the contest, according the legal requirements. Considering the fact that the selection of senior civil servants on the basis of competition, at this moment, is more exception than rule, in order to achieve <b>depolitisation</b> and professionalisation of public administration, it would be necessary immediate termination of function for all civil servants who are appointed without competition, as the current Law on Civil Servants stipulates, as well as the observance of prescribed requirements and bidding procedures for the selection of future civil servants. In order to achieve further professionalisation {{of the administration}}, it should be continue improvement of the civil service system, particularly with further development of the career system, where priority should be given to continuously professional development of civil servants, as well as improving the system of promoting and rewarding, through the reform of the wage system. At the provincial and local level, with new law of provincial and local servants, based on contemporary standards, should be regulated the issues of their legal status, and finally give opportunity to provincial and local authorities to carry out much-needed process of <b>depolitisation</b> and professionalisation of provincial and local servants. After elimination of observed deficiencies in the civil service system, the Republic of Serbia will be able to say that is fulfilled one of the main European standards in the field of administrative reform...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{explores the}} {{influence}} of the petroleum industry on the place identity of Stavanger, a Western Norwegian coastal city frequently called ‘the oil capital’. Based on interviews and focus groups including petroleum workers and people involved with regional image building in Stavanger municipality, this thesis explores the role of the petroleum industry in narratives on the past, present and future identity of Stavanger. This is conceptualised through a merged framework, where place identity is seen as both being constructed by the perceptions, feelings and meanings humans attach to places (sense of place) as well as the more structural and institutional place branding strategies (constructed place identity). A stated objective is now to alter Stavanger’s image, from the oil capital to the energy capital. This thesis shows how the new image is failing to gain resonance in the narratives of the petroleum workers, and suggest two possible solutions: The <b>depolitisation</b> of the image change and the lack of novel content in the ‘energy capital’ identity. It also shows how the change in image is presented as non-conflictual, non-political and non-sacrificial...|$|E

Employability measures proposed by the recent Spanish Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and its antithetical youth representations (as a group ‘without qualities’ – the ‘NEETS’– {{while at the same}} time as a referential value and cultural model – ‘the young entrepreneur’-) will be analysed. These paradoxes strengthened by employability policies, and further aggravated in the wake of the current economic crisis, do not give rise to political contradictions due to the <b>depolitisation</b> promoted by employability policies: social problems are converted into individual deficits. These processes of psychologisation of work are further discussed on the basis of a recent study on employment counselling and career guidance to help to enhance the employability of jobless people in three Spanish cities, Seville, Madrid and Valencia. These tools are aimed at fostering employability of unemployed people with a high risk of social exclusion and are emblematic concerning the principle of employability (new governance tools, different intervention logics/principles).

40|$|Governments are {{by their}} very nature, very messy creatures, {{controlling}} upwards of 40 % of economic activity and with responsibilities throughout {{the lives of their}} citizens. It is unsurprising then that analysing governments is an equally messy task, given the need to explain phenomena ranging in scale from ëlite decisions through the organisational dynamics of complex bureau-cracies to governance outcomes. This makes it particularly difficult to analyse meaningfully radical changes in the nature of governments.

40|$|Young people’s mode of {{political}} participation {{in recent years}} has been an object of concern and debate among political scientists and youth researchers. Research-based evidence has shown that many of them are not interested in politics like the youth of yesteryears. This trend has been described as “youth de-politisation” or youth political disengagement. Young people are said to now find comfort in pleasure and “protest politics” which often do not lead them to political positions in government or in governance institutions. Some researchers have thus described them as a ‘protest generation’ in contrast to the ‘political generation’ of their parents and grandparents. This could have crucial political implications in the future, more so because a large proportion of the world’s population today consists of young people as the UN has documented. This paper thus seeks to examine these political implications (which have received little attention from researchers) from two theoretical perspectives: political science and youth studies. Questions as to whether this alleged growing youth de-politisation is jeopardizing or will jeopardize future democracy and governance, especially from the point of view of competent political leadership, or if it is merely a replacement of traditional and/or institutional forms of politics by young people with new patterns of expression and participation that some researchers term ‘juventization’, is examined. The cause(s) of this <b>depolitisation</b> is also looked into, and suggestions about youth participation in the future are made...|$|E

This article examines the impacts that the embrace of diversity talk has had on identity and ethnic politics in Turkey that has evolved toward a relative and selective recognition. Based on {{the analysis of the}} cases of the Laze and Kurdish movements, the article argues that the politics of recognition is built conjointly by an array of actors, at different levels, with different aims, and through their very practices and interactions. The article shows that although the embrace of diversity talk may mark a <b>depolitisation</b> of the ethno-national claims, it still gives room to forms of resistance. These dynamics have shaped a non-coherent, multi-layered, recognition that does not allow the building of a common ground in the country but rather of a battlefield around discursive and policies choices.

40|$|This Master´s thesis {{analyses}} how the World Social Forum WSF {{has emerged}} as a new global civil society space {{in the context of the}} expansion of economism and general <b>depolitisation</b> (cf. Teivainen), facilitated by the internationalisation process and supranational opportunity structures (cf. Tilly and Tarrow). The WSF brings together besides national social movements and their transnational coalitions also new types of transnational social movements and networks. It challenges essentially the expanding democratic deficits at local and national levels, but especially at the international level. Recent research has confirmed the high degree of critical debate on democracy present in social forums: especially internal democracy emerges as an important topic of discussion for the activists (cf. Della Porta). One of the main debates of the WSF is found around the questions whether to favour efficiency over participation or specialization over equality, or vice versa. This dilemma is reflected in the dispute whether the WSF should continue to follow Open Space methodology or move towards a political actor. The aim of this study is to analyse these competing discourses and framings among WSF movements, mirroring discourses to the four models of public sphere presented by Ferree, Gamson, Gerhards and Rucht, and the four conception of internal democracy of Donatella della Porta, and how they are implemented in WSF internal practices. Study identifies three major framings: the movement of movements framing tends to advocate the representative democracy model and the vertical party-type organisations following associational democracy models, i. e., delegation of power and the majority decision-making. The horizontal framing typically criticize the vertical structures and representative practices, and have instead developed horizontal network politics and follow constructionist democracy ideals, emphasizing priority of the prefigurative politics over the efficiency of decision-making. Another main issue explaining the divisions among WSF movements is their divergent relation to the axis of national/ transnational spheres and the changing power relations between these spheres. The open space framing typically relates to the transnationalism as an opportunity like those sympathising horizontal framing. Although no satisfactory solution seems ready yet to address the main organizational dilemmas of the WSF, some progress can anyhow be observed. Consequently, the WSF should be seen as a laboratory of prefigurative politics, developing and testing new form of politics and alternative democratic practices, a global civil society space where excluded voices gather and discuss alternative political and economic practices. It empowers local, national and transnational social movements to create new projects and alliances, and creates new identities, as well, perhaps new type of transnational identities as well.

40|$|High-class education. A {{critical}} {{discourse analysis}} of the magazine 'Klasse'. Over the past two decades, the magazine 'Klasse', published by the Ministry of Education has become an important phenomenon in Flemish education. 'Klasse' {{is not only a}} central instrument for information and communication in the relationship between the government and schools (or the educational field in general). As a policy instrument it {{is at the same time}} part of the optimization strategy of the government, aiming at innovation and quality improvement in Flemish education. Our study conceives of the magazine 'Klasse' as a steering instrument from the government and aims at a critical {{analysis of the}} way this steering actually operates through the discourse in the magazine. In other words, we look at the steering as it takes place through what is being written/said in 'Klasse'. We argue that the discourse in 'Klasse' positions educational actors (including policy makers) in a particular way. It creates expectations about how those actors should understand themselves, act and behave among each other. These positioning effects of the discourse in 'Klasse' constitute the heart of our research interest. 	In order to situate and justify our research interest we started with three literature reviews on the broader educational and policy context. These entail a study of the relationship between the government and the educational field in the broader international and Flemish policy context; a study of the phenomenon of the 'mediatization' of actual (educational) policy; and a study of the history of the magazine 'Klasse' itself in Flemish education. These literature reviews result in a fine-tuning of the problem statement that focuses on two questions: how does 'Klasse' operate in the Flemish educational context and how does it influence the way the government and the teachers are supposed to relate to each other? 	The theoretical perspective and the methodological framework are presented in Chapter two. Theoretically our work joins the so-called governmentality studies, inspired by the work of Michel Foucault, that investigate how 'government through self-government' takes place in specific contexts and how particular power configurations operate in society. We assume that the 'order of discourse' in 'Klasse' can elucidate how this way of governing operates in the Flemish educational context. Methodologically we draw on the work of Norman Fairclough as we developed and adapted his critical discourse analysis in our study. This methodology develops through three research phases: text analysis, discourse analysis and social analysis. Adapting the phases in line with the governmentality perspective, implied that our text analysis focuses on the representations, actions and discursive identities. The discourse analysis linkes those aspects with discourses, genres and profiles of characters respectively as well as with the 'order of discourse' of 'Klasse'in general. The social analysis focuses on the assemblage of apparatuses and the governmental regime. 	Chapter three extensively reports on the results of the discourse analysis. The different discourses, genres and profiles of the characters that were identified in 'Klasse', are defined and illustrated using text fragments. The particular combination of these discourses, genres and profiles in the magazine reveals three constant elements in the order of discourse in 'Klasse': 'Klasse' is a magazine about educational quality, is an edutainment magazine, and is a mediatizing magazine. We further argue that over the years the appreciation as well as the definition of expertise of different educational actors in Klasse has clearly shifted. 	In Chapter four we focus on the 'effects' of this order of discourse of 'Klasse' using the perspective of governmentality. We demonstrate that the order of discourse of 'Klasse' installs a synoptical power configuration in education. In this power configuration a particular type of feedback information constituted by stories of experience and examples of good practice  plays a crucial role. Through this feedback information educational actors are responsibilized and mobilized to fully engage as a person and to share their individual experiences with others in the educational community. And in this way they can at the same time permanently collect new feedback information on their own functioning, and be an inspiring example to others. Following Foucault, we argue that this kind of feedback information establishes a double bind between personalization and community building in education. This power configuration positions the educational government as a coaching information-manager of the educational field. The teachers are positioned as active experts-of-themselves, with their practical experience and the professionalization of their personality constituting the core of that expertise. Furthermore, we show that through this central role of feedback information an information apparatus is installed in education, in which assuring and guaranteeing access to feedback information is the essential governmental strategy. Moreover, we argue that this information apparatus allies itself with the quality apparatus and the learning apparatus in education, and as such contributes to the effectiveness of the advanced liberal regime of government in Flemish education. In Chapter five we analyze the consequences or 'side-effects' of this synoptical power configuration for the public in education. We demonstrate that the focus on feedback information as unique and personal experiences 'matters of experience'  results in a privatization and <b>depolitisation</b> of education. This leaves no more space for 'matters of public concern'. The order of discourse of 'Klasse' and its emphasis on examples of good practice further creates a privatization of the experiences of the teacher. Finally we argue that still a different attitude of the teachertowards himself remains possible, more in particular one that acknowledges the crucial role of vulnerability and e-ducational experiences in teaching. nrpages: 311 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|On the {{occasion}} of {{the annual meeting of the}} “Foreign Policy Association” in New York on 7 May 2003, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said in a both humorous and serious address that the transatlantic alliance had left the differences of opinion over the Iraq War behind, and now it was time to ensure together a place in the world for the Iraqi people as a free, stable and self-governing country. None of the members should think that they could handle the major global challenges alone. The easing of the tension sworn to by Colin Powell may have been helped by the fact that neither the optimistic supporters nor the pessimistic critics were right on the course or outcome of the Iraq War. While one might speak of a kind of freeing of the Iraqis, the ambivalence in the Iraqi people towards this freedom by war and occupation has been underestimated by the “liberators”. Peace is still a long way off. This applies not only to the difficult material and political reconstruction in Iraq. Popularity ratings for the USA have waned since 1992, in the Muslim world they are ultimately “in the basement”. Here, support for the western fight against terrorism has also waned. To date, there has been no evidence of the given reasons for the war, the lack of credibility, perhaps even open manipulation of their own as well as the global public by the leading western power and her coalition partners may lead to further immense strain. If the project to stabilise Iraq in human terms fails, not only those directly affected but, due to the global implications, many other countries will also suffer irrespective of whether they were for or against the war. In this respect, Colin Powell is doubtless right: even those among the USA’s allies who were against the war have no choice but to accept the task of supporting post-war Iraq; not least because the historical balance of US policy of democratization through intervention is negative overall. The appeal to common values and the requirement of a partnership of convenience of course cannot hide longer-lasting ill feelings: “USA bashing” is popular in Europe, and “Europe bashing” is popular in the USA. Anti-Americanism is nothing new in Europe, it is as old as the founding of the “New World”. American reservations towards Europe extend on their part to the time of the physical and political separation from the “Old (European) World”, in this respect too, such reservations have time and again assumed different forms in the historical process. These frequently ritualised, habitual antiattitudes are full of projections and can easily be refuted empirically. More interesting than the simple fact of animosity is the question of how deep it runs and whether it impacts the substance of the transatlantic relationship. The controversy over the dealings with Saddam Hussein and his disarmament obligations are part of a larger picture in which the USA’s foreign policy goals and strategies play a part or are put up for discussion. More important than anti-American sentiment which has always been present in Germany and Europe as a whole, is the fact that a lot of basically pro-American politicians, journalists and intellectuals in Europe are increasingly concerned about a long-term trend of US global policy which has reached new heights with the Bush government: militant nationalism and unilateralism combined with militarised power politics. The following are particularly striking examples of this trend: the rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, originally an accepted return service for II the unlimited extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1995; the strong reactions by the USA to the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the associated pressure on countries who signed up to this statute; the refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of worldwide CO 2 emissions, combined with an energy policy promoting a drastic increase in the use of fossil fuels; and – in retrospect particularly piquant in the light of the war waged by the USA on Saddam Hussein for assumed non-compliance with the conditions concerning the destruction of his weapons of mass destruction – the relaxation of the inspections contrary to agreement, which the radical conservative Republicans demanded from the Clinton Administration for the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and by which they have undermined the effectiveness of this exemplary convention in terms of world order politics. The question is, therefore, whether the transatlantic “ill feeling” in connection with the Iraq crisis is in fact part of a larger crisis in European-American relations. In addition to the central dimensions of relations between Europe and the USA, this report therefore gives special attention to the foreign and security policy “grand strategy” of the United States. There is (as yet) no question of irreparable harm done to European-American relations. The general public on both sides of the Atlantic are still a lot closer than the differences on the diplomatic level would suggest. Although the mutual popularity ratings of the USA and Europe have dropped compared to 2002, the have somewhat recovered from their lowest point shortly before the Iraq War. The reservations of critics of the USA are based less on the American people than on the politics of the Bush Administration. Majorities in several European NATO countries are calling for more independence from the USA, yet more important is the findings that public opinion in the USA is no less multilaterally disposed than in Europe; on the other hand, Europeans do not vote as antimilitarily as many hardliners in the USA think. However, American citizens feel (in a very much similar order) altogether more threatened by perceived problematic international developments than Europeans. This difference was already visible before 11 September 2001, but it has intensified since the attacks. And Europeans want to cooperate with the USA equally on the security policy level, but are far more critical of military expenditures than Americans. There are furthermore some differences in long-term attitudes: Americans are clearly more nationalistic than most Europeans, and for them religion plays a much stronger role, privately and in the political arena. Economic relations between the USA and Europe house a series of systematic problems and current conflicts, in no way untypical of partners who are also competitors. Nonetheless, the majority of experts do not expect that this will result in a comparable addition of divisions as in security policy or international law. The US and EU economies are deeply integrated and intermeshed, and this intermeshing has clearly increased in recent years. Transatlantic economic relations form the most closely-knit trade and investment system in the world. Economic policy integration does trail behind the development of material processes of exchange, but these are more heavily regulated than ever, in particular owing to the dispute settlement mechanism, which was substantitally improved with the foundation of the WTO. In addition to the mode of power, the mode of compromise characterises transatlantic economic relations. This balance could of course be put under pressure, if poor global economic trends and structural economic problems on III both sides of the Atlantic were to further diminish the readiness to compromise and adapt in favour of global agreements (for example in the agricultural sector or in the area of regulating international financial markets). However, decisive changes now characterise relations between the USA and her allies on the level of the “grand strategy” in foreign policy, primarily in security policy and international law. The USA has gradually revoked the liberal-institutionalist basis of its hegemonial global order policy, which dominated the period after the Second World War. The conservative revolution and the Republican majority in Congress introduced this Uturn in the mid- 1990 s, and it is now being continued on the neoconservative line with support from large parts of the Bush jr. Administration. The majority of relevant decision- makers among the Republicans in Congress and in the administration comprise three groups: old hardliners from the Cold War period, who are oriented towards categories of power, especially military power, Christian fundamentalists, and neoconservatives. In the fight against terror and rogue states, the three groups have found their mission around which they are redefining themselves. The new “grand strategy” has neoimperial traits: The USA will do everything she can to maintain her military advantage; no other power or group of powers should be given the opportunity to catch up with her. The new global strategy includes a dramatisation of new threats, which can no longer be suppressed with deterrence; potential threats ought to or must be fought anticipatively i. e. preventively. International rules, treaties and alliances are experiencing a clear debasement in the face of the primacy of freedom of action. The result of these ideological shifts in the USA is a long list of acts in the international arena, in which the United States reject, sabotage or do not support joint solutions in ways equal to her importance and economic capacity. How can we explain the differences in basic global ideas and their legal and specific political shaping between large parts of the ruling political elites in the USA and Europe? The “personae” in the transatlantic drama are not important for structural realism, they just act out roles prescribed by the division of power. The USA is a leading super power and she behaves accordingly. It was only under the protective shield of the USA, that Europe could unite at all, and today places the accent on the “soft” methods of power policy. The USA cannot and ought not to adopt the policy of “be nice to and get along with each other”, since, in an overwhelmingly anarchically structured global polity in which violent provocations can be expected all the time, she has the task of safeguarding the security of the West. This “division of labor”, which is reflected - if only to a certain extent - in opinion surveys, and the fact that economic relations are less asymmetric and therefore less controversial, appears to support the “realist” position. But by itself it cannot explain the differences between the main participants; the division of power still leaves a lot of room for the shaping of specific policy, as the considerable differences between individual US administrations demonstrate. Social constructivism therefore stresses the importance of political culture, differences in the experience and world views of large collectives. “Exceptionalism”, the specifically American variant of nationalism, also fundamentalist traits, which are now clear up to President Bush, can be traced back to the beginnings of the “New World”. Likewise, pronounced individualism, which shows itself in foreign policy terms to be greatly sensitive IV to curtailments of sovereignty. In this context, the paradox of strength and vulnerability must also be mentioned, which again showed itself very clearly just after the attacks, which dramatically questioned the supposed security of the USA based on the highly asymmetrical division of power in the world. Finally – the flipside of the paradox – the different experience of war between the USA and Europe. For the USA the Second World War was itself primarily a “foreign affair”, quite different to the associations the Germans (and Europeans) have of the Second World War or of war in general. Certain trends and tendencies in the USA, which are difficult to understand in Europe, can be clarified with these references to ideas and ideals, but they do not explain why the multilateral dimension obvious in opinion surveys and in the history of US foreign policy can these days scarcely maintain its hold. To understand this, we need to look at the processes of preference formation in the United States, which is the major concern of liberal international relations theory. There are a series of mechanisms which cause the orientations of the ruling bodies in the USA to clash with the preferences of the majority in many cases, even though they were democratically elected. The weakness of the American party system must be mentioned here, which opens up particular opportunities of influence to highly motivated and wellorganised ideological groupings – in particular conservative-fundamentalist trends. The governing technique of the Bush jr. Administration plays a large part in that the deficits of its domestic competence (large parts of its policy programme are not in accordance with the wishes of the majority) are successfully compensated in the area of security policy. Many prominent Democrats were not convinced by the arguments of a new threat from Iraq and suspected political staging, but they were defeated in the autumn 2002 elections – with or without opposition. To date, the manipulation of fear, and patriotically-oriented and non-critical media have also helped, has functioned such that large elements of the American public were convinced of the threat by Saddam Hussein including his involvement in the attacks on 11 September. Neomarxist analyses would carve out more strongly the crisis tendencies of American capitalism, which is in no way as stable as it appears. Spectacular deficits in regulation have led to massive fixing of the balance sheets and other deceits, many small investors have been ruined and confidence in the American economy as a whole has been seriously affected. In addition to that there is the “fossilistic” energy policy which can no longer form the basis of a lasting economic model; furthermore, old problems such as private wealth and public poverty (deficits in the infrastructure, financial crises in the cities, worsening budget deficits) or the chronically negative trade figures. These crisis tendencies are underpinned by a dramatically increasing inequality in the distribution of income and wealth, which, in the opinion of critics, endangers democracy as well as economic stability. Instead of a structurally-reformist response to these crisis phenomena, the Bush Administration has given a particularist one which – internally as well as externally – favours oil interests, the Christian-fundamentalist clientele, the rich and the super-rich, a response which it protects with a “populist façade” and the fight against “evil”. Many of the described tendencies run together in the US policy against Iraq. The neoconservatives saw in Iraq, which up until the Second Gulf War in 1991 was one of the V United States’ stability partners against the Islamic revolution in Iran, a threat to the geostrategic and energy interests of the United States and a potential support for terrorism. With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the USA is combining hope for political change in the region, which will not only benefit her interests, but also a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She won the war, in fact faster and with less serious loss of lives than the majority of critics feared, but at the price of further major damage to the United Nations and international law, further splits in the state community and increased reservations towards US global policy. And she has not yet won the peace. The positive effects of the removal of Saddam Hussein are extremely hard to assess not just because of the politically, legally and ethically questionable attendant circumstances. And the Iraq War does not stand alone, it is part of a changed global strategy of the USA. To face the major global challenges, including security policy challenges, the United States depend on the goodwill and cooperation of not only the international community of states, but also on international society. This the Bush Administration does admit occasionally, while at the same time it defiantly declares that they can and will go it alone, when others do not want to cooperate on the USA’s terms. Her manic view of the world (if you’re not for us, you’re against us) with its decontextualisation and <b>depolitisation</b> of terrorism, which she stylises counter-fundamentally as “evil” per se, makes her blind to her own mistakes and prevents a prudent answer, which must be differentiated between the hard and incorrigible ideologically fanatical core of Islamic terrorists, on the one hand, and the however justified or unjustified resentment against the USA in the Arabic and Islamic world, on the other. The reservations against the USA, especially US foreign policy, have increased and not just among Muslims. The world sees the United States no way near as benevolent as the Americans see themselves. That should give a prudent world power something to think about. A prudent hegemon will, in order to extend its power, offer to limit its own autonomy and freedom of action. It will give smaller powers the feeling that it is taking them seriously, it will pick up on their matters of concern. It creates and preserves institutions finalising arrangements and agreements which last beyond the peak of its power. The biggest temptation for a hegemon is to go it alone, dictation instead of consultation, a preacher and imposer of its values. Many of the USA’s best friends and many intellectuals in the USA themselves fear that the current US administration is tempted by this “arrogance of power”. In the search for an antidote to the “arrogance of power”, advice could be taken from the founding fathers of the USA and their debates on the best constitution of the new community: “checks and balances”. It is completely possible that in the USA itself effective counterweights are already being formed against the course of the current administration. The discernible deficits in economic development and the exacerbation of social problems in the broadest sense are pointing in this direction. A lot will depend on whether there will be more big attacks giving new impetus to the siege mentality and the focus on the foreign enemy. Europe’s task must be to accept its part in the “balancing”. It is not a question of classic geopolitical counterweight politics, since, for various systematic, historical and political reasons, only a form of “cooperative balancing”, i. e. the forVI mation of international and transnational coalitions in the global political consensus formation processes is worth considering. The “old Europe” has a lot to offer these consensus formation processes, in which the use of “soft power” takes priority. Basic principles such as a system of law between nation-states, coordination via common organisations and common rules specific to political fields, non-aggression, consideration of the interests of partners and consideration also of the demands from weaker members represent expertise and experience which make the EU attractive to all states, elites and populations who are at least tentatively interested in the growing regulation and legalisation of international relations. Of course, the EU trails in many respects behind its demands and opportunities for world order. These shortcomings are more often than not hidden behind criticism of the USA’s unilateralism, even if this is justified. Or Europe herself practises an arrogance of power, as in France’s attitude towards new members who dared to speak out in favour of the American position on Iraq; or as in the German government’s attitude, which, through its unconditional ‘no’ to any form of internationally sanctioned policy of deterring a serious breach of international law by Saddam Hussein, itself incurred accusations of unilateralism and contributed to the sad fact that the Europeans could not manage to put together a common counter-position to the hardliners in the USA. The irony of such European arrogance of power is that, in view of the real power relationship, it produces only variants of an arrogance of impotence. In principle, the Europeans possess the right counterweight to the “assertive unilateralism” of the radical conservatives in the USA, they just need to position it better jointly in the scales. In addition to this, a stronger integration of their armed forces and a more efficient confederal division of labor in procurement policy is needed...|$|E
