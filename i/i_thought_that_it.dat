5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
500|$|Shore {{traced the}} concept {{for the title}} {{character}} to {{his experience as a}} patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled: [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E

500|$|Series creator David Shore {{traced the}} concept for House to his {{background}} as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be interesting to}} see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were [...] "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, {{he fell in love with}} a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question [...] "Why am I wasting your time?".|$|E
2500|$|In Westways Magazine, Smith {{wrote about}} {{driving down the}} Los Angeles River: [...] "As {{we came out of}} the river I saw the Queen Mary. [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was fitting to have a ship without engines sailing up a river without water." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2007, Doc Walker went {{solo and}} hosted The Doc Walker Show from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. WTTG's Dave Feldman and Comcast SportsNet's Carol Maloney hosted {{a new show}} called Feldman and Maloney between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Brian Mitchell moved to The John Thompson Show as co-host. [...] Regarding going solo, Walker said, [...] "Management {{came to me and}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was time to do my own show. If you are lucky enough {{to get a chance to}} do your own show you would be foolish not to take it. I will miss Al and Coach, but it was a perfect time for me to go out on my own." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions. According to Chomsky: [...] "he real work is being done by people who are not known, that's always been true in every popular movement in history...I don't know how you get that across in a film. Actually, come to think of it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don't see a lot of visual stuff, so I'm not the best commentator, but I thought Salt of the Earth really did it. It was a long time ago, but at the time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was one of the really great movies—and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never shown." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Gospel Flava that she [...] "received tremendous support" [...] from Music World, saying, [...] "they came to me. There wasn't a question as to what type of music I was going to do. Music World has a Gospel division and I'm the first artist to come out on Music World and in the Gospel division. I'd love to do more and more Gspel projects". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, [...] "I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that. They go Gospel when they don't have anything else to do anymore, you know? I chose to do this while I can reach people." ...|$|E
