Where these two national highways overlap, a divided highway segment handles the AADT which is about 4500 vpd. There is a rest area at km 281.1 south of Chamberlain with an historical marker. To the west of the highway are afforded views of the Arm River valley. At km 276.1, the highway takes a sharp turn to continue north as it leaves the Highway 11 concurrency.

6000|$|Perhaps History has dwelt {{too much}} on the blind side of this {{expensive}} King. Toland, on entering his country, was struck rather with the signs of good administration everywhere. No sooner have you crossed the Prussian Border, out of Westphalia, says Toland, than smooth highways, well-tilled fields, and a general air of industry and regularity, are evident: solid milestones, brass-bound, and with brass inscription, tell the traveller where he is; who finds due guidance of finger-posts, too, and the blessing of habitable inns. The people seem all to be busy, diligently occupied; villages reasonably swept and whitewashed;--never was a better set of Parish Churches; whether new-built or old, they are all in brand-new repair. The contrast with Westphalia is immediate and great; but indeed that was a sad country, to anybody but a patient Toland, who knows the causes of phenomena. No inns there, except of the naturally savage sort. [...] "A man is very happy if he finds clean straw to sleep on, without expecting sheets or coverings; let him readily dispense with plates, forks and napkins, if he can get anything to eat.... He must be content to have the cows, swine and poultry for his fellow-lodgers, and to go in at the same passage that the smoke comes out at, for there's no other vent for it but the door; which makes foreigners commonly say that the people of Westphalia enter their houses by the chimney." [...] And observe withal: [...] "This is the reason why their beef and hams are so finely prepared and ripened; for the fireplace being backwards, the smoke must spread over all the house before <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door; which makes everything within of a russet or sable color, not excepting the hands and faces of the meaner sort."
