5000|$|Some {{human rights}} {{scholars}} however consider the Charter's coverage of other {{civil and political}} rights to be inadequate. For example, the right to privacy or a right against <b>forced</b> <b>or</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> are not explicitly recognised. The provisions concerning fair trial and political participation are considered incomplete by international standards. However, this is subject to argument as for example Article 5 of the Charter states [...] "Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of this legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment shall be prohibited" [...] also, Article 15 states [...] "Every individual shall have the right to work under equitable and satisfactory conditions, and shall receive equal pay for equal work" [...] - which may be understood to prohibit <b>forced</b> <b>or</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour,</b> although this is not explicitly mentioned. Similarly, the Charter does not explicitly recognise the right to vote as a means of political participation, but Article 13 states [...] "(1) Every citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the government of his country, either directly or through freely chosen representatives in accordance with the provisions of the law. (2) Every citizen shall have the right to equal access to the public service of his country. (3) Every individual shall have the right of access to public property and services in strict equality of all persons before the law." ...|$|E

The Convention commits parties to prohibit the use of forced labour, admitting only five exceptions to it. Its object and purpose is to suppress the use of forced labour in all its forms irrespective {{of the nature of the}} work or the sector of activity in which it may be performed. The Convention defines forced labour as [...] "all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily".|$|E

(6) Similar to ILO C. 182, the TDA states that the work described in subparagraph (d) should be “determined by the laws, regulations, or competent authority of the country involved. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1998, the ILO International Labour Conference {{adopted the}} “Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work” {{defining}} certain rights as “fundamental.” The Declaration commits {{member states to}} respect and promote these main principles, {{referred to as the}} core conventions, which are grouped into the following four categories (total of eight ILO conventions): freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of <b>forced</b> <b>or</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour,</b> the abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The Declaration claims these rights to be universal, applying to all people in all States - regardless of level of economic development.

40|$|It is {{imperative}} that Sri Lanka grasps the concepts of green jobs to meet the most vital but intricate challenge of the 21 st Century, which is the transformation to a sustainable and a low-carbon economy. Such a transformation or a paradigm shift, which can be gradual or rapid depending on the circumstances, will undoubtedly have a considerable {{positive effect on the}} way we produce and/or consume goods and services. The speed at which this transformation would occur is likely to accelerate in the near future as there is a trend of global transition from a traditional to a low-carbon economy, in order to attain sustainable economies. Such trends will help create an array of different forms of green jobs across many sectors, and most probably can become a catalyst for further development. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has defined green jobs as “Jobs created when they help in reducing the negative environmental impacts ultimately leading to environmentally, economically and socially sustainable enterprises and economies”. Green jobs, in general, stand on two pillars: decent work and environmental sustainability. Thus, green jobs can be defined as decent work that contributes to environmental sustainability. In a broader sense decent work needs to address the core of international labour standards such as freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, elimination of all forms of <b>forced</b> <b>or</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour,</b> effective abolition of child labour, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, occupational health and safety, etc. whilst aligning to laws applicable to Sri Lanka. Environmental sustainability addresses issues such as effectively combating climate change, pollution prevention and control, conservation of eco-systems and biodiversity etc. (ILO, 2007) ...|$|E
