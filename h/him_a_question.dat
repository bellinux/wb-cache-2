500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory; event-based and time based. [...] Event-based prospective memory is when an environmental cue prompts you to carry out a task. [...] An example is when seeing a friend reminds you to ask <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember to carry out a task at a specific time. [...] An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday. [...] Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one to remember to carry out the task at that specific time.|$|E

60|$|She {{glanced at}} <b>him,</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> in her eyes, then looked away.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes asked <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> He stooped {{towards her}} {{and lowered his}} voice.|$|E
60|$|Hurt <b>him!</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question!</b> No, {{he should}} think not; better ask if that {{leap from the}} precipice hurt yourself.|$|R
60|$|He was a {{prisoner}} of the enemy, {{and what they were}} going to do with <b>him</b> was <b>a</b> <b>question</b> still to be answered.|$|R

6000|$|... "What d'you {{want for}} 'em?" [...] Good Lord! how he jumped {{if you asked}} <b>him</b> <b>a</b> plain <b>question.</b> The chap was as nervous as a guinea-fowl! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By St. Bavon thou'rt a funny child! Well? {{what is it}} now?" [...] he asked, for {{she stood}} hesitating before <b>him,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{obviously}} hovering on her lips.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a little}} the {{conductor}} passed along, and the Major stopped {{him and asked}} <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> in his habitually courteous way: ...|$|E

60|$|She nerved {{herself to}} ask <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> He looked so kind and good-natured {{that it did}} not seem {{possible}} that he would resent it.|$|E
6000|$|... "With great pleasure!" [...] {{answered}} the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely through his eye-glass--for {{it was the}} first time I had ventured to address <b>him</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>question.</b>|$|R

60|$|Proceeding up the road, {{they soon}} {{came to a}} little hamlet. On the {{outskirts}} of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools, and Tommy stopped <b>him</b> with <b>a</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|He hesitated {{and made}} a rush head down for the cellar that was his Manchester warehouse. Rodgers asked <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> that he pretended not to hear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{fight the}} King of England's bravoes?" [...] inquired Acour in a languid voice {{of those who}} stood about <b>him,</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> at which they laughed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] says Mr. Frank, quite peevish with me {{for asking}} <b>him</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> He was <b>an</b> easy young chap in money matters, and talked of {{hundreds}} as most men talk of sixpences.|$|R
