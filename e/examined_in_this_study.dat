25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E

40|$|How {{positive}} selection molds the T cell repertoire {{has been difficult}} to <b>examine.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> we use TCR-beta-transgenic mice in which MHC shapes TCR-alpha use. Differential AV segment use {{is directly related to the}} constraints placed on the composition of the CDR 3 loops. Where these constraints are low, efficient selection of alphabeta pairs follows. This mode of selection preferentially uses favored AV-AJ rearrangements and promotes diversity. Increased constraint on the alpha CDR 3 loops leads to inefficient selection associated with uncommon recombination events and limited diversity. Further, the two modes of selection favor alternate sets of AJ segments. We discuss the relevance of these findings to the imprint of self-MHC restriction and peripheral T cell activation...|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} in mathematic abilities often explored in research concerns gender disparities. There has been research examining gender {{difference in}} performance {{on standardized tests}} across various countries. Beller and Gafni's have shown that children at approximately nine years of age do not show consistent gender difference in relation to math skills. However, in 17 out of the 20 countries <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> 13-year-old boys tended to score higher than girls. Moreover, mathematics is often labeled as a masculine ability; as a result, girls often have low confidence in their math capabilities. These gender stereotypes can reinforce low confidence in girls and can cause math anxiety as {{research has shown that}} performance on standardized math tests is affected by one's confidence (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006). As a result, educators have been trying to abolish this stereotype by fostering confidence in math in all students in order to avoid math anxiety.|$|E

50|$|One study {{concluded}} that women whose epidural infusions contained fentanyl {{were less likely to}} fully breastfeed their infant in the few days after birth and more likely to stop breastfeeding in the first 24 weeks. However, this study has been criticized for several reasons, one of which is that the original patient records were not <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> and so many of the epidural infusions were assumed to contain fentanyl when almost certainly they would not have. In addition, all those who had received epidural infusions in this study had also received systemic pethidine, which would be {{much more likely to be}} the cause of any effect on breastfeeding due to the higher amounts of medication used via that route. If this were the case, then early epidural analgesia which avoided the need for pethidine would be expected to improve breastfeeding outcomes rather than worsen them. Traditional epidural for labor relieves pain reliably only during first stage of labor (uterine contractions until cervix is fully open). It does not relieve pain as reliably during the second stage of labor (passage of the fetus through the vagina).|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{study that}} researched salience {{and public opinion}} examined most of the agenda-setting research since the United States presidential election, 1968 which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to mass media’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main hypothesis <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the ranking of certain issues by the media, which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience {{of the federal budget}} deficit is significantly related [...] "to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc." [...] The result of this study concluded that [...] "even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 election, it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or dramatic as some of the other highly salient issues such as drug abuse or environmental pollution. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements." [...] In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.|$|E
