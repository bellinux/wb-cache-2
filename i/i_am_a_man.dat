He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> like other men, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> like you. I tell you I am just like you!" ...|$|E
500|$|Banquo's other {{appearance}} as a ghost during the banquet scene {{serves as an}} indicator of Macbeth's conscience returning to plague his thoughts. Banquo's triumph over death appears symbolically, insofar as he literally takes Macbeth's seat during the feast. Shocked, Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation, describing Banquo as [...] "crowned" [...] with wounds. The spirit drains Macbeth's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks; as soon as Banquo's form vanishes, Macbeth announces: [...] "Why, so; being gone, / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 November 2010, after {{once again}} {{being accused of}} {{involvement}} in juvenile prostitution, he suggested that an audience at the Milan trade fair should stop reading newspapers: [...] "Don't read newspapers any more because they deceive you. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who works hard all day long and if sometimes I look at some good-looking girl, it's better to be fond of pretty girls than to be gay". [...] The remarks were immediately condemned by Arcigay, Italy's main gay rights organisation.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1967 {{interview}} when a Canadian interviewer {{mentioned the}} Rastafari {{belief that he}} was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he responded by saying: [...] "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." [...] His grandson Ermias Sahle Selassie has said that there is [...] "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement". For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God. However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.|$|E
2500|$|A video {{accompanying}} the track [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] {{was released on}} 3 October 2012 to promote the album's release. The Weeknd previewed the album at a listening party in New York City on 24 October. It was his first major media event. According to music magazine NMEs website, in {{an open letter to}} his fans The Weeknd posted on his website in regards to the [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video, [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolising story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the accused}} mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of the Charles II. He testified that after refusing to {{participate}} in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered William May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head. Then I went to my Cabin, and presently came orders from Every, that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, 2016, David Feldman Promotions {{confirmed}} a {{fight between}} Jones and undefeated bare-knuckle fighter and former world title challenger Bobby Gunn would be announced for February 17, 2017 for the vacant WBF Cruiserweight championship {{at a press conference}} on December 6 at the Chase Center in Delaware. At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72-0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, [...] "I always do things that people don't expect me to do. I promised Bobby {{a long time ago that}} I would give him the opportunity, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again." [...] At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn in the beginning of the 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.|$|E
