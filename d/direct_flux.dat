40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> vector control {{strategy}} with {{no need for}} regulators tuning, suitable for permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machine drives. The controller operates in stator flux coordinates and calculates the inverter reference voltages in a model-based fashion, {{taking advantage of a}} novel equation for the explicit evaluation of the torque angle error. The inverter current and voltage limits are exploited in a parameter-independent way. The method segregates the machine parameters into a single block, to make it very easy to switch from one machine to another. Experimental results are reported for a PM-assisted synchronous reluctance motor drive example, characterized by significant saturation and cross-saturation.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the magnetic moment {{caused by the}} persistent currents in polygonal carbon nanotube tori by the tight binding model. The polygonal CNT tori are formed by introducing heptagonal and pentagonal defects along the inner hole and outer fringe, respectively. We found {{a new type of}} large paramagnetic persistent current caused by the semi-metallic band structures of the periodic CNT junction. It is contrasted with the persistent current originated from the metallic band structure. In spite of diamagnetism of the graphite, this paramagnetism is caused by not only the magnetic flux in the inner hole (AB flux) but also the magnetic flux directly penetrating the graphite plane (<b>direct</b> <b>flux).</b> This magnetic moment is close to that calculated with only Aharonov Bohm effect where the <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> is included in the AB flux.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new implementation of <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> and current vector control of an induction motor drive using {{the techniques of}} model predictive control. The advantages offered by predictive control are used to enhance the dynamics of <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> vector control. To minimize the problems of variable switching frequency inherent to finite control set predictive control, an alternative approach using pulse width modulation is studied for command execution as occurs in the so-called modulated model predictive control. A comparison between finite control set and modulated model predictive control is presented {{and the results are}} also compared with the control implementation through traditional proportional-integral regulators to highlight the advantages and drawbacks of predictive control based strategies. Apart from a greater harmonic content in stator currents, the predictive control can offers control dynamics comparable with proportional-integral control while maintaining immunity against machine parameter variations and excluding the need for controller tunin...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a loss-minimizing {{strategy}} is proposed for induction motor drives to ensure maximum efficiency operation {{for a given}} torque demand. The proposed strategy directly regulates the machine stator flux according to the desired torque, using an optimal stator flux reference. Therefore, the proposed {{strategy is}} suitable for motor control schemes {{that are based on}} <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> regulation, such as direct torque control or <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> vector control. The maximum efficiency per torque (MEPT) stator flux map is computed offline using the traditional no-load and short-circuit tests' data. An iron loss model based on the stator flux and frequency is also proposed for the calibration of the machine loss model and also for on-line monitoring of the iron losses during motor operation. The proposed MEPT strategy has been validated on a 2. 2 kW induction machine and the motor efficiency has been measured for different speed values and variable load conditions.

40|$|The study {{presents}} the <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> and current vector control of an induction motor (IM) drive, {{which is a}} relatively newer and promising control strategy, {{through the use of}} model predictive control (MPC) techniques. The results highlight that the fast flux control nature of <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> control strategy is further enhanced by MPC. Predictive control is applied in two of its variants, namely the finite control set and modulated MPC, and the advantages and limitations of the two are underlined. This work also highlights, through experimental results, the importance of prioritising the flux part of the cost function which is particularly significant {{in the case of an}} IM drive. The performance of the MPC-based approach is compared with the proportional-integral controller, which also prioritises the flux control loop, under various operating regions of the drive such as in the flux-weakening regime.

Spectra 1, 2, 3, represent particles {{moving down the}} field line into northern ionosphere and spectra 4, 5, 6 represent particles moving up field lines towards the magnetic equator. The former are <b>direct</b> <b>fluxes</b> and the latter are albedo fluxes. The spectra observed are remarkably similar to these observed in the auroral zone.

The perigee of ISIS crossed the magnetic equator at four local times (0400, 1000, 1600, 2100) during the lifetime of the particle spectrometer. No fluxes were observed at 0400 and 1000 local time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of molecular permeation of gases through nanoporous graphene membranes via molecular dynamics simulations; four different gases are investigated, namely helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and methane. We show {{that in addition to}} the direct (gas-kinetic) flux of molecules crossing from the bulk phase {{on one side of the}} graphene to the bulk phase on the other side, for gases that adsorb onto the graphene, significant contribution to the flux across the membrane comes from a surface mechanism by which molecules cross after being adsorbed onto the graphene surface. Our results quantify the relative contribution of the bulk and surface mechanisms and show that the <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> can be described reasonably accurately using kinetic theory, provided the latter is appropriately modified assuming steric molecule−pore interactions, with gas molecules behaving as hard spheres of known kinetic diameters. The surface flux is negligible for gases that do not adsorb onto graphene (e. g., He and H 2), while for gases that adsorb (e. g., CH 4 and N 2) it can be on the order of the <b>direct</b> <b>flux</b> or larger.

The design criteria pertinent to the construction of chemical instrumentation suitable for use in airborne eddy correlation flux measurements are discussed. A brief overview of the advantages and limitations of the current instrumentation used to obtain flux measurements for CO, CH 4, O 3, CO 2, and water vapor are given. The intended height of the measurement within the convective boundary layer is also shown to be an important design criteria. The sensitivity, or resolution, which is required in the measurement of a scalar species to obtain an adequate species flux measurement is discussed. The relationship between the species flux resolution and the more commonly stated instrumental resolution is developed and it is shown that the standard error of the flux estimate is a complicated function of the atmospheric variability and the averaging time that is used. The use of the recently proposed intermittent sampling method to determine the species flux is examined.
