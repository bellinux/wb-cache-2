5|$|An area {{in which}} the island {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence electricity networks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe.
