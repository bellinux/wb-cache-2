40|$|Closing yield gaps through higher {{fertilizer}} use increases direct {{greenhouse gas}} emissions but shares the burden over a larger production volume. Net greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints per unit product under agricultural intensification {{vary depending on the}} context, scale and accounting method. Life cycle analysis of footprints includes attributable emissions due to (i) land conversion ('fixed cost'); (ii) external inputs used ('variable cost'); (iii) crop production ('agronomic efficiency'); and (iv) postharvest transport and processing ('proportional' cost). The interplay between fixed and variable costs results in a nuanced opportunity for intermediate levels of intensification to minimize footprints. The fertilizer level that minimizes the footprint may differ from the economic optimum. The optimization problem can be solved algebraically for quadratic crop fertilizer response equations. We applied this theory to data of palm oil production and fertilizer use from 23 plantations across the Indonesian production range. The current EU threshold requiring at least 35 % emission saving for biofuel use can never be achieved by palm oil if produced: (i) on peat soils, or (ii) on mineral soils where the C debt due to conversion is larger than 20 Mg C ha - 1, if the footprint is calculated using an emission ratio of N 2 O-N/N fertilizer of 4 %. At current fertilizer price levels in Indonesia, the economically optimized N fertilizer rate is 344 - 394 kg N ha - 1, while the reported mean N fertilizer rate is 141 kg N ha - 1 yr - 1 and rates of 74 - 277 kg N ha - 1 would minimize footprints, for a N 2 O-N/N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4 - 1 %, respectively. At a C debt of 30 Mg C ha - 1, these values are 200 - 310 kg N ha - 1. Sustainable weighting of ecology and economics would require a higher fertilizer/yield price ratio, depending on C debt. Increasing production by higher fertilizer use from current 67 % to 80 % of attainable yields would not decrease footprints in current production conditions. </p...|$|E

The results of our research proved that the method, applied can be efficiently used to analyse the environmental responses, the behaviour under varying environmental conditions of different varieties. Varieties can adapt themselves differently to favourable and unfavourable environmental conditions. In general, varieties (e. g. older varieties, like Mv 15, Mv 20, and new varieties, like Lupus, Mv Emese) that give relatively good yields under unfavourable conditions (2 – 3 t ha − 1 environmental average) will utilise improving environmental conditions (7 – 8 t ha − 1 environmental average) to a lesser extent and vice versa. Varieties Mv 21, GK Öthalom and Mv Palotás (a currently cultivated variety) made good use of intensive growing conditions. The data in this paper may assist in choosing varieties best suited to the production and cultivation conditions of the production site. By applying stability analyses we proved that the stability of the control treatment was the most favourable over the investigation period, which good yield stability, however, manifested at very low yield levels. Our findings showed that under more intensive environmental conditions (7 – 9 t ha − 1 yield level) appropriate and optimum fertilizer application was very effective and in comparison to the control treatment the yield differences between optimal fertilizer treatments were up to as much as 1 – 6 t ha − 1. Under favourable environmental conditions the highest yields were obtained when a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>ratio</b> of N 120 +PK was applied. Under unfavourable conditions (these may be either or both ecological and cultivation conditions), however, only retrained, moderate fertilizer doses are recommended.

The problem of nitrate (V) accumulation in vegetable plants {{is very important to}} a potential consumer, due to the reported negative impact of nitrates on human health. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the nitrate contents in edible parts of 2 varieties of carrot, before clamping and after uncovering, in fresh carrot and dry matter. Achievement of a rational system of supplementary fertilization requires setting of the most appropriate combination of <b>fertilizers,</b> the <b>ratio</b> between these epochs and the doses of administration and knowledge of how each variety or hybrid reacts to the fertilizers used. Also, if organic carrots are used then the organic fertilizer has natural nitrates unlike the chemical fertilizer which can create a higher concentration of nitrates. The mode of fertilization and its influence on the content in nitrates shows that organic fertilization leads to accumulation of smaller quantities of nitrates in carrot roots. Organic fertilization results in a reduction in the nitrates from roots with 1. 89 mg/ 100 g, respectively 1. 91 mg/ 100 g in 2010, and for the year 2011 of 2. 47 mg/ 100 g and 2. 68 mg/ 100 g, as compared with the chemical fertilization...|$|R

Different organic materials were applied as amendments to soil for tomato production under soil residual moisture condition. In addition, roselle and cotton were cultivated using tied ridge moisture conservation technique and different nutrient sources in a savanna Alfisols at Samaru, Nigeria. The use of organic amendments produced similar fruit yield with those tomato receiving mineral fertilizer amendment. Organic amendments produced tomato fruit with 70 to 80 % marketable yield while, 84 % of the fruit yield were marketable under mineral fertilizer application. Net income from sales of tomato under organic amendments showed that they could produce comparative profit margin with those produced from mineral fertilizers. Trace and heavy metal accumulation in tomato leaves were generally within the critical concentrations of those elements in plants.

This research aimed at studying the possibility for reusing paper industry wastes as additives in phytoremediation of heavy metals polluted substrates of the spoil banks in the Kremikovtsi region. Greenhouse remediation experiments of heavy metals polluted substrates, collected from the spoil banks located in the vicinity of the metallurgical plant “Kremikovtsi”, have been performed. Phytoremediation was performed by planting 2 - years-old seedling of the red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) trees.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} Alfisols in South-West France to assess the agronomic and environmental impacts of a single application of heat-dried sludge pellets at 11. 1 Mg dry matter ha- 1. The sludge pellets, with a moisture level of 9. 5 %, were spread on an irrigated crop of maize (Zea mays L.). This treatment was compared with inorganic fertilization (urea and diammonium phosphate mixed with KCl). Soil properties, yield and the composition of maize {{and the quality of}} drained water were monitored over 1 year to detect any changes resulting from sludge application. Amongst several determined soil properties, only two were significantly modified by the sludge application: The nitric nitrogen stock of the soil was higher in the inorganic fertilized plot, whereas Olsen-P soil content was higher in the sludge-amended plot. Agronomic recovery rates of N and P added by sludge were high: For the first crop following application, total amounts of N and P supplied by the sludge had the same efficiency as approximately 45 % of the N and P amounts supplied by inorganic <b>fertilizer.</b> This <b>ratio</b> was 7 % for the N uptake by the second maize crop. The quality and quantity of maize were equally good with both types of fertilization. During the 2 years following sludge spreading, N leaching remained as low in the sludged plot as in the inorganically fertilized one. The Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd, Pb and Ni composition of the drainage water was affected by neither of the types of amendment. From the heavy-metal contents of the soil, water and maize monitored over 1 year in the {{field experiment}} and from literature data for cow manure and atmospheric emissions, a theoretical balance between crop soil heavy-metal input and output over one century was drawn up. The long-term impact of cow manure on Zn, Ni and Cr in soil is higher than that of the studied heat-dried sludge. Obviously, sludge tended to cause a strong increase in soil Cu storage, valued for these soils, which are otherwise very Cu deficient...|$|R
40|$|In {{a one-year}} field study (June 1998 to April 1999), we {{quantified}} N 2 O and NOx emissions from an extensively managed grassland in NE Bavaria (Germany) in unfertilized controls and after application of slurry or mineral N (calcium ammonium nitrate), respectively. Emissions were measured every 2 – 4 weeks, with additional daily measurements for 10 days after each fertilizer application. The closed chamber method {{was used for}} N 2 O and the open chamber method for NOx measurements. Fertilizer applications resulted in significantly increased N 2 O emission rates {{in comparison to the}} low annual mean of the control plots (1. 4 mol m– 2 h– 1). Episodical emission peaks during the summer were attributed to high microbial activity after rainfall. Mineral N fertilization resulted in the highest emission rates. Cumulative annual N 2 O emissions were 11. 2 kg N ha– 1 a– 1 for the mineral N, 8. 8 kg N ha– 1 a– 1 for the slurry and 3. 4 kg N ha– 1 a– 1 for the control plots. This represents 10. 5 % (mineral N) and 7. 2 % (slurry) of the applied nitrogen. The fertilizer-induced N 2 O emission factors on this extensively managed grassland are high in comparison to emission factors on intensively managed grassland and substantially higher than the 1. 5 % estimate used by the global emission inventory. NOx emissions increased after the first fertilizer application in summer, but not after the two following fertilizations in fall and spring. Differences between treatments were not significant. Annual NOx emissions were 1. 9 kg N ha– 1 a– 1 for both, mineral N and slurry plots and 1. 5 kg N ha– 1 a– 1 for the controls, representing 0. 5 % of the N applied with each <b>fertilizer.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of emitted NOx to N 2 O was 1 : 4. 7 for both fertilized treatments (based on N-atoms...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{irrigation}} water becomes scarce {{in the whole}} world. It is more desirable to get plenty of benefit from already present reservoirs. Method of fertilizer application to crop, especially to ornamental plant is a key issue to get the optimum potential of the crop. Different fertilizer incorporation methods have its own drawback and advantages. Therefore, under these circumstances, {{the present study was}} conducted to find out influences of different fertigation level with application of compound fertilizer on vegetative growth, flowering characteristic and chemical constituent of two rose hybrids Amelia and Anjleeq. An experiment was conducted at experimental Landscaping and Ornamental research substation, Multan during year 2011. Fertigation treatment was applied 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ml to treatment, but not to control treatment. Compound <b>fertilizer</b> having a <b>ratio</b> (17 : 17 : 17) was applied at rate 2 gL- 1 to all treatment. Our experimental result shows that all of different fertigation level influences rose production, flowering and chemical constituent. Maximum rose production, flowering and chemical constituent occurred due to 400 ml fertigation treatment followed by 300 ml. Therefore, it is proved from our experiment that fertigation technique with different level has potential to enhance and significantly affected all parameters of two rose hybrids Amelia and Anjleeq...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of hydrological {{and water quality}} models is an efficient approach {{to better understand the}} processes of environmental deterioration. This study evaluated the ability of the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) model to predict runoff, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loading in a typical small watershed of a hilly region near Taihu Lake, China. Runoff was calibrated and validated at both an annual and monthly scale, and parameter sensitivity analysis was performed for TN and TP before the two water quality components were calibrated. The results showed that the model satisfactorily simulated runoff at annual and monthly scales, both during calibration and validation processes. Additionally, results of parameter sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters Fertilizer rate, Fertilizer organic, Canopy cover and Fertilizer inorganic were more sensitive to TN output. In terms of TP, the parameters Residue mass <b>ratio,</b> <b>Fertilizer</b> rate, Fertilizer inorganic and Canopy cover were the most sensitive. Based on these sensitive parameters, calibration was performed. TN loading produced satisfactory results for both the calibration and validation processes, whereas the performance of TP loading was slightly poor. The simulation results showed that AnnAGNPS {{has the potential to be}} used as a valuable tool for the planning and management of watersheds...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} aims at the {{selection}} of an appropriate draw solute for forward osmosis process. Separation and recovery of the draw solute are the major criteria for {{the selection of}} draw solute for forward osmosis process. Therefore in this investigation six inorganic fertilizers draws solute were selected. The selections of inorganic fertilizers as draw solute eliminate the need of removal and recovery of draw solute from the final product. The final product water of forward osmosis process has direct application in agricultural as nutrient rich water for irrigation. These inorganic fertilizers were tested based on their water extraction (water flux) capacity. This experimental water flux was compared with the observed water flux. It was noted that the observed water flux {{is much higher than}} the attained experimental water flux. The difference of these two fluxes was used to calculate the performance ratio of each selected <b>fertilizer.</b> Highest performance <b>ratio</b> was shown by low molecular weight compound ammonium nitrate (22. 73) and potassium chloride (21. 03) at 1 M concentration, whereas diammonium phosphate (DAP) which has highest molecular weight among all the selected fertilizer show the lowest performance ratio (10. 02) at 2 M concentration.

40|$|In Japan, {{zucchini}} {{culture has}} yet to get underway, and the current costs of zucchini {{can be attributed to}} damage from soil-borne disease and the unstable yields due to seasonal change of female flowers. Eradication of these problems will lead to stable supply and a consequent price reduction of zucchini fruits. We previously clarified the efficacy of potted culture as a new culture method for zucchini, but potted culture can be burdensome as the weak water and nutrient retention capacity of the medium warrants its regular replacement. To solve this problem, in this study, we investigated the blend ratio for mixing rice husk charcoal with peat and the amount of fertilizer required for potted culture of zucchini. Results revealed no significant differences in the length of the largest leaf, total number of flowers, number of female flowers, and the ratio of female flowers to total flowers with different blend ratios of rice husk charcoal to peat. However, the number of harvested fruits increased with higher ratios of rice husk charcoal to peat and was highest at 80 : 20. The length of the largest leaf increased with increased amounts of fertilizer, with the best response was at 200 g. No significant differences were noted between the ratio of female flowers to total flowers in any treatments. In addition, the number of harvested fruits was highest with 160 g and 200 g of fertilizer. Taken together, the optimal blend ratio of rice husk charcoal to peat is 80 : 20, and the optimal amount of <b>fertilizer</b> with this <b>ratio</b> is 160 g...|$|R
40|$|While {{slow release}} of {{chemicals}} {{has been widely}} applied for drug delivery, little {{work has been done}} on using this general nanotechnology-based principle for delivering nutrients to crops. In developing countries, the cost of fertilizers can be significant and is often the limiting factor for food supply. Thus, it is important to develop technologies that minimize the cost of fertilizers through efficient and targeted delivery. Urea is a rich source of nitrogen and therefore a commonly used fertilizer. We focus our work on the synthesis of environmentally benign nanoparticles carrying urea as the crop nutrient that can be released in a programmed manner for use as a nanofertilizer. In this study, the high solubility of urea molecules has been reduced by incorporating it into a matrix of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles have been selected due to their excellent biocompatibility while acting as a rich phosphorus source. In addition, the high surface area offered by nanoparticles allows binding of a large amount of urea molecules. The method reported here is simple and scalable, allowing the synthesis of a urea-modified hydroxyapatite nanohybrid as <b>fertilizer</b> having a <b>ratio</b> of urea to hydroxyapatite of 6 : 1 by weight. Specifically, a nanohybrid suspension was synthesized by in situ coating of hydroxyapatite with urea at the nanoscale. In addition to the stabilization imparted due to the high surface area to volume ratio of the nanoparticles, supplementary stabilization leading to high loading of urea was provided by flash drying the suspension to obtain a solid nanohybrid. This nanohybrid with a nitrogen weight of 40...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the yellow}} earths in the Western Australian wheatbelt have {{naturally}} acidic subsoils which can reduce the yield of wheat grown on them. Current methods of assessing soil acidity cannot identify which soils have subsoil acidity severe enough to restrict wheat yields. We conducted 53 field experiments at 34 sites in 5 regions over 3 years to determine the relationship between yield of wheat and several different indices for identifying subsoils with toxic concentrations of aluminium, Al. Initially, we identified that the concentration of aluminium, [Al], in the soil solution and in 1 : 5 0. 005 M KCl extracts of soil from the 15 - 25 cm layer {{was responsible for the}} majority of the decrease in wheat yield. The concentration of Al in a 1 : 5 0. 005 M KCl extract in the 15 - 25 cm layer was well correlated with grain yield of wheat grown on yellow earth soils in the Merredin region, provided the soils had similar <b>fertilizer</b> treatments. The <b>ratio</b> [Al]:[Na] in a 1 : 5 0. 005 M KCl extract was a better predictor than [Al} alone of grain yield of wheat grown on yellow earths in different regions and with different fertilizer practices. The three seasons had little effect on the correlation between yield and different soil indices. The correlations determined were strongly affected by regional differences, which were probably due to differing water supply and availability. The choice of toxicity index depended on the uniformity of fertilizer management practices within a region and it appeared that both ionic strength and calcium were important mitigating factors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} potential {{methods to}} estimate the nitrogen fertilization value of {{a broad spectrum of}} different organic fertilizers. Ryegrass pot experi-ments were used to determine the nitrogen fertilization effect of 15 different fertilizers. These included different kinds of manure, different powders made from offal, rapeseed cake, lucerne pellets, sewage sludge, biogas residue, vi-nasse and mussel compost. Incubation studies showed that previously degraded materials such as manure, compost and biogas residue had low net nitrogen mineralization after addition to soil, whereas net mineralization was high from undegraded materials such as pelleted plant or meat products. The short-term nitrogen fertilizer value of degraded materials was therefore rather well characterized by their ammonium content, whereas the undegraded fertilizer materials required a different method. Warm water-extractable nitrogen proved to be unsatisfactory as a method for extracting readily mineralizable nitrogen, especially from animal products. Amino acid nitrogen and crude fibre analysis were also unsatisfactory for describing readily degradable or more persistent organic material. However, the carbon/nitrogen ratio very accurately reflected the short-term plant-available nitrogen content. Measurements of near infrared reflectance (NIR) proved to have {{the potential to be a}} quick and cheap method {{to estimate the}} fertilizer value of the nitrogen in fertilizers. However, developing a satisfactory model for NIR measurements would require more extensive material than the 15 fertilizers examined here. Nevertheless, it should be possible to use the carbon/nitrogen ratio already, through its negative linear relationship with the proportion of total fertilizer nitrogen with short-term <b>fertilizer</b> effect. A <b>ratio</b> of around two indicates that approximately 80 % of the nitrogen is as available as mineral fertilizer nitrogen, while a ratio above 15 means that scarcely any short-term nitrogen fertilization effect will be obtained from that fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{intensification}} of agriculture {{is needed to}} meet higher future food demands while mitigating agriculture’s ecological footprint. Intercropping is a strategy for increasing agricultural productivity per unit land {{that is based on}} ecological mechanisms for improved resource capture. No quantitative synthesis has been made on the effect of intercrop system properties and species trait combinations on intercrop productivity. Here we use meta-analysis of the intercropping literature to study how the productivity of mixed systems is affected by intercrop system design and species traits. We focus on the effects of temporal niche differentiation between species, intercropping pattern, relative densities, the use of C 3 and C 4 species and the rate of nitrogen <b>fertilizer.</b> Land equivalent <b>ratio</b> (LER) is used as index for assessing the relative productivity of a mixed system as compared to sole crops. Average LER was 1. 22 ± 0. 02, and no differences in LER were found between the 50 most highly cited studies and a random sample from the literature, indicating that high LERs in highly cited papers are representative of the entire literature. Temporal niche differentiation contributed substantially to high LER in systems combining a C 3 and C 4 species, but not in systems based on C 3 species mixtures. The amount of N fertilizer interacted positively with the effect of temporal niche differentiation on LER. The intercropping literature is dominated by studies on cereal/legume mixtures. However, the few studies on C 3 cereal/C 4 cereal mixtures indicate these mixtures have high LER. Substantial improvements in land use efficiency in agriculture may be obtained by using mixtures, particularly C 3 /C 4 mixtures. Thus, enhanced within-field crop diversity can make an important contribution to sustainable increases in food production...|$|R
