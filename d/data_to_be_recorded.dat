Software typically moves the <b>data</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> into a buffer; underrun occurs if the recorder processes data in the buffer faster than the software reloads it. Historically, {{buffer underrun}} was often caused by writing data obtained from a slow device, or by slowness of the recording software, from a slow processor or a processor executing other tasks concurrently.|$|E

Presently this communication system extracts the digital and non-digital information from printers, scanners, and touch screens and from the image processing techniques which will be fed into the different pattern recognition algorithms. The digital data communication is easier rather than non-digital data communication like hand written symbols due to the variation of styles, size and shapes of the handwritten symbols from person to person so we have to compress the image which helps to reduce the storage space and the transmission cost.
