We used intergenic spacer (IGS) region polymorphism of ribosomal DNA, <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> patterns, and vegetative compatibility and pathogenicity analyses to assess the genetic diversity within Fusarium oxysporum isolates recovered from common bean plants growing in fields around El Barco de Avila. Ninety-six vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) were found among 128 isolates analyzed; most of these VCGs contained only a single isolate. The strains belonging to pathogenic VCGs and the most abundant nonpathogenic VCGs were further examined for polymorphisms in the IGS region and <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> patterns. Isolates belonging to the same VCG exhibited the same IGS haplotype and very similar <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> patterns. These {{findings are consistent with}} the hypothesis that VCGs represent clonal lineages that rarely, if ever, reproduce sexually. The F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli strains recovered had the same IGS haplotype and similar <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> patterns, different from those found for F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli from the Americas, and were assigned to three new VCGs (VCGs 0166, 0167, and 0168). Based on our results, we do not consider the strains belonging to F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli to be a monophyletic group within F. oxysporum, as there is no correlation between pathogenicity and VCG, IGS restriction fragment length polymorphism, or <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype...</b>|$|E

40|$|The electrophoretic karyotypes of 32 {{clinical}} and 3 environmental Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from New York City were studied by contour clamped homogeneous electrophoresis. There was extensive variation among the electrophoretic karyotypes of isolates from different patients. Sequential C. neoformans isolates from {{patients with chronic}} or relapsing infection had very similar karyotypes. However, minor differences in electrophoretic karyotypes were detected among sequential isolates from 50 % of the patients studied, suggesting the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements or deletions in vivo. This hypothesis was tested by infecting mice, recovering isolates from mouse organs, and comparing the electrophoretic karyotypes before and after passage. Three {{clinical and}} three environmental strains were studied before and after passage in mice. Karyotype differences were detected after mouse passage for one clinical and two environmental strains. Our results indicate (i) extensive karyotype variation among isolates from a small geographic regions, (ii) a high frequency of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> differences among sequential isolates from individual patients, and (iii) the occurrence of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> changes during experimental infection of mice.

40|$|Seven {{isolates}} of Candida stellatoidea {{were studied}} for their <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype,</b> virulence for mice, sensitivity to UV radiation, growth rate in vitro, reaction on cycloheximide-indicator medium, and proteinase activity. The isolates exhibited {{one of two}} distinct electrophoretic karyotypes as determined by orthogonal field alternating gel electrophoresis (OFAGE). Four isolates, including the type culture of C. stellatoidea, belonged to <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> type I by OFAGE, showing eight to nine bands of which at least two bands were less than 1, 000 kilobases in size as estimated by comparison with the DNA bands of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These isolates failed to produce fatal infection in mice within 20 days when 5 X 10 (5) cells were injected intravenously. The yeasts were cleared from the kidneys of two of three mice tested by day 30. Type I showed proteinase activity on bovine serum albumin agar at pH 3. 8 and produced a negative reaction on cycloheximide-bromcresol green medium within 48 h. The three grouped in type II by OFAGE showed banding patterns {{similar to those of}} a well-characterized isolate of Candida albicans. The isolates of type II had an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> of six to seven bands approximately 1, 200 kilobases or greater in size. All three type II isolates were highly virulent for mice, producing fatality curves similar to those of a previously studied C. albicans isolate. From 80 to 90 % of the mice injected with 5 X 10 (5) cells intravenously died within 20 days. The type II isolates produced a positive reaction on cycloheximide-bromcresol green agar and showed no proteinase activity on bovine serum albumin agar at the low pH. In addition, the type II isolates grew faster and were significantly more resistant to UV irradiation than the type I isolates. These results indicated that type II, but not type I, isolates can be considered simply as sucrose-negative C. albicans...|$|E
40|$|Candida yeasts are {{occasionally}} {{recovered from}} patients with leukemia {{in spite of}} antifungal therapy used during chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether yeasts in these patients are of endogenous or exogenous origin. We examined the strain relatedness of Candida albicans isolated from three patients with leukemia (A, B, and C) and their bedside parents using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) by SmaI digestion, and the Southern hybridization patterns of the RFLPs by the C. albicans-specific probe RPS 1. SmaI digestion and Southern hybridization by RPS 1 showed identical or similar patterns among Candida isolates in patients A and his mother, although their karyotypes were different. Isolates from patients B and both parents showed identical <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes,</b> SmaI digestion patterns, and hybridization patterns. Since <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes</b> are more variable than RFLPs and their hybridization patterns, the identity of the last two suggests a close relatedness between strains. Our results also suggest that transmission of yeast strains may have occurred between patient A and his mother and between patient B and her parents.

40|$|Isolates of {{the soil}} borne {{basidiomycete}} Rhizoctonia solani vary in cultural appearance, in growth characteristics and in pathogenicity towards plants. Isolates of R. solani {{can be divided into}} anastomosis groups (AGs) and this division accommodates part of the observed diversity. However, a clear link between AGs and relevant phytopathological characters is missing and a well-described genetic basis for AGs is lacking. To provide genetic information, we examined polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal RNA genes and determined the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> by means of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). ITS polymorphism confirmed the genetic isolation of AGs and indicated that genetically isolated subgroups exist within AGs. PFGE showed that R. solani isolates have at least 11 chromosomes ranging in size from 0. 6 to 6 Mb. The R. solani genome size is estimated to be between 37 and 46 Mb. The karyotype of R. solani is highly variable and although the observed heterogeneity in karyotype within an AG is smaller than between AGs, karyotype and AG are not obviously correlated. Rather it can be concluded that the variation in <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> is reflected in the phenotypical variation of R. solani, with generally less diversity within an AG than between AGs...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the karyotype of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, by using pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis. We tested whether the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> of an isolate {{was related to}} its pathotype, as determined by infection assays, or its genetic lineage, as determined by DNA fingerprinting. Highly reproducible electrophoretic karyotypes were obtained for a collection of U. S. and Chinese isolates representing a diverse collection of pathotypes and genetic lineages. Chromosomes ranged in size from 3 to 10 Mb. Although chromosome number was largely invariant, chromosome length polymorphisms were frequent. Minichromosomes were also found, although their presence was not ubiquitous. They ranged in number from 1 to 3 and in size from 470 kb to 2. 2 Mb. Karyotypes were sufficiently variable as to obscure the obvious relatedness of isolates {{on the basis of}} pathogenicity assays or genetic lineage analysis by DNA fingerprinting. We documented that the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> of an isolate can change after prolonged serial transfer in culture and that this change did not alter the isolate's pathotype. The mechanisms bringing about karyotype variability involve deletions, translocations, and more complex rearrangements. We conclude that karyotypic variability in the rice blast fungus {{is a reflection of the}} lack of sexuality in wild populations which leads to the maintenance of neutral genomic rearrangements in clones of the fungus...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} candidal {{colonisation}} was studied {{in a group}} of terminally ill patients receiving antifungal treatment for oral candidosis. A total of 43 isolates of C. albicans was collected pre- and post-antifungal treatment from patients up to a maximum period of 4 weeks. Isolates were analysed by <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotyping</b> (EK) and by inter-repeat polymerase chain reaction (IR-PCR). Fifteen <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes</b> and 17 IR-PCR profiles were identified. Sequential isolates from 10 patients yielded identical profiles in both EKs and IR-PCR analyses. In the case of four patients, minor differences in the profiles were obtained by either EK or IR-PCR. The findings suggest that antifungal treatment in this patient group fails to eradicate the original C. albicans strain, thereby allowing recolonisation of the oral cavity. The present study has also shown that either EK or IR-PCR is a useful typing approach in such epidemiological investigations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Inbreeding of the avirulent {{physiologic}} race 8 {{strains of}} Ustilago hordei was purported to have increased its pathogenicity in a stepwise manner {{that led to}} a highly pathogenic race, designated race 14. The analysis of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes</b> and restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles detected with a telomere-specific probe (TelomereRFLP) in races 8 and 14, and progeny obtained by selfing race 8 strains, revealed substantially changed patterns in the purported progeny of the second generation of selfing, and the race 14 strain. The telomereRFLP patterns in strains purported to be the progeny of the second generation of inbreeding of race 8, were unlike both race 8 and race 14 strains, and identical to those of U. hordei physiologic races 10 and 13. These data suggest that the progeny believed to have been derived from the second selfing of race 8 strains were clonal lineages from either race 10 or race 13 strains, rather than the products of meiosis of race 8 teliospores. The <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes</b> resolved from race 8 and 14, revealed chromosome-length polymorphisms (CLPs) that were similar in magnitude to those reported among strains of the fourteen physiologic races of U. hordei, rejecting the postulate that race 14 is a lineage derivative from race 8. <b>Electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotyping</b> and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis of eight Ustilago species revealed that the four sporidium-forming species, U. avenae, U. hordei, U. kolleri, and U. nigra, form a coherent group.

The <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> of the seven chromosomes comprising the 42. 9 -Mb N. crassa genome was resolved using two translocation strains. Using gel-purified chromosomal DNAs as probes against the new cosmid library and the commonly used medium-copy-number pMOcosX N. crassa cosmid library in two independent screenings, the cosmids were assigned to chromosomes. Assignments of cosmids to linkage groups {{on the basis of}} the genetic map vs. the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> are 93 +/- 3 % concordant.

By hybridizing 79 nonoverlapping cosmids with an average insert size of 34 kbp against cDNA arrays, the density of previously characterized expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was found to be slightly < 1 per cosmid (i. e., 1 per 40 kbp), and most cosmids, on average, contained an identified N. crassa gene sequence as a starting point for gene identification...|$|E

40|$|The {{endonuclease}} restriction pattern (DNA fingerprinting) and the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> of 16 Candida parapsilosis isolates {{from environmental}} and clinical sources were investigated. DNA from both whole cells and separated mitochondria was digested with enzymes, including EcoRI, BamHI, KpnI, BglII, HpaII, PvuII, and HindIII. Regardless of their source and pathogenic properties, all isolates showed a uniform, reproducible, and overlapping whole-cell DNA fingerprinting with each endonuclease digest.

In contrast, the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotype</b> generated by rotating field gel electrophoresis (RFGE) or contour clamped homogeneous field electrophoresis (CHEF) showed a remarkable polymorphism among the isolates. This polymorphism concerned the smaller molecular size section of the karyotype (range, 1. 8 to 0. 7 Mb), where at least two to five chromosomal bands could be consistently detected by both RFGE and CHEF. Larger (greater {{than or equal to}} 3. 0 to 1. 9 Mb) chromosome-sized DNA bands (four in CHEF and three in RFGE) were quite distinct and common to all isolates. Thus, seven karyotype classes could be defined, on the basis of both the number and size of putative chromosomes. The three categories of isolates (soil, vaginal, and hematological) were not randomly distributed among the seven classes. In particular, the four hematological isolates had a karyotype pattern which was clearly distinct from that shown by the three environmental isolates, and of the nine vaginal isolates only one shared a class with isolates from another source (soil). Although tentative, the classification was totally consistent with the independent and reproducible results obtained by the two pulse-field electrophoretic techniques employed.

The differences of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes</b> observed among clinical isolates resembled the changes found among different kinds of spontaneous morphological mutants. These findings contribute to the understanding of natural karyotypic variability and are in agreement with the hypothesis that chromosomal alterations observed spontaneously under laboratory conditions provide this amictic species with genetic variability in nature...|$|R
40|$|Isolates {{representing}} {{two types}} (A and B) of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which cause different anthracnose disease on the tropical pasture legumes Stylosanthes spp. in Australia, {{were found to}} have distinct <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>karyotypes.</b> Type A isolates had five large maxi-chromosomes (2 - 6 Mb) and eight to ten smaller mini-chromosomes (270 - 600 kb), while Type B isolates had three maxi chromosomes (4. 7 -> 6 Mb) and three to five mini-chromosomes (330 - 1200 kb). Extensive chromosomal polymorphisms for both length and number were observed in the mini-chromosomes amongst isolates within both types. Results indicate that chromosomal rearrangements may have a role in generating variation in this pathogen...|$|R
