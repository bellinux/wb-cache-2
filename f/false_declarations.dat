2500|$|In {{that same}} month, Sócrates' licenciatura degree in civil {{engineering}} by Universidade Independente was put under enormous public scrutiny. Journalists found that qualifications awarded {{did not follow}} procedure and that {{four of the five}} academic disciplines were given in the private university by the same professor, António José Moraes, a socialist government appointee. A fifth academic discipline, [...] "technical English" [...] was given by the Independente's rector. A strong case was built up related to possible <b>false</b> <b>declarations</b> by José Sócrates regarding his university degree, and the way he was awarded this degree in civil engineering. Among other issues, the Independente degree in civil engineering was not an accredited degree, a civil engineering department was not yet established at that university, one examination was sent by fax and Sócrates' diploma was issued on a Sunday, a day on which the university was always closed.|$|E
