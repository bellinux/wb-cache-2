5|$|Although he had stated an {{interest}} in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa's parents persuaded him {{to take up the}} piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right hands were equally strong.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he never}} won the Serie A top goalscorer title, Baggio is {{currently}} the seventh all-time highest scorer in Serie A, with 205 goals in 452 appearances. Of these goals, 96 were decisive (either equalisers or match winners). Alongside Totti, Baggio has also scored the fourth-highest number of free-kicks in Serie A with 21 goals; ahead of him are only Alessando Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. Of his open play goals in Serie A, 84 were with his right foot, 26 with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> 6 were headers. he also assisted 118 goals in Serie A. He is the fourth-highest scoring Italian in all competitions, behind Del Piero, Giueseppe Meazza and Silvio Piola, with 318 goals. Alongside Totti and Alberto Gilardino, he has scored against the most different clubs in Serie A, with 38.|$|E

5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in <b>his</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E

25|$|The double-arch is delimited {{externally}} by {{columns and}} rectangular frames, {{and decorated with}} phytomorphic motifs.

Then an underwater explosion rocked Tatum severely but caused no damage.|$|E

25|$|Because Ney's {{front was}} {{screened}} by forests, Bennigsen had a reasonable {{hope that he}} could fall on the Frenchman's troops before his opponent could take effective countermeasures. In the event, French scouts picked up enough information for Ney to order a concentration between Guttstadt and Deppen. He also {{sent a message to}} Soult asking him to hold Elditten on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> another to Davout requesting him to defend Bergfried on his right.|$|E
25|$|Even {{traditional}} {{depictions of}} Orion have varied greatly. Cicero drew Orion {{in a similar}} fashion to the modern depiction. The Hunter held an unidentified animal skin aloft in his right hand; his hand was represented by Omicron2 Orionis and the skin was represented by the 5 stars designated Pi Orionis. Kappa and Beta Orionis represented <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right knees, while Eta and Lambda Leporis were <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right feet, respectively. As in the modern depiction, Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta represented his belt. His left shoulder was represented by Alpha Orionis, and Mu Orionis made up his left arm. Lambda Orionis was his head and Gamma, his right shoulder. The depiction of Hyginus was similar to that of Cicero, though the two differed in a few important areas. Cicero's animal skin became Hyginus's shield (Omicron and Pi Orionis), and instead of an arm marked out by Mu Orionis, he holds a club (Chi Orionis). His right leg is represented by Theta Orionis and his left leg is represented by Lambda, Mu, and Epsilon Leporis. Further Western European and Arabic depictions have followed these two models.|$|E

25|$|Following his {{assassination}} on September 18, 96 {{however, the}} Senate passed damnatio memoriae on Domitian's memoryhis name was erased from all public records and his statues and arches were destroyed. Some of his statues were resculpted {{to depict the}} new emperor Nerva, among which was Frieze A of the Cancelleria Reliefs. Nerva's head is markedly out of proportion with his body. His right eye is smaller than <b>his</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> his neck is too long, clearly suggesting the head was carved out of an earlier model for Domitian.|$|E
25|$|Worried {{about the}} {{persistent}} French attacks along the Sambre, the Coalition high command shifted their {{weight to the}} east to cover Charleroi, taking troops from the Duke of York's force at Tournai. Encouraged by his enemies' weakness, Pichegru invested Ypres on 1 June 1794. Moreau's division was employed in the siege operations. Souham covered the siege with Michaud's division on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> Despeaux's division on his right. Instead of concentrating their forces to crush one of the French wings, the Coalition forces shifted back and forth ineffectively. Meanwhile, the Duke of York was left uselessly guarding Tournai with 30,000 Austrians.|$|E
25|$|Thielmann {{intended}} {{that the}} 9th Brigade should be posted {{in rear of}} this general disposition of his troops, so that its services might be made available according as circumstances might require; but through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the order, General Borcke was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road until near La Bawette, thence to turn off to <b>his</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> continue his march, according to his original instructions {{in the direction of}} Fromont, Bourgeois, and Saint-Lambert, towards Couture-Saint-Germain; being under the impression that the whole corps had already commenced this march, in pursuance of the general plan, and that his brigade was destined to cover the movement.|$|E
