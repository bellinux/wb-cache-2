The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing convenient <b>keying</b> of IPA characters that would be otherwise unavailable on standard keyboard layouts.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{creating}} a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, {{in and around the}} city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma <b>keying</b> and other techniques were used to allow more freedom {{in creating}} effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.|$|E
25|$|The German {{time signal}} DCF77, in {{addition}} to amplitude <b>keying,</b> employs phase-shift <b>keying</b> driven by a 9-stage LFSR to increase the accuracy of received time and the robustness of the data stream {{in the presence of}} noise.|$|E
5000|$|Symmetric <b>key</b> {{wrapping}} key: Symmetric <b>key</b> wrapping <b>keys</b> {{are used}} to encrypt other <b>keys</b> using symmetric <b>key</b> algorithms. <b>Key</b> wrapping <b>keys</b> are also known as <b>key</b> encrypting <b>keys.</b>|$|R

25|$|A numbers {{station is}} a shortwave radio station {{characterized}} by broadcasts of formatted numbers, which {{are believed to}} be addressed to intelligence officers operating in foreign countries. Most identified stations use speech synthesis to vocalize numbers, although digital modes such as phase-shift <b>keying</b> and frequency-shift <b>keying,</b> as well as Morse code transmissions, are not uncommon. Most stations have set time schedules, or schedule patterns; however, other stations appear to broadcast at random times. Stations {{may or may not have}} set frequencies in the HF band.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] session <b>key</b> is a {{single-use}} symmetric <b>key</b> {{used for}} encrypting all messages in one communication session. A closely related term is content encryption <b>key</b> (CEK), traffic encryption <b>key</b> (TEK), or multicast <b>key</b> {{which refers to}} any <b>key</b> used to encrypt messages, as opposed to other uses, like encrypting other <b>keys</b> (<b>key</b> encryption <b>key</b> (KEK) or <b>key</b> wrapping <b>key).</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>key</b> {{retainer}} device (KRD) is a {{small metal}} unit that is wall or door mounted, usually designed for the interchangeable core that retains one <b>key</b> (<b>Key</b> A) while the second <b>key</b> (<b>Key</b> B) is used for authorized purposes. When the <b>key</b> in use (<b>Key</b> B) is returned into the <b>key</b> retainer, the <b>key</b> held captive (<b>Key</b> A) is turned and then can be released. Now, the special <b>key,</b> perhaps top master (<b>Key</b> B) is held captive again. The <b>key</b> retainer is a method for providing visual <b>key</b> control.|$|R

25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift <b>keying</b> (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift <b>keying</b> (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
25|$|The {{very long}} time {{constants}} of 19th and early 20th century submarine communications cables required a different form of Morse signalling. Instead of <b>keying</b> a voltage {{on and off for}} varying times, the dits and dahs were represented by two polarities of voltage impressed on the cable, for a uniform time.|$|E

25|$|An OFDM {{carrier signal}} {{is the sum}} of a number of {{orthogonal}} sub-carriers, with baseband data on each sub-carrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift <b>keying</b> (PSK). This composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier.|$|E
25|$|Morse Code, when {{transmitted}} essentially, {{creates an}} AM signal (even in on/off <b>keying</b> mode), assumptions about signal {{can be made}} with respect to similarly timed RTTY signalling.

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{technique used}} in public <b>key</b> cryptography {{is the use}} of asymmetric <b>key</b> algorithms, where a <b>key</b> used by one party to perform encryption {{is not the same as}} the <b>key</b> used by another in decryption. Each user has a pair of cryptographic <b>keys</b> - a public encryption <b>key</b> and a private decryption <b>key.</b> For example, a <b>key</b> pair used for digital signatures consists of a private signing <b>key</b> and a public verification <b>key.</b> The public <b>key</b> may be widely distributed, while the private <b>key</b> is known only to its proprietor. The <b>keys</b> are related mathematically, but the parameters are chosen so that calculating the private <b>key</b> from the public <b>key</b> is unfeasible.|$|R
50|$|Cryptographic <b>keys</b> {{may also}} have <b>keys</b> that {{designate}} {{they can be used}} for long-term (static, archived) use or used for a single session (ephemeral). The latter generally applies to the use of an Ephemeral <b>Key</b> Agreement <b>Key.</b> Most other <b>key</b> types are designed to last for long crypto-periods from about one to two years. When a shorter crypto-period is designed different <b>key</b> types may be used, such as Data Encryption <b>keys,</b> Symmetric Authentication <b>keys,</b> Private Key-Transport <b>keys,</b> Key-Wrapping <b>keys,</b> Authorization <b>keys</b> or RNG <b>keys.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{connectors}} {{are similar}} to XLR but with an extra coding key and groove that allows control over the intermating of XLD plugs and XLR sockets. A connector with the coding key installed will not {{mate with a connector}} that does not have the matching groove. By suitably <b>keying</b> connectors, analog microphones can be protected from damage by the high current digital phantom power supply provided for digital microphones.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{data can}} be encoded and {{transmitted}} via FM by shifting the carrier's frequency among a predefined set of frequencies representing digits - for example one frequency can represent a binary 1 and a second can represent binary 0. This modulation technique is known as frequency-shift <b>keying</b> (FSK). FSK is widely used in modems and fax modems, and {{can also be used}} to send Morse code. Radioteletype also uses FSK.|$|E
25|$|Modern cash {{registers}} may {{be connected to}} a handheld or stationary barcode reader so that a customer's purchases can be more rapidly scanned than would be possible by <b>keying</b> numbers into the register by hand. The use of scanners should also help prevent errors that result from manually entering the product's barcode or pricing. At grocers, the register's scanner may be combined with a scale for measuring product that is sold by weight.|$|E

The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator hooked up to an OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for <b>keying</b> and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching.|$|E
25|$|The reason: {{under the}} {{original}} flight plan, when Huygens was to descend to Titan, {{it would have}} accelerated relative to Cassini, causing the Doppler shift of its signal to vary. Consequently, the hardware of Cassinis receiver {{was designed to be}} able to receive over a range of shifted frequencies. However, the firmware failed to take into account that the Doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency, but also the timing of the payload bits, coded by phase-shift <b>keying</b> at 8192 bits per second.|$|E

The NPRM specifically states this, and this information may be found in its entirety in the December 1951 Issue of QST. While the New RTTY Handbook gives ARRL no credit, it was published by CQ Magazine and its author was a CQ columnist (CQ generally opposed ARRL at that time).|$|E
