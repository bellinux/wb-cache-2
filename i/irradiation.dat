5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) <b>irradiation</b> of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron <b>irradiation</b> using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron <b>irradiation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can {{be formed}} by the neutron {{activation}} of molybdenum-98. When needed, other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission, but are manufactured by neutron <b>irradiation</b> of parent isotopes (for example, technetium-97 {{can be made by}} neutron <b>irradiation</b> of ruthenium-96).|$|E

The short-lived heavier isotopes 238Np and 239Np, useful as radioactive tracers, are produced through neutron <b>irradiation</b> of 237Np and 238U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter isotopes 235Np and 236Np are produced through <b>irradiation</b> of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron.|$|E

30|$|Microwave <b>irradiations</b> cause {{continuous}} realignment of {{the polar}} molecules with the changing field. This causes solutions containing polar molecules (such as water) to get heated. However, as opposed to simple heating, the energy input is more efficient and happens over a shorter period of time. Hence, many workers describe such effects as “non-thermal effects” of the microwave <b>irradiations.</b> Hence, exposure to microwave <b>irradiations</b> is known to accelerate many processes [16, 17].|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor <b>irradiation</b> of this target for six years. This <b>irradiation</b> method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E

Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included <b>irradiation</b> of 243Am with 15N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium, discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of 243Am with 18O.|$|E

40|$|Histologic {{changes were}} {{particularly}} intensive in these cases. It seems that, once {{the parotid gland}} showed morbid changes in sialograms {{as the result of}} exposure to <b>irradiations,</b> normalization of the shadow would seldom, if ever, occur. The present studies concern with the sialograms of the parotid gland which shows disturbance due to exposure to <b>irradiations.</b> Comparative studies of histologic and sialographic changes were performed in 34 parotid glands of dogs in which disturbance of parotid function had experimentally been induced by <b>irradiations.</b> On the other hand, studies were made of the sialograms of. 39 parotid glands in man who had developed disturbance of parotid function as the result of exposure to <b>irradiations.</b> There was usually not much evidence of the influence of <b>irradiations</b> in Stensen 2 ̆ 7 s duct. Sialograms revealed no marked changes, except for occasional leakage of moljodol, out of Stensen 2 ̆ 7 s duct. The ill-effect of <b>irradiations</b> was more intensive in peripheral branches than in main branches of the duct system. Sialograms showed reduction in ramification of the branch, dilatation of the peripheral branches and leakage of moljodol. Breaking off or partial discontinuance of the branches and leakage of moljodol were seen more often in the sialograms taken soon after exposure to <b>irradiations.</b> The sialographic changes of the branches were correlated with histologic changes, such as flattening and degeneration of the epithelial cells, retention of secretion and cell infiltration. The shadow of the gland in sialograms represents histologic changes in the striated tubules, intercalary tubules and acinar cells. These portions of the gland were most sensitive to <b>irradiations.</b> In sialograms the shadow of the gland was abnormal, commensurate with histologic changes. The shadow of the gland has increased in density and its outline has grown more distinct after it had been exposed to <b>irradiations.</b> This observation paralleled the intensity of histologic changes, or phisiologic function of the gland. Many sialograms were demonstrated as dappled shadows with either large or small spots. These were correlated with atrophy and degeneration of the ductules and acinar cells. There were instances in which sialograms showed leakage of moljodol...|$|R

5|$|The {{easiest way}} to produce {{intrinsic}} defects in diamond is by displacing carbon atoms through <b>irradiation</b> with high-energy particles, such as alpha (helium), beta (electrons) or gamma particles, protons, neutrons, ions, etc. The <b>irradiation</b> can occur in the laboratory or in the nature (see Diamond enhancement– Irradiation); it produces primary defects named frenkel defects (carbon atoms knocked off their normal lattice sites to interstitial sites) and remaining lattice vacancies. An important difference between the vacancies and interstitials in diamond is that whereas interstitials are mobile during the <b>irradiation,</b> even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, however vacancies start migrating only at temperatures ~700°C.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{heterogeneous}} {{response to}} X-ray and far UV (254 nm) light <b>irradiations</b> {{was found in}} cultured skin fibroblast lines from 2 separate families with Gardner's syndrome.

40|$|Roles {{of water}} in the {{formation}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the <b>irradiations</b> of toluene-NO 2 and isoprene-NO 2 were investigated in a smog chamber. Experimental results show that the yield of SOA from toluene almost doubled as relative humidity increased from 5  % to 85  %, whereas the yield of SOA from isoprene under humid conditions decreased by 2. 6 times as compared to that under dry conditions. The distinct difference of RH effects on SOA formation from toluene and isoprene is well explained with our experiments and model simulations. The increased SOA from humid toluene-NO 2 <b>irradiations</b> is mainly contributed by O–H-containing products such as polyalcohols formed from aqueous reactions. The major chemical components of SOA in isoprene-NO 2 <b>irradiations</b> are oligomers formed from the gas phase. SOA formation from isoprene-NO 2 <b>irradiations</b> is controlled by stable Criegee intermediate (SCI) that is greatly influenced by water. As a result, high RH can obstruct the oligomerization reaction of SCI to form SOA...|$|R

Furthermore, tests of radiation effects such as single event upsets, are being performed with intensities down to a few particles/s. Different energies are achieved by degrading the primary beam energy. We are currently developing the capability for heavy ion <b>irradiations</b> in air with beams up to Xe at beam energies between 15 and 45 MeV per nucleon.
