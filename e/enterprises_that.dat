5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial <b>enterprises</b> <b>that</b> the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E
