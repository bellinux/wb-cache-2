5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E

SHERPA unites eleven regional offices whose purpose is to organize Mérens breeders and enthusiasts. The role of SHERPA <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> the overall direction of the breed {{in partnership with the}} French National Stud. It promotes the Mérens at fairs, national shows and international exhibitions, as well as publishing newsletters and breeder lists. SHERPA also organizes the annual breed show in Bouan.|$|E

25|$|The halting {{problem is}} an {{analogous}} example {{from the field}} of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether it halts or runs forever. The halting problem is undecidable in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.|$|E
25|$|A longstanding Pisot–Vijayaraghavan problem {{asks whether}} the {{assumption}} that α is algebraic can be dropped from the last statement. If the answer is affirmative, Pisot's numbers would be characterized among all real numbers by the simple convergence of ||λα'n|| to 0 for some auxiliary real λ. It is known {{that there are only}} countably many numbers α with this property. The problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether any of them is transcendental.|$|E
25|$|Once policy {{alternatives}} {{have been}} evaluated, {{the next step}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method {{is an exercise in}} benefit cost analysis (BCA).|$|E

25|$|Decision {{problems}} {{are one of}} the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem {{can be viewed as a}} formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide,</b> with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.|$|E
25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|Much {{effort has}} been {{dedicated}} to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, observers are presented with two arrays, composed {{of a number of}} stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Performance is critically dependent on the number of items in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, correct responses invariably decline in a monotonic fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic problem}} with {{estimating}} a gas allowance for contingencies <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> what contingencies to allow for. This is {{addressed in the}} risk assessment for the planned dive. A commonly considered contingency is to share gas with another diver from {{the point in the}} dive where the maximum time is needed to reach the surface or other place where more gas is available. It is likely that both divers will have a higher than normal RMV during an assisted ascent as it is a stressful situation. It is prudent to take this into account. The values should be chosen according to recommendations of the code of practice in use or the training agency, but if a higher value is chosen it is unlikely that anyone would object. Recreational divers may have the discretion to use RMV values of their own choice, based on personal experience and informed acceptance of risk.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
25|$|Two Players: In this variation, {{the cards}} are not dealt at the {{beginning}} of the game. Instead, the deck is placed face down and the players take turns drawing two cards with each turn. Once drawn, players must choose one card of the pair to discard and one to keep. This continues until the deck is exhausted after which, each player will possess 13 cards. The game then proceeds normally. :A variation of this deal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether or not to keep the first card drawn. If the player decides to keep the first card, the second card may be looked at, but must be discarded. If the player decides to discard the first card, the second card must be kept. This variation introduces a greater degree of chance into the game. To add an even greater degree of chance, forbid viewing of the second card if the first card is kept. This gives both players less certainty as to which cards their opponent is holding.|$|E

25|$|Municipalities (gemeente, pl. gemeenten) {{form the}} lowest tier of {{government}} in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (gemeenteraad) is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is {{comparable to that of}} the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality {{is in the hands of}} the municipal executive (college van burgemeester en wethouders, abbr. to (college van) B), made up of the mayor (burgemeester) and the aldermen (wethouder, pl. wethouders). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years and are normally re-appointed automatically for another term, provided the municipal council agrees. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.|$|E
