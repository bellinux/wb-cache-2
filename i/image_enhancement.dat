40|$|Abstract. In this paper, on {{the basis}} of the {{classical}} Retinex enhancement algorithm, we propose a MSR (Multi-Scale Retinex) algorithm based on HSI color space for foggy <b>images</b> <b>enhancement.</b> This algorithm can self-adaptively choose the Scale of the filter function, and it can automatically merge the enhancement effect of the multi-scales. The algorithm can highlight the detail characteristics of target while maintaining the background smoothly. In order to improve the brightness and contrast of the image, we use the Weber's law and the characteristics of human visual system to select the scale parameters, which can better realized the foggy <b>images</b> <b>enhancement...</b>|$|R

40|$|Overarching goal of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} automated and semi-automated methods of mapping wetlands using Landsat ETM+ and SRTM data. Automated methods consisted of: (a) slope derived from SRTM, (b) Tasseled cap Wetness Index (TCWI), (c) Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), (d) multi-band vegetation indices (MBVIs), (e) two band vegetation indices (TBVIs), (f) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and (g) data fusion involving ETM+ and SRTM and then classifying the same. The best of these indices or methods provide an accuracy of less than 30 percent with high errors of omissions and commissions. Semi-automated methods consisted of 3 key techniques: (a) <b>image</b> <b>enhancements</b> to highlight wetlands, (b) image display to discern precise boundaries of wetlands, and (b) digitizing directly off screen to separate wetlands from their neighboring landscape. The most useful displays of ETM+ <b>image</b> <b>enhancements</b> (e. g., ratios) and band combinations, displayed as false colo...|$|R

DCT based <b>image</b> resolution <b>enhancement</b> algorithm is very simple to implement and has the additional advantage of being able to produce high resolution images whose size need not necessarily be a multiple of two.
