5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission and apparently feared that it had uncovered information they would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to conceal. He argued that there were Slovene populations in Styria who would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the maintenance of Austrian rule.|$|E

The EP was a commercial success, peaking at number twenty on the Billboard 200 and at {{number one on}} Top Holiday Albums. Songs from The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection have been performed at several venues.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Frieda, {{a friend}} of Esther who has never {{received}} any marriage proposals, tells Shira that Esther would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> that Yochay marry her {{in the event of}} her death. As a result, Shira tells Yochay that Frieda is more suitable, which he takes as an affront.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, {{and he seems}} to <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.|$|E

5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from {{the upper part of the}} formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part of the formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> river-related settings.|$|E
5|$|The DeKalb County Circuit Court {{came into}} {{existence}} in June 1839 when the first session of court met in Sycamore's first courthouse building, though the building was somewhat incomplete. At first, it seemed, that Sycamore {{might not be the}} location of the DeKalb County Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates even had to present their work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the roles to be cast {{the other way}} about, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Tracks {{discovered}} by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that Stegosaurus lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing {{four or five}} baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it. Stegosaurus may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> drier settings than other common Morrison Formation dinosaurs, such as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus.|$|E

5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> {{him to have}} {{remained}} at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong to}} prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant {{did not live}} in the soil and nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong claws and long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a jungle habitat at low elevations, and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E
5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, {{ranging from the}} northern United States across Mexico {{as far south as}} Costa Rica. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. The environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the mammoth steppe). Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> forests, clearings could provide them with grass and herbs.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{moderation}} and clemency {{shown by}} Kantakouzenos in this settlement, {{it did not}} gain universal acceptance. Supporters of the Palaiologoi still distrusted him, while his own partisans would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to depose the Palaiologoi outright and install the Kantakouzenoi as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, {{and had to be}} placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous appanage covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a march against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated exclave surrounded by the Serbs, refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a de facto independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants {{existed in}} Europe during the Eocene and Late Oligocene. Cesare Baroni Urbani {{collected}} Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany. Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the Eocene, but {{the exact location}} of its discovery is unclear, due to the lost type material. P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species, living in trees instead of the ground. William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs, sharp claws and elongated mandibles. Prionomyrmex may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a jungle habitat at low elevations.|$|E
