40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish the effectiveness of interventions to reduce frequent emergency department (ED) use among a general adult high ED-use population. Systematic review of the literature from 1950 -January 2015. Studies were included if they: had a control group (controlled trials or comparative cohort studies), were set in an ED or acute care facility, and examined the impact of an intervention to reduce frequent ED use in a general adult population. Studies reporting non-original data or focused on a specific patient population were excluded. Study design, patient population, intervention, the frequency of ED visits, and costs of frequent ED use and/or interventions were extracted and narratively synthesized. Among 17 included articles, three intervention categories were identified: case management (n = 12), <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> (n = 3), and information sharing (n = 2). Ten studies examining case management reported reductions in mean (- 0. 66 to - 37) or median (- 0. 1 to - 20) number of ED visits after 12 -months; one study reported an increase in mean ED visits (+ 2. 79); and one reported no change. Of these, 6 studies also reported reduced hospital costs. Only 1 study evaluating <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> examined ED utilization and found no change in median ED visits post-intervention. Costs following <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> were also only evaluated in 1 study, which reported savings in hospital costs of $ 742 /patient. Evidence was mixed regarding information sharing: 1 study reported no change in mean ED visits and did not examine costs; whereas the other reported a decrease in mean ED visits (- 16. 9) and ED cost savings of $ 15, 513 /patient. The impact of all three frequent-user interventions was modest. Case management had the most rigorous evidence base, yielded moderate cost savings, but with variable reductions in ED use.

40|$|Abstract Mobility {{disability}} {{in older}} adults can arise from single system problems, such as discrete musculoskeletal injury. In frail older adults, however, mobility disability {{is part of}} a complex web of problems. The approach to their rehabilitation must take that complexity into account, as is reported by Fairhall et al. First, their overall health state must be assessed, which is achieved by a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The assessment can show how a particular patient came to be disabled, so that an <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> can be worked out. Whether this approach works in general can be evaluated by looking at group differences in mean mobility test scores. Knowing whether it has worked in the individual patient requires an individualized measure. This is because not every patient starts from the same point, and not every patient achieves success by aiming for the same goal. For one patient, walking unassisted for three metres would be a triumph; for another it would be a tragedy. Unless we understand the complexity of the needs of frail older adults, we will neither be able to treat them effectively nor evaluate our efforts sensibly.

BACKGROUND: Documentation of individualized patient care is a continuing concern in healthcare services and could impacts the quality and safety of healthcare. Use of electronic systems has made some aspects of documentation more comprehensive, but creation of an <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> remains a pressing issue. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: An action research project was conducted between 2010 and 2012 to improve the content and quality of nursing documentation in community healthcare services in four municipalities. One year after the project was completed four focus group interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals, one for each involved municipality. Two unit managers were interviewed individually. Qualitative content analysis was used. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: healthcare professionals perceived competing interest; they experienced that they had to manage complexity and changes; and they highlighted a clear and visible leader as important for success. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement activities are essential. Healthcare professionals experience a complicated situation when electronic health record systems do not support workflow. Further research is recommended to focus on the functionality and user interface of EHR systems, and on the role of leadership when implementing changes in clinical practice.

Objectives: To assess whether a comprehensive care programme candecrease hospital admissions {{and length of}} hospital stay (LOS) for COPDpatients. Methods: In a randomized control trial of patients discharged from hospitalafter an episode of acute exacerbation of COPD, patients were randomized toan Intervention Group (IG) or Usual Care Group (UG). The IG received acomprehensive, <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> which included respiratory nurse edu-cation, physiotherapist support for pulmonary rehabilitation, 3 -monthly tele-phone calls by a respiratory nurse {{for a period of}} 1 year, and followed up inrespiratory clinic by a respiratory specialist once every 3 months for 1 year. TheUG were managed according to standard practice. All patients had assess-ments (spirometry, 6 minute walk test, dyspnoea score [Modiﬁed MedicalResearch Council Dyspnoea Scale {MMRC}], and quality of life [QOL] [St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire {SGRQ}]) at baseline and at 12 months. The primary outcome was 12 -month hospital readmission. Results: 180 patients were recruited (IG N = 90,UG N = 90; mean age 74. 7 ± 8. 2 yrs, 172 (95. 6 %) males; mean FEV 1 45. 4 ± 16. 6 % predicted). At 12 months, the IG had fewer readmissions (1. 56 ± 2. 13 vs 2. 38 ± 2. 14 times,p = 0. 0008) and shorter LOS (7. 41 ± 11. 29 vs 12. 21 ± 12. 87 days, p = 0. 0003) for COPD than UG. IG at 12 months had improved mean MMRC (- 0. 1 ± 0. 7 vs 0. 2 ± 0. 6, p = 0. 033) and SGRQ score (- 8. 5 ± 16. 6 vs − 0. 1 ± 15. 7, p = 0. 002) compared with UG.

40|$|Background: More {{focus on}} patient-centeredness in care for {{patients}} with type 2 diabetes requests increasing attention to diabetes quality management processes on patient-centeredness by managers in primary care groups and outpatient clinics. Although patient-centered care is ultimately determined {{by the quality of}} interactions between patients and clinicians at the practice level, it should be facilitated at organizational level too. This nationwide study aimed to assess the state of diabetes quality management on patient-centeredness at organizational level and its possibilities to improve after a tailored intervention. Methods: This before-after study compares the quality management on patient-centeredness within Dutch diabetes care groups and outpatient clinics before and after a 1 -year stepwise intervention. At baseline, managers of 51 diabetes primary care groups and 28 outpatient diabetes clinics completed a questionnaire about the organization’s quality management program. Patient-centeredness (0 %- 100 %) was operationalized in six subdomains: facilitating self-management support, <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> support, patients’ access to medical files, patient education policy, safeguarding patients’ interests, and formal patient involvement. The intervention consisted of feedback and benchmark and if requested a telephone call and/or a consultancy visit. After 1 year, the managers completed the questionnaire again. The 1 -year changes were examined by dependent (non) parametric tests. Results: Care groups improved significantly on patient-centeredness (from 47. 1 % to 53. 3 %; P= 0. 002), and on its subdomains “access to medical files” (from 42. 0 % to 49. 4 %), and “safeguarding patients’ interests” (from 58. 1 % to 66. 2 %). Outpatient clinics, which scored higher at baseline (66. 7 %) than care groups, did not improve on patient-centeredness (65. 6 %: P= 0. 54) or its subdomains. “Formal patient involvement” remained low in both care groups (23. 2 %) and outpatient clinics (33. 9 %).

40|$|Objective: This {{research}} {{explores the}} critical need for <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> to ensure maximum cost savings {{by providing a}} balance between individuals’ care needs and care wishes. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to identify common goals of care (GoC) expressed by long-term care residents (using the interRAI LTCF) and clients receiving community supportive services (using the interRAI CHA) or community mental health services (using the interRAI CMH). Methods: Three interRAI datasets were used to perform data analyses. The responses to the open-ended GoC item were quantified and grouped into common goal categories, which were then examined against the interRAI outcome measures and Clinical Assessment Protocols (CAPs). Demographic and clinical characterisitics were compared across the sample populations using the chi-square test. Logistic regression models were created to reveal variables that are predictive of not having a GoC recorded within each care setting. Results: Twenty-five GoC categories were created. Although the GoC responses were very diverse, many persons had no goal recorded. Nearly 70 % of long-term care (LTC) residents and community support service (CSS) clients were unable to state a GoC. Different populations in different service settings had distinct GoC but had some commonalities as well such as goals that focused on general physical or mental health issues. GoC varied with the CAPs- the triggering of a CAP did not necessarily mean a corresponding GoC was noted. Each care sector had different predictor variables that were strongly associated with not having a GoC. Conclusions: There is not a “one size fits all” solution to <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> The same goals and outcome measures are not appropriate or realistic for all persons. It is critical to incorporate self-reported goals into the development of effective and <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> to ultimately improve one’s quality of life, satisfaction with care, and success in achieving desired outcomes of care...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The Resident Assessment Instrument–Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) is an {{interdisciplinary}} standardized process that informs <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> development in nursing homes. This standardized process {{has failed to}} consistently result in <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> which may suggest problems with content and planning integrity. We examined the decision making and care practices of personal support workers (PSWs) {{in relation to the}} RAI/MDS standardized process.  Design and Methods: This qualitative study utilized focus groups and semi-structured interviews with PSWs (n = 26) and supervisors (n = 9) in two nursing homes in central Canada.  Results: PSWs evidenced unique occupational contributions to assessment via proximal familiarity and biographical information as well as to <b>individualizing</b> <b>care</b> by empathetically linking their own bodily experiences and forging bonds of fictive kinship with residents. These contributions were neither captured by RAI/MDS categories nor relayed to the interdisciplinary team. Causal factors for PSW exclusion included computerized records, low status, and poor interprofessional collaboration. Intraprofessional collaboration by PSWs aimed to compensate for exclusion and to <b>individualize</b> <b>care.</b>  Implications: Exclusive institutional reliance on the RAI/MDS undermines quality care because it fails to capture residents’ preferences and excludes input by PSWs. Recommendations include incorporating PSW knowledge in <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and documentation and examining PSWs’ nascent occupational identity and their role as interprofessional brokers in long-term care...|$|R

Patients received a comprehensive in-home assessment by a nurse practitioner/social worker (NP/SW) team, who then met with a larger interdisciplinary team to develop an <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> In consultation with the primary care team, standardized care protocols were activated to address relevant key issues as needed. A process evaluation based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research identified key adaptations of the original model, which included streamlining of standardized protocols, augmenting mental health interventions and performing some assessments in the clinic.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to describe the design of a study to evaluate the clinical and economic effects of a Disease Management model on functional health, quality of care and quality of life of persons living in homes for the elderly. Methods This study concerns a cluster randomized controlled clinical trial among five intervention homes and five usual care homes in the North-West of the Netherlands with a total of over 500 residents. All persons who are not terminally ill, are able to be interviewed and sign informed consent are included. For cognitively impaired persons family proxies will be approached to provide outcome information. The Disease Management Model consists of several elements: (1) Trained staff carries out a multidimensional assessment of the patients functional health and care needs with the interRAI Long Term Care Facilities instrument (LTCF). Computerization of the LTCF produces immediate identification of problem areas and thereby guides <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> (2) The assessment outcomes are discussed in a Multidisciplinary Meeting (MM) with the nurse, primary care physician, nursing home physician and Psychotherapist and if necessary other members of the care team. The MM presents <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> to manage or treat modifiable disabilities and risk factors. (3) Consultation by an nursing home physician and psychotherapist is offered to the frailest residents at risk for nursing home admission (according to the interRAI LTCF). Outcome measures are Quality of Care indicators (LTCF based), Quality Adjusted Life Years (Euroqol), Functional health (SF 12, COOP-WONCA), Disability (GARS), Patients care satisfaction (QUOTE), hospital and nursing home days and mortality, health care utilization and costs. Discussion This design is unique because no earlier studies were performed to evaluate the effects and costs of this Disease Management Model for disabled persons in homes for the elderly on functional health and quality of care.

40|$|Abstract Background and objective: When FAs {{with chronic}} disease and various needs {{are able to}} keep up their {{psychological}} and physical wellbeing, perform daily activities and maintain control of their life, they are able to live an active life and take care of themselves longer, and this has an impact on their quality of life. The role of community matron is to assess an individual’s problems and needs for health services and improve the self-care of FAs by providing a needs-based education. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effectiveness of nurse-led intervention on the quality of life, sense of coherence and daily activities of frequent attenders (FAs). Methods: This study is an intervention trial, with a two-year follow-up, including intervention and control groups. The intervention group received nurse-led intervention that included the assessment of FAs care needs, an <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan,</b> support for self-management and service coordination. The FAs in the control group received traditional care, including patient education and support. Self-reported instruments were used to collect data from adult frequent attenders, including the Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), Sense of Coherence (SOC) and 15 D, to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Follow-ups measurements were taken after one year and after two years between 2008 and 2011. Results: The study shows a significant correlation between sense of coherence and quality of life (p <. 0005) and quality of life and amount of daily activities performed (p <. 0005) in both groups. The intervention group had statistically significantly better sense of coherence at every stage of the study. The activities of daily living statistically significantly weakened in the intervention group (p =. 001) from baseline to two years despite intervention, whereas in the control group it remained unchanged. In the control group, a statistically significant correlation was found between sense of coherence and FAs feeling satisfaction with their current life (p =. 019). The HRQoL did not differ between the groups during the study. Conclusions: These results indicate a correlation between sense of coherence and quality of life and also between quality of life and amount of daily activities among FAs. Intervention did not improve the quality of life of FAs or their daily functioning.

Integrated practice units (IPU) had been proposed as an approach of restructuring the organization and work processes of multidisciplinary teams to achieve value in healthcare. Our primary objective is to evaluate if the novel application of the IPU concept to organize a modified virtual ward model incorporating pre-hospital discharge transitional care can reduce readmissions of patients at highest risk for readmission. We conducted an open label, assessor blinded randomized controlled trial on patients {{with one or more}} unscheduled readmissions in the prior 90 days and LACE score ≥ 10. 840 patients were randomized in 1 : 1 ratio and blocks of 6 to the intervention program (n = 420) or control (n = 420). Allocation concealment was effected via an off-site telephone service maintained by a hospital administrator. Intervention patients received discharge planning, medication reconciliation, coaching on self-management of chronic diseases using standardized action plans and an <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> complete with written discharge instructions, appointments schedule, medication changes and the contact information of the outpatient VW nurse before discharge. At discharge, care is handed over to the outpatient VW team. Patients were closely monitored in the VW for three months that included a telephone review within 72 hours of discharge, home assessment, regular telephone reviews to identify early complications and early review clinics for patients who destabilize. The VW meet daily to discuss new patients and review care plans for patients. Control patients received standard hospital care that included a standardized patient copy of the hospital discharge summary listing their medical diagnoses and medications; and follow up is arranged with a primary care provider or specialist as considered necessary. The primary outcome was the unplanned readmission rate to any hospital within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes included the unplanned readmission rate, emergency department (ED) attendance rate to any hospital and the probability without readmission or death up to 180 days of discharge. Length of stay and mortality rate at 90 -day were compared between the two groups. Outcome data were objectively retrieved from the hospital and National Electronic Health Records by a blinded outcome assessor. All patients' outcomes were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. The characteristics of both study groups were similar. Patients in the intervention group had a significant {{reduction in the number of}} 30 -day readmissions, IRR 0. 67 (95 % CI, 0. 52 to 0. 86, p = 0. 001) and the number of 30 -day emergency department attendances, IRR 0. 60 (95 % CI, 0. 46 to 0. 79, p< 0. 001) compared to those receiving standard hospital care. The effectiveness was sustained at 90 and 180 days. The intervention group utilized 1164 fewer hospital bed days at 90 -day post discharge. No adverse events were reported. Applying the integrated practice unit concept to the virtual ward program resulted in reduced readmissions in patients who are at highest risk of readmission...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Medication {{adherence}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important aspects of the treatment plan for successful recovery of patients with psychosis. Medication non-adherence leads to increased relapse rate, risk of violence, symptom severity, hospitalization, and suicide risk; reduced mental function and life satisfaction; as well as increased economic burden to society. The aim of this study was to examine the predictors of medication adherence for first-episode psychosis patients in a three-year retrospective cohort study. Methods The retrospective cohort study evaluated the potential predictors of medication adherence over 3 years in first-episode psychosis patients. Patients having a good adherence rating (1 or 2 on a 4 -point scale) for 8 months or more were categorized into the good adherence group for that year. Patients having a poor adherence rating (3 or 4 on a 4 -point scale) for 5 months or more were categorized into the poor adherence group for that year. Potential predictors for medication adherence were gender, age, years of education, migration, occupation impairment, premorbid functioning, duration of untreated psychosis, mode of onset, diagnosis, hospitalization at first presentation, positive, negative and depressive symptoms at 1 month, stressful life experiences, and early intervention. The dependent variable was medication adherence by the patient. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to explore predictors for non-adherence at 1, 2 and 3 years. Results Among the 1400 patients recruited into the study, non-adherence rates were 15. 7 % (190 / 1208) at year 1, 15. 3 % (171 / 1115) at year 2, and 12. 1 % (125 / 1029) at year 3. From the logistic regression analyses, suicide attempt at baseline (p= 0. 027, OR= 2. 233) and mode of onset (p= 0. 035, OR= 1. 583) were found to be predictors of poor medication adherence at 3 years following the first episode. Common significant predictors were identified at year 1 and year 2. Standard care (p= 0. 000, OR= 2. 332), hospitalization at baseline (p= 0. 001, OR= 2. 095), stressful life event (p= 0. 015, OR= 1. 567), migration status (p= 0. 048, OR= 1. 472), more years of education (p= 0. 024, OR= 1. 084), lower positive symptom severity (p= 0. 001, OR= 1. 372) and paranoid schizophrenia (p= 0. 043, OR= 1. 444) were found to be predictors of poor medication adherence in the two years following the first episode. Conclusions It is clear from our study that early intervention comprising an <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> enhanced medication adherence, but these benefits lasted only until the treatment ended. It is recommended that the early intervention service should be extended to 5 years and include patient-centred interventions for high-risk patients: an adjustment and adaptation programme for immigrants (specifically new immigrants to Hong Kong); a stigma reduction programme for teenagers; psychotherapy, group therapy and individual counseling for patients who have experienced stressful life events or attempted suicide; and sustained education on medication adherence for acute and sub-acute onset patients. These strategies of intervention tailored to the individual could be introduced to improve medication adherence in psychosis patients. Further studies on medication predictors including insight level, side effects of medication, social support level, level of premorbid intelligence and therapeutic relationships, could identify potential predictors of medication adherence, which can be targeted to reduce relapse, decrease hospitalization and reduce the cost to society. published_or_final_versionPsychological MedicineMasterMaster of Psychological Medicin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} how the check sheet of the New-born <b>Individualized</b> Developmental <b>Care</b> and Assessment Program ® (NIDCAP®) can be quantified and used in research. Using the quantified NIDCAP ® mea-sures, the hypothesis that Caucasian male infants are less behaviorally compe-tent while in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was explored. Participants in-cluded 42 very preterm NICU infants. Eighty-five NIDCAP ® behaviors were quantified into scores ranging from 0 to 1, indicating the percentage of time each behavior was observed. Multivariate analyses were used in grouping the 85 NIDCAP ® behaviors into three subsystems of functioning. The hypothesis that Caucasian male infants were less competent was not supported; neither were gender differences found. Contrary to this hypothesis, African American infants were identified as more vulnerable on several behaviors. NIDCAP ® assessments were easily quantified. Once the entire NIDCAP ® exam has been quantified, prac-tice applications may involve automated development of <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

40|$|Relief {{from pain}} and {{distressing}} symptoms {{associated with a}} life limiting illness is an issue relevant to all Canadians. Provision of high quality care for persons {{nearing the end of}} life may improve the health and quality of life of the person and affects {{the health and well-being of}} members of their informal support network including family, friends, and caregivers. Palliative care, a person-centered approach to care for persons faced with a life limiting illness and their informal support network, focuses on the ‘total person’ or ‘whole self’ addressing the multifaceted complex needs of each person on an individualized basis. Palliative care is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be “achieved through prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, comprehensive assessment, and treatment of pain and physical, psychosocial, or spiritual problems” (World Health Organization [WHO], 2010). The palliative care philosophy prioritizes self-determination of the person and supports their engagement in the care planning and decision making process across the illness trajectory. Approximately one fifth of persons who die annually experience unrelieved suffering (Doyle & Woodruff, 2013). Persons nearing the end-of-life face can face a wide range of challenges that may include: uncontrollable pain and physical symptoms, unresolved and emotionally distressing psycho-social issues, and fear of one’s own mortality and of an unknown future. Nearly two thirds of Canadians who die each year may benefit from palliative care (Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association [CHPCA], 2010), however only approximately one in eight of those persons are able to access palliative care services (Carstairs & Beaudoin, 2000). Comprehensive clinical assessment supports clinicians to make evidence-informed decisions and promotes a person-centered approach to care planning. The interRAI Palliative Care assessment instrument (interRAI PC) is a comprehensive standardized assessment instrument, designed for use by facility and community based palliative care services, with applications that include care planning, outcome measurement, quality monitoring, and resource allocation (Hirdes et al., 1999; Steel, et al., 2003; Gray, et al., 2009; Hirdes et al., 2008). Using pilot data gathered from the interRAI PC, this thesis examines the potential use of interRAI PC assessment data, and in particular how evidence from the interRAI PC Clinical Assessment Protocols (CAPs) has the potential to inform <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> development for persons with a life limiting illness. This thesis begins with a scoping literature search that describes palliative care in a Canadian context and explores care planning with the interRAI PC. This is followed by three research based chapters (Chapters 6, 7, and 8) that include analysis based on pilot data gathered between 2006 and 2011 using the interRAI PC assessment instrument. Community dwelling persons with a life limiting illness receiving palliative home care services in six geographic locations across Ontario, Canada, were included in these analyses. Persons with a life limiting illness residing in institutional or hospice facilities, or in jurisdictions outside of Ontario, were excluded. Analyses were performed using SAS Version 9. 2 with an alpha level of p< 0. 05 for all statistical tests unless otherwise stated. The University of Waterloo’s Office of Research Ethics granted ethics clearance for this research (ORE# 19424) November 29 th, 2013. The first research chapter (Chapter 6) describes how clinicians may use the interRAI PC Clinical Assessment Protocols (CAPs) to inform care planning. It includes an overview of the suite of eight CAPs and provides a background description of the CAP development process. Discussion addresses the unique distributional characteristics of each CAP and describes a hierarchical triggering structure. Following, chapter six which provides an overview of the interRAI PC CAPs from a broad perspective; chapter seven (the second research chapter) takes a more in-depth focus investigating the Dyspnea CAP. Dyspnea was selected as the symptom of focus because it is the one of the most commonly triggered CAPs affecting nearly half of the sample palliative home care population used in this thesis and is reported to be one of the most distressing symptoms affecting both the person faced with a life limiting illness and their informal caregivers (Ng &von Gunten, 1998; Potter, Hami, Bryan, & Quigley, 2003; Dellon et al., 2010; Kroenke, Johns, Theobald, Wu, & Tu 2013). Chapter seven examines the Dyspnea CAP and describes the prevalence of dyspnea. This chapter demonstrates the relationship between dyspnea and prognosis as well as other clinical factors. Moreover, how the presence of dyspnea changes over time is examined and person-level characteristics, some of which are potentially amenable to change, that affect the risk for dyspnea over time are identified. In addition, risk and protective factors for persons who over time developed new dyspnea symptoms and for those who recovered from dyspnea are examined. Recognizing that a hallmark of the palliative care philosophy is its aim to provide the highest quality of care and support for both the person nearing the end of life and members of their care network including their informal caregivers, the third research chapter (Chapter 8) examines distress experienced by both the caregiver and the care recipient as a unit of care. As quality palliative care may increase satisfaction with care, improve global quality of life for client and their caregiver, reduce physical symptoms like dyspnea, decrease signs of depression or anxiety, and improve access to health care resources (Kane, Bernstein, Wales, Leibowitz, & Kaplan, 1984; Melin-Johansson, Axelsson, Gaston-Johansson, & Danielson, 2010) the association between the presence of dyspnea and distress experienced by members of the caregiver-client unit of care is examined to illustrate how dyspnea relates to distress, a major problem affecting over half of the caregiver-client units of care. Together, findings from this thesis show that if one or more interRAI PC CAPs are triggered then the clinician should take notice. Data from the interRAI PC and more specifically from the interRAI PC CAPs examined in this thesis provide evidence on their potential to inform greater understanding of the complex needs of palliative home care clients. Better understanding of the interRAI PC CAPs and identification of patterns in CAP triggering structure suggest symptoms where clinicians may focus increased attention. To address the accumulative complex needs of persons who are faced with a life-limiting illness and the needs of their caregivers, resource allocation focused on evidence gathered from a comprehensive standardized assessment instrument should be prioritized...|$|E

40|$|The {{safe use}} of {{anticoagulants}} requires {{a delicate balance}} between the risk of bleeding {{and the risk of}} thrombosis, particularly in drug-sensitive patients, such as older people. Recently-marketed “direct oral anticoagulants” are now being increasingly prescribed and administered in the hospital setting. Direct oral anticoagulants have pharmacological properties that are often unpredictable, and inter-patient variability in drug response is high. Therefore, people often require meticulous review and planning to ensure they receive optimal dosing and monitoring.

40|$|Closed access until 19 May 2018 Introduction Literature {{describes}} self-harm as {{functional and}} meaningful. This creates difficulties for service-users detained in an inpatient environment where self-harm is prevented. Aim Mental healthcare staff were interviewed {{to build on}} existing evidence of issues with the prevention approach and explore, from a staff perspective, how self-harm prevention impacts on service-users, how they manage distress and how this impacts on staff and their approach to care. Methods Qualitative methods were used to allow unexpected themes to arise. Ten semi-structured interviews were carried out with mental healthcare staff and thematically analysed. Findings and discussion The findings provide new evidence on the benefits and limitations of the inpatient environment for individuals who self-harm. Findings indicate that being unable to self-harm {{can lead to a}} continuation of distress and subsequent potentially harmful attempts to manage distress. Staff described experiencing a struggle for control in preventing self-harm, leading to increasingly harmful methods of self-harm. Alternatively some staff were able to support service-users with distress management. We discuss factors influencing which of these ‘paths’ service-users followed. Implications Considerations for <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> including understanding self-harm, using <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and attending to barriers are outlined with the ultimate aim of reducing distress and the impact of prevention of self-harm...|$|R
40|$|Background: Psychosocial {{interventions}} in long-term care {{have the potential}} {{to improve the quality of}} care and quality of life of persons with dementia. Our aim is to explore the evidence and consensus on psychosocial interventions for persons with dementia in long-term care. Methods: This study comprises an appraisal of research reviews and of European, U. S. and Canadian dementia guidelines. Results: Twenty-eight reviews related to long-term care psychosocial interventions were selected. Behavioral management techniques (such as behavior therapy), cognitive stimulation, and physical activities (such as walking) were shown positively to affect behavior or physical condition, or to reduce depression. There are many other promising interventions, but methodological weaknesses did not allow conclusions to be drawn. The consensus presented in the guidelines emphasized the importance of care tailored to the needs and capabilities of persons with dementia and consideration of the individual's life context. Conclusions: Long-term care offers the possibility for <b>planned</b> <b>care</b> through <b>individualized</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> and consideration of the needs of persons with dementia and the individual life context. While using recommendations based on evidence and consensus is important to shape future long-term care, further well-designed research is needed on psychosocial {{interventions in}} long-term care to strengthen the evidence base for such care.
