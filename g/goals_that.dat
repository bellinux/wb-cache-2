Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts. In subsequent years, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.|$|E

5|$|Argyle were {{relegated to}} the fourth tier of English {{football}} {{for the first time}} in their history at the end of the 1994–95 season, but earned promotion again the following year, this time at Wembley Stadium in the 1996 Third Division play-off final. The club won their first League championship in forty-three years at the end of the 2001–02 season, breaking numerous records in the process, including a Third Division record points tally of 102. Argyle conceded just 28 League <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> season and kept 27 clean sheets in 46 matches. Two years later, the club won the Second Division of the Football League and promotion back to the second tier, which was renamed the Championship by the League's board in the summer of 2004. Argyle's success in the 2003–04 season took their tally of titles in the third tier of English football to four, which is a divisional record. As of the end of the 2012–13 season, Plymouth Argyle Football Club has spent 40 seasons in the second tier of English football, 39 seasons in the third, and seven seasons in the fourth.

5|$|Carrick {{suffered}} an injury setback in October 2007 after breaking his elbow in a 1–0 home win over Roma in the Champions League group stage. As {{a result of}} the injury he would be out of action for up to six weeks. His return to action came on 3 November as a substitute for Anderson in a 2–2 draw at Arsenal. Carrick scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 2008 in the Manchester derby, his goal came in injury time and was mere consolation in a 2–1 home loss to rivals Manchester City. His second and final goal of the season came against his former club West Ham United in a 4–1 win at home on 3 May. Although he scored just two league <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> season it still led to another league title as United beat Wigan Athletic {{on the final day of}} the season to prevent Chelsea from reaching the top spot. On 18 April, one week on from their title success Carrick was offered a new five-year contract along with defenders Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown. A four-year contract was then signed on 17 May 2008, which tied Carrick to United until at least June 2012. He participated in his first-ever Champions League final on 21 May in Moscow, playing the full 120 minutes in a 6–5 penalty shootout win over Chelsea in the 2008 final. The scoreline ended 1–1 after extra time, he took United's second penalty of the subsequent shootout, which he converted to help give him the first European honour of his career.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} season under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Del Piero {{primarily}} served as an assist-man, providing 14 assists in Serie A, {{the most in the}} league that season, and 20 in all competitions. He faced criticism, however, for his inability to score in open play following his injury the previous season, as only one of his 9 Serie A <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> season was in open play (a header against Parma), with the rest coming from penalties. Furthermore, {{towards the end of the}} season, his once excellent attacking partnership with Inzaghi became less effective, due to Inzaghi's individualism, as well as the pair's lack of understanding and strained relationship both on and off the pitch. Del Piero helped Juventus to capture the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup that season, which allowed Juventus to qualify for the UEFA Cup; overall, he scored 12 goals in all competitions, as Juventus narrowly missed out on the Serie A title. In 2000, Del Piero was the world's best-paid football player from salaries, bonuses, and advertising revenue.|$|E
5|$|Other players {{took part}} in {{significant}} matches {{in the history of}} the club. Harry Morris and Eddy Stanley appeared in every match as Small Heath Alliance progressed through six rounds to the semi-final of the 1885–86 FA Cup. Tom Bayley, George Short and Fred Speller appeared in Small Heath's first Football League match in 1892. In more recent times, John Gayle scored the winning goal as Birmingham beat Tranmere Rovers in the 1991 Football League Trophy Final. The 18-year-old Darren Carter converted the decisive penalty in the 2002 play-off final shootout by which Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time; goalkeeper Nico Vaesen saved one of the opponents' spot-kicks. The Birmingham team that won the 2011 League Cup featured six men listed here, including Ben Foster, who won the man of the match award. Teenagers Nathan Redmond and Chris Wood scored two of the three <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> took Birmingham through to the group stage of the Europa League in the club's first season in European competition for 50 years.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 Independence Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1993 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Indiana jumped {{out to an}} early lead {{courtesy}} of a 75-yard pass from quarterback John Paci. Virginia Tech equalized the score before the first quarter ran out, then took a 14–7 lead with a second-quarter touchdown run by fullback Joe Swarm. Indiana climbed back with two field <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> cut Tech's lead to 14–13. With Indiana in possession of the ball and time running down, it appeared that Indiana would {{have at least one}} more attempt on offense before halftime. Before the Indiana drive could get moving, John Paci fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech and returned 20yards for a touchdown. On Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Indiana returned the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory, setting up a potential field goal by kicker Bill Manolopoulos. During the kick, Virginia Tech defender Jeff Holland broke through the Indiana offensive line and blocked the field goal attempt. Tech's Antonio Banks scooped up the ball and ran 80yards for another touchdown—Virginia Tech's second in less than 40seconds.|$|E
