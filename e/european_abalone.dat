40|$|International audienceVibrio harveyi is {{a marine}} {{bacterial}} pathogen responsible for episodic epidemics generally associated with massive mortalities in many marine organisms, including the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify the portal of entry and the dynamics of infection of V. harveyi in the <b>European</b> <b>abalone.</b> The results indicate that the duration of contact be-tween V. harveyi and the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> influences the mortality rate and precocity. Immediately after contact, the epithelial and mucosal area situated between the gills and the hypobranchial gland was colonized by V. harveyi. Real-time PCR analyses and culture quantification of a green fluorescent protein-tagged strain of V. harveyi in abalone tissues revealed a high density of bacteria adhering to and then penetrating the whole gill-hypobranchial gland tissue after 1 h of contact. V. harveyi was also de-tected in the hemolymph of a significant number of European abalones after 3 h of contact. In conclusion, this article shows that a TaqMan real-time PCR assay is a powerful and useful technique for the detection of a marine pathogen such as V. harveyi in mollusk tissue and for the study of its infection dynamics. Thus, we have revealed that the adhesion and then the penetration of V. harveyi in <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> organs begin in the first hours of contact. We also hypothesize that the portal of entry of V. har-veyi in the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> is the area situated between the gills and the hypobranchial gland...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFood {{sources of}} the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata {{throughout}} its life cycle are still to be clarified in nature. A novel non-destructive method of digital shell color analysis to reveal the diets of <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> (ormer) was developed in this study. The method was calibrated using ormers reared under experimental conditions in North Western Brittany in 2012 and fed a controlled monospecific diet to define the shell hues associated with various macroalgae (i. e., Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and Phaeophyta). General food preferences were established by comparing the shell hue of wild adult ormers and experimental adult ormers. Shell hue corresponds to the color tint in the HSL color space measured on digital pictures of the shell. Experimentally, shell hue values differed according to treatment, with the most yellow-green hue (72 °) for ormers fed Saccharina sp. and the coral hue (25 °) for ormers fed Palmaria palmata. High variation in shell color of wild ormers was observed according to the sampling site and/or ontogeny. The diet of wild ormers {{may be related to}} the abundance of different drifting algae in their respective habitats. Thus, this non-destructive and easy-to-use technique appears to be a promising tool for determining the diet of Haliotis species and, perhaps, other herbivorous mollusks...|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata is of {{economical}} {{importance in}} Europe, and recently in France {{where most of}} the consumed abalones remained wild animals fished on the coast. Recently, the creation of hatcheries allowed the production of cultured animals, and aquaculture is in progress. To optimize selective breeding programs, different studies were performed on adults and on their progenies. First, ten adult families, assumed to be bi-parental and produced in 2007 were analyzed. As these families were developed {{at the beginning of the}} hatchery production, the parentage of the individual necessitated to be tested. The progenies parentage assignment was done by using eight microsatellite DNA loci. In fine, the heritability was estimated from the analysis of variance of seven full-sib families which include from 23 to 27 progenies. Heritability estimate was the higher for length, width and weight (0. 37, 0. 29 and 0. 40 respectively). A high correlation was also shown between these heritable traits which can be useful during animal breeding. Shell color traits were also analyzed, using image treatment procedure. Two traits were selected according to the global color of the shell: red color and hue. The distribution of these traits evidenced a polygenic genetic control of shell color and measure of heritability evidenced a high to medium value for red color (Cr) and Hue(H) (0. 33 and 0. 20 respectively). No correlation was shown between growth and this parameter. In a second time, juveniles families produced in 2010 were studied from parents issued of the first selection. A correlation between size and density at juvenile stage was established but a statistical analysis demonstrated, by using density as co-variable a significant effect of family on size. In these conditions, growth is highly heritable (0. 74). This study is a first step toward the use of genetic markers for selection, but also a step toward the breeding improvement of <b>European</b> <b>abalone.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWild or farmed abalone are {{regularly}} exposed to stressors, such as air exposure and handling. Immune and transcriptional responses {{as well as}} susceptibility to vibriosis of sexually mature or immature <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> acclimated at 16 or 19  °C were determined following handling or air exposure. Hemocyte density and H 2 O 2 production increased while hemocyte viability and phagocytic index decreased following handling. Air exposure induces a decrease of hemocyte density and phagocytic index. Measurement of the expression of genes implicated in general metabolic, immunological and stress responses in gills, foot-muscle and hemocytes by real time q-PCR suggested that both stressors lead to a metabolic rate depression, characterized by a general inhibition of transcription. Finally, following handling a Vibrio harveyi challenge enhances almost 100 % mortality of sexually immature animals at 19  °C while it has been previously demonstrated that only mature are susceptible to vibriosis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince 1998, Haliotis tuberculata mass mortalities {{have been}} {{occurring}} regularly in wild abalone populations in France during their reproductive period and {{in conjunction with}} seawater summer temperature maxima and Vibrio harveyi presence. To confirm the importance of bacterial exposure, temperature and reproductive status on abalone susceptibility, experimental infections via bath exposure were performed using abalone ranging from immature to reproductively mature. Ripe abalone were more susceptible to the bacterium than immature specimens (P< 0. 001), and a difference of only 1 °C in temperature had a highly {{significant impact on the}} mortalities (P< 0. 001). The natural mortalities that were surveyed during summer 2007 confirmed that recent epidemic losses of <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> appeared in conjunction with host reproductive stress, elevated temperatures and presence of the pathogen V. harveyi. In view of the elevation of the mean summer temperatures observed in Brittany and Normandy over the last 25 years, this temperature-dependent vibriosis represents a new case of emerging disease associated with global warming...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ormer, Haliotis tuberculata is {{the only}} <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> species commercially exploited. The {{determination}} of growth and age in the wild is an important tool for fisheries and aquaculture management. However, the ageing technique {{used in the past}} in the field is unreliable. The stable oxygen isotope composition (18 O/ 16 O) of the shell depends on the temperature and oxygen isotope composition of the ambient sea water. The stable oxygen isotope technique, developed to study paleoclimatological changes in shellfish, was applied to three H. tuberculata specimens collected in north-west Brittany. For the specimens collected, the oxygen isotope ratios of the shell reflected the seasonal cycle in the temperature. From winter-to-winter cycles, estimates of the age and the annual growth increment, ranging from 13 to 55 mm per year were obtained. This study shows that stable oxygen isotopes can be a reliable tool for ageing and growth studies of this abalone species in the wild, and for validating other estimates...|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata is a {{delicacy}} {{and consequently}} a commercially valuable gastropod species. Aquaculture production and wild populations {{are subjected to}} multiple climate-associated stressors and anthropogenic pressures, including rising sea-surface temperatures, ocean acidification and an emerging pathogenic Vibrio infection. Transcript expression data provides a valuable resource for understanding abalone responses to variation in the biotic and abiotic environment. To generate an extensive transcriptome, we performed next-generation sequencing of RNA on larvae exposed to temperature and pH variation and on haemolymph of adults from two wild populations after experimental infection with Vibrio harveyi. We obtained more than 1. 5 billion raw paired-end reads, which were assembled into 328, 519 contigs. Filtration and clustering produced a transcriptome of 41, 099 transcripts, of which 10, 626 (25. 85 %) were annotated with Blast hits, and 7380 of these were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms in Blast 2 Go. A differential expression analysis comparing all samples from the two life stages identified 5690 and 10, 759 transcripts with significantly higher expression in larvae and adult haemolymph respectively. This is the greatest sequencing effort yet in the Haliotis genus, and provides the first high-throughput transcriptomic resource for H. tuberculat...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTriclosan (2, 4, 4 '-trichloro- 2 '-hydroxy-diphenyl ether; TCS) is an {{antibacterial}} agent incorporated {{in a wide}} variety of household and personal care products. Because of its partial elimination in sewage treatment plants, TCS is commonly detected in natural waters and sediments. Moreover, due to its high hydrophobicity, TCS accumulates in fatty tissues in various aquatic organisms. TCS can be converted into methyl-triclosan (2, 4, 4 '-trichloro- 2 '-methoxydiphenyl ether; MTCS) after biological methylation. In this study, the acute cytotoxicity of TCS and MTCS in short-term in vitro experiments was assessed on cell cultures from the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata. The results showed that morphology and density of hemocyte are affected from a concentration of 8 μM TCS. Using the XTT reduction assay, TCS has been demonstrated to decrease hemocyte metabolism activity in a dose- and time-dependent exposure. The IC(50) was evaluated at 6 μM for both hemocyte and gill cells after a 24 h-incubation with TCS. A significant cytotoxicity of MTCS was also observed from 4 μM in 24 h-old hemocyte culture. Our results reveal a toxic effect of TCS and MTCS on immune (hemocytes) and/or respiratory cells (gill cells) of the abalone, species living in coastal waters areas and exposed to anthropogenic pollution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Vibrio harveyi {{is known}} to be highly pathogenic for the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata, which is a gastronomically important marine gastropod with a high commercial value. Since 1998, some particular bacterial strains are described as implicated in recurrent mortality outbreaks in French farm and field stocks of abalone. Recently, a 9. 6 kb plasmid named pVCR 1, was shown to be harbored by one highly V. harveyi virulent ORM 4 strain suggesting its involvement in virulence phenotype. Thus, we have developed in the present study two TaqMan real-time PCR assays allowing to (i) rapidly and specifically detect, by a duplex procedure and in less than 2 h, both V. harveyi and the presence of plasmid pVCR 1 from unidentified bacterial colony and to (ii) quantify both V. harveyi and the plasmid pVCR 1 in the hemolymph of abalone or its surrounding seawater. Quantification curves of V. harveyi or ORM 4 strain seeded in hemolymph or artificial sea water samples were equivalent showing excellent qPCR efficacies and detection level as low as 18 V. harveyi cell-equivalent genomic DNA in a PCR reaction well. This qPCR allowed us to monitor V. harveyi ORM 4 strain in experimentally infected H. tuberculata. These diagnosis assays could provide powerful and useful tools to better understand the epidemiology of vibriosis caused by V. harveyi in different cultured marine species including H. tuberculata...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the toxicity of different polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the green algae, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the haemocytes from the <b>European</b> <b>abalone,</b> Haliotis tuberculata. Using the algal growth inhibition test, the green algae median Effective Concentration (EC 50) values ranged from 0. 341 mu M for PCB 28 to more than 100 mu M for PCBs 101 and 153. Considering the MTT viability test, the abalone EC 50 values ranged from 1. 67 mu M for PCB 153 to 89 mu M for PCB 28. Our results in contrast to previous observation in vertebrates did not show significant differences between the dioxin like- and non dioxin like-PCBs toxicities regardless of the model used. However, our results demonstrated that the toxicities of PCBs were species dependent. For example, PCB 28 was the most toxic compound for P. subcapitata whereas PCBs 1, 180 and 153 were less toxic for that species. On the contrary, PCB 153 was reported as the most toxic for H. tuberculata haemocytes and PCB 28 the least toxic. To investigate the mode of action of these compounds, we used an in silico method. Our results suggested that PCBs have a non-specific mode of action (e. g., narcosis) on green algae, and another mode of action, probably more specific than narcosis, was reported for PCBs on the abalone haemocytes.

40|$|The {{decline of}} <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata populations has been {{associated}} with various pathogens including bacteria of the genus Vibrio. Following the summer mortality outbreaks reported in France between 1998 and 2000, Vibrio harveyi strains were isolated from moribund abalones, allowing in vivo and in vitro studies on the interactions between abalone H. tuberculata and V. harveyi. This work reports the development of primary cell cultures from abalone gill tissue, a target tissue for bacterial colonisation, and their use for in vitro study of host cell—V. harveyi interactions. Gill cells originated from four-day-old explant primary cultures were successfully sub-cultured in multi-well plates and maintained in vitro for up to 24 days. Cytological parameters, cell morphology and viability were monitored over time using flow cytometry analysis and semi-quantitative assay (XTT). Then, gill cell cultures were used to investigate in vitro the interactions with V. harveyi. The effects of two bacterial strains were evaluated on gill cells: a pathogenic bacterial strain ORM 4 which is responsible for abalone mortalities and LMG 7890 which is a nonpathogenic strain. Cellular responses of gill cells exposed to increasing concentrations of bacteria were evaluated by measuring mitochondrial activity (XTT assay) and phenoloxidase activity, an enzyme which is strongly involved in immune response. The ability of gill cells to phagocyte GFP-tagged V. harveyi was evaluated by flow cytometry and gill cells-V. harveyi interactions were characterized using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy During phagocytosis process we evidenced that V. harveyi bacteria induced significant changes in gill cells metabolism and immune response. Together, the results showed that primary cell cultures from abalone gills are suitable for in vitro study of host-pathogen interactions, providing complementary assays to in vivo experiments...|$|E
40|$|Since 1997, {{populations of}} the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata suffer mass mortalities {{attributed}} to the bacterium Vibrio harveyi. These mortalities occur at the spawning season, when the abalone immune system is depressed, and when temperatures exceed 17 °C, leading to favorable conditions for V. harveyi proliferation. In order to identify mechanisms of disease resistance, experimental successive infections were carried out on two geographically distinct populations: one that has suffered recurrent mortalities (Saint-Malo) and one {{that has not been}} impacted by the disease (Molène). Furthermore, abalone surviving these two successive bacterial challenges and uninfected abalone were used for several post-infection analyses. The Saint-Malo population was found to be resistant to V. harveyi infection, with a survival rate of 95 % compared to 51 % for Molène. While in vitro quantification of phagocytosis by flow cytometry showed strong inhibition following the first infection, no inhibition of phagocytosis was observed following the second infection for Saint-Malo, suggesting an immune priming effect. Moreover, assays of phagocytosis of GFP-labelled V. harveyi performed two months post-infection show an inhibition of phagocytosis by extracellular products of V. harveyi for uninfected abalone, while no effect was observed for previously infected abalone from Saint-Malo, suggesting that the effects of immune priming may last upwards of two months. Detection of V. harveyi by qPCR showed that a significantly greater number of abalone from the susceptible population were positive for V. harveyi in the gills, indicating that portal of entry effectors {{may play a role in}} resistance to the disease. Collectively, these results suggest a potential synergistic effect of gills and haemolymph in the resistance of H. tuberculata against V. harveyi with an important involvement of the gills, the portal of entry of the bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{spawning}} {{season of the}} most commercially important <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> {Haliotis tuberculata) was evaluated during the summers of 1996, 1997 and 1999. The {{results of the present}} study show that the best time to start with semi-artificial spawning is from mid July using cultured abalone from the open sea in Guernsey, Channel Isles. Until 1996 Tetraselmis sueccica was the main source of food for juvenile H. tuberculata during their rearing stage (one to twelve weeks old) on glass plates. Nevertheless, this study showed that T. sueccica, as a sole food, is not sufficient for successful development and growth of early juvenile abalone. However, marine diatoms such as Skeletonema costatum, Navicula ramosissima and Cylindrotheca closterium were easily ingested and assimilated depending on the size of the animal and conditions of culture. This thesis studied the effect of different diets (mix of fresh seaweed, fishmeal and an abalone commercial) and temperatures (15, 18 and 22 C) on growth and energy budget of juvenile abalone H. tuberculata over a 210 day period. Energy budget was obtained by Ingestion (I), Egestion (E), Somatic growth (Pg), Reproductive investment (Pr), Excretion (U) and Pedal mucus production (M). All these parameters were assessed for grouped and individual organisms. Animals fed on formulated diets (energetically rich) and cultured at 18 and 22 C were shown to give better growth rates than the natural diet and preferentially allocated energy to gonad development. Thus, the combination of diet and temperature were factors that contributed to enhance growth rates and gonad development. The abalone commercial diet (CO) used in this study produced shell deformation in 89 % of the population after four months of feeding juvenile abalone. The information of these studies have important implications when considering the nutritional requirements of cultured abalone when fed on formulated diets, which need to contain not only the energy, but also the necessary micronutients which are required to produce good growth rates and also healthy animals...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demand for}} abalone and sea urchins {{globally}} {{has resulted in}} increased production of these commercially important invertebrates in aquaculture. Transfer of aquaculture technology from established producing countries to Europe {{has resulted in the}} application and implementation of new technologies by farm operators in Ireland. The industry-based research presented in this thesis addresses key industry barriers in invertebrate aquaculture, focusing on production and on-growing methods for the <b>European</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis tuberculata and the commercially important native sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. To resolve knowledge gaps in the production of algivorous invertebrates in Ireland four main issues were investigated: 1 - Industry, market and production constraints for the non-endemic species of abalone H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai were reviewed and evaluated. Findings indicated the current status and direction of the culture of abalone in Europe. 2 - New culture methods were developed for the green encrusting macroalgae Ulvella lens as it is known to increase settlement rates of swimming abalone and sea urchin larvae. Both abalone and sea urchins have similar preferences to settlement cues and the technology for settlement is common to both industries. Ulvella lens has been used and implemented successfully into the abalone industry in producing countries such as Japan and Australia. 3 - Culture methods developed for U. lens were applied to the P. lividus culture with the aim of implementing this developed technology into sea urchin aquaculture in Ireland. Due to the decline of the commercial P. lividus fishery in Ireland, increased interest has developed in the commercial culture of this species. The findings of this industry-based research indicate the need for increased commercial scale research addressing the production constraints that hamper the industry as a whole. 4 - Novel mixed macroalgal-meal diets enriched with bioavailable phosphorus were investigated for increased growth in the diet of H. tuberculata, and compared against Palmaria palmata. Weaning diets for juvenile abalone normally incorporate some form of animal protein, which does not belong in the natural diet of juvenile abalone as they are algivorous by nature. Phosphorus is limiting in the diets of abalone, and may not be available as it is bound in an indigestible form such as phytate...|$|E
