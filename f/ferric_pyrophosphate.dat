40|$|Background: Food iron {{fortification}} {{can be a}} good {{strategy to}} prevent iron deficiency. Iron bioavailability from cocoa powder enriched with <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> encapsulated in liposomes or ferrous fumarate was assessed in rats. Methods: Three groups of rats consumed during 28 days either a control diet or two diets prepared with ferric pyrophosphate- or ferrous fumarate-enriched cocoa powder as the unique source of iron. Body weight and food intake were monitored and last-week feces were collected. On day 28, animals were sacrificed and livers and spleens were removed. Hemoglobin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were determined. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} body weight and food intake. Apparent iron absorption and % absorption/intake were significantly lower in rats consuming enriched cocoa compared to the control group, without significant differences due to the iron form. Enriched cocoa groups showed significantly lower spleen iron content and concentration than the control. Liver iron was lower in the <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> group compared to the other two groups.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{method is}} {{described}} for the presumptive identification of Legionellapneumophila by {{the formation of}} satellite colonies around filter paper discs impregnated with <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> and L-cysteine hydrochloride on a deficient basal medium. This technique simplifies the differentiation of picked colonies of L pneumophila from other organisms in mixed cultures from environmental and contaminated clinical samples. Several culture media {{have been developed for}} the cultivation of L pneumophila and with the addition of antibiotics to produce semiselective media, the isolation of L pneumophila from mixed cultures has been facilitated. ' Until now L pneumophila has been initially identified by colonial appearance, morphology when stained and failure to grow on non-specialised media such as blood agar. 5 A method has now been devised which simplifies the identification of isolates when dealing with large numbers of suspect colonies from mixed cultures.

40|$|Objective: Preventing iron {{deficiency}} {{has been a}} main target of the World Health Organization since 1992. Difficulties to reach dietary recommended iron intakes and to enhance iron absorption should be overcome. We compared in iron-deficient women the bioavailability of iron of three meat pate products enriched with ferrous sulfate, <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> encapsulated in liposomes, or <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> encapsulated in liposomes plus a hemoglobin-based meat pigment. Methods: Seventeen women with low iron stores (ferritin < 30 μg/L) {{took part in a}} three-way, randomized, crossover, double-blind postprandial intervention. Test meals consisted of 80 g of the three different enriched meat pate products, which were spread on two slices of white bread. The pate composition was 13. 5 g of protein/ 100 g, 30 g of fat/ 100 g (49 % monounsaturated fatty acids, 35 % saturated fatty acids, 16 % polyunsaturated fatty acids), 1 g of carbohydrates/ 100 g, and 19 mg of total iron (including 15 mg of iron from the test fortificants). Blood samples were taken at baseline and each hour for 6 h after eating the meal and serum iron was determined. Results: Serum iron concentration evolution during the postprandial study was similar with the three meals, and maximum concentrations were obtained between hours 2 and 4. The effect of type of fortificant was not significant. Conclusion: Consumption of meat pate fortified with <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> encapsulated in liposomes can be part of a dietary strategy for preventing {{iron deficiency}} in humans.

BackgroundSoluble iron salts are toxic for {{parenteral}} administration because free iron catalyzes free radical generation. Pyrophosphate strongly complexes iron and enhances iron transport between transferrin, ferritin, and tissues. Hemodialysis patients need iron to replenish ongoing losses. We evaluated the short-term {{safety and efficacy}} of infusing soluble <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> by dialysate. MethodsMaintenance hemodialysis patients receiving erythropoietin were stabilized on regular doses of intravenous (i. v.) iron dextran after oral iron supplements were discontinued. During the treatment phase, 10 patients received <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> via hemodialysis as monthly dialysate iron concentrations were progressively increased from 2, 4, 8, to 12 μg/dl and were then sustained for two additional months at 12 μg/dl (dialysate iron group); 11 control patients were continued on i. v. iron dextran (i. v. iron group). ResultsHemoglobin, serum iron parameters, and the erythropoietin dose did not change significantly from month 0 to month 6, both within and between the two groups. The weekly dose of i. v. iron (mean±sd) needed to maintain iron balance during month 6 was 56 ± 37 mg in the i. v. iron group compared with 10 ± 23 mg in the dialysate iron group (P = 0. 001). Intravenous iron was required by all 11 patients in the i. v. iron group compared with only 2 of the 10 patients receiving 12 μg/dl dialysate iron. The incidence of adverse effects was similar in both groups.

Organoleptically ferrous fumarate was acceptable when the chocolate drink powder was reconstituted in milk or water that was heated to < 80 °. Unacceptable colour changes occurred, however, when boiling milk or water were used. In human Fe absorption studies when the Fe compounds {{were added to the}} chocolate drink immediately before consumption, ferrous fumarate was 3. 31 % absorbed compared with 2. 82 % for ferrous sulphate and 2. 11 % for <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> When the Fe compounds were processed during the manufacture of the chocolate drink powder, the absorption of ferrous fumarate was 5. 27 %, ferrous sulphate 2. 62 % and <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> 0. 55 %.

40|$|End-stage {{renal disease}} results in anemia caused by {{shortened}} erythrocyte survival, erythropoietin deficiency, hepcidin-mediated impairment of intestinal absorption and iron release, recurrent blood loss, and impaired responsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Iron malabsorption renders oral iron products generally ineffective, and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation {{is required in}} most patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD). IV iron is administered at doses far exceeding normal intestinal iron absorption. Moreover, by bypassing physiologic safeguards, indiscriminate use of IV iron overwhelms transferrin, imposing stress on the reticuloendothelial system that can have long-term adverse consequences.

This work comparatively assessed the bioavailability of two forms of iron, ferrous gluconate or <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> encapsulated in liposomes (lipofer), when used as fortificants in meat pate. Three groups of growing rats consumed during 28 days either a control diet (AIN- 93 G), or two diets prepared with enriched pate as the unique source of iron and fat. Body weight and diet intake were measured weekly, and {{during the last week}} faeces were collected. On day 28 animals were sacrificed, livers and spleens were removed and stored. Haemoglobin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were determined. There were not significant differences among the three groups in body weight and apparent iron absorption, although food intake in the two pate groups was significantly higher compared to the control group. There were not differences in liver and spleen iron content and concentration, neither in haemoglobin and TIBC values. These results indicated that iron bioavailability of pate enriched with ferrous gluconate or <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> encapsulated in liposomes was similar, and thus both sources of iron are good candidates to be used as fortifiers in meat based products. The present outcome needs to be validated in humans. © 2007 SAGE Publications. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

In this study, strain 2 CP-C was also found to grow by coupling Fe(III) reduction to the oxidation of acetate, {{making it one of the}} few isolates capable of growth by both metal reduction and chlororespiration. Doubling times for growth of 9. 2 and 10. 2 h were determined for Fe(III) and 2 -chlorophenol reduction, respectively. These were determined by using the rate of [14 C]acetate uptake into biomass. Fe(III) compounds used by strain 2 CP-C include ferric citrate, <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide. The addition of the humic acid analog anthraquinone 2, 6 -disulfonate (AQDS) increased the reduction rate of amorphous ferric iron oxide, suggesting AQDS was used as an electron shuttle by strain 2 CP-C. The addition of chloramphenicol to fumarate-grown cells did not inhibit Fe(III) reduction, indicating that the latter activity is constitutive. In contrast, the addition of chloramphenicol inhibited dechlorination activity, indicating that chlororespiration is inducible. The presence of insoluble Fe(III) oxyhydroxide did not significantly affect dechlorination, whereas the presence of soluble <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> inhibited dechlorination.

Design: In the first study, young women (n = 98) with an iron status varying from iron deficiency anemia to iron sufficiency (women with serum ferritin concentrations 25 – 40 µg/L were not included) were given stable isotope–labeled test meals (n = 196) containing ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> after which plasma hepcidin and iron bioavailability were measured. In the second study, iron-sufficient men (n = 4) were given 3. 8 - and 60 -mg oral doses of labeled ferrous sulfate. The stable isotope appearance curve was determined, and the plasma hepcidin response was measured over 6 h. Results: In study 1, plasma hepcidin and plasma ferritin were strongly correlated (r = 0. 79, P < 0. 001). Plasma hepcidin significantly, but modestly, predicted iron bioavailability from ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate (r = – 0. 51 and – 0. 46, respectively; P < 0. 0001) but not from <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (r = – 0. 30, P = 0. 056, respectively).

Methods: Iron bound to the 1 – 25 phosphopeptide of β-casein [Fe-β-CPP(1 – 25) ] was compared to an encapsulated <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (Fe-P) in the Caco- 2 model. Ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) was used as control (100 μmol/l iron, n = 6 per group). The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable byproduct of lipid peroxidation, was used as the marker of peroxidation. Results: The lowest MDA levels were observed in cells grown with Fe-β-CPP(1 – 25) and the highest with Fe-P. Iron absorption of Fe-β-CPP(1 – 25) was higher than in the 2 other forms, due to its high cellular uptake and high basolateral transfer, while iron absorption of Fe-P showed high uptake and high cell retention.

In a double blind, 5 -mo, home-based, randomized trial in Brazil, we gave one group of mildly anemic 6 - to 24 -mo-old children (n = 175) rice fortified with micronized <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> using the Ultra Rice technology and a placebo solution (URG) and another group identical nonfortified rice and iron drops. We instructed parents on the correct dosage of iron drops and to feed their children rice as they normally would. We measured serum ferritin (SF) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations at baseline and at 5 mo. At baseline, the prevalences of iron deficiency and anemia in the total sample were 73. 1 and 100 %, respectively. At 5 mo, SF and Hb increased in both groups, although {{the change in the}} URG was larger (P < 0. 01). Adult participants were unable to distinguish cooked fortified rice from unfortified rice in terms of smell, color, or taste. As rice is normally consumed at home, MPF-fortified rice increased iron stores and reduced anemia in a group of mildly anemic children 6 – 24 mo old. In populations where young children are routinely fed ∼ 100 g of cooked rice daily, fortifying it with iron may improve iron status at least as well as providing free iron drops...|$|E
40|$|Particle size is a {{determinant}} of iron (Fe) absorption from poorly soluble Fe compounds. Decreasing the particle size of metallic Fe and <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> added to foods increases Fe absorption. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop and characterize nanoparticles of FePO 4 and determine their bioavailability and potential toxicity in rats. Amorphous FePO 4 nanopowders with spherical structure were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). The nanopowders were characterized and compared with commercially available FePO 4 and FeSO 4, including measurements of specific surface area (SSA), structure by transmission electron microscopy, in vitro solubility at pH 1 and 2, and relative bioavailability value (RBV) to FeSO 4 in rats using the hemoglobin repletion method. In the latter, the potential toxicity after Fe repletion was assessed by histological examination and measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The commercial FePO 4 and the 2 FePO 4 produced by FSP (mean particle sizes, 30. 5 and 10. 7 nm) had the following characteristics: SSA: 32. 6, 68. 6, 194. 7 m 2 /g; in vitro solubility after 30 min at pH 1 : 73, 79, and 85 % of FeSO 4; and RBV: 61, 70, and 96 %, respectively. In the histological examinations and TBARS analysis, there were no indications of toxicity. In conclusion, nanoparticles of FePO 4 have a solubility and RBV not significantly different from FeSO 4. Reducing poorly soluble Fe compounds to nanoscale may increase their value for human nutrition...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} acquire iron {{from various sources}} has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} determinant in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis. Outside the cells, iron is bound to transferrin in serum, or to lactoferrin in mucosal secretions. Meningococci can extract iron from iron-loaded human transferrin by the TbpA/TbpB outer membrane complex. Moreover, N. meningitidis expresses the LbpA/LbpB outer membrane complex, which can extract iron from iron-loaded human lactoferrin. Iron transport through the outer membrane requires energy provided by the ExbB-ExbD-TonB complex. After transportation through the outer membrane, iron is bound by periplasmic protein FbpA and is addressed to the FbpBC inner membrane transporter. Iron-complexing compounds like citrate and pyrophosphate have been shown to support meningococcal growth ex vivo. The use of iron pyrophosphate as an iron source by N. meningitidis was previously described, but has not been investigated. Pyrophosphate was shown to participate in iron transfer from transferrin to ferritin. In this report, we investigated the use of <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> as an iron source by N. meningitidis both ex vivo and in a mouse model. We showed that pyrophosphate was able to sustain N. meningitidis growth when desferal was used as an iron chelator. Addition of a pyrophosphate analogue to bacterial suspension at millimolar concentrations supported N. meningitidis survival in the mouse model. Finally, we show that pyrophosphate enabled TonB-independent ex vivo use of iron-loaded human or bovine transferrin as an iron source by N. meningitidis. Our data suggest that, in addition to acquirin...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} effects of dietary iron (Fe) {{deficiency}} and recovery on bone mineral composition and strength in anemic rats submitted to a hemoglobin (Hb) repletion assay. Weanling male Wistar rats were fed a low-Fe diet (12 mg/kg) for 15 days followed by 2 weeks of Fe repletion with diets providing 35 mg Fe/kg as either ferrous sulfate (n = 8) or <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (FP; n = 12). At final day of each period (depletion and repletion), Fe-adequate animals were also euthanized. Iron status (blood Hb, Hb Fe pool, Hb regeneration efficiency), tibia mineral concentrations (Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, and Zn) and biomechanical properties were evaluated. Iron-deficient rats had lower tibia Fe and Mg levels and bone strength when compared to controls. Yield load and resilience were positively related to tibia Mg levels (r = 0. 47, P = 0. 02 and r = 0. 56, P = 0. 004, respectively). Iron repletion did not recover tibia Mg concentrations impaired by Fe deficiency. Moreover, bone elastic properties were negatively affected by FP consumption. In conclusion, bone mineral composition and strength were affected by Fe deficiency, whereas dietary Fe source influenced tibia Mg and resistance in the period during which rats were recovering from anemia.

40|$|Xylella fastidiosa is the {{etiologic}} agent {{of a wide}} range of plant diseases, including citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), a major threat to citrus industry. The genomes of several strains of this phytopathogen were completely sequenced, enabling large-scale functional studies. DNA microarrays representing 2, 608 (91. 6 %) coding sequences (CDS) of X. fastidiosa CVC strain 9 a 5 c were used to investigate transcript levels during growth with different iron availabilities. When treated with the iron chelator 2, 2 `-dipyridyl, 193 CDS were considered up-regulated and 216 were considered down-regulated. Upon incubation with 100 mu M <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> 218 and 256 CDS were considered up- and down-regulated, respectively. Differential expression for a subset of 44 CDS was further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Several CDS involved with regulatory functions, pathogenicity, and cell structure were modulated under both conditions assayed, suggesting that major changes in cell architecture and metabolism occur when X. fastidiosa cells are exposed to extreme variations in iron concentration. Interestingly, the modulated CDS include those related to colicin V-like bacteriocin synthesis and secretion and to functions of pili/fimbriae. We also investigated the contribution of the ferric uptake regulator Fur to the iron stimulon of X. fastidiosa. The promoter regions of the strain 9 a 5 c genome were screened for putative Fur boxes, and candidates were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that Fur is not solely responsible for the modulation of the iron stimulon of X fastidiosa, and they present novel evidence for iron regulation of pathogenicity determinants...|$|E
40|$|Fe {{absorption}} from water-soluble {{forms of}} Fe is {{inversely proportional to}} Fe status in humans. Whether {{this is true for}} poorly soluble Fe compounds is uncertain. Our objectives were therefore (1) to compare the up-regulation of Fe absorption at low Fe status from ferrous sulphate (FS) and <b>ferric</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (FPP) and (2) to compare the efficacy of FS with FPP in a fortification trial to increase body Fe stores in Fe-deficient children v. Fe-sufficient children. Using stable isotopes in test meals in young women (n 49) selected for low and high Fe status, we compared the absorption of FPP with FS. We analysed data from previous efficacy trials in children (n 258) to determine whether Fe status at baseline predicted response to FS v. FPP as salt fortificants. Plasma ferritin was a strong negative predictor of Fe bioavailability from FS (P < 0 · 0001) but not from FPP. In the efficacy trials, body Fe at baseline was a negative predictor of the change in body Fe for both FPP and FS, but the effect was significantly greater with FS (P < 0 · 01). Because Fe deficiency up-regulates Fe absorption from FS but not from FPP, food fortification with FS may have relatively greater impact in Fe-deficient children. Thus, more soluble Fe compounds not only demonstrate better overall absorption and can be used at lower fortification levels, but they also have the added advantage that, because their absorption is up-regulated in Fe deficiency, they innately ‘target’ Fe-deficient individuals in a populatio...|$|E
