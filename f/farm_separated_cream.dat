40|$|Current {{definitions}} of lotions, gels, creams and ointments {{vary depending on}} literature source, market history or traditional use. This often leads to confusion when deciding which dosage form to prescribe and/or purchase. The existing classification of topical dosage forms needs to be re-examined to ensure that definitions for different dosage forms are based on consistent scientific principles and that dosage forms can be distinguished from one another. The {{purpose of this study}} is to obtain a scientifically based, systematic classification of dosage forms for topical drugs. A variety of prescription and over-the-counter topical products currently marketed as lotions, gels, creams, and ointments are evaluated using different techniques including rheology (viscosity and shear rate versus shear stress), loss on drying (LOD), specific gravity, surface tension, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), water absorption, dilution properties, microscopic evaluation, transmittance of visible light, appearance and composition. Rheology is the most discriminating property <b>separating</b> <b>creams</b> and lotions. Water plus volatiles (as measured by LOD) and composition <b>separate</b> ointments and <b>creams.</b> Composition and thermal behavior separate gels from the other dosage forms. Based on these findings, new definitions and a decision tree are presented to assist in the determination of the appropriate nomenclature for a topical dosage form...|$|R

When former sea captain Erik Adde started marketing the Separadora in Argentina, {{less than one}} percent of the cows were being milked. Cattle was synonymous with meat and hides and Argentina imported dairy products like butter and cheese from Denmark and France. The Swedish inventor spurred the birth of an Argentine dairy industry and the first salted butter to be exported to England was called La Escandinava and was produced by three Swedes. The Addes Pavilion at the La Rural Fairground Exhibition in 1886 also showcased Sandvik steel, paper samples and Eskilstuna knives, and marked the kick-off for Swedish exports to Argentina.

40|$|A new test, {{the water}} agar test, is {{described}} {{that gives a}} qualitative index {{of the presence of}} bacteria that indicate contamination of the cream, poor storage conditions or both of these factors. The method is simple and requires little equipment. The bacteria grow in a film of diluted cream adsorbed on the surface of a non-nutrient base. After incubation at 30 +/- 0 - 5 degrees C. for 18 - 20 hr., a proteolytic and mucoid colony count is obtained which has the same percentage coefficient of variance as a standard plate count. An examination of the effect of storage at different temperatures on the types of bacteria present in cream showed that of all the tests done initially, only the water agar test could predict subsequent bacterial growth with any consistency. The multiplication of presumptive coliform organisms occurred even at 3 - 5 degrees C. Irrespective of the colony count, the methylene blue reduction time was not shorter than 7 1 / 2 hr. unless the bacteria were in the logarithmic phase of growth when sampled. A survey was made of the bacterial flora of 188 retail samples of double cream of 15 different brands. The age of the samples varied from freshly <b>separated</b> <b>cream</b> to cream that had been kept in the shop for a day longer than that recommended for sale. The water agar test was compared with the colony count, the presumptive coliform test, a confirmatory coliform count in violet red-bile agar, a lipolytic colony count, a staphylococcal count and the methylene blue reduction test...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} project, buffalo and cow milk was screened for pesticide residues that belonged to organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids and new chemistry groups. Feed and milk was also analysed for aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) and aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1), respectively. The correlation matrix explained that positive association exists between fat and residues of organochlorine and pyrethroid (Phase I). Considering the results of 1 st phase; pesticide residues exceeding their MRLs in first phase were taken into next 2 nd phase. In 2 nd phase dissipation behavior of pesticide residues in milk after pasteurization, cream separation (cream and skimmed milk) and dissipation of pesticide residues in cream during storage was analysed. Farms were found contaminated with AFM 1, AFB 1 and 22 pesticide residues (belonged to 4 groups of pesticides under study). In AFM 1 contaminated milk samples of dairy farms; out of 50 buffalo milk samples, 34 milk samples exceeded the maximum allowed limit (0. 05 µg L- 1) while 24 cow milk samples exceeded the maximum allowed limit (0. 05 µg L- 1). The pesticide residues of cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, ?-endosulfan and ?HCH exceeded their MRLs in milk and were selected for 2 nd phase. Reduction behavior of pesticides during processing in pesticide fortified milk and milk with naturally secreted pesticide residues was analysed. Processing of milk (pasteurization, cream separation or skimming) reduced the pesticides residues in milk. Skimming has maximum dissipation effect on pesticide residues. Pasteurization and <b>cream</b> separation (in <b>separated</b> <b>cream)</b> has also reduced pesticide residues to some extent. Firstly reduction pattern was observed in pesticide fortified milk. Residues of ?-endosulfan were dissipated maximum by pasteurization in pesticide fortified buffalo (28. 9 %) and cow (23. 6 %) milk. <b>Cream</b> separation (in <b>separated</b> <b>cream)</b> reduces highest residues of ?-endosulfan (8. 24 %) in buffalo cream and in cow cream maximum reduction of ?-endosulfan (7. 17 %) was observed. Fenvalerate residues (98. 22 %) were reduced maximum in buffalo milk and in cow milk highest reduction of cyfluthrin residues (96. 92 %) were found under skimming (in skimmed milk). In farm milk reduction was also studied and noted that residues of ?-endosulfan were dissipated maximum by pasteurization in buffalo (16. 11 %) and cow (11. 59 %) milk. <b>Cream</b> separation (in <b>separated</b> <b>cream)</b> reduces highest residues of cyfluthrin 8. 69 % in buffalo cream while in cow cream maximum reduction of cyfluthrin (5. 59 %) was calculated. The ?HCH residues (96. 78 %) were reduced maximum by skimming in buffalo milk while in cow milk highest reduction of ?-endosulfan residues (98. 46 %) was found. It was studied that storage progression reduced pesticide residues non-significantly in buffalo and cow pesticide fortified and non-fortified cream. Firstly in pesticide fortified cream dissipation of residues during storage was noticed; in buffalo cream maximum reduction in ?HCH (2. 55 %) was observed followed by ?-endosulfan, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin and cyfluthrin while in cow cream highest dissipation was found in fenvalerate (11. 62 %) followed by cyfluthrin, permethrin, ?-endosulfan, ?HCH and deltamethrin during 60 days. Secondly residues dissipation in cream without pesticide fortification during storage was estimated; in buffalo cream the highest pesticide reduction was observed in ?-endosulfan (2. 25 %) followed by permethrin, fenvalerate, deltamethrin, ?HCH and cyfluthrin while in cow cream maximum reduction was observed in permethrin (2. 85 %) followed by ?-endosulfan, ?HCH, cyfluthrin, fenvalerate and deltamethrin. This study summarize that buffalo milk carries more pesticide residues as compared to cow milk due to higher fat content. AFM 1 was observed higher in farms milk having high level of AFB 1 in feed. Skim milk contain minimum pesticide residues as pesticide residues under study in 2 nd phase were lipophilic and were removed maximum with cream...|$|R

50|$|When {{the company}} was first formed it was to make sole and heel cutting knives for the local {{footwear}} industry.

However, by 1903 they made their first internal combustion petrol engines and petrol-paraffin engines, and gradually engine manufacture was to become their main business. However, William Henry Dorman was a prolific inventor and between 1894 and 1914 there are 72 patents to his name, many related to the mechanisation of the manufacture of footwear, but also on diverse topics such as the trouser press, four-wheel-drive motor cars, and a method for <b>separating</b> <b>cream</b> from milk.
