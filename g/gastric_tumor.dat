5000|$|A <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> is a tumor of the stomach. It can be benign or {{malignant}} (gastric cancer).The gastric mucosa {{is composed}} of columnar epithelium arranged with pits known as crypts. There are several types of cells that make up gastric mucosa {{that give rise to}} gastric tumours: adenocarcinomas comprise 90% of these. Gastric tumours are mostly metastatic and are usually detected at a late stage. They occur more commonly in men than women in the 6th decade of life. Risk Factors1. Smoking2. Helicobacter pylori infection.2. Diet low in fruits and vegetables.3. Diet high in salt and nitrates.4. Polyps5. Genetic alterations - p53 mutation, microsatellite instability, E-cadherin gene6.

50|$|Gold nanobeacons {{can be used}} as a {{tool for}} cancer theranostics. Recently, Conde et al. {{developed}} a nanomaterial platform based on gold nanobeacons to detect, target and inhibit the expression of a mutant Kras gene in an in vivo murine gastric cancer model. The conjugation of fluorescently-labeled antisense DNA hairpin oligonucleotides to the surface of gold nanoparticles enables using their localized surface plasmon resonance properties to directly track the delivery to the primary <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> and to lung metastatic sites. The fluorescently labeled nanobeacons reports on the interaction with the target as the fluorescent Cy3 signal is quenched by the gold nanoparticle and only emit light following conjugation to the Kras target owing to reorganization and opening of the nanobeacons, thus increasing the distance between the dye and the quencher. The systemic administration of the anti-Kras nanobeacons resulted in approximately 60% tumor size reduction and a 90% reduction in tumor vascularization. More important, the inhibition of the Kras gene expression in gastric tumors prevents the occurrence of metastasis to lung (80% reduction), increasing mice survival in more than 85%. The developed platform can be easily adjusted to hybridize with any specific target and provide facile diagnosis and treatment for neoplastic diseases.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} 66 adenocarcinomas arising in {{the upper}} gastrointestinal tract for microsatellite instability at eight microsatellite loci to investigate the role of these genetic alterations in the etiology of these tumors. We identified alterations {{in at least one}} locus in 11 / 46 adenocarcinomas of the stomach, in 2 / 15 adenocarcinomas arising in Barrett's esophagus, and in 1 / 5 adenocarcinomas of the duodenum and jejunum. Microsatellite instability in <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> was found in 5 / 22 of intestinal, 1 / 3 of mixed, and 5 / 21 of diffuse type tumors. No relationship to the tumor stage (TNM), age, and survival time of the patients was observed. One patient had two synchronous <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> both exhibiting microsatellite instability at multiple loci. His family history revealed four individuals in the maternal line afflicted with gastric carcinoma in three generations. Our data show that microsatellite instability is a genetic event in 11 to 24 % of tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The observation of microsatellite instability and a familial clustering of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> may suggest a genetic predisposition for a subset of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors,</b> which may be identified by microsatellite analysis...|$|R
40|$|Medical imaging is an {{essential}} part of the diagnostic workup of many gastrointestinal disorders. This paper reviews imaging and endoscopy of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> in dogs and cats and the techniques used. The appearance of the normal as well as the various aspects of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> are described for these different modalities. Plain radiography is widely available but has limited diagnostic value. Contrast radiography has higher sensitivity but is laborious and time-consuming. Ultrasonography (if an adequate acoustic window is available), endosonography and endoscopy are the most appropriate modalities for diagnosing <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors.</b> They are especially useful when obtaining samples for cytologic or histopathologic examination, because the imaging modalities do not always differentiate between infl ammatory or infectious conditions and neoplastic disorders. Hydro-helical CT was found helpful for evaluating the location and local invasive-ness of the lesion. Ultrasonography and endoscopy are useful modalities for taking adequate biopsies...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether {{peppermint oil}} (PO) {{is useful for}} endoscopic diagnosis of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> without magnifying endoscopy. Twenty-six patients diagnosed with <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> were examined. Endoscopic images were recorded by white light (WL) and narrow band imaging (NBI) without magnifying endoscopy. After PO administration, images were recorded again by WL and NBI (PO+WL and PO+NBI). The clarity of tumor margins {{and the effect of}} PO on the clarity of tumor margins were scored. The mean scores for clarity of tumor margins were 3. 6 points in WL, 4 in NBI, 4. 3 in PO+WL, and 4. 3 in PO+NBI. The scores of WL and NBI showed a tendency to rise by PO. The mean scores for the effect of PO on the clarity of tumor margins were 2. 7 in WL and 2. 5 in NBI. Therefore, we conclude that PO is useful for endoscopic diagnosis of the margin of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} (RB) tumor suppressor protein, pRB, {{plays an}} important role in the regulation of mammalian cell cycle. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that pRB also involves in the regulation of apoptosis. In the present study, the degradation of pRB was observed in apoptotic <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> cells treated with a new potent anti-tumor component, tripchlorolide (TC). The inhibition of pRB degradation by a general cysteine protease inhibitor IDAM resulted in the reduction of the apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the survival of the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> cells under the TC treatment was enhanced by an over-expression of exogenous pRB. These results suggest that the pRB degradation of the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> cells under the TC treatment involves in the apoptotic progression. In addition, the same extent of TC-induced pRB-degradation was detected in the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> cells containing a p 53 dominant-negative construct, indicating that this kind of pRB degradation is p 53 -independent. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A 24 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our department because of melena. These symptoms combined with severe anemia prompted us to perform an emergency upper endoscopy, which showed bleeding from an ulcerated 30 [*]mm submucosal <b>tumor</b> in the <b>gastric</b> antrum. A computed tomography scan revealed a homogeneously enhanced mass, and endoscopic ultrasonography identified a well-demarcated mass {{in the third and}} fourth layers of the gastric wall. Because analysis of the possible medical causes remained inconclusive and the risk of rebleeding, laparoscopy-assisted gastric wedge resection was performed after administration of 10 units of red cell concentrate. Histological and immunohistological analysis revealed the tumor to be a <b>gastric</b> glomus <b>tumor.</b> <b>Gastric</b> submucosal <b>tumors</b> remain challenging to diagnose preoperatively as they show a variety of radiologic and clinicopathologic features and are associated with the risk of bleeding upon biopsy, as is indicated in the guidelines for <b>gastric</b> submucosal <b>tumors.</b> <b>Gastric</b> glomus <b>tumors</b> characteristically present with exsanguinating gastrointestinal hemorrhaging that often requires blood transfusion. Additionally, <b>gastric</b> submucosal <b>tumors</b> typically occur in elderly patients; however, this case involved a young patient who was 24 years old.

40|$|<b>Gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumors</b> were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} a low incidence (three percent). Since endoscopic diagnostic procedures have become clinical routine, they are now found more frequently (relative incidence up to 41 percent). In recent years, classifications have been developed that attempt to consider the biological relevance of these tumors. Four types of <b>gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumor</b> may be distinguished: Type 1 <b>gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumor</b> is most common. It is associated with chronic atrophic fundus gastritis, hypergastrinemia and often with pernicious anemia. Usually it is multicentric and smaller than one cm, does not produce any symptoms and has an excellent prognosis. Type 2 <b>gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumor</b> is second in frequency. It has no association with other diseases, is solitary and has no predilection for a particular localization. It may be larger than 1 cm, produce a carcinoid syndrome or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and have a metastasis rate of up to 30 percent. Type 3 <b>gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumor</b> is rare and always associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. It occurs as multiple lesions in the gastric body fundus and has a lower metastatic rate than type 2 <b>gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumor.</b> Type 4 <b>gastric</b> neuroendocrine <b>tumor</b> corresponds to a small-cell carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Forty <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> were {{investigated}} for microsatellite instability at the D 2 S 119 and L-myc loci. These tumors and 143 other gastrointestinal cancers were previously analyzed for instability at several different microsatellites. By evaluating previous and present results, repeated sequences were selected that frequently underwent replication errors (RERs). To coamplify these sequences, the following multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed: 1) D 2 S 119 /L-myc/D 18 S 59; 2) D 2 S 119 /L-myc/D 3 S 1076; and 3) D 2 S 177 /L-myc/BAT-RII. Therefore, the 40 <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> {{in the present}} survey were rescreened using multiplex PCRs. Each multiplex allowed detection of nearly all RER+ tumors (80 % for multiplex 3 and 87 % for multiplexes 1 and 2) that had been previously identified by amplifying 9 different loci with independent reactions. Moreover, for multiplexes 1 and 2, the size differences between normal and RER alleles were sufficient to be detected by electrophoresis on conventional polyacrylamide gels after DNA staining with ethidium bromide. This approach allows a rapid and easy assessment of RER phenotype in <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Patients with <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> {{are known}} to have {{deterioration}} in quality of life (QOL) following surgery. However, there is no valid disease-specific self-report QOL measure for clinical practice and research designated for Chinese in Hong Kong. The current study aimed at translating and validating a Chinese version of the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (C-GIQLI) for use in patients with gastric tumors after gastrectomy. Methods: A translation of the English version of the instrument was performed. The psychometric properties of the C-GIQLI were investigated using internal consistency analysis, correlational analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis in 140 Chinese patients who had undergone surgery for <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor.</b> Results: The C-GIQLI demonstrated good test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and a factor structure consistent with the measurement model of the European version of the instrument.

40|$|Adenocarcinoma is {{the most}} common {{histological}} type of <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor.</b> <b>Gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> arising from collision of an adenocarcinoma with a neuroendocrine carcinoma is extremely rare. Moreover, this uncommon gastric collision tumor in our case had prolapsed into the duodenum. A 77 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of vomiting and severe weight loss. Abdominal X-ray showed gastric distension, and computed tomography revealed a duodenal giant mass spreading from the bulb to the horizontal part of the duodenum. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was not helpful in confirming the diagnosis of the tumor. We suspected duodenal malignant tumor and performed laparotomy. The operative findings indicated that the gastric antrum was deeply invaginated into the duodenum because of the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor.</b> Partial resection of the stomach and duodenum was performed because the tumor was irreducible. Intraoperative diagnosis of the frozen section was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. Additional distal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed.

40|$|Background: Of all <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors,</b> {{less than}} 5 % are benign. The {{traditional}} treatment of symptomatic and some asymptomatic benign tumors has ranged from mucosal resection to limited gastrectomy. Since {{the advent of}} laparoscopy, many different laparoscopic approaches to resection of benign <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> have now been described in the literature. Methods: We reviewed our experience with laparoscopic approaches to surgical resection of 7 benign <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors.</b> The tumor locations were the body (posterior wall), 3 cases; body (anterior wall), 1 case; lesser curvature, 1 case; fundus, 1 case, and antrum, 1 case. Laparoscopic wedge resection was done in 6 cases. The seventh patient underwent a Billroth I procedure because he had leiomyoma at the antrum. There was no conversion to laparotomy. Results: The mean operative time was 105 � 15 minutes, and mean blood loss was 50 � 15 mL. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days. There were no complications or mortalities. Tumor size ranged from 2 cm to 6 cm in the greatest diameter. There has been no tumor recurrence with a mean follow-up of 26 months. Discussion: Laparoscopic approach is slowly carving a niche for itself {{in the treatment of}} benign tumors of the stomach. The basic principles are obtaining a precise preoperative pathological diagnosis; accurate tumor localization; achievement of tumor-free margins; avoidance of spillage of stomach contents, careful dissection of tumors in the esophagogastric junction, and preventing tumor seeding.

30|$|The case {{involved}} a 60 -year-old man, with a past history of RCC (clear cell type, G 2, T 1 b N 0 M 0 Stage I) treated by a right nephrectomy. Three {{years after the}} nephrectomy, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion in the greater curvature of the gastric body. The <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> was pathologically {{proven to be a}} metastasis from RCC. Furthermore, computed tomography incidentally revealed a mass lesion in the fundus of the gallbladder, which was also diagnosed as a potential metastasis from RCC. As endoscopic ultrasonography of the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> suggested the tumor potentially invaded to the submucosal layer, gastric wedge resection via a laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) technique was applied to the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor,</b> and laparoscopic cholecystectomy to the gallbladder tumor was simultaneously performed. Histological examination confirmed that the tumors of the stomach and gallbladder were both metastatic RCC. The hospitalization period after surgery was not eventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Thereafter, the patient required examination every 3 [*]months, did not use anticancer agents, and has survived without relapse to 9 [*]months after the surgery.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Ran binding protein M (RanBPM) is a ubiquitous, nucleocytoplasmic {{protein that}} serves as a {{scaffolding}} molecule. This study aimed to investigate the role of RanBPM in gastric cancer. Materials and Methods: RanBPM expression in human gastric cancer tissue samples was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The effect of RanBPM on cellular functions was examined in RanBPM-knockdown gastric cells and with in vitro cell functional assays. Results: <b>Gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> with distant metastases expressed lower levels of RanBPM transcripts compared to tumours without detectable metastases (p= 0. 036). RanBPM knockdown in gastric cancer cells reduced adhesion and promoted survival of gastric cancer cells after exposure to methotrexate and fluorouracil. Conclusion: RanBPM levels were reduced in <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> with distant metastases. This suggests that loss of RanBPM expression may {{play an important role in}} <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tumor</b> development and metastasis. Reduced RanBPM expression is also associated with chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|The causal {{role of the}} {{hedgehog}} pathway {{in cancer}} has been best documented in basal cell carcinoma of the skin. To assess potential DNA alterations of the hedgehog pathway in gastric cancer, we sequenced SMO and PTCH 1 genes {{in a set of}} 39 <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors.</b> Tumors were classified by histology based on the Lauren classification and Sanger sequencing was performed to obtain full length coding sequences. Genomic instability was evident in these tumors as a number of silent or missense mutations were found. In addition to those that are potential germline polymorphisms, we found three SMO missense mutations, and one PTCH 1 frameshift mutation that are novel and have not been documented in basal cell carcinoma. Mutations were found in both intestinal and diffuse type <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> as well as in tumors that exhibit both intestinal and diffuse features. mRNA expression of hedgehog pathway genes was also examined and their levels do not indicate unequivocal higher pathway activity in tumors with mutations than those without.

40|$|Background. In recent studies, {{aberrant}} expression of various microRNAs (miRNAs) {{is reported to}} be associated with gastric cancer metastasis. Method. Overexpression construct and inhibitor of hsa-miR- 376 c- 3 p were expressed in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC- 7901. The expression level of tumor related genes was detected by qPCR, western blot, and immunostaining. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Xenograft of SGC- 7901 cells was used to elucidate the function of hsa-miR- 376 c- 3 p in <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> growth in vivo. Result. Expression of hsa-miR- 376 c- 3 p was detected in SGC- 7901 cells. Downregulation of hsa-miR- 376 c- 3 p increased the expression level of BCL- 2 and decreased the expression of smad 4 and BAD. On the contrary, overexpression of hsa-miR- 376 c- 3 p increased the expression of BAD and smad 4, while it led to the decreasing expression level of BCL- 2. Overexpression of hsa-miR- 376 c- 3 p also promoted cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibited <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> growth in vivo. Furthermore, the expression of BCL- 2 was higher and expression of smad 4 and BAD was lower in tumor tissue than the tissue adjacent to tumor from gastric cancer patients. Conclusion.

40|$|SIRT 3 {{is a key}} NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase in the {{mitochondria}} of mammalian cells, functioning {{to prevent}} cell aging and transformation via regulation of mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis. However, SIRT 3 is also found to express in some human tumors; its role in these SIRT 3 -expressing tumor cells needs to be elucidated. This study demonstrated that the expression of SIRT 3 was elevated {{in a group of}} gastric cancer cells compared to normal gastric epithelial cells. Although SIRT 3 expression levels were increased in the <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissues, SIRT 3 positive cancer cells were more frequently detected in the intestinal type gastric cancers than the diffuse type gastric cancers, indicating that SIRT 3 is linked with subtypes of gastric cancer. Overexpression of SIRT 3 promoted cell proliferation and enhanced ATP generation, glucose uptake, glycogen formation, MnSOD activity and lactate production, which were inhibited by SIRT 3 knockdown, indicating that SIRT 3 plays a role in reprogramming the bioenergetics in <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> cells. Further analysis revealed that SIRT 3 interacted with and deacetylated the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key protein in regulating anaerobic glycolysis, enhancing LDHA activity. In consistence, a cluster of glycolysis-associated genes was upregulated in the SIRT 3 -overexpressing <b>gastric</b> <b>tumor</b> cells. Thus, in addition to the well-documented SIRT 3 -mediated mitochondrial homeostasis in normal cells, SIRT 3 may enhance glycolysis and cell proliferation in SIRT 3 -expressing cancer cells...|$|E

If the disease is recognized, the prognosis is good because antibiotic treatment is very effective.

40|$|<b>Gastric</b> nonepithelial <b>tumors</b> of {{clinical}} significance are infrequently encountered. These tumors make {{up less than}} 3 percent of all <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> and are predominantly composed of growths that derive from the gastric smooth muscle. The malignant nature of those leiomyomatous tumors encountered might be obvious by virtue of liver or peritoneal spread or organ invasion {{at the time of}} surgery. When this is not the case, a high frequency of mitotic figures and cell necrosis on histologic analysis, while not without exception, correlates best with malignant potential...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{application}} of adenoviral vectors (AdV) in gastric cancer gene therapy would {{be improved by}} increases in the specificity of transduction. Previously, we found that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was expressed on <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> but not on gastric epithelium. In this study, we evaluated doubly-ablated AdV lacking native binding ability together with bispecific single-chain antibodies targeted toward EpCAM for gene therapy of gastric cancer. Specific binding to EpCAM augmented the gene transfer efficiency of doubly-ablated AdV on gastric cancer cell lines up to 144 -fold, reaching levels similar to or exceeding those achieved with native AdV. In contrast, EpCAM-targeted doubly- ablated AdV-mediated gene transfer into an EpCAM-negative cell line was reduced 38 -fold compared with transduction by native AdV. Most importantly, EpCAM-targeted doubly-ablated AdV showed selectivity for primary human <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors</b> versus the surrounding nonneoplastic gastric mucosa of the same patients and normal liver tissue samples. Targeting these doubly- ablated AdV toward EpCAM resulted in similar transduction efficiency as obtained with native AdV for EpCAM-expressing primary human <b>gastric</b> <b>tumors,</b> whereas transduction of gastric epithelium and liver tissue was reduced at least 10 -fold. This study thus indicates that {{application of}} EpCAM-targeted doubly-ablated AdV for gastric cancer gene therapy results in a favorable tumor-over-normal tissue transduction rati...|$|R
