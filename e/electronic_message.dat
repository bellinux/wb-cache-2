Many of today's <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> systems have their own distinct merits and peculiarities. Pervasive messaging will have to shield the user from these differences. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy for <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> systems, providing a uniform way to analyze, compare, and discuss <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> systems. With this taxonomy, we analyze the current practice, demonstrating its shortfalls. To overcome these shortfalls, we introduce a novel messaging model: The Unified Messaging System.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{social and}} nonsocial uses of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> systems, their determinants, and their impacts on direction of communication, perceived quality of work, and decision-making. A {{survey was conducted}} in 1992 in the headquarters of a large, geographically dispersed telecommunications company in Maryland which used an in-house electronic mail system. The findings showed that <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> were not widely used for socioemotional purposes but were certainly more common among certain groups. Messages pertaining to socioemotional content were generally avoided in downward and diagonal communication. Younger employees {{who had worked for}} the organiza-tion for a shorter period of time and were holding lower level jobs were more likely to communicate socioemotional content via <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> These people were less often involved in the decision-making process and felt they did not make effective decisions. However, socioemotional use was positively related to perceived quality of work. Consistent with previous studies, upper managers tended to use <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> for routine tasks. When time pressure was involved, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> would be used for complex tasks. Studies have shown a considerable amount of socioemotional con-tent in text-based, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> (Hiemstra, 1982; Phillips, 1983; Rice & Love, 1987; Steinfield, 1986 a) regardless of their imper-sonal nature claimed by many researchers (Daft & Lengel, 1984...|$|R

A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, <b>electronic</b> <b>message</b> center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> is associated with high care quality for diabetes and lower outpatient utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> over a 15 -month period between 1 January 2004 and 31 March 2005. The study was set at Group Health Cooperative—a consumer-governed, nonprofit health care system that operates in Washington and Idaho. Participants included all patients aged � 18 years with a diagnosis of diabetes. In addition to usual care, all patients had the option to use <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> to communicate with their care providers. The primary outcome measures were diabetes-related quality-of-care indicators (A 1 C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol) and outpatient visits (primary care, specialty care, and emergency). RESULTS — Nineteen percent of patients with diabetes used <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> to communicate with their care providers {{during the study period}} (n � 2, 924) (overall study cohort: 15, 427 subjects). In multivariate models, frequent use of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> was associated with A 1 C � 7 % (relative risk [RR] 1. 36 [95 % CI 1. 16 – 1. 58]). Contrary to our hypothesis, frequent use of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> was also associated with a higher rate of outpatient visit...|$|R

40|$|Introduction  Research {{suggests}} that <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> can improve patient engagement. Studies {{indicate that a}} ‘digital divide’ may exist, where certain patient populations may be using <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> less frequently. This study aims to determine which patient characteristics are associated with different levels of usage of an <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> system in a diverse urban population. Methods  Cross-sectional electronic health record data were extracted for patients 10 {{years of age or}} older who live in New York City and who visited a set of clinics between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2012. Regression analyses determined which participant characteristics were associated with the sending of <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> Results  Older, female, English-speaking participants of white race who received more messages, had any diagnoses, more office visits and a provider who sent messages were more likely to send more messages. Non-Millennial, non-white participants who received fewer messages, had more office visits, any diagnoses, a provider who saw fewer patients with patient portal accounts, lived in a low socioeconomic status neighbourhood, and did not have private insurance were more likely to send zero messages. Conclusion  This study found significant differences in <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> usage based on demographic, socioeconomic and health-related patient characteristics. Future studies are needed to support these results and determine the causes of observed associations. </p...|$|R
