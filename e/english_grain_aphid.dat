40|$|Biotransformation of mycotoxins {{in animals}} {{comprises}} phase I and phase II metabolisation reactions. For the trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON), several phase II biotransformation reactions {{have been described}} resulting in DON-glutathiones, DON-glucuronides and DON-sulfates made by glutathione-S-transferases, uridine-diphosphoglucuronyl transferases and sulfotransferases, respectively. These metabolites can be easily excreted and are less toxic than their free compounds. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} in the animal kingdom the conversion of DON to DON- 3 -glucoside (DON- 3 G) via a model system with plant pathogenic aphids. This phase II biotransformation mechanism has only been reported in plants. As the DON- 3 G metabolite was less toxic for aphids than DON, this conversion is considered a detoxification reaction. Remarkably, <b>English</b> <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> (Sitobion avenae) which cooccur with the DON producer Fusarium graminearum on wheat during the development of fusarium symptoms, tolerate DON much better and convert DON to DON- 3 G more efficiently than pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), the latter being known to feed on legumes which are no host for F. graminearum.

40|$|The use of {{intercropping}} as {{a strategy}} for increasing biodiversity in fields {{has the potential to}} reduce pest damage and improve the crop production. Here, a study was undertaken to evaluate the role of different wheat-pea intercropping patterns in conserving arthropod natural enemies and suppressing cereal aphids in agroecosystems. Wheat-pea intercropping in an 8 - 2 row pattern of wheat and pea, respectively, preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of wheat. The highest abundance of ladybeetles in 2008 and 2009 occurred in the 8 - 2 row pattern, whereas the highest densities of aphid parasitoids were found in the 4 - 2 row pattern in 2008 and the 8 - 2 row pattern in 2009. The distribution of aphid populations in the peak stage was spatially heterogeneous, and the highest density of aphids was shown visually in wheat monoculture fields. The land equivalent ratio of 1. 121 : 1. 187 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2008 and 1. 114 : 1. 174 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2009 showed that intercropping of wheat and pea has potential to improve the utilization of plant growth resources as compared to sole crops.

40|$|Background: The {{sesquiterpene}} (E) -ß-farnesene is {{the main}} component of the alarm pheromone system of various aphid species studied to date, including the <b>English</b> <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae. Aphid natural enemies, such as the marmalade hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus and the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, eavesdrop on aphid chemical communication and utilize (E) -ß-farnesene as a kairomone to localize their immediate or offspring preys. These aphidpredator systems are important models to study how the olfactory systems of distant insect taxa process the same chemical signal. We postulated that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception, have conserved regions involved in binding (E) -ß-farnesene. Methodology: We cloned OBP genes from the <b>English</b> <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and two major predators of this aphid species. We then expressed these proteins and compare their binding affinities to the alarm pheromone/kairomone. By using a fluorescence reporter, we tested binding of (E) -ß-farnesene and other electrophysiologically and behaviorally active compounds, including a green leaf volatile attractant. Conclusion: We found that OBPs from disparate taxa of aphids and their predators are highly conserved proteins, with apparently no orthologue genes in other insect species.

The McAb was selected by screening hybridoma lines for antibodies that bound with the semi-digested aphid proteins in ladybirds. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using ClonotypingTM System/HRP showed that it belonged to the IgG 2 a isotype.

40|$|Insects {{are often}} {{infected}} with facultative endosymbiotic bacteria, which {{can have a}} range of important ecological effects. The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, harbours diverse facultative symbionts, which suggests their importance in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> biology. This thesis attempts to explain the ecological roles of the facultative endosymbionts in S. avenae. It also examines {{the question of whether the}} horizontal transmission of symbionts between aphid clones and species can be important for shaping the ecology and evolution of multi-species aphid communities. Novel techniques developed for research with the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> study system are presented. <b>Grain</b> <b>aphid</b> clones vary in their tolerance to low temperatures, but this trait is not affected by their facultative endosymbionts. Strains of a symbiont Hamiltonella defensa do not protect <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> from hymenopterous parasitoids, regardless of the host genotype. However, experienced parasitoid females preferentially oviposit in aphids which do not harbour symbionts. Comparison of the fitness consequences of infection with the same Hamiltonella strains in their original and in novel <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones reveal no consistent differences. Symbiont strains establish easily following artificial transfer between clones of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> but the symbionts transferred from other aphid species form less stable infections. Hamiltonella strains do not affect the fecundity of their <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones regardless of their host species of origin, but also do not generally confer protection against parasitoids. There are no clear patterns in the distribution of parasitoid-resistant phenotypes across phylogenetic trees of Hamiltonella and its bacteriophage APSE. Strains of four unrelated species of endosymbionts, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Rickettsiella and Regiella, confer the same pathogen-resistant phenotype to a single pea aphid clone. The same symbiont strains can confer resistance to clones of two different aphid species. Some strains in multiple infections may compensate for the costs of infections with other symbionts. The importance of these results for understanding the ecological and evolutionary role of facultative endosymbionts in aphids and other insects are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed.

40|$|Background: The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest {{which causes}} significant yield losses of wheat in China, Europe and North America annually. Transcriptome profiling of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> alimentary canal after feeding on wheat plants could provide comprehensive gene expression information involved in feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, selection of aphid-specific RNAi target genes would be essential for utilizing a plant-mediated RNAi strategy to control aphids via a non-toxic mode of action. However, due to the tiny size of the alimentary canal and lack of genomic information on <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> as a whole, selection of the RNAi targets is a challenging task {{that as far as}} we are aware, has never been documented previously. Results: In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analyses of the alimentary canals of <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> before and after feeding on wheat plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The transcriptome profiling generated 30, 427 unigenes with an average length of 664 bp. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomes of alimentary canals of pre- and post feeding <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> indicated that 5490 unigenes were differentially expressed, among which, diverse genes and/or pathways were identified and annotated. Based on the RPKM values of these unigenes, 16 of them that were significantly up or down-regulated upon feeding were selected for dsRNA artificial feeding assay. Of these, 5 unigenes led to higher mortality and developmental stunting in an artificial feeding assay due to the down-regulation of the target gene expression. Finally, by adding fluorescently labelled dsRNA into the artificial diet, the spread of fluorescence signal in the whole body tissues of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> was observed. Conclusions: Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of the alimentary canals of pre- and post-feeding <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> on wheat plants provided comprehensive gene expression information that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, five novel and effective potential RNAi target genes were identified in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> for the first time.

40|$|Wing {{dimorphism}} in aphids can {{be affected}} by multiple cues, including both biotic (nutrition, crowding, interspecific interactions, the presence of natural enemies, maternal and transgenerational effects, and alarm pheromone) and abiotic factors (temperature, humidity, and photoperiod). The majority of the phloem-feeding aphids carry Buchnera, an obligate symbiotic proteobacteria. Buchnera has a highly reduced genome size, but encode key enzymes in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway and is crucial for nutritional balance, development and reproduction in aphids. In this study, we investigated the impact of two nutritional-based biotic factors, symbionts and starvation, on the wing dimorphism in the <b>English</b> <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, a devastating insect pest of cereal crops (e. g., wheat) worldwide. Elimination of Buchnera using the antibiotic rifampicin significantly reduced the formation of winged morphs, body mass and fecundity in S. avenae.

Considerable variation was shown in insect performance among and within different wheat collections, with reduced susceptibility in a number of varieties, but phenotyping did not identify strong resistance to aphids or wheat bulb fly. Field trials showed within collection differences in aphid performance, with fewer aphids populating lines from the Watkins collection. This differs from development data in laboratory bioassays and suggests that there is a pre-alighting cue deterring aphid settlement and demonstrates differences in aphid preference and performance on older plants in the field compared with seedlings in the laboratory, highlighting the need for phenotyping for aphid resistance at different plant growth stages. No association was identified between performance of the different insect species on individual varieties, potentially suggesting different nutritional requirements or resistance mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|<b>English</b> <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (EGA, Sitobion avenae Fabricius) is an {{important}} pest in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To develop EGA-resistant varieties, introducing the desirable genes from related species is regarded as an efficient avenue. In this study, the F 1, F 2 and F 3 plants derived from the cross of EGA-susceptible wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo amphiploid (PHW-SA, AABBDDNsNs) and EGA-resistant triticale (Zhongsi 828, AABBRR) were analyzed for EGA resistance. Consequently, PHW-SA was moderately susceptible while Zhongsi 828 and their F 1 hybrids were immune, suggesting that the resistance is dominant. All the F 2 plants showed high resistance or immunity over two years, indicating that EGA resistance genes are more likely carried by the rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosomes rather than the genomes A or B of Zhongsi 828. In the F 3 generation, 25 of 239 lines became susceptible. Giemsa C-banding patterns revealed that these F 3 lines had 38 - 40 chromosomes, including complete rye genome except 5 R (and 2 R in five lines). Genomic in situ hybridization analysis confirmed this result. During meiosis, all the chromosomes formed bivalents. Six bivalents in 20 lines and five bivalents in five lines were characterized from rye. In contrast, their F 2 parental lines had 42 chromosomes (21 bivalents), containing 1 R- 7 R of rye. No P. huashanica chromosomes were detected. Therefore, we propose that the rye chromosome 5 R {{may be related to}} EGA resistance...|$|E
40|$|Aphids feed on plant phloem sap, rich in sugars {{but poor}} in {{essential}} amino acids. However, sugars cause osmotic regulation problems for aphids, which they overcome by hydrolysing the sugars in their gut and polymerising the hydrolysis products into oligosaccharides, excreted with honeydew. Aphids harbour primary bacterial endosymbionts, which supply them with {{essential amino acids}} necessary for survival. They also harbour secondary (facultative) endosymbionts (sfS), {{some of which have}} a positive impact on life history traits, although it is not yet known whether they also play a role in providing effective tolerance to differing levels of water soluble carbohydrates (WSCs). We investigated the relationship between WSC content of cocksfoot cultivars and performance of clones of the <b>English</b> <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Sitobion avenae F. We evaluated how clone genotype and their sfS modulate performance on these different cultivars. We therefore examined the performance of genetically defined clones of S. avenae, collected from different host plants, harbouring different sfS. The performance was tested on 10 Dactylis glomerata L. cultivars with varying WSC content. D. glomerata is known as a wild host plant for S. avenae and is also commercially planted. We found that high WSCs levels are responsible for the resistance of D. glomerata cultivars to specific S. avenae clones. The minimum level of WSCs conferring resistance to D. glomerata cultivars was 1. 7 % dw. Cultivars with a WSC content of 2. 2 % or higher were resistant to S. avenae and did not allow reproduction. Our results further indicate that sfS modulate to some extend host plant cultivar adaptation in S. avenae. This is the first study revealing the importance of WSCs for aphid performance. Cocksfoot cultivars with a high content of WSCs might be therefore considered for aphid control or used for resistance breeding in this and other grass species, including cereals...|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{has been}} widely used in functional genomics of insects and received intensive attention {{in the development of}} RNAi-based plants for insect control. Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle protein (USP) play important roles in molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction of insects. EcR and USP orthologs and their function in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) have not been documented yet. Here, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, dsRNA feeding assay and aphid bioassay were employed to isolate EcR and USP orthologs in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> investigate their expression patterns, and evaluate the effect of RNAi on aphid survival and fecundity, and its persistence. The results indicated that SaEcR and SaUSP exhibited similar expression profiles at different developmental stages. Oral administration of dsRNAs of SaEcR and dsSaUSP significantly decreased the survival of aphids due to the down-regulation of these two genes, respectively. The silencing effect was persistent and transgenerational, as demonstrated by the reduced survival and fecundity due to knock-down of SaEcR and SaUSP in both the surviving aphids and their offspring, even after switching to aphid-susceptible wheat plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SaEcR and SaUSP are essential genes in aphid growth and development, and could be used as RNAi targets for wheat aphid control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{expression}} patterns of superoxide dismutase genes (sod 2, sod 3. 4, sod 9 and sodB) in seedling leaves of the Zea mays L. Tasty Sweet (susceptible) and Ambrozja (relatively resistant) cultivars infested with one of two hemipteran species, namely monophagous Sitobion avenae F. (<b>grain</b> <b>aphid)</b> or oligophagous Rhopalosiphum padi L. (bird cherry-oat aphid). Secondarily, aphid-elicited alternations in the antioxidative capacity towards DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical in insect-stressed plants were evaluated. Comprehensive comparison of expression profiles of the four sod genes showed that both insect species evoked significant upregulation of three genes sod 2, sod 3. 4 and sod 9). However, aphid infestation affected non-significant fluctuations in expression of sodB gene in seedlings of both maize genotypes. The highest levels of transcript accumulation occurred at 8 h (sod 2 and sod 3. 4) or 24 h (sod 9) post-infestation, and aphid-induced changes in the expression of sod genes were more dramatic in the Ambrozja cultivar than in the Tasty Sweet variety. Furthermore, bird cherry-oat aphid colonization had a more substantial impact on levels of DPPH radical scavenging activity in infested host seedlings than <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> colonization. Additionally, Ambrozja plants infested by either hemipteran species showed markedly lower antioxidative capacity compared with attacked Tasty Sweet plants...|$|R
