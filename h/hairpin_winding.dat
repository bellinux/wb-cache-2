Potential simple modifications of the winding configurations and cooling system are studied: (a) flat wire (<b>hairpin)</b> <b>winding</b> vs stranded round wire, (b) material grades effect - copper vs aluminum, (c) cooling systems - water jacket vs spray, fluid properties and flow rate...|$|E

Along Råheimsdalen and Eldalen to the Gaularfjellet mountains, {{you will see a}} marvellous waterfall landscape that has been landscaped with paths for visitors. From the top of Gaularfjell mountains, <b>hairpin</b> bends <b>wind</b> down to the Vetlefjorden, an arm of the Sognefjorden. The breathtaking contrasts of steep mountainsides, winding roads, and waterfalls are characteristic of Western Norway’s exceptional scenery.|$|R

2500|$|The track, [...] long, is winding and has {{remained}} largely unchanged. The first curve is the station hairpin. After {{that the road}} climbs on the Avenue Léon Say, alongside the stone viaduct that carries the Boulevard de Pyrenées, to Pont Oscar. A tunnel {{is followed by the}} narrow hairpin at the Louis Barthou high school that leads the track into the demanding Parc Beaumont section {{at the top of the}} town. After the Casino garden and another <b>hairpin,</b> the track <b>winds</b> back to the start along the Avenue Lacoste.|$|R
