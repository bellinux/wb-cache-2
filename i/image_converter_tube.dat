50|$|Other <b>Image</b> <b>Converter</b> <b>tube</b> based systems {{emerged in}} the 1950s which {{incorporated}} a modified GenI image intensifier with additional deflector plates which allowed a photon image to be converted to a photoelectron beam. The image, while in this photoelectron state, could be shuttered on and off as short as a few nanoseconds, and deflected to {{different areas of the}} large 70 and 90 mm diameter phosphor screens to produce sequences of up to 20+ frames. In the early 1970s these camera attained speeds up to 600 million frame/s, with 1 ns exposure times, with up to 15 frames per event. As they were analog devices there were no digital limitations on data rates and pixel transfer rates. However, image resolution was quite limited, due to the inherent repulsion of electrons and the grain of the phosphor screen. Resolutions of 10 lp/mm were typical. Also, the images were inherently monochrome, as wavelength information is lost in the photon-electron-photon conversion process. There was also a fairly steep trade-off between resolution and number of images. All images needed to fall on the output phosphor screen. Therefore, a four image sequence would mean each image occupies one fourth of the screen; a nine image sequence has each image occupying one ninth, etc. Images were projected and held on the tube's phosphor screen for several milliseconds, long enough to be optically, and later fiber optically, coupled to film for image capture. Cameras of this design were made by Hadland Photonics Limited and Cordin Company. This technology remained state of the art until the mid-1990s when the availability of CCD image capture enabled instant results in digital format.|$|E

The method employs a mode-locked laser transmitter and utilizes an <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>tube</b> equipped with deflection plates in measuring the time of flight of the laser pulse to a distant retroreflector and back. Samples of the outgoing and returning light pulses are focussed on the photocathode of the <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>tube,</b> whose deflection plates are driven by a high-voltage 120 MHz sine wave derived from a very stable oscillator. From the relative positions of the images produced at the output phosphor by the two light pulses, {{it is possible to}} make a precise determination of the fractional amount by which the time of flight exceeds some large integral multiple of the period of the deflection sinusoid...|$|E

40|$|Many <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>tubes</b> exhibit {{decreasing}} resolution with decreasing exposure time, {{when they}} are used for the observation of high-speed phenomena.

During investigations into the performance of the image section of an image orthicon as a high speed shutter, [ [...] . ] these effects have been observed and a quantitative description has been developed. The results of such a calculation are helpful in distinguishing whether the loss of resolution is caused by the tube alone or by other factors, for example the incorrect shape of the shutter pulse...|$|R

Furthermore, as the system scanned the target, the motion of the scanning relative to the subject resulted in artifacts that compromised the image.

This charge is approximately plane wave initiated and used a water pipe quality circular copper liner. To establish the quality of this jet we report about an experiment using several of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory high-resolution diagnostics previously published in this meeting [1]. <b>Image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>tube</b> camera stereo image pairs were obtained early in the jet formation process.

25|$|The idea of {{an image}} tube was first {{proposed}} by G. Holst and H. De Boer (Netherlands) in 1928 , but early attempts to create one were not successful. It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared <b>converter</b> <b>tube.</b> This tube consisted of a photocathode in proximity to a fluorescent screen. Using a simple lens, an image {{was focused on the}} photocathode and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the photocathode by photons to strike the fluorescent screen. This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was non-inverting. With this <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> type <b>tube,</b> it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s very fast cameras based on micro-channel plate (MCP) image {{intensifier}}s were developed. The MCP intensifier is similar technology used for night vision applications. They {{are based on}} a similar photon-electron-photon conversion as the above-described <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>tubes,</b> but incorporate a micro-channel plate, which is a thin silicon section with extremely fine holes drilled in a tight array. This plate is given a high-voltage charge such that electrons coming from the input photocathode to the holes create a cascading effect, thereby amplifying the image signal. These electrons fall on an output phosphor, creating the emission of photons that comprise the resulting image. The devices can be switched on and off at the nanosecond time scale. The output of the MCP is coupled to a CCD, usually by means of a fused fiber-optic taper, creating an electronic camera with very high sensitivity and capable of very short exposure times, though also one that is inherently monochrome due to wavelength information being lost in the photon-electron-photon conversion. The pioneering work in this area was done by Paul Hoess while at PCO Imaging in Germany.|$|R
