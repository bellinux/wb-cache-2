5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of gorillas {{are the other}} two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> many copies each gene has. Until recently, gorillas {{were considered to be}} a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla. There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other.|$|E

500|$|Johns {{initially}} recorded eight songs, only {{to delete}} the files thinking {{they were too}} similar to tracks on the previous album, Neon Ballroom. Leaving the security and darkness of his earlier work, he restarted from scratch to create something more uplifting. Diorama represented a radical change in Silverchair's musical structure; the heavy grunge influence on their prior work was replaced by string and horn ensembles and highly complex song structures. Johns felt more comfortable in making this radical change rather than a minor one, finding it helped him to regain his passion for music, which had diminished during the grunge days. Johns wrote much of the album at a baby grand piano; he had previously taught himself the instrument and composed songs on {{it for the first}} time with Diorama. This change in songwriting technique had a significant effect on the sound of the album; Johns commented on the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> his vocals resonated with piano as compared to guitar. He worked with others in developing the album; Van Dyke Parks (Beach Boys, U2) collaborated on orchestral arrangements, and the pair spent much of their recording time attempting to describe the music in metaphorical terms, with Johns describing Parks' orchestral swells as [...] "tidal waves" [...] and violins as [...] "a flock of birds". The pair described the collaborative experience as [...] "mind-blowing". A DVD entitled Across The Night: The Creation Of Diorama was released in 2002, featuring interviews with Johns and Parks.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, face {{covering}} veils with caps velvet with trimmed with otter fur were worn {{in the streets}} by Turki women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by the adventurer Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s. Travelers of the period Sir Percy Sykes and Ella Sykes wrote that in Kashghar women went into the bazar [...] "transacting business with their veils thrown back" [...] but mullahs tried to enforce veil wearing and were [...] "in the habit of beating those who show their face in the Great Bazar"." [...] Uyghur women who had non-Muslim Han Chinese husbands did not wear veils due to their slackness in regards to religion in the period after Yaqub Beg's rule ended.

2500|$|Traditionally-prepared soul foods {{tend to be}} {{very high}} in starch, fat, sodium, cholesterol, and calories. In {{contemporary}} times, some traditional-style soul foods have been implicated in the abnormally high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension), type 2 diabetes, clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), stroke, and heart attack suffered by Americans â€“ especially those living in the Southern and Central United States. [...] A foundational <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> health is perceived of being contemporary is that soul food may differ from 'traditional' styles is the widely different structures of agriculture. Fueled by federal subsidies, the agricultural system in the United States became industrialized as the nutritional value of most processed foods, and not just those implicated in a traditional perception of soul food, have degraded. This urges a consideration of how concepts of racial authenticity evolve alongside changes in the structures that make some foods more available and accessible than others.|$|E
2500|$|As {{important}} as the budget differences are {{to the issue of}} pay for performance, the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, Edward L. Deci and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals. [...] Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an [...] "interesting" [...] activity to perform. [...] Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards. [...] Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{chosen a}} club and stroke {{to produce the}} desired distance, the player {{addresses}} the ball by taking their stance {{to the side of}} it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single [...] "plane" [...] of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.|$|E

2500|$|Die BrÃ¼cke and Der Blaue Reiter {{were both}} {{examples}} of tendency of early 20th-century German art to be [...] "honest, direct, and spiritually engaged" [...] The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> {{the two groups}} attempted this were telling, however. The artists of Der Blaue Reiter were less oriented towards intense expression of emotion and more towards theory- a tendency which would lead Kandinsky to pure abstraction. Still, it was the spiritual and symbolic properties of abstract form that were important. There were therefore Utopian tones to Kandinsky's abstractions: [...] "We have before us an age of conscious creation, and this new spirit in painting is going {{hand in hand with}} thoughts toward an epoch of greater spirituality." [...] Die BrÃ¼cke also had Utopian tendencies, but took the medieval craft guild as a model of cooperative work that could better society- [...] "Everyone who with directness and authenticity conveys that which drives him to creation belongs to us". The Bauhaus also shared these Utopian leanings, seeking to combine fine and applied arts (Gesamtkunstwerk) with a view towards creating a better society.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796, Byron {{suffered}} from scarlet fever, {{and his mother}} {{took him to the}} Scottish Highlands to stay in the mountains until his recovery. This experience affected Byron greatly, as he described in his poetry, especially his memory of the mountain of Lochnagar and a girl named Mary. He soon fell in love with another Mary, a cousin, and would still think of her until he was 27. On 21 May 1798, the death of Byron's great-uncle, the [...] "wicked" [...] Lord Byron, allowed the 10-year-old to become the 6th Baron Byron; he inherited the Rochdale estate in Lancashire, and Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, coming under the care of his relative, Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle. Byron noticed no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> he was treated until the first time he was given the title dominus (meaning 'lord') in class; he was struck speechless and burst into tears while the other schoolchildren sat in amazement. However, little money came with the inheritance, as his great-uncle had already squandered most of his fortune; the fifth Lord Byron had sold the Rochdale estate illegally, and more money had to be put into a legal battle to restore Rochdale to Byron.|$|E
2500|$|The {{implications}} of this ruling were immediately felt in the State of Virginia, where Lee Boyd Malvo became no longer eligible {{for the death penalty}} {{for his role in the}} Beltway sniper attacks that terrorized the Washington, D.C. area in October 2002. [...] At the time of the attacks, Malvo was 17 years old. Malvo had already been spared the death penalty in his first trial for the murder of FBI employee Linda Franklin in Falls Church, Virginia, and had pleaded guilty in another case in Spotsylvania County; however, he had yet to face trial in Prince William County, Virginia, as well as in Washington, D.C., Washington state, Texas, Maryland, Louisiana, California, Arizona and Alabama. In light of this Supreme Court decision, the prosecutors in Prince William County decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. At the outset of the Beltway sniper prosecutions, the primary reason for extraditing the two suspects from Maryland, where they were arrested, to Virginia, was the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the two states deal with the death penalty. While the death penalty was allowed in Maryland, it was only applied to persons who were adults at the time of their crimes, whereas Virginia had also allowed the death penalty for offenders who had been juveniles when their crimes were committed.|$|E
