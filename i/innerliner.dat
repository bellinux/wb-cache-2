The cigarette packs using different <b>innerliners</b> were stored for one month at 23 centigrade Celsius before appraisal...|$|R
40|$|This paper illustrates, in {{a general}} way, how {{compounding}} raw materi-als used in several non-tread tire components can affect their proper-ties that in turn will influence tire durability. Examples are given {{of the effect of}} polymers, antidegradants and curing agents on compound properties including weather resis-tance, impermeability, fatigue resis-tance, hysteresis and adhesion. In-cluded is data illustrating the ad-vantages of a new bromobutyl poly-mer in <b>innerliners,</b> and of neody-mium catalyzed butadiene rubber in sidewalls.

40|$|The {{development}} of stretchable electronic devices that {{are soft and}} conformable has relied heavily on a single material – polydimethylsiloxane – as the elastomeric substrate. Although polydimethylsiloxane {{has a number of}} advantageous characteristics, its high gas permeability is detrimental to stretchable devices that use materials sensitive to oxygen and water vapor, such as organic semiconductors and oxidizable metals. Failing to protect these materials from atmosphere-induced decomposition leads to premature device failure; therefore, it is imperative to develop elastomers with gas barrier properties that enable stretchable electronics with practical lifetimes. Here, we reinvent butyl rubber – a material with an intrinsically low gas permeability traditionally used in the <b>innerliners</b> of tires to maintain air pressure – for stretchable electronics. This new material is smooth and optically transparent, possesses the low gas permeability typical of butyl rubber, and vastly outperforms polydimethylsiloxane as an encapsulating barrier to prevent the atmospheric degradation of sensitive electronic materials and the premature failure of functioning organic devices. The merits of transparent butyl rubber presented here position this material as an important counterpart to polydimethylsiloxane that will enable future generation stretchable electronics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nonwoven plastic {{is a new}} {{material}} for packaging that has some special quality among the other things such as flexible, higher strength, hydrophob, breathable and hygienes. The technology of nonwoven plastic is spunbond technolog which is a clean technology and produce a non fibre product. The raw material of nonwoven plastic is food grade polypropylene, so that the products are safe for food packaging. Recently just pioneered of nonwoven plastic application as <b>innerliner</b> of plastic sack that can replace “karung goni”as rice packaging and replace cotton sack as meal or flour packaging. Therefore grains {{that have not been}} prepared yet, respiration activity is very important to be breathable characteristic of nonwoven plastic is able to support air circulation very well and also to keep humidity balance in the packaging. At the flour packaging, beside hydrophob characteristic, however breathable characteristic is necessary too because flour has a tendency to absorb water and flour stability must be kept at 13. 5 – 14...|$|E
