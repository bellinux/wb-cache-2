40|$|The {{release of}} aroma {{compounds}} from rehydrated <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> in an artificial mouth system {{and in the}} mouths of 12 assessors was studied by gas chromatography combined with flame ionisation detection and sniffing port detection. In an artificial mouth system, volatile compounds were isolated under mouth conditions, such as temperature, salivation, and mastication. No significant differences were determined between the aroma release from the beans in the artificial mouth and release in the mouths of assessors. However, both the real and artificial mouth systems differed significantly from a purge-and-trap and a dynamic headspace system in aroma release. In order to study aroma release over time, volatile compounds were isolated from rehydrated <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> for 1, 1. 5, 3 and 12 min in the artificial mouth system and analysed by gas chromatography/sniffing port analysis. 2 -Methylpropanal, 2 -/ 3 -methylbutanal, hexanal, 2 -methyl- 2 -butenal, 1 -octen- 3 -one, and dimethyl trisulphide possessed detectable odours when isolated from the <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> in the artificial mouth for all time periods.

40|$|The {{influence}} of mastication, saliva composition and saliva volume on aroma release from rehydrated diced bell peppers and <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> was studied {{in a model}} mouth system. Released volatile compounds were analysed by gas chromatography combined with sniffing port and flame ionisation detection. Compounds were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, resulting in more than 40 compounds to be identified in each vegetable. Mastication increased release from bell peppers significantly and {{increased the number of}} volatile compounds with detectable odours in sniffing port analysis from six to 10 compounds. Addition of artificial or human saliva resulted in the same aroma profile for bell peppers. The amylase activity of artificial saliva consisting of human or porcine -amylase was in the same range as amylase activity in human saliva at 37 oC. Bacterial -amylase had lower activity. Human and porcine -amylase in artificial saliva added to rehydrated <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> did not differ significantly in starch breakdown and affected aroma release similarly. Increase in saliva volume decreased release of aroma compounds from rehydrated <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> significantly. The artificial saliva with porcine or human -amylase sufficiently simulated human saliva with regard to aroma release. The three parameters mastication, saliva composition and saliva volume were shown to be important factors in aroma release from rehydrated vegetables...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glyoxylate {{released as}} a result of ureide catabolism in the developing fruits of legumes was examined through an investigation of alanine-, glutamate- and serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in these tissues. A study of the distribution of these activities among the tissues of the developing fruits of two ureide-transporting legumes, <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and an amide-transporter, snow pea (Pisum sativum), was conducted. Serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in each species was very low relative to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In all three species most of the aminotransferase activity was in the pods. In cowpea, alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity was high in the embryos relative to the seed coats, whereas in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea the seed coats had higher activity than the embryos. Three glyoxylate aminotransferases were isolated and partially purified from extracts of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea developing fruits. These were a serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), which primarily catalyzes the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction; a glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT), which catalyzes both the glutamate- and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions; and an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction. Sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that the SGAT and GGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> fruits are located in the peroxisomes, and that the AGAT is located outside the peroxisomes, probably in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. These results confirm the existence of an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT) as an enzyme distinct from the GGAT. The results of initial velocity kinetic studies of the enzymes isolated from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea, conducted at pH 7. 1, were consistent with a Ping Pong reaction mechanism involving pyridoxal phosphate as a co-enzyme. The Km values obtained for the substrates of the enzymes were in all cases higher for the amino acid than for glyoxylate. For the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes the Km for the amino acids was about ten-fold higher than that for glyxoylate. The affinity of the snow pea enzymes for glyoxylate was less than that of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes. Alanine--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was associated with the GGAT and this activity was reversible, in contrast to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity of this enzyme. The reversible aspartate--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> developing fruits was not catalyzed by the glyoxylate aminotransferases. The pH optimum of the GGAT and the SGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> was approximately 8. 3. The molecular weight of the GGAT and AGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> estimated by gel filtration was 104 kDa.

40|$|<b>French</b> <b>bean</b> [Phaseolus vulgaris (L.) ] {{is among}} the leading export {{vegetable}} in Africa, mostly produced by small-scale farmers. Unfavorable environmental conditions and heavy infestations by insect pests are among the major constraints limiting production of the crop. Most <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers grow their crop in open fields outdoors subject to harsh environmental conditions and repeatedly spray insecticides {{in a bid to}} realize high yield. This has led to rejection of some of the produce at the export market as a result of stringent limits on maximum residue levels. Two trials were conducted at the Horticulture Research and Teaching Field, Egerton University, Kenya, to evaluate the potential of using agricultural nets (herein referred to as agronets) to improve the microclimate, reduce pest infestation, and increase the yield and quality of <b>French</b> <b>bean.</b> A randomized complete block design with five replications was used. <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> seeds were direct-seeded, sprayed with an alpha-cypermethrin-based insecticide (control), covered with a treated agronet (0. 9 mm 3 0. 7 mm average pore size made of 100 denier yarn knitted into a mesh impregnated with alpha-cypermethrin), or covered with an untreated-agronet (0. 9 mm 3 0. 7 mm average pore size made of 100 denier yarn knitted into a mesh not impregnated with insecticide). Alpha-cypermethrin and agronets were manufactured by Tagros Chemicals (India) and A to Z Textile Mills (Tanzania), respectively. Covering <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> with the agronets modified the microclimate of the growing crop with air temperature increased by ' 10 %, relative humidity by 4 %, and soil moisture by 20 %, whereas photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and daily light integral (DLI) were decreased by ' 1 % and 11. 5 %, respectively. Populations of silverleaf whitefly [Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) ] and black bean aphids [Aphis fabae (Scopoli) ] were reduced under agronet covers as contrasted with control plots. Furthermore, populations of both pests were reduced on <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> grown under impregnated agronets compared with untreated agronets, but only on three of the five sampling dates [30, 44, and 72 days after planting (DAP) ] for silver leaf whitefly or at only one of the five sampling dates (30 DAP) for black bean aphid. Covering <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> with agronets advanced seedling emergence by 2 days and increased seedling emergence over 90 % compared with control plots. <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> plants covered with both agronet treatments had faster development, better pod yield, and quality compared with the uncovered plants. These findings demonstrate the potential of agronets in improving <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> performance while minimizing the number of insecticide sprays within the crop cycle, which could lead to less rejection of produce in the export market and improved environmental quality.
