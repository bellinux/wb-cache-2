40|$|CMOS image sensors (CISs) {{with global}} shutter (GS) {{function}} are strongly required {{in order to}} avoid image degradation. However, CISs with GS function have generally been inferior to the rolling shutter (RS) CIS in performance, because they have more components. This problem is remarkable in small pixel pitch. The newly developed 3. 4 µm pitch GS CIS solves this problem by using multiple accumulation shutter technology and the gentle slope light <b>guide</b> <b>structure.</b> As a result, the developed GS pixel achieves 1. 8 e− temporal noise and 16, 200 e− full well capacity with charge domain memory in 120 fps operation. The sensitivity and parasitic light sensitivity are 28, 000 e−/lx·s and − 89 dB, respectively. Moreover, the incident light angle dependence of sensitivity and parasitic light sensitivity are improved by the gentle slope light <b>guide</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E

In order to evaluate the methods which lexicographers employ to improve dictionary accessibility, the concept of <b>guide</b> <b>structures</b> was introduced by Hausmann and Wiegand (1989). Since the appearance of that article, various academics have writ-ten articles and read papers on <b>guide</b> <b>structures</b> in print dictionaries, but few studies have focussed on the tremendous potential of <b>guide</b> <b>structures</b> in electronic dictionaries. In this article it will be shown that electronic dictionaries add dimensions to the implementa-tion of <b>guide</b> <b>structures</b> not possible in print versions. The role of two of the <b>guide</b> <b>structures</b> in the transfer of infonnation in CD-ROM dictionaries will be discussed. The access and mediostructures of the Microsoft Encarta World English Dictionary and the Elektroniese Handwoordeboek van die Afri-kaanse Taal will be analysed and critically evaluated to illustrate the advantages of electronic dic-tionaries over print dictionaries and the urgent need for metalexicographical discussion of this publication medium...|$|R

40|$|The {{automatic}} identification of protein domains from coordinates {{is the first}} step in the classification of protein folds and hence is required for databases to <b>guide</b> <b>structure</b> prediction. Most algorithms encode a single concept based and sometimes do not yield assignments that are consistent with the generally accepted perception. Our development of an automatic approach to identify reliably domains from protein coordinates is described. The algorithm is benchmarked against a manual identification of the domains in 284 representative protein chains. The first step is the domain assignment by distance (DAD) algorithm that considers the density of inter-residue contacts represented in a contact matrix. The algorithm yields 85 % agreement with the manual assignment. The paper then considers how the reliability of these assignments could be evaluated. Finally the use of structural comparisons using the STAMP algorithm to validate domain assignment is reported on a test case,...|$|E

40|$|An {{inorganic}} {{scintillating material}} {{plastic optical fiber}} (POF) dosimeter for measuring ionizing radiation during radiotherapy applications is reported. It is necessary that an ideal dosimeter exhibits many desirable qualities, including water equivalence, energy independence, reproducibility, dose linearity. There has been much recent research concerning inorganic dosimeters. However, little reference {{has been made to}} date of the depth-dose characteristics of dosimeter materials. In the case of inorganic scintillating materials, they are predominantly non water-equivalent, with their effective atomic weight (Z(eff)) being typically much greater than that of water. This has been a barrier in preventing inorganic scintillating material dosimeter from being used in actual clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a parallel-paired fiber light <b>guide</b> <b>structure</b> to solve this problem. Two different inorganic scintillating materials are embedded separately in the parallel-paired fiber.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an approach for modeling landmark {{sites such as}} the Statue of Liberty based on large-scale contaminated image collections gathered from the Internet. Our system combines 2 D appearance and 3 D geometric constraints to efficiently extract scene summaries, build 3 D models, and recognize instances of the landmark in new test images. We start by clustering images using low-dimensional global “gist” descriptors. Next, we perform geometric verification to retain only the clusters whose images share a common 3 D structure. Each valid cluster is then represented by a single iconic view, and geometric relationships between iconic views are captured by an iconic scene graph. In addition to serving as a compact scene summary, this graph is used to <b>guide</b> <b>structure</b> from motion to efficiently produce 3 D models of the {{different aspects of the}} landmark.
