5|$|The {{principal}} motivation {{or driving}} force behind the re-establishment of religious houses in the kingdom of the English, living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, from other literary works, from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries, or indeed from the physical remains of buildings... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run, or a more general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E

In a final battle at Harran in 609 BC the Babylonians and Medes defeated the Assyrian-Egyptian alliance, after which Assyria ceased to exist as an independent state.

25|$|Martí's maltreatment at {{the hands}} of the Spaniards and {{consequent}} deportation to Spain in 1871 inspired a tract, Political Imprisonment in Cuba, published in July. This pamphlet's purpose was to move the Spanish public to do something about its government's brutalities in Cuba and promoted the issue of Cuban independence. In September, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of El Jurado Federal, Marti and Sauvalle accused the newspaper La Prensa of having calumniated the Cuban residents in Madrid. During his stay in Madrid, Marti frequented the Ateneo and the National Library, the Café de los Artistas, and the British, Swiss and Iberian breweries. In November he became sick and had an operation, paid for by Sauvalle.|$|E

25|$|After {{spending}} a year aboard the USCGC Winnebago, Seaman Ron Marlett {{was transferred to}} the district office in Honolulu. His duties included being a driver for the District Office and working as an artist on the Pacific Shield, a monthly publication that presented interesting stories and news for the coastguardsmen and their families living in the 14th Coast Guard District. Ensign Bafflestir started as a small, four-panel gag about coastguardsmen concealing long hair beneath their hats. JO1 Jim Gilman conceived and wrote the first cartoon and had Ron illustrate the story. After receiving positive feedback from the 14th Coast Guard District Commander, Admiral Prins, the Admiral's Aide, Lieutenant Gary Boyer, gave Ron creative control of the cartoon along with the request that Bafflestir fill a whole page in future publications of Pacific Shield. Ron's sense of humor originated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of MAD magazine, especially its featured cartoonist, Don Martin. When Ron took the responsibility of writing his own cartoon strip., he applied his style of exaggeration toward military cliches and Coast Guard culture, which instantly catapulted Ensign Bafflestir into a controversial arena within the Coast Guard. Some coastguardsmen and their families saw Ensign Bafflestir as amusing entertainment, while others saw it as undermining military discipline and promoting unfair criticism of the service they devoted their lives to. African Americans serving in the Coast Guard during the early 1970s embraced the cartoon as a symbol of their fight for social equality. Seaman's curly hair and broad nose made the character easily identifiable to blacks, who saw Seaman as a black being treated unfairly by Bafflestir, Doinkadilly, and Barnflower. After a year of publication, Ensign Bafflestir was circulated in other Coast Guard Districts. Coastguardsman Jim Castagnera from the 9th Coast Guard District wrote a several page spread on Ron Marlett titled The View From Here, which appeared in the 9th District's news magazine Shipmates. Castagnera included several Ensign Bafflestir pieces and compared Marlett to the famous military cartoonist Bill Mauldin. During an admirals' conference in Washington DC, some admirals voiced their opposition toward Ensign Bafflestir and complained that Ron's cartoons promoted insubordination within the ranks. Admiral Prins defended the cartoon strip, proclaiming that Ensign Bafflestir was good for morale because it provided entertainment that coastguardsmen could relate to. This belief was shared by the majority of district commanders.|$|E
25|$|As the {{complaints}} from the BMX upper crust-the Pros and BMX Press-increased, the more Mennenga resented {{and took a}} defensive position. This defensiveness that perhaps slowly calcified to an unwillingness to listen help to create an unorganized Pro rider boycott in 1983 and into part of 1984. It was led unofficially by Greg Hill, {{one of the most}} respected and winningest professionals at the time, and included legendary racers like Stu Thomsen over the alleged unfairness of its pro points system that was in place during that time. It was a long-standing complaint going back to Mr. Hill's 1980 objections to the 1979 season points scoring. An editorial boycott by Robert Osborn, the Managing Editor, Publisher and owner of BMX Action, a major BMX magazine, was over long simmering slights perceived by Mr. Osborn at ABA events but the direct cause of his boycott was his being denied a photographer's pass at an ABA national in 1980. Mr. Osborn had printed unfavorable editorials in his magazine about the ABA. As a result, ABA racing events abruptly disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of BMX Action after the June 1983 issue when it covered the Elsinore National. Conversely NBL Nationals and Renny Roker's NBL sanctioned ESPN Pro Spectacular races received lavish coverage, particularly the 1983 NBL Grand Nationals. It had a full 19 pages dedicated to it in the January 1984 issue. BMXA didn't even cover the ABA Grand National for 1983. In contrast in its February 1985 issue it reported with photos of the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) race at the USBMX track in Azusa, California. The USBA was as time would show not merely an archrival of the ABA but an arch enemy. The ABA was mentioned only obliquely and incidentally, which had been the case for the previous year and a half. It was not until the March 1985 issue did it cover an ABA event, the 1984 Grand National. It was 20 months since the last ABA national BMX Action had reported on. Reportedly, BMX Action ended its editorial boycott in part due to an agreement with the ABA to cease publishing its in house magazine Bicycles and Dirt.|$|E

500|$|According to science-fiction {{historian}} Donald H.

Author James Gunn said of the new fantasy magazines {{that appeared in the}} 1950s that [...] "the best of these was Beyond, created by Horace Gold as a companion fantasy magazine to Galaxy, which he had created three years before. Beyond Fantasy Fiction aimed at the same rationalized fantasy niche that Unknown had established and to which Gold had contributed stories." [...] Not everyone thought the magazine was completely successful in emulating Unknown, however; P.Schuyler Miller, reviewing an anthology drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of Beyond, was generally approving but commented that [...] "Except for Budrys, Pohl, Brown and Sturgeon, these stories from Beyond are rather self-conscious.

500|$|Weird Tales {{had lost}} much of its unique flavor with the {{departure}} of Farnsworth Wright, but in Ashley's view McIlwraith made the magazine more consistent: [...] "though the issues edited by McIlwraith [...] "seldom attain Wright's highpoints, they also omitted the lows". [...] McIlwraith continued to publish some of Weird Tales most popular authors, such as Fredric Brown and Fritz Leiber, but eliminated sword and sorcery fiction, which Robert E. Howard had popularized under Wright with his stories of Conan, Solomon Kane and Bran Mak Morn. [...] August Derleth, who had corresponded with Lovecraft until the latter's death in 1937, continued to send Lovecraft manuscripts to McIlwraith during the 1940s, {{and at the end of}} the decade decided to issue a magazine to publicize Arkham House, a publishing venture he had begun in 1939 that reprinted largely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of Weird Tales. [...] The title was The Arkham Sampler; Derleth intended it to be a more literary magazine than the current crop of sf and fantasy pulps. [...] It published both new and reprint material. [...] Some of the stories were of good quality, including work by Robert Bloch and Lord Dunsany, but it closed down after eight quarterly issues for financial reasons.|$|E
500|$|Supporters {{promoted}} Breckinridge for Speaker of the House, but {{he refused}} to allow his own nomination and voted with the majority to elect fellow Kentuckian Linn Boyd. Despite this, the two were factional enemies, and Boyd assigned Breckinridge to the lightly regarded Committee on Foreign Affairs. Breckinridge's first speech, and several subsequent ones, were made to defend William Butler, again a presidential aspirant in 1852, from charges leveled by proponents of the Young America movement that he was too old and had not made his stance on slavery clear. The attacks came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of George Nicholas Sanders's Democratic Review, and on the House floor from several men, nearly all of whom supported Stephen Douglas for the nomination. These men included California's Edward C. Marshall, who was Breckinridge's cousin. Their attacks ultimately hurt Douglas's chances for the nomination and Breckinridge's defense of Butler enhanced his own reputation. After this controversy, he was more active in the chamber's debates but introduced few significant pieces of legislation. He defended the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 against attacks by Ohio Representative Joshua Giddings and opposed Andrew Johnson's proposed Homestead Act out of concern that it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Despite his campaign rhetoric that federal funds should only be used for internal improvements [...] "of a national character", he sought to increase Kentucky's federal allocation for construction and maintenance of rivers and harbors, and supported bills that benefited his district's hemp farmers.|$|E
