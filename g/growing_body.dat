5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the <b>growing</b> <b>body,</b> respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E

5|$|A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact {{that can be a}} source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

25|$|The {{chloroplast}} membranes sometimes protrude {{out into}} the cytoplasm, forming a stromule, or stroma-containing tubule. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively. They may exist to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum. When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts. However, there is a <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> of evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.|$|E
