5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} survey {{in a total}} 16 villages {{locating}} {{in and around the}} different protected areas in Nagaland. Out of 265 respondent 69 (28. 2 %) respondents confirmed the presence of sun bear by direct sighting and <b>indirect</b> <b>evidences</b> in 2 PAs of Nagaland. Overall status of sun bear was found to be low and rare in and around Pas. In the Nagaland states, human population is constantly on the increase and as a result, there are increasing biotic pressure on protected areas and reserve forests. The potential tropical rainforest habitats of sun bear should be well protected and management action for improvement these habitats should be taken up on priority. Livestock grazing should be restricted in forest areas. Presence of sun bears has been confirmed in the Itanki and Fakim National Parks of Nagaland, but it showed patchy distribution. Both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>evidences</b> (scats, claw marks and foot prints) of sun bears were observed by inhabitants of these areas. Sun bears were reported to be sighted and <b>indirect</b> <b>evidences</b> were seen by inhabitants of villages. Public education and awareness programmes towards conservation and natural history of sun bear must be initiated by the forest department. Study on ecology and management of sun bear is also very necessary for formulation of action plan for mitigation of human-sun bear conflict and long term conservation of the species...|$|R

Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E

In China, although the one gate canal flash lock existed beforehand, the two-gate pound lock was invented in 984 by an official of Huainan and engineer named Qiao Weiyo, during the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), so that ships could safely travel along canal waterways having gated and segmented chambers where water levels could be regulated.

5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into three generations, each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes {{up and down}} quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{no more than three}} generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in particle accelerators.|$|E

5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic recombination between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single mitochondrion can contain 2–10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is usually thought to reproduce by binary fission. What recombination does take place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are studies showing evidence of recombination in mitochondrial DNA. It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for recombination are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination. The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> of recombination exists. If recombination does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{text from}} Tikal {{mentions}} K'uk' Mo' {{and has been}} dated to AD406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely {{to refer to the}} same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, <b>indirect</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On AltarQ he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.|$|E
