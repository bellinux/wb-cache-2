25|$|Although {{the first}} arrivals were almost entirely {{made up of}} convicts and soldiers, {{it was not long}} before rumours of Van Diemen's Land began to attract free settlers, {{allowing}} Hobart Town to grow. But Hobart Town's isolation also led to a large number of 'undesirables' seeking to escape from former crimes, escaping the law, or <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a life of solitude finding their way to the fledgling town. The area around the docks was rife with crime and prostitution, and heavy drinking and fighting were common.|$|E
25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After {{crossing}} the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a place to go, too. While lighting {{up the rest of the}} fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they don't distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly on April 4, 1936 that the original [...] "lacked distinction and artistic merit" [...] and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, withholding approval.|$|E

De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 {{at home with their}} divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as hard as they possibly can but I'm <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a little bit more now".|$|E

500|$|Lindelof {{said that}} {{the other parts of}} the script were strong enough to survive without the Alien hallmarks, such as the Alien creature, which he {{believed}} had been diluted by the exposure it had received. He said, [...] " [...] were <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the Alien stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can {{be a part of this}} movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about." [...] Lindelof {{said that the}} film could instead run parallel to the Alien series and that a sequel would be Prometheus 2 and not Alien, and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010. Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's Alien prequel into an original creation. Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the Alien symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010. Inspired by Blade Runner and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an Alien story of action and horror with [...] "the Blade Runner thematic," [...] to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films.

When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

Likewise, GamePro commented that the game [...] "might prove too challenging to casual DS gamers who are <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a quick round of fun" [...] and would most likely fit best for [...] "DS owners looking for a hardcore dungeon crawling experience." [...] In spite of this, they found that the game had several notable positive aspects, including a [...] "solid" [...] control scheme and [...] "well done" [...] Japanese voice acting and English subtitling. X-Play pointed to the game's [...] "original visual style and a quirky sense of humor" [...] as characteristics that distinguished the game from roguelikes. They greatly enjoyed the dialogue and voice acting and felt that the game [...] "shouldn't get lost" [...] among other dungeon crawlers released to the DS. However, 1UP.com found that the [...] "amusingly slapstick storyline" [...] was the only point that stood out against dungeon crawlers, though the game was [...] "a considerable improvement" [...] over the original. In general, 1UP.com thought the game was [...] "a challenge meant for hardcore RPG fanatics but amusing enough that newcomers might find it worthwhile, too." [...] Likewise, IGN commented that the game would take [...] "a very specific gamer to cuddle up to this cute, comedic experience" [...] and pointed out that the game was [...] "most unlikely of sequels." [...] In contrast to 1UP.com, IGN found the game to be [...] "undoubtedly more of the same," [...] leading to the same benefits and drawbacks.|$|E
