5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E

In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship <b>had</b> <b>she</b> hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, <b>had</b> <b>she</b> been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E

5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier <b>had</b> <b>she</b> sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools <b>had.</b> <b>She</b> thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

60|$|Ruth started. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> {{never heard}} him speak like this before. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not {{imagined}} him capable of speaking in that way. Even {{in the days when}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> loved him most <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never looked up to him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> considered his nature weak, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> loved his weakness. Except in the case of her father, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> always dominated the persons with whom she mixed; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken it for granted that her will was stronger than Kirk's. Something in his voice now told her that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> under-estimated him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> been a girl, not {{accountable}} for loss of mother, for choice {{of home and}} education. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> belonged to a class. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> grown to womanhood in it. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> loved, and in loving had escaped the evil of her day, if not its taint. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> lived only for herself. Conscience had awakened--but, alas! too late. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> overthrown the sordid, self-seeking habit of life; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> awakened to real womanhood; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fought the insidious spell of modernity and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> defeated it; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> learned the thrill of taking root in new soil, the pain and joy of labor, the bliss of solitude, the promise of home and love and motherhood. But <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gathered all these marvelous things to her soul too late for happiness.|$|R
5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention <b>had</b> <b>she</b> had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia.

However, she likely would have avoided these <b>had</b> <b>she</b> been underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control teams would have kept the ship afloat.|$|E

However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they are outraged that he ran off simply to take pictures and say he has lost their trust.

Blaming the events that gave him his powers, {{he is about to}} take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben. Realizing that he had saved Curt either way, he decides that Spider-Man is needed and hides the vial under his desk.|$|E
