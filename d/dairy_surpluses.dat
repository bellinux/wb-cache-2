40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} interrelationship between dairy aid and trade. After WW-II US dairy aid contributed to rises in {{consumption}} and {{sales in the}} Pacific; US domestic politics and Cold War strategy influenced aid programmes. Similarly, when <b>dairy</b> <b>surpluses</b> in the EEC (also known as the EC; currently the EU) coincided with shortages in India in the 1960 s, the EEC sought to: maintain the CAP status quo, dispose of its "Butter Mountain", and earn political cachet such as the US enjoyed via PL 480 food aid - while assisting India. Proceeds from "monetised" EEC butter oil and milk powder donations were to be invested in Indian dairy infrastructure. As the largest Asian country with a "dairy culture", India was a suitable setting for Operation Flood (OF), the world's largest dairy development programme ca. 1970 - 1996. Because so much debate on aid, trade and development can be illustrated by OF, this thesis chose India as its case study. Claims that dairying could benefit women and minorities attracted World Bank loans, but subjected OF to virulent charges of unmet goals. Worse, warned OF detractors, India could become permanently dependent on Europe’s lactic largess. OF officials countered that they were successfully carrying out their original mission to improve the dairy marketing system of India. Thesis maps and charts based on the Agrostat-PC database (FAQ) show India increased dairy production and consumption significantly during OF. As some comparable countries declined, India moved toward self-sufficiency and status as the world's number two milk producer. Proper pricing by Indian authorities ensured that dairy aid was not a long-term disincentive to farmers and, in the end, increased dairy autonomy. Prospects for "replication" of Operation Flood are limited {{by a lack of}} settings suitable for such programmes, and by reduced stocks available for aid. But dairy aid will have a continued role in emergency aid, and in structural adjustment in those poor countries whose food security declines as GATTAVTO liberalises international agricultural trade...|$|E

Dramatic increases in the program’s cost have made it a visible target for politicians concerned about federal budget deficits. Consumer groups, who favor lower dairy prices, also are opposed to the current program. Livestock producers, however, opposed recent changes in the dairy program, fearing that such efforts to reduce <b>surplus</b> <b>dairy</b> production will promote a significant slaughter of dairy cows that will keep beefprices at low levels. These groups and their opposition to the dairy program were confronted, as usual, by a politically powerful dairy lobby. 1 This article first reviews the history and mechanics of the dairy price support program. Elementary economic principles show why the dairy program has generated an increasing volume of <b>dairy</b> <b>surplus</b> by effectively maintaining milk prices above the competitive market level.

40|$|Cycling of {{potassium}} in grassland systems has received relatively little attention {{in research and}} practice in recent years. Balanced nutrient systems require consideration of nutrients other than nitrogen (N). Potassium (K) is needed in large amounts and {{is closely related to}} N nutrition. In intensive <b>dairy</b> farming, <b>surpluses</b> of K arise from the input of concentrates and fertilizer and are returned to the grassland and may lead to increasing K content in the soil. Organic farming, on the other hand, is characterized by limitations in input of nutrient sources and quantities. Leaching of K from grassland is usually low, but high levels of available soil K, high K input from fertilizer or at urine patches lead to increasing losses. High K inputs have a negative influence on Mg and Ca uptake by plants and can cause accelerated leaching of these cations.

The heifer rearing scheme included free advice on calf rearing, drugs, acaricides, minerals and subsidised concentrates for 30 months. The farmers in the coconut growing area integrate dairying with their plantation, they sell their milk to the main processors. The peri-urban farmers are intensive milk producers, who sell their milk at informal markets.

40|$|Generic dairy {{promotion}} is big business. The 1983 Dairy and Tobacco Adjustment Act {{requires that}} all dairy farmers pay a promotion assessment of 15 cents per hundredweight on all milk sold commercially. Of the total assessment, up to 10 cents may be retained locally to fund regional or state dairy product advertising. The funding for {{national and state}} programs combined totals over $ 200 million annually. Thus, the program involves high stakes and, if not well conducted, can result in substantial losses in opportunity costs to dairy farmers. The size of the potential losses {{emphasizes the importance of}} understanding the economics of dairy promotion and the need to increase the efficiency of promotional efforts. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use a comprehensive optimization framework to identify the optimal time path of advertising expenditures for the New York State fluid milk promotion program. New York State is the third largest milk producing state and the size of its consuming population is second only to the State of California. Currently, New York dairy farmers invest $ 15 million annually in dairy promotion efforts. The problem is cast in a deterministic optimal control framework with fluid sales equations for major New York cities and the farm milk supply equation for the entire state as the time-evolving equations. The objective is to choose the optimal advertising spending level for each city with the goal of maximizing the discounted net farm revenue stream. The model can be extended to optimization of national advertising expenditures across states or regions. Analytical insights into the solution structure as well as empirical results based on alternative functional specifications are presented in the paper. The empirical results indicate that advertising expenditure levels have been too high in the markets of New York City and Albany, although the spending level for Syracuse is found to be nearly optimal. The magnitude of the overspending, however, depends critically on the functional form chosen. For example, the result for New York City based on a semi-logarithmic specification indicates that the historical spending level is about 4. 9 times that of the optimal level while the rate of overspending is 2. 5 times when a double-logarithmic model is used. The overspending rate of 2. 5 for New York City is consistent with that found in Liu and Forker, which also used a double-logarithmic specification. The analysis also shows that it is optimal to follow a seasonal pattern in allocating advertising funds: advertising should be intensified in the winter and at a lower level during the late spring and early summer. Further, the optimal seasonal pattern found is not sensitive to alternative functional form specifications. A casual examination of the expenditure data indicates that historically the seasonal spending pattern is far from optimal. This study represents the first attempt to deal with commodity dairy promotion in a comprehensive optimization framework while taking into account the complexity of endogenous supply response and government price intervention. The advantage of the current approach over previous ad hoc simulation procedures is that both the short-term seasonal advertising pattern and the long-term; spending time path can be identified in a more realistic setting. While the present model provides a more detailed dynamic of fluid milk sales, farm supply and advertising, it does suffer from some limitations. The optimal solutions are highly dependent on the functional form specified. This is a disturbing result, which confirms the finding of a previous. The dilemma supports Kinnucan 1 s call for devoting greater attention to theoretical underpinnings of the sales-advertising response relation in order to gain some insight into the appropriate a priori restriction to place on the functional form. The results also point out the need to develop a better and more comprehensive commodity promotion data set as argued by Forker et. al. Such a data set would enable researchers to narrow the choices of functional form empirically through appropriate specification tests. In addition to resolving the functional form problem, the model could be improved to better reflect the characteristics of the dairy market environment. For example, the model does not account for the fact that political goodwill may accrue when advertising efforts increase demand and thereby reduce government expenditures on the dairy support program. In light of the 1985 Food Security Act, which gives the Secretary of Agriculture the power to adjust dairy support prices in response to surplus levels, the potential for political goodwill is of increasing importance to dairy farmers. If the possibility for political goodwill were incorporated, optimal advertising expenditure levels might be higher than those found in this study. To adapt the model to reflect the political economy of the entire dairy industry, researchers would need to specify the behavior of government in setting support prices. With an endogenized government support price which is a function of the <b>dairy</b> <b>surplus,</b> the adapted model should also allow for manufactured dairy product advertising, since the effect of such expenditures would no longer simply be to replace government purchases with private consumption, but rather would result in a farm price impact.

Data from a 3 -year (2009 – 2011) survey {{were used to assess}} farm-gate P balances and P use efficiency (PUE) on 21 intensive grass-based dairy farms operating under the good agricultural practice (GAP) regulations in Ireland. Mean stocking rate (SR) was 2 · 06 livestock units (LU) /ha, mean P surplus was 5 · 09 kg/ha, or 0 · 004 kg P/kg milk solids (MS), and mean PUE was 0 · 70. Phosphorus imports were dominated by inorganic fertilizer (7 · 61 kg P/ha) and feeds (7 · 62 kg P/ha), while exports were dominated bymilk (6 · 66 kg P/ha) and livestock (5 · 10 kg P/ha). Comparison to similar studies carried out before the introduction of the GAP regulations in 2006 indicated that P surplus, both per ha and per kg MS, has significantly decreased (by 74 and 81 %, respectively) and PUE increased (by 48 %), mostly due to decreased inorganic fertilizer P import and improvements in Pmanagement. There has been a notable shift towards spring application of organic manures, indicating improved awareness of the fertilizer value of organic manures and good compliance with the GAP regulations regarding fertilizer application timing. These results suggested a positive impact of the GAP regu-lations on <b>dairy</b> farm P <b>surplus</b> and PUE, indicating an improvement in both environmental and economic sustainability of dairy production through improved resource use efficiencies.

The advancement in public health care through introduction of antibiotics against infectious agents is now being threatened by global development of multidrug-resistant strains. These strains are product of both continuous evolution and un-checked antimicrobial usage (AMU). Though antibiotic application in livestock has largely contributed toward health and productivity, it has also played significant role in evolution of resistant strains. Although, a significant emphasis {{has been given to}} AMR in humans, trends in animals, on other hand, are not much emphasized. <b>Dairy</b> farming involves <b>surplus</b> use of antibiotics as prophylactic and growth promoting agents. This non-therapeutic application of antibiotics, their dosage, and withdrawal period needs to be re-evaluated and rationally defined. A dairy animal also poses a serious risk of transmission of resistant strains to humans and environment. Outlining the scope of the problem is necessary for formulating and monitoring an active response to AMR. Effective and commendably connected surveillance programs at multidisciplinary level can contribute to better understand and minimize the emergence of resistance. Besides, it requires a renewed emphasis on investments into research for finding alternate, safe, cost effective, and innovative strategies, parallel to discovery of new antibiotics. Nevertheless, numerous direct or indirect novel approaches based on host–microbial interaction and molecular mechanisms of pathogens are also being developed and corroborated by researchers to combat the threat of resistance.

40|$|Dairy farms produce {{significant}} {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions {{and are therefore}} a focal point for GHG-mitigation practices. To develop viable mitigation options, we need robust (insensitive to changes in model parameters and assumptions) predictions of GHG emissions. To this end, we developed a stochastic model to estimate the robustness of predictions based on input parameters (GHG emission factors and production traits) and their uncertainties. In our study we explored how sensitive predictions of GHG emissions are to three factors: (1) system boundaries of the emission model (2) the uncertainty of input parameters due to quality of data or methodological choices (epistemic uncertainty) and (3) inherent variability in input parameters (variability uncertainty). To assess the effect of system boundaries, we compared two different boundaries: the “dairy farm gate” boundary (all GHG emissions are allocated to milk) and “system expansion” (the model gives a GHG credit to beef derived from culled cows and bull, heifer and calf fattening of <b>surplus</b> <b>dairy</b> calves outside the farm). Results using the farm-gate boundary provide guidance to dairy farmers to reduce GHG emissions of milk production. The results using system expansion are important for defining GHG abatement policies for milk and beef production. We found that the choice of system boundary had the strongest impact on the level and variation of predicted GHG emissions. Model predictions were least robust for lower-yielding dairy cow production systems and when we used system expansion. We also explored which GHG-abatement strategies have the most leverage by assessing the influence of each input parameter on model predictions. Predicted GHG emissions were least sensitive to variability-related uncertainty in production traits (i. e. replacement rate, calving interval). Lower-yielding production systems had the highest variation, indicating the highest potential for GHG mitigation of all production systems studied. Variation in predicted GHG emissions increased substantially when both epistemic and variability uncertainty in emission factors and variability uncertainty in production traits were included in the model. If the system boundary was set at the farm gate, the emission factor of N 2 O from nitrogen input into the soil had the highest impact on variation in predicted GHG emissions. This variation stems from uncertainties in predicting N 2 O emissions (epistemic uncertainty) but also from inherent variability of N 2 O emissions over time and space. The uncertainty of predicted GHG emissions can be reduced by increasing the precision in predicting N 2 O emissions. However, this additional information does not reduce GHG emissions itself. Knowing site specific variability of N 2 O emissions can help reduce GHG emissions by specific management (e. g. reduce soil compaction, adopted manure management, choice of suitable crops). In case of system expansion, uncertainty in GHG emission credit for dairy beef contributed the most to increasing the variation in predicted GHG emissions. The stochastic-model approach gave important insights into the robustness of model outcomes, which is crucial in the search for cost-effective GHG-abatement options. Despite the high degree of uncertainty when using system expansion, its results help identifying global GHG mitigation options of combined milk and beef productio...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Belgian white veal {{industry}} {{specializes in}} raising predominantly male <b>surplus</b> <b>dairy</b> calves to white veal meat. This is obtained by intensive feeding of low-iron diets, historically dominated by liquid milk replacer, containing vegetable protein sources. Consequently, veal calves only had very limited ruminal development and function. Only recently, {{the share of}} roughage and concentrates has expanded for welfare and feed-technical reasons, leading to more mature rumen development. Both milk replacer and solid feeds contain grain products, concomitant with possible mycotoxin contamination. Mycotoxins are naturally occurring secondary fungal metabolites that can be produced in crops and other feed commodities both pre- and post-harvest. It is suggested that an optimal rumen functioning {{is responsible for the}} biotransformation and detoxification of several Fusarium mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON), making ruminants less sensitive to these toxins. In {{the first part of this}} study, we aimed to evaluate the mycotoxin contamination of feed samples in the Belgian veal industry. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of ruminal development on the biotransformation of DON and its acetylated derivatives, 3 - and 15 -acetyl-DON (3 - and 15 -ADON), in calves using a comparative toxicokinetic approach. METHODS: Survey: 45 feed samples were collected from 15 different veal farms. On each farm three to six samples per feed component, respectively milk replacer, roughage (straw or corn silage) and concentrate feed, were collected and subsequently pooled per feed component. Samples were analysed by validated multi-mycotoxin (UHP) LC-MS/MS methods (Monbaliu et al., 2010; Van Pamel et al., 2014). Toxicokinetic study: two ruminating and two non-ruminating male calves each received respectively a bolus of DON (120 µg/kg bodyweight (BW)), 3 -ADON (25 µg/kg BW), and 15 -ADON (50 µg/kg BW) by intravenous (IV) injection or per os (PO) in a cross-over design, respecting a wash-out period of 96 h. Concentrations were based on average feed intake and maximum contamination levels of the feed based on the survey. Following mycotoxin bolus administration, blood and urine was collected at different time points post administration. DON, 3 -ADON, 15 -ADON as well their metabolites, namely de-epoxy-DON, DON- 3 -glucuronide, DON- 3 -sulfate, DON- 15 -sulfate, 3 -ADON- 15 -sulfate, 15 -ADON- 3 -sulfate and DON- 3, 15 -di-sulfate, in plasma and urine samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Survey: About 13 % of the milk replacer samples were contaminated with fumonisin B 1 and FB 2, with an average contamination level of respectively 32 ± 7 and 13 ± 1 µg/kg. No other mycotoxins were found in these samples. However, all roughage and concentrate feed samples were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin. DON was most prevalent, contaminating 80 % of the roughage samples and all 15 concentrate samples. Also the DON acetylated derivatives 3 - and 15 -ADON were present in 40 % of the roughage and concentrate samples. It remains to be determined whether 3 - and 15 -ADON contribute to the total DON contamination, e. g. by possible in vivo hydrolysis upon ingestion. Besides DON, also enniatin B was highly prevalent (73 % of the samples). Toxicokinetic study: Results will be presented at the conference. DISCUSSION: The survey demonstrates a multi-mycotoxin contamination of the feed for veal calves, mainly present in roughage and concentrate feed. The results of the toxicokinetic study will determine the balance between mycotoxin exposure and ruminal biotransformation of the toxins in veal calves. The increased exposure of veal calves to mycotoxins, by the provision of large amounts of solid feed, can negatively affect veal performance, gastro-intestinal health and susceptibility for infectious diseases. However, the provision of large amounts of solid feed stimulates ruminal development, which can make the veal calves less sensitive to mycotoxins.
