In the proposed approach, users feel {{the effect of the}} effect of the virtual kinematic loops: (a) on the inertia of the virtual linkage at the user-selected operational point (OP); and (b) on their freedom of motion. The approach introduces a method for computing the inertia of linkages with kinematic loops at arbitrarily selected OPs. It uses this inertia to select the directions of motion resisted by the virtual <b>joints.</b> <b>Users</b> feel the apparent inertia via impedance control, and the motion restrictions via stiffness control. Controlled experiments within a planar haptic interaction system validate that the proposed approach successfully renders the kinematic loop closure constraints to users. I...|$|R
