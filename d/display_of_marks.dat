The older Mark II fighters, not equipped with the more advanced systems used in the newer Vipers, were unaffected by the Cylon modifications to Dr. Baltars program.

50|$|Tipperary {{went into}} decline {{following}} this victory and Doyle decided {{to retire from}} inter-county hurling. On {{his way home from}} posting a letter to the county board announcing his retirement Doyle bumped into selector John Joe Callanan. Callanan told Doyle that the regular corner-back was ill, and asked Doyle if he would take his place and mark the great Christy Ring. Doyle agreed and he produced perhaps the greatest <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> {{in the history of the}} game, hoding the legendary Ring scoreless through 150 minutes of championship hurling. Tipperary later defeated Limerick by 1-16 to 2-10 to take the provincial title. It was Doyle's fourth Munster medal. On 4 September 1949 Tipperary and Laois faced off in the All-Ireland decider. In a one-sided affair Tipp completely overpowered the Leinster champions on a score line of 3-11 to 0-3, giving Doyle his third All-Ireland medal.|$|R

40|$|A {{deficiency}} in pejvakin, a protein of unknown function, causes a strikingly heterogeneous form of human deafness. Pejvakin-deficient (Pjvk(-/-)) mice also exhibit variable auditory phenotypes. Correlation between their hearing thresholds {{and the number}} of pups per cage suggest a possible harmful effect of pup vocalizations. Direct sound or electrical stimulation show that the cochlear sensory hair cells and auditory pathway neurons of Pjvk(-/-) mice and patients are exceptionally vulnerable to sound. Subcellular analysis revealed that pejvakin is associated with peroxisomes and required for their oxidative-stress-induced proliferation. Pjvk(-/-) cochleas <b>display</b> features <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defenses, and peroxisomes in Pjvk(-/-) hair cells show structural abnormalities after the onset of hearing. Noise exposure rapidly upregulates Pjvk cochlear transcription in wild-type mice and triggers peroxisome proliferation in hair cells and primary auditory neurons. Our results reveal that the antioxidant activity of peroxisomes protects the auditory system against noise-induced damage. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} in order to apply {{the most common type of}} {{criteria}} for logicality, invariance criteria, to natural language, we need to consider both invariance of content—modeled by functions from contexts into extensions—and invariance of character—modeled, à la Kaplan, by functions from contexts of use into contents. Logical expressions should be invariant in both senses. If we do not require this, then old objections due to Timothy McCarthy and William Hanson, suitably modified, demonstrate that content invariant expressions can <b>display</b> intuitive <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> non-logicality. If we do require this, we neatly avoid these objections while also managing to demonstrate desirable connections of logicality to necessity.

40|$|Shape {{encoding}} mechanisms can be probed by the sequential brief <b>display</b> <b>of</b> dots that <b>mark</b> {{the boundary}} <b>of</b> the shape, and delays of less that a millisecond between successive dots can impair recognition. It {{is not entirely}} clear whether this is accomplished by preserving stimulus timing in the signal {{being sent to the}} brain, or calls for a retinal binding mechanism. Two experiments manipulated the degree of simultaneity among and within dot pairs, requiring also that the pair members be in the same half of the visual field or on opposite halves, i. e., across the midline from one another. Recognition performance was impaired the same for these two conditions. The results make it likely that simultaneity of cues is being registered within the retina. A potential mechanism is suggested, calling for linkage of stimulated sites through activation of PA 1 cells. A third experiment confirmed a prior finding that the overall level of recognition deficit is partly a function of display-set size, and affirmed submillisecond resolution in binding dot pairs into effective shape-recognition cues...|$|R
40|$|Inland {{aquatic organisms}} almost ubiquitously <b>display</b> a pattern <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> provincialism {{characterized}} by substantial population differentiation and genealogical discontinuities. This {{is the result}} of strong priority effects and local adaptation following dispersal and colonization of new habitats. We present a case that defies this biogeographic paradigm. We have investigated the phylogeography of the fairy shrimp Streptocephalus torvicornis across its circum-Mediterranean and Eurasian distribution. Based on three independent datasets, namely sequence variation at 12 S and 16 S rRNA, cyst morphology and male second antenna characters, we discern a pattern of extensive genetic and morphological homogeneity pointing to unhindered gene flow and widespread connectivity among populations. These intriguing findings may provisionally be explained by (i) a high dispersal frequency overwhelming the ability of a population to maintain resource monopolization, (ii) an outbreeding vigour opportunity offered to secondary immigrants, (iii) an ecological equivalence of genotypes generating long-term immigration–extinction equilibria and buffering genetic diversity over spatial scales, (iv) enhanced bird-mediated dispersal in open habitats as opposed to ponds surrounded by forests or shrub, or (v) a shallow population history with little time for substantial genetic differentiation...|$|R
