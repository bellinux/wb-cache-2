40|$|Contractile {{properties}} differ between skeletal, cardiac {{and smooth}} muscles {{as well as}} between various skeletal muscle fiber types. This functional diversity is thought to be mainly related to different speeds of myosin head pulling cycles, with the molecular mechanism of force generation being essentially the same. In this study, force-generating attachments of myosin heads were investigated by applying small perturbations of myosin head pulling cycles in stepwise stretch experiments on skeletal muscle fibers of different type. Slow fibers (frog tonic and rat slow-twitch) exhibited only a ‘slow-type’ of myosin <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> over the entire activation range, while fast fibers (frog and rat fast-twitch) displayed a ‘slow-type’ of myosin <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> at low levels of activation, and an up to 30 -times faster type at high levels of activation.

40|$|Competing {{models for}} the {{coordination}} of processive stepping in kinesin can be tested by introducing a roadblock to prevent lead <b>head</b> <b>attachment.</b> We used T 93 N, an irreversibly binding mutant monomer, as a roadblock, and measured the rates of nucleotide-induced detachment of kinesin monomers or dimers with and without the T 93 N roadblock using microflash photolysis combined with stopped flow. Control nucleotide-induced monomer (rK 340) unbinding was 73. 6 s− 1 for ATP and 40. 5 s− 1 for ADP. Control ADP-induced dimer (rK 430) unbinding was 18. 6 s− 1. Added 20 mM Pi slowed both monomer and dimer unbinding. With the roadblock in place, lead <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> of dimers is prevented and ATP-induced trail head unbinding was then 42 s− 1. This is less than two-fold slower than the stepping rate of unimpeded rK 430 dimers (50 – 70 s− 1), indicating that during walking, lead <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> induces at most only a slight (less than two-fold) acceleration of trail head detachment.

Significant progress has been made for inducing dependency grammars, however the models employed are overly simplistic, particularly in comparison to supervised parsing models. In this paper we present an approach to dependency grammar induction using tree substitution grammar which is capable of learning large dependency fragments and thereby better modelling the text. We define a hierarchical non-parametric Pitman-Yor Process prior which biases towards a small grammar with simple productions. This approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art, when measured by <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> accuracy. ...|$|E

Aim: The aim of this study was to delineate the morphology of pronator quadratus muscle. Material and methods: A total of 60 forearms (Rt- 30; Lt- 30) from 30 Indian cadavers were evaluated. Careful dissection of each forearm was done and extent of radial and ulnar attachments of pronator quadratus, width of proximal and distal borders of it was taken. Also, observed additional <b>heads,</b> <b>attachment</b> of origin and insertion of pronator quadratus muscle. Results: Width of proximal and distal borders of pronator quadratus were 28. 6 mm and 30. 2 mm respectively on right side and on left it was 28. 7 mm and 30. 1 mm respectively. It had a single head in 33. 33 %, double heads in 60. 00 % and three heads in 06. 66 %.

40|$|Force {{enhancement}} during lengthening of {{an active}} muscle, a condition that normally occurs during locomotion in vivo, is attributed to recruitment of myosin heads that exhibit fast attachment to and detachment from actin in a cycle that does not imply ATP splitting. We investigated the kinetic and mechanical features of this cycle in Ca 2 + activated single skinned fibres from human skeletal muscles containing different myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, identified with single-fibre gel electrophoresis. Fibres were activated by using a new set-up that allows development {{of most of the}} tension following a temperature jump from 0 – 1 °C to the test temperature (∼ 12 °C). In this way we could prevent the development of sarcomere non-uniformity and record sarcomere length changes with a striation follower in any phase of the mechanical protocol. We found that: (i) fibres with fast MHC isoforms develop 40 – 70 % larger isometric forces than those with slow isoforms, as a result of both a larger fraction of force-generating myosin heads and a higher force per head; (ii) in both slow and fast fibres, force enhancement by stretch is due to recruitment of myosin <b>head</b> <b>attachments,</b> without increase in strain per head above the value generated by the isometric heads; and (iii) the extent of recruitment is larger in slow fibres than in fast fibres, so that the steady force and power output elicited by lengthening become similar, indicating that mechanical and kinetic properties of the actin–myosin interactions under stretch become independent of the MHC isoform...|$|R

40|$|Sertoli cells play {{a number}} of roles in {{supporting}} spermato-genesis, including structural organization, physical and para-crine support of germ cells, and secretion of factors necessary for germ cell development. Studies with microtubule disrupting compounds indicate that intact microtubule networks are cru-cial for normal spermatogenesis. However, treatment with tox-icants and pharmacologic agents that target microtubules lack cell-type selectivity and may therefore elicit direct effects on germ cells, which also require microtubule-mediated activities for division and morphological transformation. To evaluate the importance of Sertoli cell microtubule-based activities for sper-matogenesis, an adenoviral vector that overexpresses the micro-tubule nucleating protein, g-tubulin, was used to selectively dis-rupt microtubule networks in Sertoli cells in vivo. g-Tubulin overexpression was observed to cause redistribution of Sertoli cell microtubule networks, and overexpression of a g-tubulin-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein was observed to localize {{to the site of}} elongate spermatid <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> to the seminiferous epithelium.

40|$|The signal {{transduction}} pathway (Ca 2 + activation) was investigated by observing the orientation and {{dynamics of the}} labeled regulatory proteins reconstituted into the thin filaments of muscle fibers. Troponin C labeled at Cys- 97 was strongly immobilized by interaction with other regulatory proteins, which allowed an accurate determination of the orientation during activation with Ca and/or myosin heads. The addition of Ca to reconstituted fibers resulted in a 20 ° rotation of the labeled domain accompanied by an increase of orientational disorder, whereas myosin <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> induced a 30 ° rotation with similar disordering. The difference {{in the degree of}} rotation reflects the different modes of thin filament activation by Ca and by myosin heads. Tropomyosin labeled with MSL at Cys- 197 and Cys- 36 was reconstituted into ghost fibers. Mobility of the labeled domains was not inhibited by the interaction with the thin filament. The large scale mobility of tropomyosin was modulated to a small extent by interaction with troponin, Ca, caldesmon, or myosin heads. These findings suggest weak, nonstereospecific interactions of tropomyosin and actin, with tropomyosin hovering over the surface of the thin filament...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the force-velocity curves of glycerinated rabbit psoas fibers over {{a range of}} ATP concentration from 2. 5 microM to 5 mM. As the ATP concentration is increased, the isometric tension increases to a maximum around 50 microM, then decreases to a plateau at 70 % of the maximum by 1 mM ATP. At low ATP concentrations the maximum velocity of contraction is low and increases with increasing ATP, reaching a plateau at approximately 2 lengths per second by 1 mM ATP. Our {{studies suggest that the}} binding of ATP dissociates the myosin head from actin in the contracting muscle, a reaction similar to that seen in solution. We have constructed models of the actin-myosin-nucleotide interactions based on a kinetic scheme derived from solution studies. The fit of these models to the data shows that the rates of some reactions in the fiber must be considerably different from the rates of the analogous reactions in solution. The data is best fit by models in which <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> occurs rapidly {{at the beginning of a}} power stroke, head detachment occurs rapidly at the end of the power stroke, and the force produced by a myosin head in a power stroke is independent of velocity...|$|E
40|$|SINCE the {{introduction}} of field shelling of corn by combines, many farmers have changed from ear-corn harvesting to a high-moisture, field-shelling system. A field survey (USDA 1971) in the Corn Belt indicated the continued shift to combines for harvesting corn. The portion of acreage harvested by corn heads on combines reached 69 per-cent in some midwestern states for the 1971 season. The combine approach has gained such favor because combines are universal types of harvesters, which may be equipped with different <b>head</b> <b>attachments,</b> and, when appropriately adjusted, {{can be used to}} harvest all types of grains. Field combining of corn has brought into focus the problem of mechanical damage to corn kernels. Industry and re-searchers (Byg et al. 1966, Cooper 1968, Hall and Johnson 1970) have directed their efforts to improve the shelling performance by establishing optimum operating parameters, yet shelling damage continues at objectionable levels. Several research workers (Brass 1970, Fox 1969, USDA 1967) have developed a new shelling mechanism. The experimental shellers shell corn with less damage than conventional shellers, but inherent limitations and performance problems have been encountered. It thus seems that the full potential of the conventional cylinder-concave mechanism in shelling corn has yet to be realized. Basic research is needed to indicate where damage occurs and what modifications are needed to substantially reduce the level of damage. This must be done without adversely affecting the overall performance of the machine. The literature reviewed showed lack of quantitative evaluation of corn-kernel separation and damage distribution along the concave. Research was conducted with the specific objectives of investigating the distribution of through-put and mechanical damage of shelled corn in the combine-shelling mechanism (Mahmoud 1972...|$|R

40|$|Time-resolved {{intensity}} {{measurements of}} the x-ray equatorial reflections were made during twitch contractions of frog skeletal muscles, to which stretches or releases were applied at various times. A ramp stretch applied {{at the onset of}} a twitch (duration, 15 ms; amplitude, approximately 3 % of muscle length) caused a faster and larger development of contractile force than in an isometric twitch. The stretch accelerated the decrease of the 1. 0 reflection intensity (I 1, 0). The magnitude of increase of the 1, 1 reflection intensity (I 1, 1) was reduced by the stretch, but its time course was also accelerated. A release applied at the peak of a twitch or later (duration, 5 ms; amplitude, approximately 1. 5 %) caused only a partial redevelopment of tension. The release produced clear reciprocal changes of reflections toward their relaxed levels, i. e., the I 1, 0 increased and the I 1, 1 decreased. A release applied earlier than the twitch peak had smaller effects on the reflection intensities. The results suggest that a strength applied at the onset of a twitch causes a faster radial movement of the myosin heads toward actin, whereas a release applied at or later than the peak of a twitch accelerates their return to the thick filament backbone. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} regulation of the myosin <b>head</b> <b>attachment</b> by calcium...|$|E
40|$|AbstractActin {{filaments}} have {{key roles}} in cell motility but are generally {{claimed to be}} passive interaction partners in actin-myosin-based motion generation. Here, we present evidence against this static view based on an altered myosin-induced actin filament gliding pattern in an in vitro motility assay at varied [MgATP]. The statistics that characterize the degree of meandering of the actin filament paths suggest that for [MgATP] ≥ 0. 25  mM, the flexural rigidity of heavy meromyosin (HMM) -propelled actin filaments is similar (without phalloidin) or slightly lower (with phalloidin) than that of HMM-free filaments observed in solution without surface tethering. When [MgATP] was reduced to ≤ 0. 1  mM, the actin filament paths in the in vitro motility assay became appreciably more winding in both the presence and absence of phalloidin. This effect of lowered [MgATP] was qualitatively different from that seen when HMM was mixed with ATP-insensitive, N-ethylmaleimide-treated HMM (NEM-HMM; 25 – 30 %). In particular, the addition of NEM-HMM increased a non-Gaussian tail in the path curvature distribution {{as well as the}} number of events in which different parts of an actin filament followed different paths. These effects were the opposite of those observed with reduced [MgATP]. Theoretical modeling suggests a 30 – 40 % lowered flexural rigidity of the actin filaments at [MgATP] ≤ 0. 1  mM and local bending of the filament front upon each myosin <b>head</b> <b>attachment.</b> Overall, the results fit with appreciable structural changes in the actin filament during actomyosin-based motion generation, and modulation of the actin filament mechanical properties by the dominating chemomechanical actomyosin state...|$|E
