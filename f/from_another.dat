5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription <b>from</b> <b>another</b> programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E

5000|$|In the master-builder relationship, {{design and}} {{construction}} tasks were considered inextricable <b>from</b> one <b>another.</b> <b>From</b> the mid-twentieth century on, {{design and construction}} contracts, activities and roles were separated <b>from</b> one <b>another</b> as projects became more complex. In response to this complexity, increasingly specialized roles, silo'd by skill, and project management shaped by litigation and risk management, deepened this split.|$|R

5|$|After {{learning}} of the film adaptation from Nichols, Ben Stiller joined the project and signed a two-picture directing deal with Savoy. He spent nine months working on the script with Smith. During preproduction, however, Stiller had a falling out with Savoy over budget disputes—among them was how the studio's reported $4 million offer to Nicolas Cage would affect the film’s budget. Unable to secure financing <b>from</b> <b>another</b> studio, Stiller left the production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rainfall}} is low, Sismiut has abundant natural {{supplies of}} fresh, drinkable surface water, collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq. Water is also pumped to the waterworks <b>from</b> <b>another</b> lake around 2.5 kilometers {{away in the}} mountains. The water mains are preinsulated and electrically heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E
5|$|At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 {{the curtain}} rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the {{gamekeeper}} Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical {{practices of the}} time, Giselle was preceded by an excerpt <b>from</b> <b>another</b> production—in this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, Mosè in Egitto.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there is}} much debate {{regarding}} whether the species B. virginiensis and B. nitida can actually be distinguished <b>from</b> one <b>another.</b> Thomson and Thomas state that five species of Bothriolepis from the United States (B. nitida, B. minor, B. virginiensis, B. darbiensis and B. coloradensis) are unable to be consistently distinguished <b>from</b> one <b>another.</b> Conversely, Weems asserts that there are several traits that distinguish the species <b>from</b> one <b>another,</b> including several listed above.|$|R

5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack <b>from</b> <b>another</b> country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} <b>from</b> <b>another</b> star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E

5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested <b>from</b> <b>another</b> part of the body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Credit Information: The {{use of the}} Lebanese Identity Card can {{enable the}} banks in the Republic of Lebanon to easily {{establish}} persons credit-worthiness from the Credit Referencing Agencies any time they apply for a loan. This may lead drastically to the reduction in bank rates on loans since the banks can establish whether they are already servicing a loan <b>from</b> <b>another</b> bank which {{will result in a}} reduction in the incidents of bad debts.|$|E
5|$|Domination: Two teams {{compete to}} control various control points to earn points. Standard maps contain three control points. Control of these points is {{initially}} accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but {{control of a}} point continues until a player <b>from</b> <b>another</b> team occupies the space. The first team to reach the point limit, or that has the most points when a time limit has expired, wins.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{times when the}} story is told from a third person point of view. And those are times that tell the story <b>from</b> <b>another's</b> perspective, usually a lesser character, but they do not adopt a first person point of view.|$|R
