40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} pilot {{testing of}} Quality of Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes (Q-DIO), {{an instrument to}} measure quality of nursing documentation. DESIGN: Instrument testing was performed using a random, stratified sample of 60 nursing documentations representing hospital nursing with and without implementation of standardized nursing language (30 for both strata) in a Swiss General Acute Hospital. METHODS: Internal consistency and intrarater and <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities</b> were tested. Through item analyses, the grades of difficulty and the discrimination validity of items were evaluated.

We built on earlier research on New World monkeys to further elucidate the evolution of personality structure in primates. We therefore examined personality in 100 family-reared adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) from 3 colonies on a 60 -item questionnaire. Principal components analyses revealed 5 domains that were largely {{similar to those found}} in a previous study on captive, ex-pet, or formerly laboratory-housed marmosets that were housed in a sanctuary. The <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities</b> of domain scores were consistent with the <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities</b> of domain scores found in other species, including humans. Four domainsdmdash;conscientiousness, agreeableness, inquisitiveness, and assertiveness-resembled personality domains identified in other nonhuman primates. The remaining domain, patience, was specific to common marmosets. We used linear models to test for sex and age differences in the personality domains. Males were lower than females in patience, and this difference was smaller in older marmosets. Older marmosets were lower in inquisitiveness. Finally, older males and younger females had higher scores in agreeableness than younger males and older females. These findings suggest that cooperative breeding may have promoted the evolution of social cognition and influenced the structure of marmoset prosocial personality characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{reliable}} and valid instrument, named the Observatory Test of Capacity, Performance, and Developmental Disregard (OTCPDD), for measuring the amount and quality of use of affected upper limb functions in the daily routines of children with CP. Forty-eight participants (24 children with CP and 24 matched typically developing children) were recruited. The OTCPDD was administered twice (the spontaneous use condition first, followed by the forced use condition) on children with CP. Their parents were asked to complete the Pediatric Motor Activity Log-Revised (PMAL-R). The internal consistency, the intrarater and <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities,</b> and the convergent and discriminate validities were measured. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and the intrarater and <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities</b> were higher than 0. 9 for all of the OTCPDD scores. The convergent validity was confirmed by significant correlations between the OTCPDD and the PMAL-R. For the discriminant validity, significant differences (p< 0. 05) were found between children with CP and typically developing children. The results support that the OTCPDD is a reliable and valid observation-based assessment. The OTCPDD, which uses bimanual daily living activities, is able to represent the children's general affected hand functions (including capacity, performance, and developmental disregard) in their daily routines...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Post mortem {{studies have}} shown a volume deficit of the {{hypothalamus}} in depressive patients. With ultra-high field (7 Tesla) MRI this effect can now be investigated in vivo in detail. But {{to benefit from the}} sub-millimeter resolution a segmentation procedure was required that overcomes limitations of existing procedures, in particular schematic approximations. Methods: Using 7 Tesla T 1 images the traditional anatomical landmarks of the hypothalamus were refined. A detailed segmentation algorithm (unilateral hypothalamus) was developed for colour coded, histogram-matched images and evaluated in a sample of 10 subjects. Intra- and <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities</b> were estimated in terms of intra- and interclass-correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: The computer-assisted segmentation algorithm ensured test-retest reliabilities of ICC ≥ 0. 97 and interrater-reliabilities of ICC ≥ 0. 94. There were no significant volume differences between the tracers and between the hemispheres (paired t-tests). The estimated volume of the hypothalamus (tracer 1, first run) was 1130. 64 mm 3 ± 103. 48 mm 3. Conclusion: We present a computer-assisted algorithm for the manual segmentation of the human hypothalamus on ultra-high field 7 Tesla MR images. With very high intra- and <b>interrater</b> <b>reliabilities</b> it outperforms former procedures established with 1. 5 T or 3 T MRI. The estimated volumes lie between previous histological and neuroimaging results. The algorithm provides an excellent basis for the investigation of our larger neuropsychiatric sample.

50|$|In {{a survey}} of {{documented}} head injuries followed by unconsciousness, most of which involved sporting activities, two thirds of head impacts demonstrated a fencing response, indicating {{a high incidence of}} fencing in head injuries leading to unconsciousness, and those pertaining to athletic behavior. Likewise, animal models of diffuse brain injury have illustrated a fencing response upon injury at moderate but not mild levels of severity as well as a correlation between fencing, blood brain barrier disruption, and nuclear shrinkage within the LVN, all of which indicates diagnostic utility of the response. The most challenging aspect to managing sport-related concussion (mild traumatic brain injury, TBI) is recognizing the injury. Consensus conferences have worked toward objective criteria to identify mild TBI in the context of severe TBI. However, few tools are available for distinguishing mild TBI from moderate TBI. As a result, greater emphasis has regularly been placed on the management of concussions in athletes than on the immediate identification and treatment of such an injury. On-field predictors of injury severity can define return-to-play guidelines and urgency of care, but past criteria have either lacked sufficient incidence for effective utility, did not directly address the severity of the injury, or have become cumbersome and fraught with <b>interrater</b> <b>reliability</b> issues. By providing a clear, discernible physiological event immediately upon injury, the fencing response can discern moderate brain injury forces from milder forces, providing an additional criterion by which the identification and classification of concussions can be improved, with immediate application to sport-related on-field diagnoses and decisions affecting return-to-play status for athletes, thereby facilitating the transition from diagnosis to the treatment of any post-concussion symptoms (PCS).|$|E
