60|$|The fact of {{the female}} preferring to pair with one male rather than with another {{of the same species}} is not so likely to excite attention, as when this occurs, as we have just seen, between {{distinct}} species. The former cases can best be observed with domesticated or confined birds; but these are often pampered by <b>high</b> <b>feeding,</b> and sometimes have their instincts vitiated to an extreme degree. Of this latter fact I could give sufficient proofs with pigeons, and especially with fowls, but they cannot be here related. Vitiated instincts may also account for some of the hybrid unions above mentioned; but in many of these cases the birds were allowed to range freely over large ponds, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose that they were unnaturally stimulated by <b>high</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|E

60|$|He lay {{at night}} upon a {{mattress}} {{on the floor of the}} sitting-room; his own chamber having been assigned to Mrs Gamp; and Mr Pecksniff was similarly accommodated. The howling of a dog before the house, filled him with a terror he could not disguise. He avoided the reflection in the opposite windows of the light that burned above, as though it had been an angry eye. He often, in every night, rose up from his fitful sleep, and looked and longed for dawn; all directions and arrangements, even to the ordering of their daily meals, he abandoned to Mr Pecksniff. That excellent gentleman, deeming that the mourner wanted comfort, and that <b>high</b> <b>feeding</b> was likely to do him infinite service, availed himself of these opportunities to such good purpose, that they kept quite a dainty table during this melancholy season; with sweetbreads, stewed kidneys, oysters, and other such light viands for supper every night; over which, and sundry jorums of hot punch, Mr Pecksniff delivered such moral reflections and spiritual consolation as might have converted a Heathen--especially if he had had but an imperfect acquaintance with the English tongue.|$|E
60|$|Do {{not these}} various evidences endorse our {{argument}} respecting the feeding of children? Do they not imply that, even supposing the same stature and bulk to be attained on an innutritive as on a nutritive diet, {{the quality of}} tissue is greatly inferior? Do they not establish the position that, where energy as well as growth has to be maintained, {{it can only be}} done by <b>high</b> <b>feeding?</b> Do they not confirm the à priori conclusion that, though a child of whom little is expected in the way of bodily or mental activity, may thrive tolerably well on farinaceous substances, a child who is daily required, not only to form the due amount of new tissue, but to supply the waste consequent on great muscular action, and the further waste consequent on hard exercise of brain, must live on substances containing a larger ratio of nutritive matter? And is it not an obvious corollary, that denial of this better food will be at the expense either of growth, or of bodily activity, or of mental activity; as constitution and circumstances determine? We believe no logical intellect will question it. To think otherwise is to entertain in a disguised form the old fallacy of the perpetual-motion schemers--that it is possible to get power out of nothing.|$|E

6000|$|With {{racehorses}} {{selection for}} swiftness has been followed methodically, and our horses now easily surpass their progenitors. The increased size and different {{appearance of the}} English racehorse led a good observer in India to ask," [...] Could any one in this year of 1856, looking at our racehorses, conceive {{that they were the}} result of the union of the Arab horse and the African mare?" [...] (20/72. 'The India Sporting Review' volume 2 page 181; 'The Stud Farm' by Cecil page 58.) This change has, it is probable, been largely effected through unconscious selection, that is, by the general wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation, combined with training and <b>high</b> <b>feeding,</b> but without any intention to give to them their present appearance. According to Youatt (20/73. 'The Horse' page 22.), the introduction in Oliver Cromwell's time of three celebrated Eastern stallions speedily affected the English breed; [...] "so that Lord Harleigh, one of the old school, complained that the great horse was fast disappearing." [...] This is an excellent proof how carefully selection must have been attended to; for without such care, all traces of so small an infusion of Eastern blood would soon have been absorbed and lost. Notwithstanding that the climate of England has never been esteemed particularly favourable to the horse, yet long-continued selection, both methodical and unconscious, together with that practised by the Arabs during a still longer and earlier period, has ended in giving us the best breed of horses in the world. Macaulay (20/74. 'History of England' volume 1 page 316.) remarks, [...] "Two men whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem, the Duke of Newcastle and Sir John Fenwick, pronounced that the meanest hack ever imported from Tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be expected from the best sire of our native breed. They would not readily have believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from England as ever the English had been to obtain horses from Barbary." ...|$|E

50|$|Meat {{broilers}} {{have been}} artificially selected for an extremely <b>high</b> <b>feeding</b> motivation, {{but are not}} usually feed-restricted, as this would delay the time taken for them to reach slaughter-weight.

50|$|Razorbills dive {{deep into}} the sea using their wings and their {{streamlined}} bodies to propel themselves toward their prey. While diving, they rarely stay in groups, but rather spread out to feed. The majority of their feeding occurs {{at a depth of}} 25 m but they have the ability to dive up to 120 m below the surface. During a single dive an individual can capture and swallow many schooling fish, depending on their size. Razorbills spend approximately 44% of their time foraging at sea. When feeding their young, they generally deliver small loads. Adults will mainly feed only one fish to their chick with <b>high</b> <b>feeding</b> deliveries at dawn and decreased feeding 4 hours before dark. Females will generally feed their chicks more frequently than males. They may well fly more than 100 km out to sea to feed when during egg incubation, but when provisioning the young, they forage closer to the nesting grounds, some 12 km away, and often in shallower water.|$|E

50|$|Broiler {{chickens}} (Gallus gallus domesticus), or broilers, are a gallinaceous domesticated fowl, bred {{and raised}} specifically for meat production. They are {{a hybrid of}} the egg-laying chicken, both being a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Most commercial broilers reach slaughter-weight at between five and seven weeks of age, although slower growing breeds reach slaughter-weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. Because the meat broilers are this young at slaughter, their behaviour and physiology are that of an immature bird. Due to artificial selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions, and congestive heart conditions. The breeding stock (broiler-breeders) grow to maturity and beyond but also have welfare {{issues related to the}} frustration of a <b>high</b> <b>feeding</b> motivation and beak trimming. Broilers are usually grown as mixed-sex flocks in large sheds under intensive conditions, but some breeds can be grown as free-range flocks.

50|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) technology generates {{electricity from}} sunlight, {{and it can}} be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications. They were first mass-produced in the year 2000, when German environmentalists and Eurosolar have succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program. In July 2012, a cumulative installed total solar PV power of 29.7 GW was in place. Solar PV provided 18 TW·h in 2011, 3% of the total electricity demand. As solar power installations rise quickly, in first half of 2012, about 5.3% of the total electricity demand was covered by solar power. On Saturday May 25, 2012, solar power broke a new record <b>high,</b> <b>feeding</b> 22 GW into the power grid, or as much as 20 nuclear power stations. This jump above the 20 GW level was due to increased capacity and excellent weather conditions countrywide, and made up for half of the nation's electricity demand at midday. Germany was also the biggest expanding market for solar PV 2012, with 7.6 GW of newly connected systems. Some market analysts expect the solar electricity share could reach 25% by 2050. Price of PV systems has decreased more than 50% in 5 years since 2006.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding level and major dietary energy source used during {{lactation}} on sow milk composition, piglet body composition, and energy balance of sows were determined. During a 21 -d lactation, 48 primiparous sows were fed either a Fat-rich (134. 9 g/kg fat; 196. 8 g/kg carbohydrate) or a Starch-rich (33. 2 g/kg fat; 380. 9 g/kg carbohydrate) diet at either a High (44 MJ NE/d; 1, 050 g protein/d) or a Low (33 MJ NE/d; 790 g protein/d) feeding level. Within each feeding level, the two diets were fed {{to provide an}} isocaloric and isonitrogenous intake. At the Low feeding level, no differences in milk production, milk composition, or piglet body composition were found {{as a result of}} feeding the two dietary energy sources. However, at the <b>High</b> <b>feeding</b> level, sows fed the Fat-rich diet produced higher milk fat (8. 4 vs 6. 9 €and milk energy (5. 38 vs 4. 77 kJ/g) concentrations and a higher piglet body fat concentration (152. 1 vs 135. 4 g/kg) than sows fed the Starch-rich diet. At the Low feeding level, the energy balance (d 6 to d 20) of the sows was similar when fed either the Fat- or the Starch-rich diet (- 558 and - 515 kJ x BW(-. 75) x d(- 1)), but at the <b>High</b> <b>feeding</b> level, the energy balance was more negative in sows fed the Fat than those fed the Starch-rich diet (- 544 vs - 372 kJ x BW(-. 75) x d(- 1)). This suggests that at the <b>High</b> <b>feeding</b> level, dietary energy in the form of fat is preferentially used for milk fat synthesis, resulting in growth and in fatter piglets. Alternatively, at the <b>High</b> <b>feeding</b> level, Starch as the major energy source is used only for growth of the piglets, as confirmed by protein deposition, and also results in a less-negative energy balance for the sows. From this experiment, it can be concluded that effects of substituting cornstarch for fat in the diet of lactating sows on milk composition, piglet body composition, and energy balance of the sows are dependent on feeding level...|$|E
