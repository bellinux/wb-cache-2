40|$|Based on a phenomenological {{approach}} and <b>experiential</b> <b>fieldwork</b> in an Ontario Ojibway community, this thesis records and analyses {{a set of}} intercultural dialogues following the method of "sharing and listening. " The dialogues are analysed with respect to three themes: humour; food; and, social issues (teen pregnancy, school drop-out rates, drug and alcohol use). The dialogues are interpreted both as counter-discourses that displace dominant discourses on Native peoples in Canadian society and as continuous with Ojibway storytelling and oral traditions. The thesis argues that mainstream media and scholarship reduces contemporary Native experience {{to a set of}} "social problems" and stereotypes thereby denying the meaning-making activities, agency and, ultimately, humanity of Native people...|$|E
40|$|Public {{health is}} {{capturing}} {{the energy and}} imagination of undergraduate students across the country, and University of Virginia (UVa) faculty, like many other faculties in both small colleges and large universities, are responding with innovative new courses and academic programs. As a relatively young academic field that dates back only to {{the early twentieth century}} in the United States, the study of public health illustrates the strengths and value of an undergraduate liberal education that features integrative learning, which draws on diverse academic perspectives from across the curriculum, and intentionality in learning, which embeds student-directed problem solving and <b>experiential</b> community <b>fieldwork</b> within academic programs. The goal of the new initiatives in undergraduate public health education is not only to prepare future health professionals, but also and perhaps more importantly, to educate future citizens. Who Will Keep the Public Healthy?, a 2003 Institute of Medicine report, called for public health education for all undergraduate students and featured both themes, as did a 2006 Consensus Conference on Undergraduate Public Health Education, sponsored by the Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences and national public health associations.

40|$|The {{holistic}} approach to education and schooling emphasises values of sustainable development. A teacher's task is to enable optimal learning conditions for successful pedagogical process. Pupils, attending Naklo Primary School, aged 9 to 12 {{were included in the}} research. The research measures the effects of <b>experiential</b> learning and <b>fieldwork</b> on pupils’ attitude towards water and their knowledge of water. We tried out experiential learning in six workshops. There were four lessons, which lasted for 45 minutes, carried out by pupils aged 12 to 14 attending the optional subject called Environmental Education. They were mentors to the younger pupils. The attitude towards water and knowledge of water was tested three times by using a survey and a test in order to collect data on how effectively the teaching units were carried out and how permanent the acquired knowledge was. Prior to the research the pupils were taught about water through the transmission method of teaching. Consequently, there were no differences in results of tests taken before the lessons by pupils of different ages. Due to using experiential learning and getting to know research work in their hometown area, the results in learning and knowledge are much better. Fieldwork motivates them much more and they are enthusiastic about it {{and on top of that}} their attitude towards nature is becoming more positive. Teacher’s attitude and enthusiasm is also of paramount importance and an additional motivator for experiential learning and research. It is crucial that pupils aged 8 to 11 get a lot of experience in active learning as they are still very susceptible to forming their attitude and values and their awareness of how valuable nature and cultural heritage in their hometown area is. They start developing sensibility to environmental issues as well. The results of our research prove to teachers who are already carrying out a lot of <b>experiential</b> learning and <b>fieldwork</b> on regular basis that they are on the right track...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Youth [© Sage Publications and YOUNG Editorial Group] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] article grapples with the ethical dilemmas of youth research, and more specifically 'edgework', via an <b>experiential</b> account of <b>fieldwork</b> with 'boy racers' in Aberdeen, Scotland. 'Edgework' is ethically problematic for those who wish to conduct fieldwork with youths. By engaging in 'edgework', researchers can find themselves unwittingly drawn into the deviant activities of youths, as deviance slowly becomes the norm through prolonged immersion in their social world. 'Edgework' also blurs the line between insider and outsider status, threatening the researcher's ability to step back from the field and critically reflect on their experiences. Furthermore, the experiential aspect of the 'edgework' method is called to the fore since the researcher's experiences of risky behaviours (in terms of discomfort) differed from those of the researched (in terms of pleasure). © SAGE Publications and Young Editorial Group...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{post-secondary}} {{curriculum in}} emerging interdisciplinary fields presents particular challenges in course design and resource utilization, {{especially when the}} field is interdisciplinary by nature of its inherent breadth. A new course at the University of Calgary, designed to introduce undergraduate students to the methods and philosophy of Acoustic Ecology [...] - the study of sound {{and its effects on}} health, cognition and culture [...] exemplifies both the challenges and some practical solutions. Following a brief history of the concept and its philosophy, a summary and critique is presented from the first offering of the course as a pilot project. Conclusions drawn include the necessity of an integrative approach to interdisciplinary fields of study that are true 'interdisciplines', the utility of <b>experiential</b> <b>fieldwork,</b> and the advantages presented by a student group with diverse academic backgrounds...|$|E
40|$|How might deeply {{embodied}} student {{experiences and}} nonhuman agency {{change the way}} we think about learning theory? Pushing the conceptual boundaries of practice-based learning and communities of practice, this chapter draws on student <b>experiential</b> <b>fieldwork</b> 'on Country' with Indigenous people in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia, to explore the peculiar silence when it comes to more-than-human 1 features of situated learning models. As students engage with, and learn from, Indigenous epistemologies and ontologies, they become open to the ways their learning is co-produced in and with place. The chapter builds a case for an inclusive conceptualisation of communities of practice, one that takes seriously the material performativity of nonhuman actors - rock art, animals, plants and emotions in the 'situatedness' of socio-cultural contexts. As a co-participant in the students' community of practice, the more-than-human forms part of the process of identity formation and actively helps students learn. To shed light on the student experiences we employ Leximancer, a software tool that provides visual representations of the qualitative data drawn from focus groups with students and field diaries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{response}} to critiques from feminist, existential, and postmodern qualitative researchers, {{the idea of}} maintaining objective and distant relationships with research subjects {{gave way to the}} belief that researchers could and, in some cases, should become intimately connected to research participants. These traditions opened the door for contemporary field workers to unapologetically forge close relationships to setting members. Several ethical evaluations have emerged from this intimate literature warning researchers of the harm that can come when we “go to far ” in the quest for intimate familiarity. In this paper, I reflect on some of the debates regarding intimacy and exploitation by examining my experiences of dating, marrying, and eventually divorcing my key informant. I trace the way that, despite my attempts to follow the existing ethical guides, I reinforced several larger inequalities in my intimate stance. Using my failure to avoid or mitigate harm, I argue that our discussions of intimate methods and immersion in the field have failed to accurately note how we reinforce or resist structure in our research endeavors. Viewing ourselves as “doing structure ” in the field would lead us to stop debating whether intimacy is better than objectivity, celibacy is better than sex, disclosure is better than silence, or conventional behavior is better than deviance in the field. Instead, we should locate how our behaviors, research roles, or discursive choices enact structures and the effect this enactment has on the people who we research. Keywords Intimate methods.
