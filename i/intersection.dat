5|$|Bypass US Highway131 (Byp. US131) was a {{bypass route}} around {{downtown}} Grand Rapids. The highway followed 28th Street eastward from the <b>intersection</b> with US131 (Division Street) south of downtown. From this starting point eastward, it ran concurrently with Byp. US16 and Byp M-21. M-37 also followed 28th Street {{at the time}} eastward from the <b>intersection</b> at Kalamazoo Avenue. At the <b>intersection</b> with East Beltline and Broadmoor avenues in Paris Township (now Kentwood), Byp.US16/Byp. US131/Byp.M-21 turned northward to follow East Beltline, and M-37 turned southward on Broadmoor. The bypass route continued northward through Grand Rapids Township. At the <b>intersection</b> with US16/M-50 (Cascade Road), Byp. US16 ended, and Byp. M-21 ended {{less than half a}} mile (0.4km) north of that at the <b>intersection</b> with M-21 (Fulton Street). North of the <b>intersection</b> with Fulton Street, Byp. US131 was the only designation along East Beltline Avenue at the time. The highway ran northward into Plainfield Township, and it terminated at an <b>intersection</b> with US131 at Plainfield Avenue and Northland Drive just south of the Grand River.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} used Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) traces to {{successfully}} extract segments of road networks because such {{data can be}} rapidly updated at a low cost. However, most studies have not focused on extracting <b>intersections,</b> which are indispensable parts of road networks in terms of connectivity. However, extracted <b>intersections</b> often present unsatisfactory precision and misleading connectivity. This study proposes a novel method for extracting road <b>intersections</b> from Global Position System (GPS) trace points and for capturing <b>intersections</b> with better accuracy. The key to improving the geometric accuracy of <b>intersections</b> is to identify the dominant orientations of road segments around <b>intersections,</b> merge similar orientations and maintain independent conflicting orientations. Extracting <b>intersections</b> by aligning the dominant orientations can largely reduce location offsets and road distortions. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the increased accuracy and connectivity of extracted road <b>intersections</b> by the proposed method...|$|R
