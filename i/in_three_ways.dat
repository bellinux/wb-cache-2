25|$|Government {{authorities}} usually impose administrative entry {{restrictions on}} foreign citizens <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>ways</b> - countries whose nationals may enter without a visa, countries whose nationals may obtain a visa on arrival and countries whose nationals require a visa in advance. Nationals who require a visa in advance are usually advised to obtain {{them at a}} diplomatic mission of their destination country. Several countries allow nationals of countries that require a visa to obtain them online.|$|E
25|$|Close non-eclipsing {{binaries}} {{can also}} be photometrically detected by observing how the stars affect each other <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> First is by observing extra light which the stars reflect from their companion. Second is by observing ellipsoidal light variations which are caused by deformation of the star's shape by their companions. The third method is by looking at how relativistic beaming affects the apparent magnitude of the stars. Detecting binaries with these methods requires accurate photometry.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is used <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>ways</b> for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals {{spread it}} onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; pre-wetting, {{which means a}} liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pre-treating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads.|$|E

25|$|Yaska, in {{his famous}} text titled Nirukta, asserts that Rigveda in the ancient tradition, can be {{interpreted}} <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>ways</b> - {{from the perspective of}} religious rites (adhiyajna), {{from the perspective of the}} deities (adhidevata), and from the perspective of the soul (adhyatman). The fourth way to interpret the Rigveda also emerged in the ancient times, wherein the gods mentioned were viewed as symbolism for legendary individuals or narratives. It was generally accepted that creative poets often embed and express double meanings, ellipses and novel ideas to inspire the reader. Nirukta enables one to identify alternate embedded meanings that poets and writers may have included in old texts.|$|E
25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} {{commonly}} formed <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> In the laboratory, preparation is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, while mayor, {{he wrote}} his first book, The Social Worker, which set out many of the {{principles}} that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:In a civilised community, {{although it may be}} composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>ways</b> – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.|$|E
