The approach used to measure exchange rate pass-through is based on cointegration and error-correction modelling and the period of analysis is from 1979 to 1995. Full pass-through from the bilateral Irish pound-Sterling exchange rate and from UK producer costs could not be rejected for total and sectoral import unit values for the sample period 1979 q 1 - 1995 q 4. This implies no role for domestic competing prices in explaining the long-run relationship determining unit values of Irish imports from the UK.

Its {{focus is on the}} augmented FLQ formula (AFLQ) proposed by Flegg and Webber, 2000, which takes regional specialization explicitly into account. In our case study, we examine data for 20 Finnish regions, ranging in size from very small to very large, in order to assess the relative performance of the AFLQ formula in estimating regional <b>imports,</b> <b>total</b> intermediate inputs and output multipliers, and to determine an appropriate value for the parameter ? used in this formula. In this assessment, we use the Finnish survey-based national and regional input-output tables for 1995, which identify 37 separate sectors, as a benchmark. The results show that, in contrast with the other LQ-based formulae examined, the AFLQ is able to produce adequate estimates of output multipliers in all regions. However, some variation is required in the value of ? across regions in order to obtain satisfactory estimates. The case study also reveals that the AFLQ and its predecessor, the FLQ, yield very similar results. This finding indicates that the inclusion of a measure of regional specialization in the AFLQ formula is not helpful in terms of generating superior results.

40|$|As the world’s {{emerging}} economies {{increase their}} petroleum and coal use the inevitable repercussions of fossil fuel depend-ency {{will continue to}} escalate. Among these are eventual restrictions in supply and spiralling costs of energy as easily accessed reserves are depleted. Regardless of supply is an unequivocal imperative to take immediate and aggressive measures to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing fossil-fuel consumption and increasing our use of carbon-neutral or carbon-neg-ative fuels. Economic growth and development worldwide depend increasingly on secure supplies of reliable, affordable, clean energy, and climate stability and environmental security require carbon neutral alternatives. Alternative sources of energy are thus a priority for modern society, and chief among these is the only proven mechanism to convert solar energy into market-able fuels, this being photosynthesis in plants and algae.

40|$|Exports to Taiwan in 1990 via {{air freight}} were {{approximately}} $ 2. 9 billion, and imports via air freight {{to the united}} States were $ 3. 1 billion. Total U. S. exports/imports to/from Taiwan in 1990 were $ 11. 5 billion and $ 22. 7 billion, respectively. China Airlines operates three air cargo hubs in the united States: New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas. The real per capita Gross National Product (GNP) in Taiwan for 1989 was $ 7, 512, up from $ 3, 297 in 1985. This implies that the Taiwanese economy {{is one of the}} fastest growing economies in Asia. Trade volume between the united States and Taiwan has increased substantially over the last 10 years and is predicted to grow in the future. The objective of this study is to evaluate the economic feasibility of Fargo, North Dakota, as an air cargo handling facility for products shipped to (from) Taiwan. Two static transshipment models were used to determine the economic feasibility of an air cargo hub being located at Fargo. Both transshipment models minimized trucking costs of cargo from (to) customs districts to (from) air cargo hubs and air cargo costs from (to) hubs to (from) Taiwan for exports and <b>imports.</b> <b>Total</b> savings and market shares for both export and import models are presented by evaluating the feasibility of an air cargo hub at Fargo. The model, excluding Fargo as a cargo hub, results in $ 47 million in exports and $ 1. 7 million in imports. Including Fargo as a cargo hub at the New York rate saves $ 2. 73 million; at the Dallas rate, $ 2. 84 million; and at the Los Angeles rate, $ 3. 08 million. Fargo's market share is 11. 8 % for exports and 14. 8 % for imports. Fargo gains its entire market share for both exports and imports from New York for all models. In conclusion, this study indicates Fargo has a logistical advantage over New York and Dallas in shipping and receiving air cargo between Taiwan and Northern Plains states (Minnesota, Illinois, and Montana). This does not necessarily mean it would be economically feasible to place an air cargo hub at Fargo. In addition to logistics, economic feasibility depends on investment and operating costs, and a volume large enough to minimize per unit operating costs through economies of scale. vDemand and Price Analysis,...|$|E

40|$|Austria's {{accession}} to the European Community {{has created a}} new framework against which to evaluate Austria's foreign trade sector. The EU 15 is the world's largest exporter. In 1994, exports of the EU, including trade within the EU, accounted for two fifths of world trade, twice as much as the trade share of the USA (11. 8 percent) and of Japan (9. 7 percent) taken together. Even excluding intra-EU trade, which in 1994 amounted to one fourth of world trade, the EU is the world's largest exporter with a share of 20 percent. In the 1990 s though, the EU suffered market losses. Foreign trade of the EU is heavily concentrated: the three largest countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom) account {{for more than half of}} total exports; the largest six countries account for more than four fifths (81 percent) of EU exports. About one fourth of EU exports originate in Germany alone. The EU countries conduct the major part of their foreign trade with each other. Intra-EU exports total 63 percent of total exports of the EU; intra-EU <b>imports</b> <b>total</b> 61 percent of total imports of the EU. With a share of 65 percent, Austria's integration into the EU is slightly above average. Even though Austria is one of the smaller EU countries, countries which as a rule are intensively engaged in trade, the relation of exports to GDP was only 22. 7 percent, slightly above the EU average (22. 3 percent). The EU's exports to countries outside the EU (extra-EU exports) amounted to 8. 4 percent of GDP. This figure was lower than that for Japan (8. 6 percent) and slightly higher than that for the USA Thus, foreign trade plays approximately the same role in all the regions of the triad. 75 percent of Austria's intra-EU imports originate in those seven EU countries which are considered likely candidates for the EMU. In both France and Germany, this figure is only 55 percent. These two countries, therefore, have the utmost interest in maintaining strict exchange rate discipline in the envisaged "EMS II". Austria is mainly concerned with Italy's participation in the EMU, because in that case the share of EU trade not jeopardized by exchange rate fluctuations would rise above 90 percent. The importance of the developing countries as a market for EU exports rose substantially during the early 1990 s. Sales to the non-OPEC countries advanced very rapidly, while OPEC's share in exports declined. 17. 7 percent of total extra-EU exports or almost half of the exports to the developing countries go to the Far East; the corresponding figures are 7. 5 percent for the Middle East, 8. 1 percent for Africa, and 5. 7 percent for Latin America. In Austria, 22 percent of extra-EU exports were destined for the developing countries; Austria also had a relatively strong position in the OPEC (6 percent). Manufactured products dominate foreign trade of the EU: this group accounts for 84. 1 percent of total exports, and 78. 8 percent of total imports, with machinery and transport equipment constituting the most important items. The share of semi-manufactures (mostly low-grade goods used in manufacturing) in exports is substantially smaller in the EU (18. 2 percent) than in Austria (28. 9 percent); steel accounted for only 3. 5 percent of total EU exports (Austria 5. 3 percent); the figures for textiles are 3. 1 percent (4. 1 percent). As far as intermediary products are concerned, agricultural products with a share of 10 percent are the most important export items. Außenhandel der EU.
