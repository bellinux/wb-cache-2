50|$|Places & Spaces: Mapping Science is {{an internationally}} {{recognized}} science exhibition that demonstrates {{the power of}} maps to analyze, organize, and visualize abstract intellectual spaces. The exhibit showcases high-resolution maps that represent complex data in a visually understandable format. The maps featured in Places & Spaces were created by a global collection of experts {{in the fields of}} scientometrics, the natural, physical, and social sciences, visual arts, socio-political policymaking, and the humanities. By the end of 2014, the exhibit had collected 100 maps and various additional elements. The latter include Ingo Günther's WorldProcessor Globes, an <b>illuminated</b> <b>diagram</b> display, the Gapminder Card Game, hands-on science maps for kids, and the award-winning short film Humanexus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an innovative, mixed-media information visualization display method and system architecture for public learning exhibits. The system is scalable {{in the number}} and types of displays and flexible in its applicability {{to a range of}} data domains and interaction models. This work extends and improves the original <b>illuminated</b> <b>diagram</b> paradigm which merges static, ultra-resolution, hardcopy prints with dynamic, lower-resolution, softcopy graphics. In this paradigm, projected graphics are used to highlight relationships among the detailed information in the hardcopy prints. Multiple coordinated views enable the comparison of data between reference systems, and interactive queries employ brushing and linking methods to synchronize highlighted information between views. This system is applicable to any information visualization display where multiple, static reference maps can be used in unison to improve the exploration and understanding of very large data sets...|$|E

40|$|This book aims {{to dispel}} the mystery and fear {{experienced}} by students surrounding sequences, series, convergence, and their applications. The author, an accomplished female mathematician, achieves this by taking a problem solving approach, starting with fascinating problems and solving them step by step with clear explanations and <b>illuminating</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The reader will find the problems interesting, unusual, and fun, yet solved with the rigor expected in a competition. Some problems are taken directly from mathematics competitions, with the name and year of the exam provided for reference. Proof techniques are emphasized, {{with a variety of}} methods presented. The text aims to expand the mind of the reader by often presenting multiple ways to attack the same problem, as well as drawing connections with different fields of mathematics. Intuitive and visual arguments are presented alongside technical proofs to provide a well-rounded methodology. With nearly 300 problems including hints, answers, and solutions,Methods of Solving Sequences and Series Problems is an ideal resource for those learning calculus, preparing for mathematics competitions, or just looking for a worthwhile challenge. It can also be used by faculty who are looking for interesting and insightful problems that are not commonly found in other textbooks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of nonlinear conservation laws have long posed fascinating problems. With {{the introduction of}} some nonlinearity, e. g. Burgers' equation, discontinuous behavior in the solutions is exhibited, even for smooth initial data. The introduction of randomness in any of several forms into the initial condition makes the problem even more interesting. We present {{a broad spectrum of}} results from a number of works, both deterministic and random, to provide a diverse introduction to some of the methods of analysis for conservation laws. Some of the deep theorems are applied to discrete examples and <b>illuminated</b> using <b>diagrams.</b> Comment: 22 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study four {{operations}} defined on {{pairs of}} tableaux. Algorithms {{for the first}} three involve the familiar procedures of jeu de taquin, row insertion, and column insertion. The fourth operation, hopscotch, is new, although specialised versions have appeared previously. Like the other three operations, this new operation may be computed with a set of local rules in a growth diagram, and it preserves Knuth equivalence class. Each of these four operations gives rise to an a priori distinct theory of dual equivalence. We show that these four theories coincide. The four operations are linked via the involutive tableau operations of complementation and conjugation in an <b>illuminating</b> commutative <b>diagram...</b>|$|R

A power signal box (PSB) often has a number of signalmen operating multiple electric or computerized signalling panels and large <b>illuminated</b> track <b>diagrams</b> showing wide areas of operation. This makes traffic regulation much easier for signalmen to handle among themselves. In some cases, a Traffic Regulator is appointed, who may be consulted for train working decisions. Following the accident at Ladbroke Grove in 1999, it was resolved that supervisors should be appointed at key signal boxes. However, these supervisors are not train controllers. Similar appointments have been made at major signal boxes in New South Wales since 2003.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Constrained {{minimization}} problems considered here {{arise in}} the design of multi-dimensional subspace beamformers for radar, sonar, seismology, and wireless communications, and {{in the design of}} precoders and equalizers for digital communications. The problem is to minimize a quadratic form, under a set of linear or quadratic constraints. We derive the solutions to these problems and establish connections between them. We show that the quadratically-constrained problem can be solved by solving a set of linearly-constrained problems and then using a majorization argument and Poincare’s separation theorem to determine which linearly-constrained problem solves the quadratically-constrained one. In addition, we present <b>illuminating</b> circuit <b>diagrams</b> for our solutions, called generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) diagrams, which allow us to tie our constrained minimizations to linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimations.

50|$|The {{line from}} Epping to Ongar is a {{single-track}} line apart from at North Weald, which functioned {{as the only}} available passing loop for trains travelling in opposite directions. In 1888, however, {{the eastern end of}} the loop was severed and it was used only as a siding. The loop was restored in 1949 after transfer to London Transport, and a second (westbound) platform was built at this time, and both platforms were used from 1949 until 1976, the westbound track being lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box still sited on the southbound platform to this day. Until this occurred, North Weald was the last section of the Underground network to be signalled using mechanical semaphore signals. Although disused, the <b>illuminated</b> track <b>diagram</b> in the signal box continued to show the progress of trains until its closure.|$|R
50|$|The Parc Abbey Bible (London, British Library, Add. MS 14788, 14789, and 14790) is a 12th-century {{illuminated}} Bible. It {{was made}} in the Leuven region of Belgium at the Abbey of St. Mary of Parc. A colophon on folio 197 indicates that the codex was produced in 1148. The text is Latin and written in proto-gothic book script on vellum. The folios are 437 by 300 mm, with the text block being 340 by 240 mm. The manuscript is <b>illuminated</b> with miniatures, <b>diagrams,</b> decorated borders, and decorated initials. The decorated initials include historiated, inhabited, and foliate initials.|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{diagrams}} {{of politics}} {{could and should}} be iconic for political science {{in much the same}} way as supply-and-demand curves are in economics. Many fundamental problems of political science can be connected with them, and many different concepts—such as ideological constraint, cross-pressures, framing, agenda-setting, political competition, voting systems, and party systems, to name just a few—can be <b>illuminated</b> through spatial <b>diagrams.</b> Spatial diagrams raise questions and provide insights. They suggest polit-ical maneuvers, possible realignments, and political problems. They provide us with revealing images that aid memory and facilitate analysis. They are a powerful way to think about politics, and we could not do better than to feature them in our textbooks, to use them in our research, and to exhibit them as our brand—as our distinctive way of thinking about how the world works A rt seizes the senses, excites the emotions, and enliv-ens the intellect.
