40|$|A <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> is {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} high R/X (resistance/reactance) ratio and it is radial in nature. By design, a <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> system is not an active network, and it is normally designed {{in such a way}} that power flows from transmission system via distribution system to consumers. But in a situation when wind turbines are connected to the <b>distribution</b> <b>grid,</b> the power source will change from one source to two sources, in this case, network is said to be active. This may probably have an impact on the <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> to whenever the wind turbine is connected. The best way to know the impact of wind turbine on the <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> in question is by carrying out load flow analysis on that system with and without the connection of wind turbines. Two major fundamental calculations: the steady-state voltage variation at the PCC (point of common coupling) and the calculation of short-circuit power of the grid system at the POC (point of connection) are necessary before carrying out the load flow study on the <b>distribution</b> <b>grid.</b> This paper, therefore, considers these pre-load flow calculations that are necessary before carrying out load flow study on the test <b>distribution</b> <b>grid.</b> These calculations are carried out on a test distribution system...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel co-simulation is developed, {{to study the}} dynamic {{exchange}} of reactive power from a <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> to the transmission grid. This exchange is performed under a regulatory scheme. In particular, a <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> optimizer signals to the transmission grid the available reactive power interval at the distribution/transmission nodes every 15 minutes. A transmission grid optimizer uses this information to compute a reactive power set point, to stabilize the voltage in the transmission <b>grid.</b> The <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> optimizer receives this set point and translates it into settings for transformers and renewable generators. This strategy is tested on a running grid simulation, with the tools working in parallel.

40|$|The Dutch gas <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> faces several {{changes in}} the near future. Among others, the share of green gas will grow, the {{interaction}} with the electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> and local heat grids will increase, and the grid will transform from a mono-gas system to a multi-gas system. The gas <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> {{is likely to be}} expanded with novel components, e. g. blending stations, gas storage sites, and gas compressor stations. Furthermore, these changes require the currently passive gas <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> to become a smart gas grid that monitors and controls the gas pressure, gas flow, and gas quality. Therefore, the distribution service operators need to make investments in the gas <b>distribution</b> <b>grid.</b> When looking at for example the introduction of green gas, a decision tree on the optimal green gas supply configuration can be identified. Decisions in this respect consider, among others, the location of several process steps (perform the process step locally at a small scale or centrally at a larger scale) and the addition of components like a gas storage site or a compressor station. Due to the multitude of development options for the gas <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> {{and the fact that the}} best solution is largely dependent on the local situation and performance criteria (e. g.
