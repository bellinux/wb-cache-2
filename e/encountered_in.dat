40|$|Socioecological theory {{suggests}} that between-group competition {{is an important factor}} affecting the nature of primate social relationships. Between-group <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> macaques may involve female resource defense, male mate defense, and male resource defense. We observed between-group <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> two groups (a forest group and a temple group) of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata). We observed 102 <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> 875 h of observation of the forest group (1. 40 per 12 -h day) and 58 <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> 907 h of observation of the temple group (0. 77 per 12 -h day). Aggressive interactions between groups occurred in 32. 4 % and 29. 3 % of <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> the forest and temple groups, respectively. Overall, we found little support for the female resource defense hypothesis. Females in both groups rarely participated aggressively <b>in</b> between-group <b>encounters.</b> We found support for the male mate defense hypothesis. For example, males of the forest group were more aggressive during <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> the mating season than in the non-mating season. Males were also aggressive to females from their own group immediately following encounters. We also found partial support for the male resource defense hypothesis. <b>Encounters</b> <b>in</b> the forest group occurred in a feeding context more often than expected based on time budgets. Also, males in the temple group were more often aggressive <b>in</b> food-related <b>encounters</b> than <b>in</b> other <b>encounters.</b> The findings {{of this study suggest that}} socioecological models of primate social relationships need to distinguish male and female strategies during between-group encounters and integrate the resulting functional outcomes...|$|R
