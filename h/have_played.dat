25|$|Bush, Barratt and Priestley {{had been}} in the Slade Lucas tour to the West Indies two year previously.

Elliott <b>had</b> not <b>played</b> first class cricket before the tour while Williams and Leigh <b>had</b> not <b>played</b> first-class cricket for almost 10 years. However the remaining 7 <b>had</b> <b>played</b> first-class cricket in 1896 and so the team was clearly stronger than Lucas's two years earlier. In 1896 Palairet, Stanley and Woods <b>had</b> <b>played</b> for Somerset, Beldam and Stoddart for Middlesex, Stone for Leicestershire and Lewis for Oxford University. Stoddart <b>had</b> <b>played</b> for England during the 1896 season while Woods <b>had</b> <b>played</b> against South Africa in 1895-96. All the 13 played at least three first-class matches on the tour. G.A. Maclean played in a minor match.|$|R

5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan <b>have</b> <b>played</b> one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams <b>have</b> <b>played</b> twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they <b>have</b> <b>played</b> any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E
