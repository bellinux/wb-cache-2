2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete McCloskey gave {{an address}} to the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) in 2000. [...] When he ran in the 2006 Republican Party primary for congress, there was {{controversy}} over <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> about the Holocaust at the event. According to the San Jose Mercury News McCloskey said at the time, [...] "I don't know whether you are right or wrong about the Holocaust," [...] and referred to the [...] "so-called Holocaust". McCloskey replied that he has never questioned the existence of the Holocaust, and the 2000 quote referred to a debate over the number of people killed. McCloskey {{said in an interview with}} the Contra Costa Times on January 18, 2006 that the IHR transcript of his speech was inaccurate. Journalist Mark Hertsgaard of The Nation, in response to criticism of an article he wrote praising McCloskey's campaign against Pombo, stated that a tape he had viewed of McCloskey's speech to the IHR did not contain the [...] "right or wrong" [...] wording present in the transcript.|$|E

5000|$|Chen's theory {{had been}} that the market should {{supplement}} the plan. In the context of radical Maoism this made him seem like a social democratic proponent of market socialism. It turned out, however, that Chen meant <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> was much less enthusiastic about the market than Deng Xiaoping and Deng's younger colleagues. Although in his [...] "secret" [...] pronouncements of 1979 Chen had shown an unusual personal disdain for Mao, he also indicated he shared the late Chairman's worries that China would abandon socialism and revert to capitalism.|$|R

He {{knew that}} the story {{was not a very}} {{unlikely}} one, for while, in view of the simplicity of the Canadian land tenure legislation, {{there is no reason why}} any man should be swindled, as a matter of fact, a good many are. He was also irritated that he had allowed himself to indulge in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> realized must have appeared a puerile threat. This was, of course, of no moment in itself, but he felt that it showed how he was losing hold of the nice discretion he had, at least, affected in England.

'I mustn't make that poor little head of yours ache with Scotch law,' my uncle said; 'I must put it plainly. There are marriages allowed in Scotland, Blanche, which are called Irregular Marriages--and very abominable things they are. But they have this accidental merit in the present case.

I couldn't say anything to that, seeing what a house we've got to-night, except to bid him look out to the horizon where the sun will shortly shine. In other words, I told him that business was about to buck up and that later on he would be going about the place with a sprained wrist from clipping coupons. But he refused to be cheered, cursed me some more for ruining his piece, and ended by begging me to buy his share of it cheap." ...|$|E

On the final hand of the game, Matloubi tried to bluff Ungar all-in for $32,000 on the river with a board of 3-3-7-K-Q. Ungar, who held 10-9, thought for a few seconds and said to Matloubi, [...] "You have 4-5 or 5-6 so I'm gonna call you with this" [...] and flipped over his 10-high to win the pot and bust Matloubi, who in fact held <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Ungar <b>said</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|R
2500|$|Lasers {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 57, based on 27 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Allmusic editor Andy Kellman gave it {{three out of}} five stars and criticized its [...] "lumbering, overwrought choruses", writing that [...] "If there is one MC whose rhymes should not be dulled {{for the sake of}} chasing pop trends, it’s Lupe Fiasco". Jeff Leven of Paste gave Lasers a six out of 10 rating and found its musical arrangements polished and [...] "radio-friendly". The Guardians Alex Macpherson viewed its content as a concession to pop music trends, panning its [...] "synthy choruses" [...] and [...] "trite empowerment anthems". Andy Gill of The Independent gave the album two out of five stars and criticized Fiasco's lyrics, stating [...] "while his flow has a nice bounce and monotonal glide, too many tracks end with one wondering <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>he's</b> <b>said,</b> if anything at all". David Amidon of PopMatters panned the album as [...] "a disgustingly awkward effort from everyone involved [...] Listenability? Credibility? These, Lasers is lacking in seismic qualities". Brandon Soderberg of Spin found it to be affected by crossover tendencies and wrote that [...] "Lasers works best, however, when the grabby hooks, electro beats, and conscious rap rants are all turned down a notch". Los Angeles Times writer Todd Martens shared a similar sentiment and commented that the album [...] "feels more like a compromise than a cohesive album". Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen criticized the album for [...] "surveying the current pop-rap landscape and retaining nothing worthwhile", commenting that [...] "Lasers simply sounds bad, playing against every single one of Lupe Fiasco's strengths and creating new weaknesses".|$|R
60|$|The King's swarthy {{face turned}} {{a variety of}} colours, his languid eyes lost all trace of languor. Those who knew his nature might have {{expected}} that he would now deliver himself with that sneering sarcasm, that indolent cynicism, which he used upon occasion. But he was too deeply stirred for acting. His self-control deserted him entirely. <b>Exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> has not been preserved for us. All that we are told is that he signified his resentment in such terms as he had never before used; and that his Grace, almost petrified by the King's most royal rage, uttered never a word in answer. The windows of the room overlooked the Thames. The King's eyes strayed towards them. Richmond was slight of build, Charles vigorous and athletic. His Grace took the door betimes lest the window should occur to his Majesty, and so he left the lady alone with the outraged monarch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Whistler," [...] adds Professor Raleigh, [...] "always laughed first." [...] The truth is, I believe, that Whistler never {{laughed at}} all. There was no {{laughter}} in his nature; {{because there was}} no thoughtlessness and self-abandonment, no humility. I cannot understand anybody reading [...] "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies" [...] and thinking that there is any laughter in the wit. His wit is a torture to him. He twists himself into arabesques of verbal felicity; he is full of a fierce carefulness; he is inspired with the complete seriousness of sincere malice. He hurts himself to hurt his opponent. Browning did laugh, because Browning did not care; Browning did not care, because Browning was a great man. And when Browning said in brackets to the simple, sensible people who did not like his books, [...] "God love you!" [...] he was not sneering in the least. He was laughing--that is to say, he meant <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Whereupon {{he burst}} {{out into a}} long story in German and English, so mixed up that I could not quite {{understand}} <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but roughly I gathered that long ago, hundreds of years, men had died there and been buried in their graves; and sounds were heard under the clay, and when the graves were opened, {{men and women were}} found rosy with life, and their mouths red with blood. And so, in haste to save their lives (aye, and their souls!--and here he crossed himself) those who were left fled away to other places, where the living lived, and the dead were dead and not--not something. He was evidently afraid to speak the last words. As he proceeded with his narration, he grew more and more excited. It seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him, and he ended in a perfect paroxysm of fear--white-faced, perspiring, trembling and looking round him, as if expecting that some dreadful presence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the open plain. Finally, in an agony of desperation, he cried: ...|$|E
