5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> cup of hot chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer {{than any of his}} English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|The {{flavonoids}} {{found in}} the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also {{have a positive effect}} on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E

25|$|Éamon de Valera {{worried about}} O'Kelly's {{drinking}} habits, which were much commented on during his career. O'Kelly <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> lot, and often, yet his behaviour remained dignified and above reproach {{and he never}} caused any scandal. The author, Monsignor Pádraig Ó Fiannachta, reported that President O'Kelly kept barrels of draught Guinness stout on tap in Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E
25|$|Jie {{was also}} a known alcoholic, {{but he did not}} drink regular wine. He <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> type of pure alcohol wine (清醇). The people working for him who could not supply this drink were killed. Many people died because of this. And while he was {{drinking}} wine it was required that he ride on someone’s back like a horse.|$|E

She was still living alone in her home on her 115th birthday. In 2016 she credited her long life to her diet of raw eggs and cookies, and to staying single.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, the {{infestation}} was eradicated, {{but both}} the Governor's delay and {{the scale of}} the action has remained controversial ever since. Some people claimed that malathion was toxic to humans, as well as insects. In response to such concerns, Brown's chief of staff, B. T. Collins, staged a news conference during which he publicly <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> glass of malathion. Many people complained that, while the malathion may not have been very toxic to humans, the aerosol spray containing it was corrosive to car paint.|$|E
25|$|The race saw him break Indianapolis victory lane {{tradition}} when he <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> celebratory {{bottle of}} orange juice instead of the traditional bottle of milk. He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. He was widely criticized and ridiculed for the action, even though he later {{took a sip of}} milk after the television cameras were off.|$|E
25|$|The H. pylori {{hypothesis}} was initially poorly received, so {{in an act}} of self-experimentation Marshall <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> Petri dish containing a culture of organisms extracted from a person with an ulcer and five days later developed gastritis. His symptoms disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since halitosis is one of the symptoms of infection. This experiment was published in 1984 in the Australian Medical Journal and is among the most cited articles from the journal.|$|E

25|$|Hanson {{returned}} to Boston and married her third husband, George Kinney on November 26, 1836. Kinney was a known gambler and drunkard, and {{was five years}} Hanson's junior. His business collapsed soon after the wedding, and Hanson began supporting her husband and then three children through {{her work as a}} seamstress. In 1840, Kinney was treated for syphilis, which he had contracted through a sexual affair with a mistress. On August 9, 1840, Kinney <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> cup of herbal tea and died painfully afterward.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Goram, he {{overheated}} while hard at work, <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> giant {{quantity of}} ale, {{and fell asleep}} in his favourite (stone) chair, whilst Vincent paced himself better and completed his channel. (One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical point is to explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The onomastic point is {{to account for the}} name of the Avon Gorge, but this is a bit feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E

Hayley {{was diagnosed with}} a terminal cancer of the pancreas after a check-up in 2013. Hayley decided to end her life before she succumbs to her illness much to the despair of her husband Roy Cropper. Roy reluctantly agreed to his wife's demands and Hayley <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> concoction of mashed up pills and died in bed of an overdose with her husband lying beside her.|$|E

25|$|A {{price of}} 1 million copper coins {{was placed on}} Lao Ai's head if he was taken alive or half a million if dead. Lao Ai's {{supporters}} were captured and beheaded; then Lao Ai was tied up and torn to five pieces by horse carriages, while his entire family was executed to the third degree. The two hidden sons were also killed, while mother Zhao Ji was placed under house arrest until her death many years later. Lü Buwei <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> cup of poison wine and committed suicide in 235 BC. Ying Zheng then assumed full power as the King of the Qin state.

25|$|Several {{times he}} {{prepared}} to head out, but each time was detained by the threats of his enemies in Piedmont or by economic restraints which compelled him to mortgage his marquisate to Frederick II. Finally, he cowed some cities into giving him aid in men. Nevertheless, he was present at Capua, Ferentino, and Sora with Frederick II in February 1223. Delayed again and again, he <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> toast at Brindisi to his setting off in 1225, but he fell ill at the last minute. His fleet remained in port until Spring 1226, when, under urging from Honorius, it finally cast off. The delays had been fatal and William himself died at Almyros on 17 September. The rest of his army {{was hit by a}} dysentery epidemic and melted away.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative gastric bypass {{patients}} {{develop a}} lowered tolerance {{for alcoholic beverages}} because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol {{at a faster rate}} than people who have not undergone the surgery. It also takes a post-operative patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 post-operative patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> 5 oz. glass of red wine and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The Doolittle Raiders held {{an annual}} reunion almost {{every year from}} the late 1940s to 2013. The high point of each reunion was a solemn, private {{ceremony}} in which the surviving Raiders performed a roll call, then toasted their fellow Raiders who had died during the previous year. Specially engraved silver goblets, {{one for each of}} the 80 Raiders, were used for this toast; the goblets of those who have died were inverted. Each Raider's name was engraved on his goblet both right side up and upside down. The Raiders <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> toast using a bottle of cognac that accompanied the goblets to each Raider reunion. In 2013, the remaining Raiders decided to hold their last public reunion at Fort Walton Beach, Florida, not far from Eglin Air Force Base, where they trained for the original mission. The bottle and the goblets had been maintained by the United States Air Force Academy on display in Arnold Hall, the cadet social center, until 2006. On 19 April 2006, these memorabilia were transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.|$|E
