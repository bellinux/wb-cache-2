25|$|Apposition eyes work by {{gathering}} {{a number}} of images, one from each eye, and combining them in the brain, with each eye typically contributing a single point of information. The typical apposition eye has a lens <b>focusing</b> <b>light</b> from one direction on the rhabdom, while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium.|$|E
25|$|Using a {{plane of}} light formed by <b>focusing</b> <b>light</b> through a {{cylindrical}} lens at a narrow angle or by scanning {{a line of}} light in a plane perpendicular to the axis of objective, high resolution optical sections can be taken. Single plane illumination, or light sheet illumination, is also accomplished using beam shaping techniques incorporating multiple-prism beam expanders. The images are captured by CCDs. These variants allow very fast and high {{signal to noise ratio}} image capture.|$|E

25|$|The human cornea borders {{with the}} sclera via the corneal limbus. In lampreys, the cornea is solely an {{extension}} of the sclera, and is separate from the skin above it, but in more advanced vertebrates it is always fused with the skin to form a single structure, albeit one composed of multiple layers. In fish, and aquatic vertebrates in general, the cornea plays no role in <b>focusing</b> <b>light,</b> since it has virtually the same refractive index as water.|$|E
25|$|The {{human eye}} {{functions}} by <b>focusing</b> <b>light</b> onto {{a layer of}} photoreceptor cells called the retina, which forms the inner lining {{of the back of}} the eye. The focusing is accomplished by a series of transparent media. Light entering the eye passes first through the cornea, which provides much of the eye's optical power. The light then continues through the fluid just behind the cornea—the anterior chamber, then passes through the pupil. The light then passes through the lens, which focuses the light further and allows adjustment of focus. The light then passes through the main body of fluid in the eye—the vitreous humour, and reaches the retina. The cells in the retina line the back of the eye, except for where the optic nerve exits; this results in a blind spot.|$|E

40|$|<b>Focused</b> <b>light</b> field camera {{can be used}} {{to measure}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) temperature field of a flame because of its ability to record intensity and direction information of each ray from flame simultaneously. This work aims to develop a suitable geometric calibration method of <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> field camera for 3 -D flame temperature measurement. A modified method based on Zhang's camera calibration is developed to calibrate the camera and the measurement system. A single focused light-field camera is used to capture images of bespoke calibration board for calibration in this study. Geometric parameters including intrinsic (i. e., camera parameters) and extrinsic (i. e., camera connecting with the calibration board) of the <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> field camera are calibrated to trace the ray projecting onto each pixel on CCD (charge-coupled device) sensor. Instead of using line features, corner point features are directly utilized for the calibration. The characteristics of <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> field camera including one 3 -D point corresponding to several image points and matching main lens and microlens f-numbers, are used for calibration. Results with a <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> field camera are presented and discussed. Preliminary 3 -D temperature distribution of a flame is also investigated and presented...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} of the mammalian eye owes itself completely {{to the task of}} <b>focusing</b> <b>light</b> onto the retina. This light causes chemical changes in the photosensitive cells of the retina, the products of which trigger nerve impulses which travel to the brain.|$|E
30|$|Light sheet {{microscopy}} {{became a}} popular tool allowing fast imaging with reduced out of <b>focus</b> <b>light.</b> However, when light penetrates turbid media such as biological tissues, multiple scattering scrambles the illumination into a speckle pattern and severely challenges conventional fluorescence imaging with <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> {{or with a}} light sheet. In this article, we present generation of light sheet type illumination patterns despite scattering.|$|R

Such lenses can be made very thin and lightweight. Binary-optic microlenses <b>focus</b> <b>light</b> by diffraction. They have grooves with stepped edges or multilevels that approximate the ideal shape. They have advantages in fabrication and replication by using standard semiconductor processes such as photolithography and RIE.|$|R

50|$|Most {{microtubule}} inhibitors affect both cancerous {{and healthy}} cells, requiring lower doses to avoid severe side effects. Because photostatins are inactive {{in the absence}} of light, they only affect cells that are illuminated. <b>Focusing</b> <b>light</b> on tumors directs their activities to appropriate targets with fewer side effects.|$|E

50|$|Many {{digital cameras}} have preset modes for {{different}} applications. Within {{the constraints of}} correct exposure various parameters can be changed, including exposure, aperture, <b>focusing,</b> <b>light</b> metering, white balance, and equivalent sensitivity. For example, a portrait might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{implementation}} of an on-chip microscope system, termed fluorescence optofluidic microscope (FOFM), which is capable of fluorescence microscopy imaging of samples in fluid media. The FOFM employs an array of Fresnel zone plates (FZP) to generate an array of <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> spots within a microfluidic channel. As a sample flows through the channel and across the array of <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> spots, the fluorescence emissions are collected by a filter-coated CMOS sensor, which serves as the channel’s floor. The collected data can then be processed to render fluorescence microscopy images at a resolution determined by the <b>focused</b> <b>light</b> spot size (experimentally measured as 0. 65 mm FWHM). In our experiments, our established resolution was 1. 0 mm due to Nyquist criterion consideration. As a demonstration, we show that such a system {{can be used to}} image the cell nuclei stained by Acridine Orange and cytoplasm labeled by Qtracker...|$|R
5000|$|Although antimuscarinic drops (homoatropine 5%) can {{be applied}} topically to relax the muscle, this leaves the {{individual}} without any accommodation and, depending on refractive error, unable to see well at near distances. Also, excessive pupil dilation may occur as an unwanted side effect. This dilation may pose a problem since a larger pupil is less efficient at <b>focusing</b> <b>light</b> (see pupil, aperture, and optical aberration for more.) ...|$|E
