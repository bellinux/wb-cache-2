In 2005, Jordan talked to <b>Ed</b> <b>Bradley</b> of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah."

500|$|More than 50 {{years since}} its release, [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] remains highly regarded, as {{measured}} by polls of reviewers and fellow songwriters. A 2002 ranking by Uncut and a 2005 poll in Mojo both rated it as Dylan's number one song. As for his personal views on such polls, Dylan told <b>Ed</b> <b>Bradley</b> in a 2004 interview on 60 Minutes that he never pays attention to them, because they change frequently. Dylan's point was illustrated in the [...] "100 Greatest Songs of All Time poll" [...] by Mojo in 2000, which included two Dylan singles, but not [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". Five years later, the magazine named it his number one song. Rolling Stone picked [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] as the number two single of the past 25 years in 1989, and then in 2004 placed the song at number one on its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".

500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist <b>Ed</b> <b>Bradley.</b> Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." [...] Robie Mortin described her past this way: [...] "I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't angry or anything." ...|$|E
