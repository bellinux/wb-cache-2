40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{proposed}} for the determination of effective rain cell <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>orientation.</b> Two rain cell models were considered: the circular cell and the elliptical cell. In both models {{it is assumed that}} the rain rate is constant throughout the cell, that all cell locations are equally likely, and that the cell dimensions depend upon the rain rate. It is then shown that the effective cell <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> may be deduced from rain rate statistics accumulated at two or three closely spaced sites, depending upon the model chosen. The results of this study alone with previous estimates of rain cell dimension indicate that the rain rate measurement points should be spaced on the order of one-half kilometer apart. The proposed method is simple and relatively inexpensive; thus, this approach is readily suited {{to the study of the}} dependence of rain cell size and orientation upon climatic region. The resulting rain cell characteristics are of direct value in the prediction of millimeter wavelength attenuation statistics on both single-terminal and diversity earth-space propagation paths as well as point-to-point terrestrial links...|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the morphological characteristics of palatine rugae and to assess the existence of side asymmetry in them in Sudanese Arabs. It also assesses the possibility of determining sex using logistic regression. One hundred dental casts for 50 males and 50 females aged between 18 and 23 were studied for palatal rugae <b>dimensions,</b> shapes, <b>and</b> <b>orientations,</b> as well as sexual dimorphism and side symmetry. The most predominant rugae were primary, and the most prevalent shapes in both sexes were wavy, curved, and straight forms. The predominant orientation was forward. Side asymmetry existed more in the orientations than in the shapes, but no side asymmetry was recorded in the dimensions. There was no significant sexual dimorphism in the rugae <b>dimensions,</b> shapes, <b>and</b> <b>orientations,</b> except for forward-directed rugae (P< 0. 037). A predictive value of 60 % was obtained in assigning sex using <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> of 58 % using shapes alone.

40|$|Graphite monochromators {{are known}} to give rise to non-homogeneous primary X-ray beams. When intensities of single {{crystals}} are measured the effective cross section of a non-spherical crystal in the X-ray beam depends on its orientation in the beam. Therefore, systematic errors in the measured integrated intensities are introduced by the inhomogeneity of the incoming beam. A correction for these errors can be made, knowing the intensity profile of the primary beam and the <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> of the crystal in the beam. The correction can conveniently be applied with the absorption correction. Examples of the corrections are given for crystals with rational boundary planes. It is shown that the intensity of an X-ray reflection {{as a function of}} the rotation about the scattering vector (~ rotation) can be calculated with fair accuracy.

Each agent is able to measure its relative position <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> with respect to its neighbors.

The convergence to the desired configuration is shown by comparing the system with time-varying orientations with the equivalent approach with fixed rotations, showing that their difference vanishes as time goes to infinity.
