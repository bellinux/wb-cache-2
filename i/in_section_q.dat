On October 20, 1944, his division was paired with the 1st Cavalry Division within X Corps, and the two divisions made an assault landing at Leyte. When Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, the Japanese forces stationed on the island concentrated their fire on the waves of incoming troops from gun positions located in a palm grove bounded by submerged rice paddies. When Wai arrived on the beach in the fifth wave, he found the soldiers there to be leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for tertiary structural interaction(s) (interactions(s) between two regions of an RNA molecule that are widely separated in the RNA sequence) within the 5 '-one {{third of the}} 16 S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli that constitutes the binding site of protein S 4. The two main interacting RNA regions were separated by about 120 nucleotides (<b>sections</b> <b>Q</b> to M) of the 16 S RNA sequence. A second, smaller gap, of 13 nucleotides, occurred within section C". The two main interacting regions contain about 150 nucleotides (<b>sections</b> H" to <b>Q)</b> and 160 nucleotides (sections M to C"). They are folded back on one another and, especially {{in the presence of}} protein S 4, are strongly protected against ribonuclease digestion. The intermediate region (<b>sections</b> <b>Q</b> to M), however, is relatively accessible to ribonucleases in the S 4 -RNP. By partial removal of subfragments from the RNA complex it was possible to localise the two main interacting sites within sections H" - H and sections I" - C". Three main criteria for the specificity of the RNA-RNA interactions were invoked and satisfied. The possibility of other tertiary structural RNA-RNA interactions occurring in other regions of the 16 S RNA is discussed.

30|$|Beats, {{that can}} be defined as a sense of equally spaced {{temporal}} units [41], can also be detected to merge combinations with a quantization grid. Once the beats are estimated (for example with a beat tracking algorithm like BeatRoot [42]), a grid split with a given beat divisor 1 /q can be used, assuming that the minimum note duration is q. For instance, if q = 4, each inter-beat interval can be split <b>in</b> <b>q</b> <b>sections.</b> Then, the combinations of the frames that belong to the quantization unit can be merged to obtain the results at each minimum grid unit. Like in the onset detection scheme, the success rate of this approach depends on the success of the beat estimation. The extended method can be applied using any of these schemes. The adequate choice of the architecture depends on the signal to be analysed. For instance, for timbres with sharp attacks, it is recommended to use onset information, which is very reliable for these kind of sounds. These alternative architectures have been perceptually evaluated using some example real songs, but a more rigorous evaluation of these schemes is left for future study, since an aligned dataset of real musical pieces with symbolic data is required for this task.|$|R
