40|$|Background: Patients with {{thalassemia}} major {{are largely}} transfusion dependent {{and are thus}} exposed {{to a variety of}} risks such as transmission of infectious diseases, iron overload and alloimmunization. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of human immune deficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and red cell antibodies among multiple-transfused thalassemic patients in and around the national capital region. Materials and Methods: The Department of Transfusion Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, conducted this study in collaboration with the National Thalassemia Welfare Society over a period of 1 year starting February 2011. Blood samples from the patients were tested for blood group, red cell alloantibody/ies, anti-HIV, anti-HCV and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by ELISA and for the respective viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by nucleic acid testing (NAT). Results: A total of 462 thalassemics which consists of 290 males and 172 females were tested. The overall alloimmunization rate was 4. 1 % and anti-Kell was the most common antibody identified. Thirteen cases (2. 8 %) were positive for HBsAg by ELISA, 107 (23. 1 %) were reactive for anti HCV and 11 (2. 38 %) for anti HIV antibodies. Further screening and discriminatory assays by NAT confirmed the presence of HBV DNA in 11 cases, HIV RNA in 7 cases and HCV RNA in 48 cases. Conclusion: In spite of advances in Immunohematology and <b>infectious</b> <b>marker</b> testing in recent years, the rates of alloimmunization and <b>infectious</b> <b>marker</b> positivity remains high among multiply transfused patients like thalassemics. Provision of safe and adequate blood supply to these patients is a key to improving their quality-of-life and longevity...|$|E
40|$|Pursuit of {{pharmaceutical}} {{purity of the}} blood in the bag {{has led to a}} shrinking donor base and a significantly more expensive product. Decisions regarding new <b>infectious</b> <b>marker</b> testing and donor deferrals have typically been made emphasizing decreasing one specific risk without considering the effect the intervention will have on the overall safety and availability of blood transfusion. Regulations have been formulated by governmental agencies with limited input from the medical community. The decision making process has lacked risk benefit analyses and has not had the robustness associated with spirited discussions. Policies made in this manner may result in certain risks being decreased but can also have adverse unintended consequences.

40|$|Infection {{during the}} {{neonatal}} period commonly induces apnea episodes, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1 β {{may serve as}} a critical mediator between these events. To determine the mechanism by which IL- 1 β depresses respiration, we examined a prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) -dependent pathway in newborn mice and human neonates. IL- 1 β and transient anoxia rapidly induced brainstem-specific microsomal prostaglandin E synthase- 1 (mPGES- 1) activity in neonatal mice. Furthermore, IL- 1 β reduced respiratory frequency during hyperoxia and depressed hypoxic gasping and autoresuscitation in mPGES- 1 wild-type mice, but not in mPGES- 1 knockout mice. In wild-type mice, PGE 2 induced apnea and irregular breathing patterns in vivo and inhibited brainstem respiratory rhythm generation in vitro. Mice lacking the EP 3 receptor (EP 3 R) for PGE 2 exhibited fewer apneas and sustained brainstem respiratory activity, demonstrating that PGE 2 exerts its respiratory effects via EP 3 R. In human neonates, the <b>infectious</b> <b>marker</b> C-reactive protein was correlated with elevated PGE 2 in the cerebrospinal fluid, and elevated central PGE 2 was associated with an increased apnea frequency. We conclude that IL- 1 β adversely affects breathing and its control by mPGES- 1 activation and PGE 2 binding to brainstem EP 3 receptors, resulting in increased apnea frequency and hypoxia-induced mortality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{prediction}} of infection, including maternal chorioamnionitis and early-onset neonatal infection, remains a critical challenge {{in cases of}} preterm rupture of membranes and may influence obstetrical management. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the predictive value for early-onset neonatal infection and maternal histological and clinical chorioamnionitis of maternal biological markers in routine use at or after 34 weeks of gestation in women with premature rupture of membranes. Methods We conducted a two-center prospective study of all women admitted for premature rupture of membranes at or after 34 weeks of gestation. The association of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, vaginal sample bacteriological results, and a prediction model at admission, for early-onset neonatal infection and maternal chorioamnionitis were analyzed by comparing areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves and specificity. Results The study included 399 women. In all, 4. 3 % of the newborns had an early-onset neonatal infection and 5. 3 % of the women had clinical chorioamnionitis. Histological chorioamnionitis was detected on 10. 8 % of 297 placentas tested. White blood cell counts and C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly associated with early-onset neonatal infection and included in a prediction model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this model was 0. 82 (95 % CI [0. 72, 0. 92]) and of C-reactive protein, 0. 80 (95 % CI [0. 68, 0. 92]) (p = 1. 0). Specificity was significantly higher for C-reactive protein than for the prediction model (48 % and 43 % respectively, p Conclusions The concentration of C-reactive protein at admission for premature rupture of membranes is the most accurate <b>infectious</b> <b>marker</b> for {{prediction of}} early-onset neonatal infection in routine use with a sensitivity > 90 %.

40|$|The {{breathing}} pattern of infants, particularly preterm infants, is often irregular or periodic and is frequently interrupted by apnea The latter represents {{a major concern}} in haematology, yet much remains unknown about its incidence, appearance, and pathophysiology. This thesis further characterizes cardiorespiratory activity in preterm infants during postnatal development and investigates the association between infection and apnea in neonates, focusing on the mediatory role of interleukin- 1 â and prostaglandin E 2 in depressing central respiration. Cardiorespiratory activity was evaluated in extremely preterm infants between birth and term-equivalent age using impedance pneumography, electrocardiography, and pulse oximetry. The incidence of apnea bradycardia, and hypoxemia diminished with advancing age, although these events often persisted at term-equivalent age and after hospital discharge. Infection was clearly {{associated with an increased}} apnea and hypoxemia incidence. To further elucidate the association between infection and apnea respiration was examined in neonatal rodents using whole-body plethysmography after administration of the cytokine interleukin- 1 â (IL- 1 â) or the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Animals given IL- 1 â or LPS exhibited a lower respiratory frequency, depressed anoxic gasping, and a reduced ability to autoresuscitate following hypoxic apnea compared to control animals. Hyperoxic challenge revealed functioning peripheral chemoreceptors in all animals, suggesting a central mechanism underlying the ventilatory effects of these immunomodulators. However, IL- 1 â did not affect the respiration-related activity in neonatal rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations, indicating that it may communicate indirectly with this central respiratory network. Thus, the role of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in mediating the central ventilatory effects of IL- 1 â was explored. In newborn infants, the <b>infectious</b> <b>marker</b> C-reactive protein was correlated with an elevated PGE 2 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, which in turn was associated with an increased apnea frequency. In newborn rodents, PGE 2 reversibly inhibited brainstem respiratory activity in vitro and induced apnea and irregular {{breathing pattern}}s in vivo. Moreover, IL- 1 â rapidly induced brainstem microsomal prostaglandin E synthase- 1 (mPGES- 1), an enzyme crucial for PGE 2 biosynthesis. Pretreatment with indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, clearly attenuated the adverse effects of IL- 1 â and LPS on basal respiration and anoxic ventilatory response in neonatal rats. Additionally, MPGES- 1 knockout mice did not exhibit IL- 1 â induced depression of hyperoxic response, hypoxic gasping, or autoresuscitation. Similarly, mice lacking the EP 3 receptor for PG 2 E had fewer PGE 2 -induced apneas in vivo and no PGE 2 -induced inhibition of brainstem respiratory activity in vitro compared to wildtype mice. These findings strongly suggest that IL- 1 â alters breathing and hypoxic defense via central mPGES- 1 activation and subsequent PGE 2 binding to brainstem EP 3 receptors. These studies have important clinical implications for the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of neonatal apnea associated with infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect {{infectious}} agents is a prerequisite to the treatment and containment of transmittable diseases. Many diagnostics assays are based upon the detection of antibodies in serum against the infectious agent and often rely on ELISA or agglutination based assays to determine the infectious status. Using function-spacer-lipid (FSL) constructs bearing peptides (1) representative of an infectious agent attached to human red blood cells, offers a potential alternative diagnostic approach to the detection of antibody-defined infections. Using the syphilis spirochaete as a model, and a peptide selection algorithm, a series of FSL constructs were created and attached to human red cells creating syphilis-kodecytes. These kodecytes were then tested in routine blood typing platforms against serum from patients and blood donors of known syphilis status. This approach has already been successfully used to detect ethnic specific blood group antibodies (1). It was found that syphilis-kodecytes used in blood grouping platforms are capable of the same sensitivity and specificity as ELISA and Particle Agglutination assays. The ability to engineer the FSL construct and replace the functional peptide for other <b>infectious</b> <b>markers</b> allows for a highly flexible and rapid-development technique {{for the detection of}} antibodydefined <b>infectious</b> agent <b>markers,</b> and may be an important lowtechnology tool for use in epidemics and pandemics, particularly in third world environments...|$|R

MethodsIn this prospective study, 43 mothers who delivered earlier than 35 gestational weeks and their 57 infants were evaluated clinically and with laboratory findings. Placentas and umbilical cords were investigated histopathologically for chorioamnionitis and funisitis. ResultsThe overall frequency of clinical and histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) was 8. 3 % and 23. 2 %, respectively. The frequency of HCA was 47. 3 % and 83. 3 % in mothers delivered < 32 weeks and < 30 weeks, respectively. Maternal demographic and clinical findings and also leukocyte and C-reactive protein values were not indicative of HCA. Infants of mothers with HCA had significantly lower Apgar scores together with higher SNAP-PE-II and CRIB scores. These infants had increased mechanical ventilator and surfactant requirements, higher incidences of patent ductus arteriosus, early sepsis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and higher mortality rates. The effect of HCA on neonatal morbidity and mortality was more prominent than the effect of low birthweight and lower gestational age. ConclusionChorioamnionitis not only causes premature deliveries, but is also associated with neonatal complications and increased mortality.

The preparation of blood components increased from 60 % to 98. 2 %. The most transfused blood components were red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and fresh frozen plasma. In addition to transfusion activities, there were other departments performing antenatal serology, tissue typing, special investigations, and reagent preparation. Despite the progress made, some challenges remain, namely, legal framework and haemovigilance system. A regulatory system for blood needs to be established...|$|R
40|$|Background: Blood donor {{screening}} is {{the most}} effective measure to prevent transfusion transmitted infectious agents. In each region, the healthcare authorities provide locally specific suitable screening. In Slovenia, screening for various viral markers has been implemented soon after the recognition of the agents and availability of testing techniques. Methods: A twenty-year period of uniform screening in the independent state of Slovenia is presented. Methods and techniques have been changed several times. Currently, we perform serological screening with Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA). Direct detection of viral genome is performed with the NAT method of Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA). Results: Results of testing and the frequency of detected <b>infectious</b> <b>markers</b> among donors are presented. During the period, prevalence rates for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-Treponema pallidum declined significantly over time. The yield of HIV screening is constant, despite a higher prevalence rate of HIV infection in general population. In the last five years, we detected on average 12 carriers of HBsAg, 5 donors with antiHCV antibodies, 0 – 2 persons infected with HIV and 10 with syphilis. In twenty years, we screened more than one and a half million of donations and detected more than 1, 000 donors with transfusion-transmitted infection. In the year 1991, 1 positive donation was detected in 1, 407 tested, compared to significantly decreased number of infections in 2009 – 1 in 3, 550 (p < 0, 0001). Conclusions: In the last twenty years, the number of donors with detected viral markers and deferred from blood donations has declined. Nowadays, blood supply is safe also owing to current approaches in blood screening...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{article has}} two objectives: (1) to present for {{countries}} and territories of the Region of the Americas data {{on the number of}} blood donations, proportion of voluntary blood donors versus remunerated blood donors, coverage of screening for infectious agents, and separation of donated blood into its components and (2) to explore the relationships of those characteristics with economic and organizational factors in the {{countries and territories}}. METHODS: We carried out comparative analyses using population and health information gathered annually by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) from national health officials from the countries in the Americas, as well as economic information (gross national product (GNP) per capita) obtained from publications of the World Bank. RESULTS: There is a direct correlation between the availability of blood for transfusion and GNP per capita. Seven countries with a GNP per capita above US$ 10 000 per year account for 38 % of the Regional population but 68 % of the Regional blood donations. Voluntary blood donation is more common in the countries with better blood availability. There is no association between GNP per capita and coverage of screening for infectious agents. Nevertheless, of the six countries with a GNP per capita below US$ 1 000, only one of the six screens all units for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Countries with a higher proportion of voluntary blood donors tend to have lower prevalence rates of <b>infectious</b> <b>markers.</b> Separation of blood into its components is also more common in countries with higher blood donation rates. CONCLUSIONS: The availability, safety, and quality of blood for transfusion in the Americas needs to be improved. As part of that effort, national policies and strategies must be put into place so that the resources already allocated for blood services are better utilized...|$|R
40|$|Background: Blood transfusions carry {{risks of}} {{untoward}} reactions, including {{the transmission of}} infections, such as hepatitis B and C. Proper blood donor recruitment and selection, and adequate laboratory screening for <b>infectious</b> <b>markers</b> diminish the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Objectives: To estimate the potential risk of acquiring transfusion-transmitted infections by hepatitis B or hepatitis C in 24 Caribbean countries {{during the period of}} 1996 to 2003. Study design: Official national reports for 1996, 2000 - 2003 of the yearlynumber of blood donors, screening coverage, and prevalence of serological <b>markers</b> for <b>infectious</b> diseases were used to estimate the risk of patients receiving an HBV- or HCV-positive unit of blood, and of developing an infection after receiving a positive unit. Estimates of number of infections transmitted through transfusion and number of infections prevented by screening of blood were also obtained. Results: During the period analyzed, HBV screening coverage among blood donors was 100 % in all countries with the exception of Grenada (0 % in 1996) and Saint Lucia (99. 5 % in 2002). For HCV, only 10 countries reported universal screening in 1996, while 15 did in 2003. The number of countries that did not screen any units for HCV decreased from 11 in 1996 to five in 2003. In general, high prevalence rates of HBV (10 - 75 per 1000 donors) and HCV (7 - 19. 3 per 1000 donors) markers were found in the majority of countries. We estimated that 235 infections by HCV (1 : 12471 donations) and two infections by HBV (1 : 1465373) were transmitted through transfusion because of lack of screening. On the other hand, screening of blood for transfusion prevented 21 005 HCV and 22 100 HBV infections...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Safety in Transfusion Medicine {{is subject}} to {{regulations}} and government legislation within a total quality framework. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of seroprevalence and indeterminate results on lost units and cost per donation. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in the Blood Bank and Transfusion Therapy Department of the Hospital Central de la Policia Nacional del Perú in Lima, Peru. All completed donations (replacement/voluntary) without complications were included in this study. Every donation met the institutional requirements and quality criteria of Programa Nacional de Hemoterapia y Bancos de Sangre (PRONAHEBAS). Data analysis was achieved using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results: A total of 7723 donations were evaluated during 2014 and 2015 with 493 being seropositive (overall prevalence 5. 25 %) and 502 having indeterminate results (overall prevalence 5. 35 %). Thus total loss was 995 units, 437. 8 L of blood and 49, 750 US dollars. The most common seropositive <b>infectious</b> <b>markers</b> were the core antibody of hepatitis B virus (2. 82 %) and syphilis (1. 02 %), and the most common indeterminate results were Chagas disease (1. 27 %) and the core antibody of hepatitis B virus (1. 26 %). There was no significant change in the prevalence of seropositivity (p-value = 0. 243) or indeterminate results (p-value = 0. 227) over the two-year period of the study. A statistical correlation was found between the cost per lost donation and the most prevalent markers (rho = 0. 848; p-value = < 0. 001). Conclusion: Seroprevalence was lower than the regional mean, but the prevalence of indeterminate results was elevated causing a great impact on blood supply and economic losses to this institution...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV), human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis infections pose a great threat to blood safety. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of serologic markers for transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) among blood donors at a hospital based blood centre in north India {{over a period of}} nine years. Methods: The results of serologic markers for TTIs (HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV and syphilis) of all blood donations (both voluntary and replacement) at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2013 were screened. Additional analysis was conducted to examine the prevalence trends associated with each of the positive marker. Results: The data of 180, 477 donors [173, 019 (95. 86 %) males and 7, 458 (4. 13 %) females] were analyzed. Replacement donations [174, 939 (96. 93 %) ] represented the majority whereas, only 5, 538 (3. 06 %) donations were from the voluntary donors. The risk of blood being reactive was three times higher in male donors when compared with the female donors. The risk of blood being reactive for one or more <b>infectious</b> <b>markers</b> was 2. 1 times higher in replacement donors when compared with the voluntary donors. Seropositivity of HIV, HBsAg, HBcAb, syphilis showed a significant decreasing trend (P< 0. 05) while there was an increasing trend in HCV infection which was insignificant. Interpretation & conclusions: This study reflects that the risk of TTIs has been decreased over time with respect to HIV, HBV and syphilis, but the trends for HCV remains almost the same in blood donors. Blood transfusion remains a risk factor for the spread of blood-borne infections. Therefore, improvements are needed to strengthen both safety and availability of blood...|$|R
40|$|Background: Surveillance of <b>infectious</b> disease <b>markers</b> in {{the blood}} donor {{population}} is important in recognizing trends in prevalence and incidence of transfusion related infections in asymptomatic volunteer blood donors. Subjects & Methods: It is a community base cross sectional study. Subjects of study are volunteers to donate blood. Samples were collected from blood donors and questionnaire was designed to collect the risk factors data. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among 1, 000 apparently healthy blood donors was determined. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of virus B hepatic infection and to illustrate the various socioeconomic, demographic and medical factors related to infection with HBV among apparently healthy individuals. Results: The prevalence rate of HBV was 5 %. Conclusion: This study provides comprehensive and reliable information on the possible risk factors affecting spread of Hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{decision}} in September 2011 in the UK to accept blood donations from non-practicing {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) has received significant public attention. Will this rule change substantially boost the number of blood donations or will it make our blood less safe? Clearly, most European countries have a blood procurement problem. Fewer young people are donating, while the population is aging and more invasive therapies are requiring more blood. Yet if that was the reason for allowing non-practicing MSM to donate, clearly re-admission of some other, much larger populations that are currently deferred from donation should likewise be considered. As far as risks for blood safety are concerned, evidence has been provided that the current quality of <b>infectious</b> disease <b>marker</b> testing significantly mitigates against, although does not completely eradicate, risks associated with admission of donors with a high risk of carrying certain blood-transmissible agents. However, it could be argued that more effective recruitment of the non-donor pool, which is substantially larger than the group of currently ineligible donors, would be a better strategy. Recruitment of this group will benefit the availability of blood without jeopardizing the current excellent safety profile of blood. </p...|$|R
