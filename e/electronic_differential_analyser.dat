5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that [...] "about 15 Meccano model <b>Differential</b> <b>Analysers</b> were built for serious work by scientists and researchers around the world". More recently, building <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> with Meccano parts has become a popular project among serious Meccano hobbyists.

5000|$|Mechanical integrators were key {{elements}} in the mechanical <b>differential</b> <b>analyser,</b> used to solve practical physical problems. Mechanical integration mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or temperature in industrial processes. Mechanisms such as the ball-and-disk integrator were used both for computation in <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> and as components of instruments such as naval gun directors, flow totalizers and others. A planimeter is a mechanical devices used for performing integration on data given in graphical form.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, further <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> {{were built}} at the Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland and in the {{basement}} of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania during the early 1940s. The latter was used extensively in the computation of artillery firing tables prior to the invention of the ENIAC, which, in many ways, was modelled on the <b>differential</b> <b>analyser.</b> Also in the early 1940s, with Samuel H. Caldwell, one of the initial contributors during the early 1930s, Bush attempted an electrical, rather than mechanical, variation, but the digital computer built elsewhere had much greater promise and the project ceased. In 1947, UCLA installed a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. By 1950, this machine had been joined by three more. The UCLA differential analyzer appeared in 1951's When Worlds Collide, where it was called, euphemistically, [...] "DA".|$|R

50|$|Although Manchester {{was later}} {{to be known}} as the birthplace of the {{electronic}} computer, Douglas Hartree made an earlier contribution building a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> in 1933. The machine was used for ballistics calculations as well calculating railway timetables.|$|R

40|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> for {{high-performance}} {{electric vehicles}} with independent driving motors is proposed in this paper. This <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> endows the electric vehicle with a close-to-zero vehicle side-slip angle. When vehicle side-slip vanishes, the heading {{direction of the}} vehicle coincides with the velocity direction of the mass centre. In addition to the side-slip angle, the yaw rate is driven towards an optimal value with the proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> on-board. The improvements in vehicle side-slip and yaw rate responses are of great significance to the handling performance of high-performance vehicles. In this paper, the mathematical relationships between the vehicle dynamic states and the independent motor torques are revealed, based on which the proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> controller is designed. Simulation results manifest that in various challenging steering scenarios, the proposed control method outperforms two common <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> control schemes in terms of vehicle side-slip and yaw rate responses...|$|R
5000|$|In 1934, Meccano {{began to}} be used in the {{construction}} of <b>differential</b> <b>analysers,</b> a type of analogue computer used to solve differential equations which has long since become obsolete. Though invented on paper in the 19th century, the first such machine had only been built in 1931, and normally they would be built by specialist manufacturers, at great cost. For example, in 1947, UCLA in the US installed a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. However, a [...] "proof of concept" [...] model of a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> which made extensive use of Meccano parts was built at Manchester University, UK, in 1934, by Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter: use of Meccano meant that the machine was cheap to build, and it proved [...] "accurate enough for the solution of many scientific problems". This machine is now in the Science Museum, Exhibition Road, London, England. A similar machine built by J.B. Bratt at Cambridge University in 1935 is now in the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) collection in Auckland, New Zealand. A memorandum written for the British military's Armament Research Department in 1944 describes how this same machine was modified during World War II for improved reliability and enhanced capability, and identifies its wartime applications as including research on the flow of heat, explosive detonations, and simulations of transmission lines. After a lengthy period of neglect, a restoration effort began in 2003, and a successful [...] "full run through" [...] of this machine was completed on December 16, 2008.|$|R

The proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> is implemented {{in the form of}} a closed-loop control system that constantly regulates the torque commands sent to the independent driving motors.

He used a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> in his PhD studies, an early form of computer, and purchased the machine in 1948 for £100.

Whale was a visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1969, and the University of California in 1969-1970.|$|R
