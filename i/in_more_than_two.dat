5|$|Manchester United {{recorded}} {{their first}} win {{of the season}} on 9 September, beating newly promoted Charlton Athletic 4–1. Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjær each scored a brace to overturn the visitor's early lead. The match was marred with demonstrations in and around Old Trafford against the proposed takeover of the club by BSkyB. Obscene chants were directed at chairman Martin Edwards, who had given his support to the merger. A 2–0 victory against Coventry City the following week put United in perfect stead for the clash at home to Barcelona, but a comprehensive defeat to champions Arsenal left the team in 10th position. This was Arsène Wenger's third straight victory over Ferguson (four in all competitions); goals from Tony Adams, Nicolas Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg condemned Manchester United to their heaviest away defeat <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years. To compound the misery midfielder Nicky Butt, who had been sent off in the Champions League match earlier in the week, was handed a second red card {{in the space of}} four days after a lunge on French international Patrick Vieira. United ended the month with a win, beating rivals Liverpool 2–0 to move into fifth spot.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} senior players, Ambrose was rested from West Indies' next tour, an ODI tournament in October 1995, but he {{returned}} {{to play in a}} three-team ODI tournament in Australia in December and January. However, affected by the refusal of Brian Lara to tour following after being fined for his behaviour during the tour of England, the team failed to qualify for the final. Ambrose took ten wickets in the tournament, and took three wickets in consecutive innings; in the latter game, he was man of the match. West Indies were more successful in the World Cup in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka which began in February. They reached the semi-finals, losing to Australia. Ambrose was man of the match with three for 28 in his team's opening match, and took ten wickets at 17.00 in the competition. He conceded an average of just three runs per over over the tournament, the second best among those who played <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> games.

The Tractatus iuris was also printed twice and survives <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> dozen manuscripts. The Summa is frequently mined by modern scholars in search of literary analogues and materials for social history.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{nonlinear}} problems {{cannot be}} posed {{in general and}} thus not solved within distribution theory alone. In the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. <b>In</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> spacetime dimensions the problem {{is related to the}} regularization of divergences. Here Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) causal perturbation theory. This does not solve the problem in other situations. Many other interesting theories are non linear, like for example the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.|$|E
