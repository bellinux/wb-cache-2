The horizontal seed is orbicular or reniform, with dark brown, smooth or glossy seed coat. The seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm.|$|E
25|$|Like in all Asteraceae, the pentameric flowers have anthers {{that are}} fused {{together}} forming a tube {{through which the}} style grows. The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an <b>indehiscent</b> fruit in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre.|$|E
25|$|Sesame {{seeds are}} {{protected}} by a capsule which only bursts when the seeds are completely ripe. This is called dehiscence. The dehiscence time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules have opened. The discovery of an <b>indehiscent</b> mutant (analogous to nonshattering domestic grains) by Langham in 1943 began the work towards development of a high-yielding, dehiscence-resistant variety. Although researchers have made significant progress in sesame breeding, harvest losses due to dehiscence continue to limit domestic US production.|$|E

All florets (in this case only one) are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre. A particular character of Gudelia that is rare among the Asteraceae is that florets are gender specialised, with the central floret being functionally hermaphrodite and the marginal florets being functionally male.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} shoots may be erect or nodding, with erect or pendulous flowers, {{which may}} become more erect as the plant matures. The flowers themselves, in common {{with other members of}} the Ericaceae, have corollas that are generally bell- or cup-shaped, though the petals themselves may or may not be fused. However, the Monotropoideae lack the poricidal anthers that are characteristic of the majority of the Ericaceae. (The Pyroleae do have poricidal anthers, however.) Pollen grains are released as a monad, in contrast to the majority of the Ericaceae, which release pollen grains in tetrad groups. (The Pyroleae variously release pollen as monads, tetrads, or polyads.) Fruits are dry loculicidal dehiscent (or sometimes <b>indehiscent)</b> capsule or a berry. Seeds are highly reduced dust seeds. The shoot may or may not be persistent after seed dispersal.|$|E
500|$|Amaranthus brownii is {{an annual}} herb in the Amaranthaceae family. The plant is found {{only on the}} small island of Nihoa in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, growing on rocky {{outcrops}} at altitudes of [...] It is one of nine species of Amaranthus in the Hawaiian Islands, but the only endemic Hawaiian species of the genus. It was first discovered during the Tanager Expedition in 1923 by botanist Edward Leonard Caum. A. brownii differs from other Hawaiian species of Amaranthus with its spineless leaf axils, linear leaves, and <b>indehiscent</b> fruits.|$|E
500|$|A. brownii is {{the only}} endemic species of Hawaiian Amaranthus in the Hawaiian Islands. It is an {{herbaceous}} annual plant that grows to a height of [...] and has narrow, linear leaves, small green flowers, and fruit that holds a single, dark red seed. A. brownii is monoecious; that is, {{the male and female}} flowers are found together on the same plant. It differs from other Hawaiian species of Amaranthus with its spineless leaf axils, linear leaves, and <b>indehiscent</b> fruits (fruit which does not open to release seeds when ripe). The fruits are ovoid and between 0.8–1mm long and 0.6–0.8mm wide. The plant is thought to be anemophilous (pollinated by wind).|$|E

2500|$|Simple fruits can {{be either}} dry or fleshy, and result from the {{ripening}} of a simple or compound ovary in a flower with only one pistil. Dry fruits may be either dehiscent (they open to discharge seeds), or <b>indehiscent</b> (they do not open to discharge seeds). Types of dry, simple fruits, and examples of each, include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The ovary most {{typically}} develops into a legume. A legume is {{a simple}} dry fruit that usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name {{for this type of}} fruit is a [...] "pod", although that can also be applied to a few other fruit types. A few species have evolved samarae, loments, follicles, <b>indehiscent</b> legumes, achenes, drupes, and berries from the basic legume fruit.|$|E
2500|$|The trees produce edible red or purple fruits called [...] "cherries" [...] {{that are}} {{described}} either as epigynous berries or as <b>indehiscent</b> drupes. The cherries contain two seeds, the so-called [...] "coffee beans", which—despite their name—are not true beans. In about 5-10% of any crop of coffee cherries, {{only a single}} bean, rather than the usual two, is found. This is called a peaberry, which is smaller and rounder than a normal coffee bean. It is often removed from the yield and either sold separately (as in New Guinea peaberry), or discarded.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{structures}} {{commonly referred}} to as [...] "seeds" [...] are actually dry fruits. Plants producing berries are called baccate. Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an <b>indehiscent</b> seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike animals, {{plants are}} limited {{in their ability to}} seek out {{favorable}} conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to disperse their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also vegetative reproduction). A seed must somehow [...] "arrive" [...] at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called dehiscent, which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques. [...] When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called <b>indehiscent,</b> which include the fruits achenes, caryopsis, nuts, samaras, and utricles.|$|E
2500|$|By definition, berries have a fleshy, <b>indehiscent</b> pericarp, {{as opposed}} to a dry, dehiscent pericarp. Fossils show that early {{flowering}} plants had dry fruits; fleshy fruits, such as berries or drupes, appeared only {{towards the end of the}} Cretaceous Period or the beginning of the Paleogene Period, about [...] The increasing importance of seed dispersal by fruit-eating vertebrates, both mammals and birds, may have driven the evolution of fleshy fruits. Alternatively, the causal direction may be the other way round. Large fleshy fruits are associated with moist habitats with closed tree canopies, where wind dispersal of dry fruits is less effective. Such habitats were increasingly common in the Paleogene and the associated change in fruit type may have led to the evolution of fruit eating in mammals and birds.|$|E
2500|$|In botanical language, a berry is {{a simple}} fruit having seeds and fleshy pulp (the pericarp) {{produced}} from the ovary of a single flower. The ovary can be inferior or superior. It is <b>indehiscent,</b> i.e. {{it does not have}} a special [...] "line of weakness" [...] along which it splits to release the seeds when ripe. The pericarp is divided into three layers. The outer layer is called the [...] "exocarp" [...] or [...] "epicarp"; the middle layer, the [...] "mesocarp" [...] or [...] "sarcocarp"; the inner layer, the [...] "endocarp". Botanists have not applied these terms consistently. Exocarp and endocarp may be restricted to more-or-less single-layered [...] "skins", or may include tissues adjacent to them; thus on one view, the exocarp extends inwards to the layer of vascular bundles ("veins"). The inconsistency in usage has been described as [...] "a source of confusion".|$|E
60|$|By descent {{the banana}} {{bush is a}} {{developed}} tropical lily, not at all remotely allied to the common iris, only that its flowers and fruit are clustered together on a hanging spike, instead of growing solitary and separate as in the true irises. The blossoms, which, though pretty, are comparatively inconspicuous for {{the size of the}} plant, show the extraordinary persistence of the lily type; for almost all the vast number of species, more or less directly descended from the primitive lily, continue to {{the very end of the}} chapter to have six petals, six stamens, and three rows of seeds in their fruits or capsules. But practical man, with his eye always steadily fixed on the one important quality of edibility--the sum and substance to most people of all botanical research--has confined his attention almost entirely to the fruit of the banana. In all essentials (other than the systematically unimportant one just alluded to) the banana fruit in its original state exactly resembles the capsule of the iris--that pretty pod that divides in three when ripe, and shows the delicate orange-coated seeds lying in triple rows within--only, in the banana, the fruit does not open; in the sweet language of technical botany, it is an <b>indehiscent</b> capsule; and the seeds, instead of standing separate and distinct, as in the iris, are embedded in a soft and pulpy substance which forms the edible and practical part of the entire arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Some {{difficult}} cases exist however, so {{that the}} term <b>indehiscent</b> follicle is sometimes used, for example with the genus Filipendula, which has <b>indehiscent</b> fruits {{that could be considered}} intermediate between a (dehiscent) follicle and an (<b>indehiscent)</b> achene.|$|E
