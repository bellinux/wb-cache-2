To detail these interactions better, the present study used retrograde tracers to reveal {{the origins of the}} corticothalamic projections in two closely related monkey species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis). The medial dorsal thalamic nucleus received only light cortical inputs, which predominantly arose from area 23. Efferents to the anterior medial thalamic nucleus also arose principally from area 23, but these projections proved more numerous than those to the medial dorsal nucleus and also involved additional inputs from areas 29 and 30. The anterior ventral and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei had similar sources of inputs from the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. For both nuclei, the densest projections arose from areas 29 and 30, with numbers of thalamic inputs often decreasing when going dorsal from area 23 a to 23 c and to area 31. In all cases, the corticothalamic projections almost always arose from the deepest cortical layer.

Understanding natural variation of lateral septal anatomy and function, as well as its genetic modulation, may provide important insights into individual differences in these evolutionarily important functions. Here we address these issues by using efficient and unbiased stereological probes to estimate the volume of the lateral septum in the BXD line of recombinant inbred mice. Lateral septum volume is a highly variable trait, with a 2. 5 -fold difference among animals. We find that this trait covaries with a number of behavioral and physiological phenotypes, many of which have already been associated with behaviors modulated by the lateral septum, such as spatial learning, anxiety, and reward-seeking. Heritability of lateral septal volume is moderate (h 2 = 0. 52), and much of the heritable variation is caused by a locus on the distal portion of chromosome (Chr) 1. Composite interval analysis identified a secondary interval on Chr 2 that works additively with the Chr 1 locus to increase lateral septum volume. Using bioinformatic resources, we identified plausible candidate genes in both intervals that may influence the volume of this <b>key</b> <b>nucleus,</b> as well as associated behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{infant death}} {{syndrome}} (SIDS) involves failure of arousal to potentially life threatening events, including hypoxia, during sleep. While neuronal dysfunction and abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems within the medulla oblongata have been implicated, the specific pathways associated with autonomic and cardiorespiratory failure are unknown. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its tachykinin neurokinin- 1 receptor (NK 1 R) {{have been shown to}} play an integral role in the modulation of homeostatic function in the medulla, including regulation of respiratory rhythm generation, integration of cardiovascular control, and modulation of the baroreceptor reflex and mediation of the chemoreceptor reflex in response to hypoxia. Abnormalities in SP neurotransmission may therefore result in autonomic dysfunction during sleep and contribute to SIDS deaths. [125 I] Bolton Hunter SP autoradiography was used to map the distribution and density of the SP, NK 1 R to 13 specific nuclei intimately related to cardiorespiratory function and autonomic control in the human infant medulla of 55 SIDS and 21 control (non-SIDS) infants. Compared to controls, SIDS cases exhibited a differential, abnormal developmental profile of the SP/NK 1 R system in the medulla. Furthermore the study revealed significantly decreased NK 1 R binding within <b>key</b> medullary <b>nuclei</b> in SIDS cases, principally in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and all three subdivisions of the inferior portion of the olivo-cerebellar complex; the principal inferior olivary complex (PIO), medial accessory olive (MAO) and dorsal accessory olive (DAO). Altered NK 1 R binding was significantly influenced by prematurity and male sex, which may explain the increased risk of SIDS in premature and male infants. Abnormal NK 1 R binding in these medullary nuclei may contribute to the defective interaction of critical medullary mechanisms with cerebellar sites, resulting in an inability of a SIDS infant to illicit appropriate respiratory and motor responses to life threatening challenges during sleep. These observations support the concept that abnormalities in a multi-neurotransmitter network within <b>key</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the medullary homeostatic system may underlie the pathogenesis of a subset of SIDS cases.

This presence of deformation has been explained in S isotopes by a moderate reduction of the N= 28 shell closure together with a proton induced collectivity originating from the near degeneracy of the PI d 3 / 2 and PI s 1 / 2 orbitals [6]. As a consequence, the observed deformation is the result of a subtle interplay between neutron and proton excitations and the importance of the N= 28 shell closure reduction is then difficult to estimate. Since the proton configuration in the Si isotopes is expected to be more stable due to the Z= 14 sub-shell gap [7], the $^{ 42 }$Si was considered as a <b>key</b> <b>nucleus</b> in order to distinguish the different effects responsible of the structural changes observed at N= 28.

The amygdala is a <b>key</b> <b>nucleus</b> involved in the autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stress. The goal {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of the central amygdala (CeA) to stress or the stress hormone cortisol (or corticosterone in rats) induces nociceptive behaviors mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) within the CeA. We selectively knocked down CRF in the CeA via antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASO) in animals with targeted, stereotaxically placed corticosterone (CORT) micropellets or following repeated water avoidance stress (WAS). CRF expression in the CeA was analyzed concurrently with the assessment of visceral hypersensitivity to colonic distension and mechanical somatic withdrawal threshold. The responses were characterized at 7 or 28 days post implantation of the CORT micropellet or following 7 days of WAS. Exposure of the CeA to elevated CORT or WAS increased CRF expression and heightened visceral and somatic sensitivity. Infusion of CRF ASO into the CeA decreased CRF expression and attenuated visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in both models. Our study provides important evidence for a CRF-mediated mechanism specifically within the CeA that regulates stress-induced visceral and somatic nociception.

A class of computational models assumes that, during action selection, the basal ganglia compute for all actions available in a given context the probabilities that they should be selected. These models suggest that a network of GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons computes the normalization term in Bayes' equation. In order to perform such computation, the GPe needs to send feedback to the STN equal to a particular function of the activity of STN neurons. However, the complex form of this function makes it unlikely that individual GPe neurons, or even a single GPe cell type, could compute it. Here, we demonstrate how this function could be computed within a network containing two types of GABAergic GPe projection neuron, so-called 'prototypic' and 'arkypallidal' neurons, that have different response properties in vivo and distinct connections. We compare our model predictions with the experimentally-reported connectivity and input-output functions (f-I curves) of the two populations of GPe neurons. We show that, together, these dichotomous cell types fulfil the requirements necessary to compute the function needed for optimal action selection. We conclude that, by virtue of their distinct response properties and connectivities, a network of arkypallidal and prototypic GPe neurons comprises a neural substrate capable of supporting the computation of the posterior probabilities of actions...|$|R

The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are <b>key</b> <b>nuclei</b> in opioid-induced analgesia, and opioids interact with serotonin to produce analgesia. Objectives:. The purpose was to examine central inhibitory mechanisms involved in analgesia produced by wheel running. Methods:. C 57 /Black 6 mice were given access to running wheels in their home cages before induction of chronic muscle hyperalgesia and compared with those without running wheels. Systemic, intra-PAG, and intra-RVM naloxone tested the role of central opioid receptors in the antinociceptive effects of wheel running in animals with muscle insult. Immunohistochemistry for the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the spinal cord and RVM, and pharmacological blockade of SERT, tested whether the serotonin system was modulated by muscle insult and wheel running. Results:. Wheel running prevented the development of muscle hyperalgesia. Systemic naloxone, intra-PAG naloxone, and intra-RVM naloxone reversed the antinociceptive effect of wheel running in animals that had received muscle insult. Induction of chronic muscle hyperalgesia increased SERT in the RVM, and blockade of SERT reversed the hyperalgesia in sedentary animals. Wheel running reduced SERT expression in animals with muscle insult. The serotonin transporter in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord was unchanged after muscle insult, but increased after wheel running. Conclusion:. These data {{support the hypothesis that}} wheel running produced analgesia through central inhibitory mechanisms involving opioidergic and serotonergic systems...|$|R

For each model we derive the conditions for producing the observed abundance peaks at mass numbers A ~ 80, 130, and 195 under the waiting-point approximation and further determine the sets of conditions that can best reproduce the r-process abundance patterns (r-patterns) inferred for {{the solar system and}} observed in metal-poor stars of the Milky Way halo. In broad agreement with previous studies, we find that (1) the conditions for producing abundance peaks at A ~ 80 and 195 tend to be very different, which suggests that, at least for some nuclear mass models, these two peaks are not produced simultaneously; (2) the typical conditions required by the critical waiting-point (CWP) nuclei with the N = 126 closed neutron shell overlap significantly with those required by the N= 82 CWP nuclei, which enables coproduction of abundance peaks at A ~ 130 and 195 in accordance with observations of many metal-poor stars; and (3) the typical conditions required by the N = 82 CWP nuclei can reproduce the r-pattern observed in the metal-poor star HD 122563, which differs greatly from the solar r-pattern.

In mechanically dissociated rat VMH neurones with attached native presynaptic nerve endings, GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded using the nystatin perforated patch recording mode under voltage-clamp conditions. Histamine reversibly inhibited the sIPSC frequency in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the mean current amplitude. The selective histamine receptor type 3 (H 3) agonist imetit (100 nm) mimicked this effect and it was completely abolished by the selective H 3 receptor antagonists clobenpropit (3 μm) and thioperamide (10 μm). The GTP-binding protein inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (10 μm) removed the histaminergic inhibition of GABAergic sIPSCs. Elimination of external Ca 2 + reduced the GABAergic sIPSC frequency without affecting the distribution of current amplitudes. In this condition, the inhibitory effect of imetit on the sIPSC frequency completely disappeared, suggesting that the histaminergic inhibition requires extracellular Ca 2 +. The P/Q-type Ca 2 + channel blocker ω-agatoxin IVA (300 nm) attenuated the histaminergic inhibition of the GABAergic sIPSC frequency, but neither the N-type Ca 2 + channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA (3 μm) nor the L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker nicardipine (3 μm) was effective. Activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (10 μm) {{had no effect on}} histaminergic inhibition of the sIPSCs.

During inflammation, microglia change into a state that either promotes removal of debris (M 1), or into a state that promotes soothing (M 2). Caudal- and rostral- ventrolateral medullary regions (CVLM and RVLM, respectively) of the brainstem are <b>key</b> <b>nuclei</b> involved in all aspects of the cardiovascular system. In this study, we investigate a novel role for microglia in cardiovascular control in the brainstem of adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat. Here we show, that increases and decreases in blood pressure (BP) triggers alertness in the physiology of microglia in the brainstem region; inducing changes in microglial spatial distribution and the number of synapses in contact with microglial end processes. Following 6 h of acute hypertension, the number of synapses in contact with microglia increased by ≈ 30 % in both regions of the brainstem, CVLM and RVLM. Induction of acute hypotension for 6 h causes microglia {{to reduce the number of}} synaptic contacts by > 20 % in both, CVLM and RVLM, nuclei of the brainstem. Our analysis of the morphological characteristics of microglia, and expression levels of M 1 and M 2, reveals that the changes induced in microglial behavior do not require any obvious dramatic changes in their morphology. Taken together, our findings suggest that microglia play a novel, unexpected, physiological role in the uninjured autonomic nuclei of CNS; we therefore speculate that microglia act cooperatively with brainstem cardiovascular neurons to maintain them in a physiologically receptive state. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphisms of the OXTR gene affect people’s social {{interaction}} styles in various social encounters: carriers of the OXTR GG, {{compared to the}} OXTR AA/AG in general, are more motivated to interact socially and detect social salience. We focus on sales professionals operating in knowledge intensive organizations. Study 1, {{with a sample of}} 141 sales people, shows that carriers of the OXTR GG allele, compared to the OXTR AA/AG allele, are more motivated to help customers than to manipulatively impose goods/services on them. Study 2, using genomic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a sample of 21 sales professionals processing facial pictures with different emotional valences, investigates <b>key</b> <b>nuclei</b> of social brain regions (SBRs). Compared to OXTR AA/AG carriers, OXTR GG carriers experience greater effective connectivity between SBRs of interest measured by Granger causality tests using univariate Haugh tests. In addition, the multivariate El-Himdi and Roy tests demonstrate that the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and pars opercularis (inferior frontal gyrus) play key roles when processing emotional expressions. The bilateral amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex show significantly greater clout – influence on other brain regions – for GG allele carriers than non-carriers; likewise, the bilateral pars opercularis, left amygdala, and left medial prefrontal cortex are more receptive to activity in other brain regions among GG allele carriers than AG/AA allele carriers are. Thus, carriers of the OXTR GG allele are more sensitive to changes in emotional cues, enhancing social salience. To our knowledge, this is the first study on how insights from imaging genetics help understanding of the social motivation of people operating in a professional setting...|$|R
40|$|The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is a <b>key</b> <b>nucleus</b> for the {{regulation}} of feeding behavior. Inhibitory inputs from the hypothalamus to the PBN {{play a crucial role}} in the normal maintenance of feeding behavior, because their loss leads to starvation. Viscerosensory stimuli result in neuronal activation of the PBN. However, the origin and neurochemical identity of the excitatory neuronal input to the PBN remain largely unexplored. Here, we hypothesize that hindbrain glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) neurons provide excitatory inputs to the PBN, activation of which may lead to a reduction in feeding behavior. Our data, obtained from mice expressing the yellow fluorescent protein in GLP- 1 -producing neurons, revealed that hindbrain GLP- 1 -producing neurons project to the lateral PBN (lPBN). Stimulation of lPBN GLP- 1 receptors (GLP- 1 Rs) reduced the intake of chow and palatable food and decreased body weight in rats. It also activated lPBN neurons, reflected by an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive cells in this region. Further support for an excitatory role of GLP- 1 in the PBN is provided by electrophysiological studies showing a remarkable increase in firing of lPBN neurons after Exendin- 4 application. We show that within the PBN, GLP- 1 R activation increased gene expression of 2 energy balance regulating peptides, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and IL- 6. Moreover, nearly 70 % of the lPBN GLP- 1 fibers innervated lPBN CGRP neurons. Direct intra-lPBN CGRP application resulted in anorexia. Collectively, our molecular, anatomical, electrophysiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data provide evidence for a functional role of the GLP- 1 R for feeding control in the PBN...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear {{reactions}} in the pp-chain region {{and on the}} breakout process from the pp-chain region under very high temperature conditions are reviewed, and some possibilities for experimental investigation are discussed. The reactions discussed could {{play an important role}} typically for the primordial nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis. Specifically, I discuss here the reactions starting from the two <b>key</b> <b>nuclei,</b> 7 Be and 7 Li. The 7 Be(n,α) reaction, which destroys 7 Be, is considered to have a large impact to the primordial 7 Li problem. Our recent estimate of the reaction rate indicates that the reaction rate can be about one order of magnitude smaller than the rate currently adopted, suggesting this channel has a minor effect for the 7 Li problem. Under a proton-rich environment at high temperature like the νp-process, the 7 Be(α,γ) 11 C(α,p) 14 N pathway is expected to play a majpr role for heavy element synthesis, comparable to the triple alpha process. These two reactions on the pathway were investigated by using low-energy, high-intensity RI beams of 7 Be and 11 C. The results support the theoretical prediction of heavy nucleus production at around mass 90 - 100 by the νp-process, where the anomalously abundant p-nuclei exist. The reactions on the breakout sequence of 7 Li(n,γ) 8 Li(α,n) 11 B are also discussed which could paly a crucial role in nuetron-rich envirnments, like in the primirdial universe as well as the early stage of the r-process. The cross sections of the first step reaction 7 Li(n,γ) 8 Li seems well confirmed, but the second step reaction 8 Li(α,n) 11 B still is not well known yet, whose status of the study is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Mass {{measurements}} of radioactive nuclides {{are one of}} the cornerstones of our understanding of the nucleus. The Penning trap spectrometer ISOLTRAP performs direct mass measurements far away from the valley of stability, as well as high-precision {{measurements of}} <b>key</b> <b>nuclei</b> to anchor long decay chains. Both schemes provide valuable information on the dripline itself and on nuclei in its close vicinity. 1 Introduction The mass is one of the gross properties of a nucleus. The mass, explored over large areas, helps the understanding of the nucleus considerably by revealing weaknesses in nuclear models, by uncovering nuclear fine structure effects as well as shell closures. At the drip-line, known or predicted mass differences help to find especially interesting decay modes as for instance the two proton decay. There are many different methods to measure the mass of radioactive nuclei as for instance summarized in [1]. Two principle ways can be distinguished, so-called direct and indirect measurements. In the latter case the mass of a nuclear state, that can of course be its ground state, is deduced from the energy difference of two nuclear states measured basically by observing particles or radiation that were emitted during the transitions from the initial to the final state. Here, the energy of one of the two states has to be known to determine the other one. Possible transitions mechanisms are nuclear reactions, ff and fi decay. This method of mass measurement is hence limited not only by the uncertainty of the transition energy determination but also by the uncertainty in the mass of the second state. The advantage is, however, that {{especially in the case of}} monoenergetic particles emitted like in ff decay very short half-live...|$|R
40|$|In many {{vertebrate}} species, testosterone (T) {{influences the}} volume and cellular characteristics of a variety steroid-dependent nuclei, including the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) of male Japanese quail. The quail POM is a <b>key</b> <b>nucleus</b> in the control of male sexual behavior and exhibits a sex difference (larger in males than in females). In castrated quail, the POM volume is markedly increased by T but previous studies always assessed this effect {{after a period of}} 8 - 14 days and its specific time-course is unknown. We recently reported that antisense treatments suppressing steroid receptor coactivator- 1 expression block T effects on POM volume but when treatment was discontinued, a significant increase of POM size occurred within two days. We therefore asked whether this rapid neuroanatomical change was specifically linked to the SCR- 1 modulation or reflected the normal rate of T-induced effects. We collected brains from castrated male quail after 1, 2, 8 and 15 days of T treatment (CX+T) while in untreated castrates (CX) brains were collected after 1 or 15 days. The POM volume defined by Nissl staining increased in a time-dependent fashion in CX+T to reach a 40 % increase after 15 days while no change was observed in CX. An increase in the average POM volume was detected on day 1 (13 %) and this increase was statistically significant (25 %) after only 2 days of exposure to T. No volume change was observed in the steroid-insensitive nucleus rotundus. The activation of male sexual behavior was positively correlated with the increase in POM volume. Because new neurons are not incorporated in the adult avian hypothalamus, these rapid volumetric changes must reflect increases in soma size, neuropile or extracellular space. The mechanisms underlying this unexpectedly rapid neural plasticity are currently under study, focusing in particular on the potential modifications of the steroid sensitive aromatase expressing cells...|$|R
