25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of <b>export</b> <b>certificates</b> to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use <b>export</b> <b>certificates</b> for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively).

40|$|In 2017 {{it will be}} Australia’s turn {{to chair}} the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KP), an {{international}} organisation set up to regulate the trade in diamonds. Diamonds are a symbol of love, purchased to celebrate marriage, and it is therefore deeply ironic that the diamond trade has become linked with warfare and human rights violations committed in African producer countries such as Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and, more recently, Zimbabwe and Angola. In their quest for diamonds, or by using diamonds to purchase weapons, armed groups in these countries have engaged in recruiting child soldiers, amputating limbs, and committing rape and murder. In response to the problem, the international community, non-governmental organisations and key industry players such as De Beers combined forces to create the Kimberley Process in 2002. The KP uses an <b>export</b> <b>certificate</b> system to distinguish the legitimate rough diamond trade from so-called ‘blood diamonds’, which are also known as ‘conflict diamonds’. This book considers {{the extent to which}} the KP, supported by other agencies at the international and national levels, has been effective in achieving its mandate. In so doing, it presents an original model derived from the domain of regulatory theory, the Dual Networked Pyramid, as a means of describing the operation of the system and suggesting possible improvements that might be made to it. Nigel Davidson spoke with 936 ABC Hobart about what Australia can do to help stop blood diamonds. Listen to the full interview here...|$|E
40|$|This work envisages {{minimizing}} many shortcomings including associated {{delays in}} the cargo clearance process when the import and <b>export</b> <b>certificate</b> which is legally known as license/permit become applicable. Preliminary survey conducted revealed that there is undue delay. The work then systematically identifies the factors that hamper efficient and effective enforcement of such regulations in the import and export of goods in the Sri Lankan context. A questionnaire was circulated among a sample of 100 importers and exporters or their representatives in order to gather information on ground level practical problems faced by them. Existing laws and regulations as well as regulatory processes at several agencies were examined to identify the correct legal position and any existing automated solutions. Various authorities were interviewed {{in order to identify}} their requirements as well as the problems they face. It was found that in almost all the instances manual procedures are in use in the issuance of certificates (licenses/permits) and in subsequent debit/write-off steps introducing delays, duplications and poor control effects. The study shows that certain commodities require certificates from more than one regulatory agency for identical purpose. It is recommended that Automated Certificate Processing System be put into use integrated with the existing Customs Automated System. It is also recommended that the simplification and standardizing of procedures at regulatory agencies as well as at Customs need to be carried out before introducing an automated system. Proposed e-Certificate system will not only expedite the clearance process but also will prevent the certificates being misused. Much superior controls could be implemented as online information will be available for all regulatory agencies. Main goal of the proposal is to eliminate paper requirement and pave the way for paperless trade in Sri Lanka...|$|E
