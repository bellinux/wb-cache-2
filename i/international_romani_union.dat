40|$|Key words: Roma, pro-romani movement, emancipation, {{collective}} identity, Roma Pride, <b>International</b> <b>Romani</b> Day, Ara Art, Konexe Abstract This paper presents on {{an example}} of two organizations and events organized by them a contemporary pro-romani movement in the Czech Republic - their topics and their strategies of agency to achieving their aims. The introductory part deals with {{the historical development of}} the pro-romani movement and in the second part, the author describes in detail the activities of two organizations Ara Art and Konexe. The final part presents by the using of a categorical analysis of their members forms in which these organizations on their events (<b>International</b> <b>Romani</b> day and Roma Pride) constitute a Roma collective identity. Both events have a two-way character, which is based on the relationship of the category "we" (the Roma) with the dominant category "they" (the majority society). With this relationship, the organizers deal on these events by a strengthening of collective belonging {{and at the same time}} negations of stereotypes about Roma created by the majority. Their primary purpose is therefore a destigmatisation their own identity...|$|R
