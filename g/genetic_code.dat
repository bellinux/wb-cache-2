5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in the <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for tryptophan and not arginine; however, the codon in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG codon, consistent with the standard <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> for tryptophan. Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> The <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{principle}} of least effort in communications has been shown, by Ferrer i Cancho and Solé, to explain emergence of power laws (e. g., Zipf’s law) in human languages. This paper applies the principle and the information-theoretic model of Ferrer i Cancho and Solé to <b>genetic</b> <b>coding.</b> The {{application of the}} principle is achieved via equating the ambiguity of signals used by “speakers ” with codon usage, on the one hand, and the effort of “hearers ” with needs of amino acid translation mechanics, on the other hand. The re-interpreted model captures {{the case of the}} typical (vertical) gene transfer, and confirms that Zipf’s law {{can be found in the}} transition between referentially useless systems (i. e., ambiguous <b>genetic</b> <b>coding)</b> and indexical reference systems (i. e., zero-redundancy <b>genetic</b> <b>coding).</b> As with linguistic symbols, arranging <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> according to Zipf’s law is observed to be the optimal solution for maximising the referential power under the effort constraints. Thus, the model identifies the origins of scaling in <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> — via a trade-off between codon usage and needs of amino acid translation.

5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme {{is often referred to}} as the canonical or standard <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> or simply the <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is a {{key part}} of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model for the emergence of <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{encoding}} {{provides a}} generic construction scheme for biomolecular functions. This paper addresses the key problem of coevolution and {{exploitation of the}} multiple components necessary to implement a replicable genetic encoding scheme. Extending earlier results on multicomponent replication, the necessity of spatial structure for the evolutionary stabilization of the <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> system is established. An individual-based stochastic model of interacting molecules in three-dimensional space is presented that allows the evolution of <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> to be analyzed explicitly. A massively parallel configurable computer (NGEN) is used to implement the model, on the time scale of millions of generations, directly in electronic hardware. The spatial correlations between components of the <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> system are analyzed and found to be essential for evolutionary stability...|$|R

5|$|The <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is the set {{of rules}} by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E

5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> In general, the <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E

40|$|Genetic Algorithm is an {{optimization}} technique {{based on a}} genetic model comprising string representation of genes, mate and cross-over of strings, generation of new off-springs. Invention of GAs approach initially created great expectations in a broad variety of fields. As researches progress, it has been noticed that GAs have severe limitations and difficulty to be useful in real life applications, {{one of which is}} the requirement of extremely much computational time. Another limitation may be the length and the volume of population to be considered. <b>Genetic</b> <b>Coding</b> Approach is a genetic base alternative technique to overcome these limitations of conventional GAs. <b>Genetic</b> <b>coding</b> requires much less computation time {{due to the fact that}} the string length is only limited to three regardless of the sophistication of the application. Another significant improvement is that accuracy obtained in GCA is much larger than that of Conventional GAs. In the mean time, synthesis of mechanisms is a field requiring a high effort for optimization. There have been attempts to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques to mechanism synthesis like Expert Systems and GAs. In this study, fundamentals of <b>Genetic</b> <b>Coding</b> Algorithm (GCA) investigated together with an application to synthesizing planar mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of the RNA world indicates 2 different <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> being present throughout the living world. In contrast to non-coding RNAs that are built of repetitive nucleotide syntax, the sequences that serve as templates for proteins share—as main characteristics—a non-repetitive syntax. Whereas non-coding RNAs build groups that serve as regulatory tools in nearly all <b>genetic</b> processes, the <b>coding</b> sections represent the evolutionarily successful function of the genetic information storage medium. This indicates that the differences in their syntax structure are coherent with the differences of the functions they represent. Interestingly, these 2 <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> resemble the function of all natural languages, i. e., the repetitive non-coding sequences serve as appropriate tool for organization, coordination and regulation of group behavior, and the nonrepetitive coding sequences are for conservation of instrumental constructions, plans, blueprints for complex protein-body architecture. This differentiation may help to better understand RNA group behavioral motifs...|$|R

5|$|Stereochemical {{affinity}}: the <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is {{a result}} of a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity.

5|$|Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of the <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> that {{minimize the}} effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons).
