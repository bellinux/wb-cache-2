A computationally less expensive 120 ° wall segment approach was utilized for the simulations in this study. <b>Heat</b> <b>effects</b> of the reactions were introduced by heat generation/consumption {{terms in the}} catalyst particles considering suitable reaction kinetics proposed in the literature. Due to strong diffusion limitations {{the activity of the}} catalyst particles is confined to a thin layer at the particle surface. Therefore, the energetic effects of the reactions were restricted to the outer 5 % of the particle dimension by a user-defined code. The selection of the correct active region was verified for both the particle external and internal–hole surfaces. Simulation results of the reaction <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to cold flow cases where there were no <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> but only tube wall heat transfer. Due to the endothermic nature of the reactions, relatively lower temperature fields were observed when the <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> were introduced, where the positions of the solid particles play an important role.

Fog and mist are frequent, although the urban <b>heat</b> <b>effect</b> has made winters less foggy and cold than before. Snow can occasionally occur and prolonged winter droughts increasingly deny sufficient moisture to the soil. Summers are hot and humid, with July mean temperatures ranging between 22 °C and 25 °C (1971-2000 averages). Frequent thunderstorms and sudden hailstorms {{have the potential}} to produce large hail, dump large quantities of rain, and be highly destructive to crops.

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of the Joule <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> on electrokinetic flow focusing In electrokinetically driven microfluidic systems, the driving voltage applied during operation tends to induce a Joule <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> in the buffer solution. This heat source alters the solution’s characteristics and changes both the electrical potential {{field and the}} velocity field during the transport process. This study performs a series of numer-ical simulations to investigate the Joule <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> and analyzes its influence on the electrokinetic focusing performance. The {{results indicate that the}} Joule <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> causes the diffusion coefficient of the sample to increase, the potential distribution to change, and the flow velocity field to adopt a nonuniform profile. These variations are particularly pronounced under tighter focusing conditions and at higher applied elec-trical intensities. In numerical investigations, it is found that the focused bandwidth broadens because thermal diffusion effect is enhanced by Joule heating. The variation in the potential distribution induces a nonuniform flow field and causes the focused bandwidth to tighten and broaden alternately {{as a result of the}} convex and concave velocity flow profiles, respectively. The present results confirm that the Joule <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> exerts a considerable influence on the electrokinetic focusing ratio...|$|R

Results show that the influence of wall heat loss on gas explosion strength is significant. In addition, the influences of wall <b>heat</b> <b>effect</b> on explosion wave and flame propagation velocity in the gas explosion process are experimentally investigated in the adiabatic condition and heat conduction. It is found that the wall <b>heat</b> <b>effect</b> can affect gas explosion strength, flame propagation velocity, peak overpressure and the peak flame propagation velocity, and their influence degree becomes more significant with the increase of the adiabatic degree. Therefore, {{it can be seen that}} the wall <b>heat</b> <b>effect</b> has an important influence on the gas explosion and its propagation.
