40|$|In {{order to}} relate optical {{measurement}} of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) to the underlying structure, one must have accurate values for RNFL thickness at the locations measured optically. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a method for measuring RNFL thickness at any location on retinal tissue previously studied by other optical imaging. The method developed used confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM) to provide both en face and cross-sectional images of a whole-mounted retina. Isolated rat retina was fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde. Nerve fiber bundles were identified by using phalloidin to label F-actin and ganglion cell bodies were identified by DAPI fluorescent counterstain of nuclei. The flat-mounted retina was examined by cLSM. 2 -D images were collected through the retina to a depth at least covering the ganglion cell layer. The images were stacked to reconstruct cross-sectional images of the measured retina. Thickness of nerve fiber bundles was measured on these synthesized cross sections and compared with the measurement from conventional histologic sections. The <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> displayed individual nerve fiber bundles and ganglion cells between bundles as different colors. Blood vessels, which also bound phalloidin, were easily distinguished from nerve fiber bundles. The <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> displayed the same pattern of nerve fiber bundles as seen in imaging measurements and simplified the identification of corresponding areas in the two modalities. The cross-sectional images provided thickness measurements of the RNFL over the entire field-of-view, not just at the points represented by the conventional histologic section, resulting in a large increase in available data...|$|E

40|$|We {{apply the}} {{principle}} of master-slave (MS) interferometry to a full-field swept source optical coherence tomography (OCT) setup equipped with a fast 2 -D camera. MS interferometry does not involve Fourier transformations and, therefore, {{eliminates the need for}} spectrum data resampling required by the conventional spectral domain OCT. Using this method in a full-field OCT setup, <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> are acquired in vivo from finger skin, Drosophila melanogaster larvae, and pupae, with no spectrum resampling and no mechanical scanning. The signal processing is based on a comparison operation of the shapes of channeled spectra for each camera pixel, with a set of reference signals (masks). In this way, <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT <b>images</b> can be obtained with no need for the volumetric assembly and software cutting the <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> from an image volume, which are required by the conventional spectral domain OCT method. We demonstrate that the sensitivity and axial resolution of the MS method in a full-field swept source OCT setup are similar to the values obtained using the conventional Fourier-transformation-based swept source OCT method in a full-field setup. Multiple <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> can be produced in parallel by using multiple stored shapes of channeled spectra for the depths of interest.

Here we investigated the influence of parent artery curvature on the inflow zone location of unruptured sidewall internal carotid artery aneurysms. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: In 32 aneurysms, the inflow zone location was decided by 4 D flowMR imaging, and the radius of the parent artery curvature was measured in 2 D on an <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> of the section plane corresponding to the aneurysm orifice. RESULTS: The inflow zone was on the distal neck in 10 (group 1, 31. 3 %), on the lateral side in 19 (group 2, 59. 4 %), and on the proximal neck in 3 (group 3, 9. 4 %) aneurysms. The radius in group 1 was significantly larger than that in group 2 (8. 3 mm [4. 5 mm] versus 4. 5 mm [1. 9 mm]; median [interquartile range]; P. 0001). All 7 aneurysms with a radius of 8. 0 mm were in group 1. All 18 aneurysms with a radius of 6. 0 mm were in group 2 or 3. In two group 3 aneurysms, the inflow zone was located in a part of the neck extending beyond the central axis of the parent artery.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a recently}} developed non-invasive imaging modality, {{which is often}} used in ophthalmology. Because of the sequential scanning in form of A-scans, OCT suffers from the inevitable eye movement. This often leads to mis-alignment especially among consecutive B-scans, which affects the analysis and processing of the data such as the registration of the OCT <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> to color fundus image. In this paper, we propose a novel method to correct the mis-alignment among consecutive B-scans to improve the accuracy in multi-modality retinal image registration. In the method, we propose to compute decorrelation from overlapping B-scans and to detect the eye movement. Then, the B-scans with eye movement will be re-aligned to its precedent scans {{while the rest of}} B-scans without eye movement are untouched. Our experiments results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and success rate in the registration to color fundus images...|$|E
40|$|Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) is an {{emerging}} imaging modality {{with which the}} retinal circulation can be visualized by computing the decorrelation signal on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

Central to the CCD approach is the necessity for either very fast CCDs or carrier generation separate to the stepping reference mirror to track the high frequency OCT carrier.|$|R
30|$|Using this standard, the {{decrease}} in reflectivity on the en face scan should correlate with a decrease in visual acuity, so it is unclear why the visual function in our patient improved initially despite a constricting island of PR signal. One explanation {{could be that the}} en face OCT images would have eventually improved if our patient stayed in remission longer, creating a mismatch between the function and structural recovery. In this case, timely initiation of steroids may have halted or reduced the sensitivity of anti-retinal antibodies in attacking the retina to allow for vision recovery, but not in time to prevent changes to the reflectivity of the PRs on imaging. There have been other reports of vision function improving even without obvious signs of structural recovery [15, 16]. With this reasoning, the PRs can reorganize and restore function even though the reflectivity is abnormal. Of course, there are limitations to the interpretation of <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> reflections. The appearance of the PRs on OCT can change over minutes to hours because of the changes in the property of light as it passes through the PR outer segment and RPE interface; therefore, further studies should be done.|$|E

With the tracking system {{installed in the}} prototype and the montage scanning protocol, wide field OCT angiograms of 9 mm * 11 mm were created. OCT angiography utilizes the intrinsic motion of red blood cells as contrast mechanism therefore requires no exogenous contrast agents as fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography do. Four consecutive OCT scans were acquired at the same location for angiography generating, intensity based, phase based and complex signal based OCTA were all computed and compared. With the ability to resolve fine and detailed vascular lobules, complex signal based OMAG were selected for en face visualization. In consistency with histological studies, lobular vascular networks were observed and corresponding feeding arterioles were identified in OMAG images. Structural OCT <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> was also generated and at periphery regions, lobular structures can also be recognized with distinct brightness patterns.

40|$|In ophthalmology, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is {{becoming}} one of the dominant imaging technologies for both clinical diagnostics and vision research. In a previous bachelor’s thesis prior to this project, we described a highly optimized Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementation of the Fourier Domain (FD) OCT processing and visualization pipeline that was capable of real-time volume rendering at video rate. In this thesis, we describe three applications that build upon the GPU-based processing software: Speckle Variance (sv) OCT, Compressive Sample (CS) OCT, and Wavefront Sensorless Adaptive Optics (WSAO) OCT. We first demonstrate that svOCT can be a powerful fundus imaging technique for visualizing the retinal vasculature network, which may be comparable to the gold-standard technique called Fluorescein Angiography (FA). The strongest attribute of svOCT is that it bypasses the use of intravenous fluorescein for vascular contrast enhancement, and can be highly suitable for longitudinal monitoring of patients with vasculature-related pathologies in the retina. In our second application, we present a GPU-accelerated CS-OCT processing pipeline. The principle behind CS-OCT is {{to take advantage of the}} redundancy in biological structures, such as the retina, for reconstructing volumes acquired at a sampling density below the Nyquist criterion; the purpose is to justify decreasing volume acquisition time by significantly subsampling the datasets. In our final application, we present a WSAO-OCT system as a novel technique for cellular resolution imaging of the human photoreceptor layer.

40|$|Glaucoma is {{the second}} leading cause of {{blindness}} worldwide, which induces irreversible structural damage (retinal ganglion cell loss and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning) on the retina. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides RNFL thickness measurements, which have become an essential clinical measure for objective glaucoma assessment. RNFL thickness is measured on a cross-sectional retinal image sampled along a 3. 4 mm circle centered around the optic nerve head (ONH). With the conventional time-domain OCT (TD-OCT), its operator dependent scan registration {{is responsible for the}} majority of measurement variability. Recently, spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) technology has been introduced. SD-OCT provides faster scanning (up to 100 x) and finer axial resolution (up to 2 x) compared to TD-OCT, allowing three-dimensional (3 D) volume sampling. 3 D SD-OCT data can be visualized as an <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image</b> of the retina. This allows us to create a virtual OCT image along any sampling line (curved or straight), which permits virtually perfect scan registration. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve the clinical utility of OCT RNFL measurement by establishing data comparability across the multiple OCT generations and models. First, we developed an algorithm to match the TD-OCT scan location within the corresponding 3 D SD-OCT volume. Scan location matching (SLM) enables computation of the calibration equation between TD-OCT and SD-OCT for direct comparison of measurements, bridging the old technology with new ones. Second, the performance of the SLM method was measured using various SD-OCT devices with different spatial sampling methods. By making TD-OCT measurements at one time point comparable to the most recent SD-OCT measurement using SLM, glaucoma progression can be assessed on one to one basis. However, due to the variable TD-OCT scan registration over multiple visits, one can still not analyze the trend of glaucoma progression because RNFL thickness measured at different locations is not directly comparable even after calibration. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model of the retinal nerve fiber bundle distribution pattern to normalize the off-centered TD-OCT RNFL thickness to a virtually centered one. The outcome of this study would facilitate more accurate and reliable glaucoma disease/progression detection in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{development}} of non-invasive imaging techniques has been {{stimulated by the}} shortcomings of histopathology. Currently the only valid diagnostic technique in dermatology is skin biopsy which remains a painful, invasive intervention for the patient. Moreover, this approach is not always convenient for monitoring and follow-up of a skin disease. Optical imaging technologies could solve these shortcomings as they are fast, precise, repeatable and painless. There are four established non-invasive skin imaging techniques used in daily practice: dermoscopy, high-frequency ultrasound, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and conventional optical coherence tomography (C-OCT). In imaging there is a trade-off between resolution and penetration depth. The former permits the visualization of cells, if the resolution is at least 3 µm. The latter enables the recognition of patterns and structures in deeper layers of the skin if the penetration depth is deeper than 150 µm. New non-invasive techniques using infrared light sources have been developed recently. The technique used in this work is a high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT). Objectives. The overall aims of this thesis were the feasibility of HD-OCT to visualize in/ex vivo, in real time and in 3 -D the cellular and structural morphology of the skin, secondly {{the assessment of the}} capability of this technology to measure in vivo and real time the cutaneous optical properties, and finally the determination of the contribution of this technique to the non-invasive near-infrared imaging technologies. Five specific objectives have been established: i) could cells be observed in their 3 -D microenvironment in normal and diseased skin, ii) could we describe morphologic features of cells and structures in normal and diseased skin (m_HD-OCT), iii) could these morphologic features be quantified by optical property analysis (o_HD-OCT), iv) was it possible to perform accurate thickness measurements in normal and diseased skin, and finally v) what was the diagnostic potential of this technique?Methodology. HD-OCT uses a combination of parallel time-domain interferometry, high power tungsten lamp (with Gaussian filter, very low lateral coherence and ultra-high bandwidth (1300 nm +/- 100 nm)), and last but not least, full field illumination with real time focus tracking. A constant homogeneous resolution of 3 µm resolution in all three dimensions is obtained up to a depth of 570 µm. Hence, the system is capable of capturing real time full 3 -D images. Moreover, the in vivo assessment of optical properties of the skin is only applicable to OCT when operating in focus-tracking mode, which is the case for HD-OCT. The means to obtain answers to the five specific questions were the comparison of en face HD-OCT images with RCM and HD-OCT cross-sectional images with histopathology and C-OCT. Results. At least 160 line pares were observed by imaging a high resolution phantom with HD-OCT. This suggested a 3 µm lateral resolution. The presence of cells such as keratinocytes, melanocytes, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and melanophages in their 3 -D cutaneous microenvironment in vivo as well as ex vivo has been demonstrated. A qualitative description of structures and patterns in normal and diseased skin could be performed by HD-OCT. Clear structural changes of the epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, papillary dermis and reticular dermis related to intrinsic skin ageing could be observed. Lobulated structures, surrounded by stretched stromal fibers and arborizing vessels, could be demonstrated in nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The o_HD-OCT of normal and diseased skin could be assessed in vivo. This approach permitted the quantitative assessment of the OCT signal attenuation profiles of normal healthy skin, actinic keratosis (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Differences in signal attenuation profiles could be demonstrated between these three groups. These differences were also observed between BCC subtypes. The slope of the exponential attenuation of the signal in {{the upper part of the}} epidermis was very high in benign nevi. The more malignant the lesion the lower the slope. Thickness measurements of epidermis and papillary dermis could be performed by m_HD-OCT, based on a cross-sectional images and their corresponding <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>image.</b> More accurate measurements of epidermal and papillary dermal thickness could be performed based on the optical analysis of a skin volume by o_HD-OCT. The diagnostic potential of HD-OCT in comparison with dermoscopy, RCM and C-OCT could be assessed regarding i) melanoma, ii) BCC differentiation from BCC imitators and BCC sub-differentiation and iii) SCC differentiation from AK. A much higher diagnostic potential could be demonstrated for o_HD-OCT in comparison with m_HD-OCT concerning melanoma detection. The diagnostic potential of HD-OCT to discriminate BCC from clinical BCC imitators was moderate. However, HD-OCT seemed to have high potential in sub-differentiation of BCC subtypes: i) it seemed to be the best technique to include and exclude a superficial BCC, ii) the technique appeared to be the best approach to exclude nodular BCC, and iii) HD-OCT looked to be the best technique to include an infiltrative BCC. Finally, HD-OCT has proven to be a powerful method to discriminate AK from SCC. Conclusions. HD-OCT is able to capture real time 3 -D imaging with a sufficiently high optical resolution and penetration depth to allow the visualization of cells in and ex vivo in their micro-architectural context. At the same time, HD-OCT permits the recognition of patterns and structures in a sufficiently large volume of skin (1. 5 mm³). HD-OCT closes therefore the gap between RCM with a high resolution but low penetration depth and C-OCT with a low resolution but high penetration depth. Moreover, HD-OCT permits, in contrast to RCM and C-OCT, the real time in vivo analysis of optical properties of the skin. HD-OCT seems to be a promising tool for early diagnosis of melanoma, BCC sub-differentiation and differentiation between SCC and AK. Future perspectives. Multicenter validation studies are needed to determine the diagnostic performance of this promising new technology, especially in other clinical settings combining both morphological and optical property analysis. This combined analysis could be a valuable method not only for diagnosis, monitoring and therapeutic guidance of dermatologic diseases but it could also be helpful in the management of non-dermatologic conditions such as diabetic micro-angiopathy, infantile cystinosis or even osteoporosis.  Doctorat en Sciences médicales (Santé Publique) info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

In contrast, the beta zone significantly correlated with age (P = 0. 0249) and glaucoma (P = 0. 014). <b>En</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> reconstructed from 3 D SS-OCT data facilitated measurements of the beta and the gamma PPA zones even in eyes with optic disc distortion. The OCT-defined beta zone is associated with glaucoma and age, whereas the gamma zone correlated with myopia but not with glaucoma. This study confirmed the clinical usefulness of OCT-based classification of the PPA zones in distinguishing glaucomatous damage of the optic nerve from myopic damage in non-highly myopic eyes...|$|R

A case report of a 48 -year-old woman with recent vision loss from ERM imaged using an AO-flood fundus camera and high resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (Fd-OCT) before and 3 months after vitrectomy. Visual acuity improved from 20 / 70 to 20 / 20 after vitrectomy.

30|$|In {{the index}} study, we have {{described}} the differentiating features of VKH and CSC in the acute stage using the non-invasive technique of OCTA and <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT. OCTA has been recently shown {{to be an effective}} tool to identify the changes at the level of choriocapillaris in acute VKH and in monitoring the disease resolution, recurrence, and persistence in conjunction with clinical examination and other multimodal imaging techniques by our group [17]. In the present study, <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCTA <b>images</b> in the acute stage of VKH showed multiple dark foci of flow void suggestive of choriocapillaris hypoperfusion which were variable in shape and size (20 eyes; 100 %). ICGA imaging in these eyes confirmed the presence of choriocapillaris ischemia in the areas of choroidal inflammatory foci. The corresponding OCTA structural <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> showed no evidence of signal loss suggesting that these hyporeflective areas represented true flow void (Fig.  3).|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} with VKH disease, eyes with acute CSC showed two patterns of alterations on <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCTA imaging and <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT scans. One pattern, mottled dark areas appeared as irregular dark areas on OCTA that {{corresponded to the}} subretinal fluid on OCT B-scan. The second pattern of alteration resulted due to RPE detachments and was seen as hyporeflective, dense dark areas (Table  3). The structural <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> showed signal loss due to the shadowing effect of the overlying retinal structures, subretinal fluid, and RPE, thereby confirming that such dark hyporeflective areas did not represent true flow void.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the retinal and choroidal vascular pattern, structure, and thickness using high-speed, high axial resolution, swept-source {{optical coherence tomography}} (SS-OCT) at 1060 nm, demonstrating enhanced penetration through all choroidal layers. Methods. An ophthalmic SS-OCT system was developed operating at 57, 000 A-lines/s with 5. 9 μm axial resolution and was used to collect 3 D images with scanning angles up to ∼ 70 ° × 35 °. The similar features were observed in the choroidal layers by imaging three healthy volunteers. <b>En</b> <b>face</b> <b>images,</b> extracted at different depths, capture features of the retinal and choroidal vasculature networks and substructure. Retinal and choroidal thicknesses were measured over scanning angles of ∼ 14 ° × 14 °, yielding retinal and choroidal thickness maps. Results. The retinal layers, choriocapillaris (CC), Sattler's layer (SL), Haller's layer (HL), and the lamina suprachoroid layer (LSL) were delineated in 2 D sagittal tomograms. The sagittal tomograms and <b>en</b> <b>face</b> reflectance <b>images</b> over a 2 -cm^ 2 field of view captured the paraoptic, lateral and medial distal short posterior ciliary artery (SPCA) branches {{as well as the}} two lateral and medial long posterior ciliary arteries (LPCAs). <b>En</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> in the HL revealed the superotemporal, inferotemporal, superonasal, and inferonasal major choroidal vessels. Conclusions. High-speed, high-resolution SS-OCT centered at 1060 nm enables retinal and choroidal vasculature networks visualization, including retina vessels, posterior ciliary artery (PCA) branches, and venous vascular patterns. This technology offers diagnostic opportunities by monitoring change in these networks, substructure, and retinal and choroidal thicknesses during disease initiation and progression...|$|R
40|$|Aims: It is well {{established}} that glaucoma results in a thinning of the inner retina. To investigate whether the outer retina is also involved, ultrahigh-resolution retinal imaging techniques were utilised. Methods: Eyes from 10 glaucoma patients (25 - 78 years old), were imaged using three research-grade instruments: (1) ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (UHR-FD-OCT), (2) adaptive optics (AO) UHR-FD-OCT and (3) AO-flood illuminated fundus camera (AO-FC). UHR-FD-OCT and AO-UHR-FD-OCT B-scans were examined for any abnormalities in the retinal layers. On some patients, cone density measurements were made from the AO-FC <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images.</b> Correlations between retinal structure and visual sensitivity were measured by Humphrey visual-field (VF) testing made at the corresponding retinal locations. Results: All three in vivo imaging modalities revealed evidence of outer retinal changes along with the expected thinning of the inner retina in glaucomatous eyes with VF loss. AO-UHR-FD-OCT images identified {{the exact location of}} structural changes within the cone photoreceptor layer with the AO-FC <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> showing dark areas in the cone mosaic at the same retinal locations with reduced visual sensitivity. Conclusion: Losses in cone density along with expected inner retinal changes were demonstrated in well-characterised glaucoma patients with VF loss...|$|R
40|$|Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) {{disease and}} central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) develop serous retinal detachment; however, the {{treatment}} of each disease is totally different. Steroids treat VKH but worsen CSC; therefore, {{it is important to}} distinguish these diseases. Here, we report a case with CSC which was diagnosed by <b>en</b> <b>face</b> optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging during the course of VKH disease. A 50 -year-old man was referred with blurring of vision in his right eye. Fundus examination showed bilateral optic disc swelling and macular fluid in the right eye. OCT showed thick choroid, and <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT <b>images</b> depicted blurry choroid without clear delineation of choroidal vessels. Combined with angiography findings, this patient was diagnosed with VKH disease and treated with steroids. Promptly, fundus abnormalities resolved with the reduction of the choroidal thickness and the choroidal vessels became visible on the <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images.</b> During the tapering of the steroid, serous macular detachment in the right eye recurred several times. Steroid treatment was effective at first; however, at the fourth appearance of submacular fluid, the patient did not respond. At that time, the choroidal vessels on the <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT <b>images</b> were clear, which significantly differed from the images at the time of recurrence of VKH.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the characteristics of microcystic macular edema (MME) determined from the <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> obtained by an adaptive optics (AO) fundus camera in patients with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) and to try to determine the mechanisms underlying the degeneration of the inner retinal cells and RNFL by using the advantage of AO. Six patients from 4 families with ADOA underwent detailed ophthalmic examinations including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Mutational screening of all coding and flanking intron sequences of the OPA 1 gene was performed by DNA sequencing. SD-OCT showed a severe reduction in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in all patients. A new splicing defect and two new frameshift mutations with premature termination of the Opa 1 protein were identified in three families. A reported nonsense mutation was identified in one family. SD-OCT of one patient showed MME in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. AO images showed microcysts in the <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> of the INL.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a well-established}} imaging method in the ophthalmic practice. We describe a novel corneal topography method that directly measures anterior cornea surface elevation {{from a single}} <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT <b>image.</b> This method uses an OCT interferometer configuration equipped with a multiple delay element (MDE) in the reference arm. The MDE selects multiple axial positions within the target object, simultaneously, which leads to information from multiple axial distances to be cumulated in a single <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT frame. When an <b>en</b> <b>face</b> OCT scan of a cornea is acquired with such an OCT setup, the resulting image contains nonoverlapping circular contours. Images of a reflective metallic sphere obtained using this method are used to numerically calibrate the setup. Using these calibration results, position information contained in the <b>en</b> <b>face</b> <b>images</b> from the cornea can be measured directly obtaining three-dimensional coordinates for multiple points located on the cornea surface. From these points, the topographic map of the anterior cornea surface can be generated, using interpolation or Zernike polynomial decomposition.
