5|$|<b>Essence</b> is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's <b>essence</b> capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum <b>essence</b> summons a creature which costs 20 <b>essence,</b> their maximum <b>essence</b> is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain <b>essence.</b> A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more <b>essence</b> to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more <b>essence</b> and reduces the amount of <b>essence</b> available to summon other creations or cast spells. <b>Essence</b> and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} an {{examination}} of the debate around <b>essences</b> in feminist philosophy and theorizing. Here, <b>essences</b> are rethought through Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology as carnal or embodied <b>essences.</b> As such, embodied <b>essences</b> are found at the joints, the hollows that are not inside us but that connect us, so that we are not isolated within cultural and historical zones. Embodied <b>essences</b> can be taken up in language as idealities...|$|R

40|$|Phenomena may preferably be {{appreciated}} as <b>essences,</b> and describing phenomena and their <b>essences</b> {{is a common}} methodological goal in phenomenological research, e. g. {{in the area of}} health and well-being. Consequently it is important to explore the meaning of <b>essences,</b> thereby answering the questions, What are phenomenological <b>essences?</b> How do they come to be? What are their characteristics? In this article I suggest some possible answers to these questions through an analysis of Husserl’s philosophy and especially his understanding of intentionality. Further, I want to show that the analysis of <b>essences</b> in empirical research never can be separated from the context of the phenomenon. Here I draw on the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty and especially his philosophy of ‘‘the flesh’’...|$|R
5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} by earlier Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as the}} Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, claiming that they were not a priori. He rejected the argument on the basis that existence precedes <b>essence,</b> or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their <b>essence.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of density and time of urea foliar {{application}} on oil yield and <b>essences</b> percentage of black cumin (Nigella Sativa L.) a field experiment was conducted at Research Station of Faculty of Agriculture, Azad University of Birjand in 1387 growing season. Three urea foliar application times [1 -control 2 -at 8 - 10 leaves stage 3 -at 10 % flowering 4 - 100 % flowering] and three plant densities (100, 200, 300 plant m-²) were compared in split plot based on complete randomized block design with three replications. Studied components were seed yield, oil yield, <b>essences</b> yield, oil percentage, <b>essences</b> percentage. Results showed that urea foliar application times had significant effects on <b>essences</b> percentage and <b>essences</b> yield. Density had significant effects on oil and <b>essences</b> percentage, <b>essences</b> yield and seed yield. Between all densities 200 plant m-² and urea application at 8 - 10 leaves stage had the highest seed yield (593 / 33 kg/ha) and 100 plant m-² and foliar application at 8 - 10 leaves stage had the lowest (243 / 33 kg/ha) seed yield. 300 plant m-² and urea application at 100 % flowering stage had the highest <b>essences</b> yield (2 / 72 kg/ha). 200 plant m-² and urea application at 10 % flowering stage had the highest (0 / 56 %) <b>essences</b> percentage. 300 plant m-² and urea application at 100 % flowering stage had the highest <b>essences</b> yield (173 / 15 kg/ha). Between all densities 100 plant m-² and urea application at 8 - 10 leaves stage had the highest (173 / 15 kg/ha) oil percentage. It seems that 300 plants m-² and urea application at 100 % flowering is the best treatment for black cumin yield and it's quality in Birjand...|$|R

5|$|The Temple {{teaches that}} the true self, or <b>essence,</b> is immortal, and Xeper {{is the ability to}} align {{consciousness}} with this <b>essence.</b> Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the <b>essence</b> of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His <b>essence,</b> only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E

5|$|After {{the player}} {{successfully}} obtains {{the assistance of}} each of the primary factions, a Landsmeet is called among the nobles of Ferelden. There, the player confronts Loghain, ultimately either executing him or sparing and initiating him into the Grey Wardens (causing Alistair to resign). The player also settles who will lead Ferelden against the Blight (Alistair and/or Anora) and rallies the rest of the kingdom against the Darkspawn. At this point, the player learns that due to the Taint, only a Grey Warden can slay the Archdemon. Killing it will release a demonic <b>essence</b> within it, which is drawn to the Taint in the Grey Warden and effectively kills them; if anyone else slays it, the <b>essence</b> will survive and find a new host in the nearest Darkspawn, making the monster effectively immortal.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's <b>essence,</b> and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his <b>essence</b> into the world.|$|E
