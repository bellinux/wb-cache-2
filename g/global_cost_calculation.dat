40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} for supporting decision making in design activities; in case of new projects or retrofitting of existing buildings. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted; involving Real Estate Appraisal and Economic Evaluation of Project and Building Environmental Design. It is proposed a methodology for selecting the preferable solutions among technological options; considering both economic and environmental aspects; in terms of global performance. Assuming the principles of Life Cycle Thinking and Circular Economy focus is posed at the end‐of‐life stage. Attention is paid on disposal costs and residual value as relevant items enable to orient investment decisions. This is done through an approach for quantifying environmental indicators related to Life Cycle Assessment (Standard ISO 14040 : 2006); and economic indicators adopting the Life Cycle Costing (Standard ISO 15686 : 2008). The paper proposes a conjoint "economic‐environmental indicator". An application of <b>Global</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>calculation</b> is illustrated; including monetized environmental impacts (Embodied energy and Embodied carbon); disposal/dismantling costs and residual value. The result of the <b>Global</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>calculation</b> is expressed through a "synthetic economic‐environmental indicator" in order to select; between two different technologies; the most viable solution for a multifunctional building glass façade project; in Northern Italy. The study demonstrates that the initial investment decisions depend on the design solutions; since the early stages; related to the whole building life cycle considering conjointly the construction‐management phases and the end‐of‐life stage...|$|E

These objectives lead to the proposed Semi-Global Matching method that performs pixelwise matching based on Mutual Information and the approximation of a global smoothness constraint. Occlusions are detected and disparities determined with sub-pixel accuracy. Additionally, an extension for multi-baseline stereo images is presented. There are two novel contributions. Firstly, a hierarchical calculation of Mutual Information based matching is shown, which is almost as fast as intensity based matching. Secondly, an approximation of a <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> <b>calculation</b> is proposed that can be performed in a time that is linear {{to the number of}} pixels and disparities.

40|$|Concise Summary An integer {{programming}} problem which is solved by the enumerative approach was parallelized using PVM [1]. The <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> function <b>calculation</b> for each feasible configuration solution {{is independent of}} the others, thus amenable to straightforward parallelization. On the other hand, the enumeration of nodes of the tree being searched grows exponentially. A simplified heuristic cost, depending only on the current node is a must for efficient pruning, but not enough for all practical purposes. This paper shows that exchange of pruning information by sibling processes working in parallel, dramatically shortens the whole calculation, while preserving {{the quality of the}} resulting configuration. 1 The Optimization Problem Given a set of electric power sources, the problem is to schedule their maintenance outages along the year, obeying a set of constraints.

40|$|Abstract During the {{uncontrolled}} consumption {{period the}} building sector {{has come to}} account {{one of the greatest}} proportions of greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in industrial countries. In this context, European countries have decided to address the environmental challenge by promoting the use of renewable energies and the implementation of low energy consumption requirements. For these reasons, zero emission buildings, which have a net zero annual energy demand, were regarded as a possible solution. And everything points to believe that they will continue to be crucial in a recent future. Consultants and contractors have shown the need towards a better understanding and knowledge regarding the selection of renewable energy supply solution for ZEBs. Accordingly, this Mater Thesis aims to explain how to use the new methodology for a cost-optimal selection of energy systems in early design phase analysis. It consists on a number of guidelines and Excel files that serve as templates for different calculations. The project is part of the development of a decision support method that automates the process of selecting the best system, in this particular case in office buildings. This early design phase study is not only focused on giving a cost-optimal alternative but also on performing a full analysis in terms of energy performance. It also shows the steps for both the energy systems dimension and the selection of office building parameters. A concept office building with four storeys is selected and modelled in connection with the Norwegian ZEB centre s project report 8. Following the Norwegian NZEB definition, the simulation software IDA-ICE is used as a tool for modelling the building and simulating the energy demand. It analyses six different energy supply combinations which were selected between available renewable technologies in Norway. In comparison to the previous study applied in residential buildings, this project introduces the building s cooling demand as a new feature of the analysis. Therefore, reversible heat pumps, free-cooling with the ground and chillers are also taken into account. Further, energy systems are economically compared by using <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> <b>calculations,</b> following the European Cost Optimal Methodology. Results are given in a graph where <b>global</b> <b>costs</b> and CO 2 emissions produced by the energy balance of the building are shown in each axis. Finally the cost-optimal energy supply, the system with lower <b>global</b> <b>costs,</b> is selected like the most suitable option. In addition, the building energy performance is also discussed as an important parameter to be considered in the decision making process. At the end, the sensitivity analysis shows stable results with regard to changes in energy price development and PV area...|$|R
40|$|All new {{buildings}} will be nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB) in Europe {{by the end}} of 2020, in compliance with the recast Directive on the Building Energy Performance (EPBD recast 2010 / 31 /EU). Thereby changes to the energy performance requirements for buildings are also expected to come through the application of costoptimality concept. The European Parliament and the Council have hence established that Member States (MS) have to create a set of reference buildings to which apply energy efficiency measures and to calculate the cost optimal levels of minimum energy performance. In particular the cost optimal level is defined as the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle. It must be calculated in accordance with a comparative methodology framework that is based on the <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> method. This one considers, for each energy efficiency measure, the initial investment, the sum of the annual costs for every year (including energy costs) and the final value, all with reference to the starting year of the calculation period. The analysis carried on within this research, apply the comparative methodology framework to two European case studies in order to compare the obtainable results and point out the criticalities of this procedure. In particular two reference existing buildings, now mainly used for office purpose, were selected as the EPBD recast requires applying the cost-optimal procedures by using typical buildings; one of them is representative of the Italian existing buildings stock and the other one of the Turkish one. Although Turkey is not yet a European Member State, but just a candidate, the cost optimal methodology has been applied to a Turkish case study as this methodology represents a current and widespread area of research also in this country. A set of energy efficiency measures has been selected, organized into packages and applied to retrofit the reference buildings. They mostly consist of the improvement of the envelope thermal insulation and of the systems efficiency; the measures have been defined in compliance with the respective national regulations in terms of energy. The on-site production of renewable energy, from PV system on the building roof (when suitable according to the law), has been considered as an additional efficiency measure. The office buildings energy performance and the impact of the efficiency measures have been assessed by means of dynamic simulation with the EnergyPlus code. In order to establish which of the packages defined has the lowest <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> and represents thus the cost optimal level, the <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> method has been applied to the two reference buildings according to the European Standard EN 15459 : 2007. The <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> <b>calculations</b> result in a net present value of costs incurred during a defined calculation period, taking into account the residual values of components with longer lifetimes. Finally, a comparison of the results achieved in the analyses in the two different European countries has been develope...|$|R

By considering a subsystem corresponding to each period, we have network system with a parallel structure of T subsystem where each subsystem has q processes connected in series. Using the proposed multi-period DEA model and also the mathematical relationships between the <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> efficiencies of the total system, its subsystems and its processes, we measure the multi-period <b>global</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency of network system in three different ways.
