5|$|Half a {{year after}} the Lindisfarne trip, Pete and Jenny have separated. He moves from house to house, {{eventually}} finding a houseshare with a gay landlord. He has a brief fling with Ramona, which is followed by some dates with a teacher (Pooky Quesnel). Jenny begins a relationship with a <b>dotcom</b> millionaire (Ben Miles), who decorates her house with flowers and takes her on a trip to New York. The fling ends when Jenny realises he does not love her. She and Pete reconcile after briefly considering a divorce. David and Karen bring home their newborn twins, and Karen's ex-pat mother (Mel Martin) moves in for a couple of episodes.

25|$|On 20 January 2012, {{the police}} flew in by {{helicopter}} and arrested Kim <b>Dotcom</b> {{and three others}} in Coatesville, Auckland, in an armed raid on Dotcom's house following United States cybercrime indictments against him for on-line piracy via his internet file sharing company, Megaupload. Assets worth $17 million were seized including eighteen luxury cars, giant screen TVs and works of art. According to <b>Dotcom,</b> about 80 police officers {{were involved in the}} operation; the New Zealand police claimed it was between 20 and 30. The incident became controversial when a district court judge ruled that the warrants issued for the property seizures were invalid and it turned out the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had broken the law when asked by police to spy on <b>Dotcom.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{prices of}} {{consumer}} electronics {{sold on the}} Web by both online-only retailers (<b>Dotcoms)</b> and the online branches of multi-channel retailers (MCRs). Surprisingly, it finds that <b>Dotcoms</b> charge higher price than MCRs, a conclusion contradictory {{to the results of}} most of empirical studies. Also finds that the electronics prices decreased over the period of study in general, dropping about 0. 6 percent per week, and the prices of MCRs and <b>Dotcoms</b> went down with time at a similar speed. Further, the prices across MCRs are 35. 3 percent more dispersed than the prices across the <b>Dotcoms</b> based on full prices, and 33. 1 percent more dispersed based on percentage prices. However, results show that price dispersion moved up with time in general, with {{no significant difference in the}} speeds between MCRs and <b>Dotcoms...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} <b>dotcoms</b> has been short lived. Within a short {{span of a}} few years the <b>dotcoms</b> {{experienced}} a meteoric rise and suffered a dramatic fall. This research is a support vector machine based investigation of <b>dotcoms</b> from a financial perspective. Data from the financial statements of survived and failed <b>dotcoms</b> are collected and 24 financial ratios are computed. The financial ratios are analyzed using support vector machines to find out whether they can predict the financial fate of companies. The results show that support vector machines can predict the financial fate of <b>dotcoms</b> with at most 76 % accuracy. Several numerical experiments are conducted to check the impact of size of training sample, size of testing sample, ratio of training and testing sample size, and balance of sample on the classification accuracy of support vector machines...|$|R
40|$|We compare price {{differences}} and market dynamics between {{two types of}} online retailers: online branches of multichannel retailers (OBMCRs) and pure Internet retailers (<b>Dotcoms),</b> based {{on a set of}} panel data collected from the DVD market. We find that (i) OBMCRs charge higher prices than <b>Dotcoms,</b> (ii) prices go up with time for both OBMCRs and <b>Dotcoms,</b> and (iii) prices of <b>Dotcoms</b> go up faster than those of OBMCRs. We also find that price dispersions of OBMCRs and <b>Dotcoms</b> are significantly different and the difference decreases with time. Our results show that although the two types of retailers have different price levels and different price dispersions at the beginning, such differences are getting smaller over time, implying that the two types of retailers will have similar pricing behavior in the long run. However, persistent price dispersion among all retailers exists in the market, even over a long period...|$|R
25|$|In 2003 Pataki made a {{controversial}} budget proposal {{in which he}} proposed several tax cuts, despite the state's rising deficits due to drying up tax revenue from the once boom to now bust <b>dotcom</b> sector, and resulting tech layoffs. He also made cuts in {{education and health care}} funding, which some alleged would close emergency rooms and turn non-profit hospitals into for-profits. Pataki argued that new taxes would drive businesses out-of-state, reduce jobs and further compound the state deficit.|$|E

It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about £6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{pricing behaviour}} and market dynamics for both online branches of Multi-Channel Retailers (MCRs) and online-only retailers (<b>Dotcoms),</b> {{based on a}} set of panel data collected for 2 years in the online DVD market. We find that prices of MCRs and <b>Dotcoms</b> both go down with time, but prices of MCRs decrease in a significantly faster speed, implying that difference in the average prices between the two types of retailers is getting smaller with time. We also compare the price dispersion and its dynamics between MCRs and <b>Dotcoms.</b> We find that the price dispersion among MCRs is much bigger than that among <b>Dotcoms</b> at the beginning. But such a difference gets smaller with time as the price dispersion among <b>Dotcoms</b> becomes bigger. Our results suggest that the two types of retailers will not only charge similar average prices in long term, but also have similar price dispersions. But our findings show that price dispersion among all retailers goes up with time, indicating that prices do not converge in the Internet market. Branding makes significant difference on both the price and the price dispersion. ...|$|R

25|$|Telecommunications {{equipment}} providers, {{convinced that}} the future economy would require ubiquitous broadband access, went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high-speed equipment and fiber optic cables. In the struggle to become a technology hub, many cities and states used tax money to fund technology conference centers, advanced infrastructure, and created favorable business and tax law to encourage development of the <b>dotcom</b> industry in their locale. Virginia's Dulles Technology Corridor along I-495 {{is a prime example}} of this activity. Large quantities of high-speed fiber links were laid, and the State and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms. Office vacancy increased significantly after the bubble burst, although the area still remains a major technology hub.|$|E
25|$|Neither Kroupa nor Fancher ever {{discussed}} the excess that {{was taking place}} behind the scenes until nearly {{a decade after the}} fact, {{but it was not a}} well kept secret. Although MindVox quickly became notorious for the escapades of its hard-partying clientele, there is little or no evidence that Fancher was involved personally in the wild lifestyles of its members. However, he was at least indirectly affected, in that by 1995 Kroupa's drug use was fast becoming legendary and his ability to function on a daily basis was diminishing. While the media's fascination with MindVox never ended, the development and growth of the system had slowed down and Phantom Access Technologies was taking on consulting positions to help other companies create their own online presence, and Fancher gained growing acclaim as a software architect and member of the <b>dot.com</b> technocracy.|$|E
40|$|Before {{the advent}} of the internet, the {{mainstream}} media in Zimbabwe and across the globe, enjoyed the privilege of mediating and interpreting football â€˜realityâ€™ to the audiences. This â€˜privilegeâ€™ to mediate reality and the traditional practice of sports reporting in general, is undeniably under threat in this internet age. Academic studies focusing on the influence of internet sites such as Facebook, have overlooked how internet has affected the sport reporting landscape. This study located in the interpretive prism of qualitative paradigm of research, makes a â€˜thick descriptionâ€™ (see Geertz 1973) of Zimbabwe sports journalistsâ€™ experiences and perceptions of DeMbare <b>DotComs,</b> a vibrant Facebook page for Dynamos fans. The intention was to find out how DeMbare <b>DotComs,</b> has affected the way sports journalists mediate and interpret football â€˜realityâ€™ to the audiences in Zimbabwe. Findings show that social (new) media network sites such as DeMbare <b>DotComs</b> has threatened and affected the traditional practice of football reporting in Zimbabwe. In actual fact sports journalists compete with DeMbare <b>DotComs</b> to break news and â€˜scoopsâ€™ to the audiences.

25|$|Both {{stamp duty}} and SDRT {{remain in place}} today, albeit with {{continued}} relief for intermediaries, so that over 70% of transactions are exempt from tax. SDRT accounts {{for the majority of}} revenue collected on share transactions effected through the UK's Exchanges. On average almost 90% of revenues stem from the SDRT. Only a minor part comes from Stamp Duty. Revenue is pro-cyclical with economic activity. In terms of GDP and total tax revenue the highest values were reached during the <b>dot.com</b> boom years around the end of the 20th century, notably in 2000–01. In 2007–08, SDRT generated €5.37 billion in revenue (compared to 0.72 billion of the standard stamp duty). This accounts for 0.82% over total UK tax revenue or 0.30% of GDP. In 2008–09 the figure dropped to €3.67 billion (0.22% of GDP), due to reduced share prices and trading volumes {{as a result of the}} financial crisis.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Key was {{implicated in}} the arrest of Kim <b>Dotcom</b> and the {{subsequent}} revelations that the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had illegally spied on <b>Dotcom.</b> As Prime Minister, Key was directly responsible for the GCSB, which {{is not allowed to}} spy on New Zealand citizens – and <b>Dotcom</b> had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, [...] Key apologised for the illegal spying. [...] "I apologize to Mr <b>Dotcom.</b> I apologize to New Zealanders because every New Zealander…is entitled to be protected from the law {{when it comes to the}} GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him."

5000|$|Issues {{were raised}} with how broadly the {{original}} search warrant was written. According to Rothken the warrant was very broad, {{and could have}} included family photos. It provided little guidance on what to actually gather, leading the court to determine the search warrant was overly broad. The U.S. then quickly removed the seized information from New Zealand, even before the court could make this ruling. [...] "They just went and grabbed everything. It's like, literally going into someone's home with a search warrant and just clearing the whole place out, which happened." [...] said Auckland defense lawyer Gary Gotlieb. The Court found that the raid on <b>Dotcom's</b> home in Coatesville was illegal based on invalid search warrants and that the police illegally seized Kim <b>Dotcom's</b> computer systems and data. The Court {{also found that the}} United States violated the law when they removed <b>Dotcom's</b> data from New Zealand without authorization.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} pricing {{trends in the}} online toy markets based on {{a unique set of}} panel data {{collected}} across three years’ span. The analysis was made through panel data regression models with error components and serial correlation, allowing comparisons of prices and price dispersions between the two types of online retailers as well as examinations of dynamics of prices and price dispersions. Our results indicate that both online branch of multichannel retailers (OBMCRS) and <b>dotcoms</b> charge similar prices on average, and over time their prices move in tandem. Although the OBMCR retailers charge significantly different prices, the <b>dotcoms</b> do charge similar prices. Moreover, both retailer types demonstrate different magnitudes of price dispersion that move at different rates over time. Although the price dispersion of OBMCRS is higher than that of the <b>dotcoms</b> at the beginning, the gap narrows over time. e-commerce, online pricing strategies, online toy market, price dispersion, pricing trends...|$|R

2500|$|Lee-Chin was {{reluctant}} {{to invest in the}} <b>dotcom</b> boom, and saw AIC investments lose 8 per cent in value, even as the S gained 56 per cent. Investors moved US$224 million out of AIC's flagship [...] "Advantage Mutual Fund". The Globe and Mail ran an article predicting even more investors to leave the fund, meaning that they would run out of cash and be forced to sell its core holdings. Lee-Chin's response was to sell stock in Coca-Cola, and invest US$65 million into Mackenzie Holdings (the same firm in which he had invested US$400,000 16 years previously). Letters were sent to all 350,000 investors, explaining the strategy. The investors were calmed by the purchase, and the stock was later sold to Investor Group (the same company Lee-Chin had worked for in the 1980s) at more than twice the price AIC had paid for it. In 2000 and 2001, following the <b>dotcom</b> crash, AIC outperformed the market with 26 per cent growth and 4 per cent decline respectively.|$|E
