25|$|The 1792, Treaty of Jassy {{forced the}} Ottoman Empire to cede Yedisan to the Russian Empire, which made Russian {{presence}} much more notable, {{given that the}} Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia.

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the book}} was almost {{immediate}} in the influence it had upon William Butterfield's All Saints, Margaret Street Church. Politician Alexander Beresford Hope and architect Butterfield had agreed upon the general details just a month after Ruskin's book was published and by August they had revised their plans to encapsulate the principles it espoused. All Saints is considered the first Ruskinian building due to its use of brick 'honestly' employed as a structural system rather than for surface decoration.|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} {{appendix}} for the Italian {{edition of the}} book Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity by August Kopff in 1923, Fermi {{was the first to}} point out that hidden inside the famous Einstein equation (...) was an enormous amount of nuclear potential energy to be exploited. [...] "It does not seem possible, at least in the near future", he wrote, [...] "{{to find a way to}} release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the <b>first</b> <b>effect</b> of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it." ...|$|E

One famous, anonymous Hiroshima victim, sitting on stone steps [...] from the hypocenter, left only a shadow, having absorbed the fireball heat that permanently bleached the surrounding stone. Simultaneous fires were started throughout the blast-damaged area by fireball heat and by overturned stoves and furnaces, electrical shorts, etc. Twenty minutes after the detonation, these fires had merged into a firestorm, pulling in surface air from all directions to feed an inferno which consumed everything flammable.|$|E

[...] If the first part to arrive at shore is the ridge, a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the <b>first</b> <b>effect</b> noticed on land. [...] However, if the first part to arrive is a trough, a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically, exposing normally submerged areas. [...] Drawback can exceed hundreds of metres, and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>effect</b> the {{opposition}} had {{that led to}} the end of the war was that fewer soldiers were available for the army. The draft was protested and even ROTC programs too. Howard Zinn first provides a note written by a student of Boston University on May 1, 1968, which stated to his draft board, [...] "I have absolutely no intention to report for that exam, or for induction, or to aid in any way the American war effort against the people of Vietnam…" [...] The opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States. This refusal letter soon led to an overflow of refusals ultimately leading to the event provided by Zinn stating, [...] "In May 1969 the Oakland induction center, where draftees reported from all of Northern California, reported that of 4,400 men ordered to report for induction, 2,400 did not show up. In the first quarter of 1970 the Selective Service System, for the first time, could not meet its quota." ...|$|E
2500|$|The prince's journey {{begins with}} an act of pity: upon {{preparing}} to cross a bridge, the hero notes that {{it is home to}} an ant colony, and, fearful of destroying it, opts instead to cross through the riverbed. An alate ant visits him and rewards his deed with one of its wings, guaranteeing that, should he ever need assistance, burning the item would instantly summon the entire colony to his aid. A similar encounter takes place after Harap Alb fashions his hat into a hive, to be used by a homeless swarm of bees: the grateful queen bee presents him with another wing, with which to summon her and her subjects. Further down on his path, Harap Alb gradually collects a band of followers. The first among them is Gerilă (from ger, [...] "frost", and the diminutive suffix -ilă), a man who shivers in summer, and whose cold breath, reaching the fury of a strong wind, can turn things into ice. Confronted with astonishment and some irony by the prince, Gerilă answers: [...] "Laugh if you will, Harap Alb, but you'll not be able to accomplish anything without me where you're going." [...] The reply prompts its recipient to change his mind, and creates a bond between the two characters. They are joined by Flămânzilă (from flămând, [...] "hungry"; translated as [...] "Eat-All"), who can consume huge amounts without satisfying his appetite. Next comes Setilă (from sete, [...] "thirst"; also [...] "Drink-All"), Flămânzilă's counterpart among drinkers. These in turn are followed by Ochilă (from ochi, [...] "eye"), whose sight covers immense distances, and Păsări-Lăți-Lungilă (from pasăre, [...] "bird", a se lăți, [...] "to widen oneself" [...] and a se lungi, [...] "to lengthen oneself"), who can will himself to grow in any direction and reach heights only accessible to birds. They all persuade Harap Alb to discard his reticence by issuing forecasts closely resembling Gerilă's reply. The <b>first</b> <b>effect</b> of this reunion is however disastrous: the respective traits of the characters result in burning down entire forests, depleting the soil, draining the water, exposing all secrets and exterminating birds, with Harap Alb himself being the only one who [...] "did not cause any disruption." ...|$|E
