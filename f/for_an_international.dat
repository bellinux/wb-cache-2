5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, the need <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> consensus on risk assignment {{has also been}} recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies.

This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also {{commonly referred to as}} MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} 19th century stadia called Hampden Park, built on {{different}} sites. A stadium {{on the present}} site was first opened on 31 October 1903.
