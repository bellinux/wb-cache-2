30|$|The prints {{analyzed}} {{in this study}} can be split into two subsets: those that use natural orpiment as a yellow pigment (Set A) and those that use artificial arsenic sulfide (Set B). The prints with brighter green and yellow tones in Set A used natural orpiment in the yellow and green areas of the print. The yellow pigment found in these prints exhibited the characteristic Raman spectrum of orpiment (Fig.  1), and SEM images showed flat plate-like particles between 1 and 30  μm in size, also typical of natural orpiment. In contrast, the prints with relatively duller yellow and green tones in Set B were found to use artificial arsenic sulfide, {{as indicated by the}} homogeneous 1 – 3  μm diameter spherical pigment particles, the broader Raman peaks, and the excess in sulfur detected by SEM–EDS. The Raman and SEM–EDS data of the artificial arsenic sulfide identified in the prints agrees well with previous reports of dry-process artificial orpiment [1, 2, 8, 18]. A notable exception to the distinctive use of natural orpiment in Set A and artificial arsenic sulfide in Set B was print JP 1082 (Set B). In this print, in addition to artificial arsenic sulfide in the yellow and green areas, we found natural orpiment, limited to the orange areas of the print and mixed with <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>red</b> (as identified by XRF and Raman). Thus, natural orpiment was mixed with a red pigment with the intent of obtaining a bright orange tone.

40|$|Traditionally, {{treatments}} of the Inca Empire {{have sought to}} document its deep economic and political impact on local populations in the Andes. There has been less study of how subject groups might have independently negotiated opportunistic economic responses to the Inca Empire. This research explores this issue through {{the investigation of the}} relationship between the Inca Road and a recently discovered, non-Inca system of mining camps, isolated deep in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile. Study of the development of these camps, and of their relationship with the Road aimed at addressing whether the Atacama Inca Road, served as a linear exchange nexus, or only as a highway servicing Inca imperial needs. To address this objective, I conducted a one-year project of survey, surface collection, and excavation to investigate: (1) the social organization and chaîne opératoire of turquoise and malachite beads, and red pigment production at the Cachiyuyo de Llampos Mountain camps; and (2) the nature of settlement and associated artifact assemblages along a nearby section of the Inca Road. In contrast to Inca state-ruled mining sites from the Inca epoch, these Chilean camps lacked Inca architecture and production patterns, presenting instead a pattern of artisan household mining and craft production of copper ore beads, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>red</b> pigment, and the crafting of items with distantly acquired raw materials. This craft production predated the Inca, and was not greatly altered following Inca conquest. However, occupation and production did intensify following Inca conquest, as the Road became a logistical resource for the camps, facilitating provisioning and exchange. Local miners and artisans worked full time in the desert, far from agricultural areas; the Inca Road became their main connection for the acquisition and movement of goods, independent of the Inca Empire’s imperial purposes. The data generated on domestic and craft activities, and on local and long distance exchange, contributes to our understanding of the use of the Inca Road and to how populations respond to imperial infrastructure. ...|$|E
40|$|Materials {{chemistry}} basically {{deals with}} rational {{design and synthesis}} of new solids exhibiting various functional properties. A sound knowledge of crystal structures and chemical bonding is needed to understand the properties of materials. Space group, cell parameters and atomic positions provide a basic crystallographic description of the structure. Crystal structure could be described in a detailed way in terms of close packing of anions and occupancy of cations in different coordination sites. The coordination polyhedra and their interconnectivity bring out the interrelationships between different structures and the properties exhibited. Transition metals (TMs) are d-block elements which occupy groups 3 - 12 in Periodic Table. IUPAC defines a TM as ‘an element whose atoms have partially filled d-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d-shell’. The partially filled d-shell in TMs {{plays an important role}} in various chemical and physical properties of TMs. Although TM cations can form compounds with different anions, most of the TM containing compounds are metal oxides due to the large free energies for formation of oxides. Binary TM oxides adopt different kinds of structures among which rock salt (e. g. NiO), rutile (e. g. TiO 2), and corundum (e. g. Cr 2 O 3) are most common. Ternary TM oxides are also known to form in variety of structures with the perovskite (e. g. BaTiO 3), and the spinel (e. g. MgFe 2 O 4) structures being well known. TM oxides exhibit a broad range of electronic and magnetic properties. TM oxides, at one end, display metallic behavior (e. g. ReO 3, RuO 2, LaNiO 3) due to the delocalized electrons and at other end, show insulating behavior (e. g. NiO) due to the localized electrons. In between, TM oxides have semiconducting properties involving either the hopping of carriers (e. g. partially reduced TiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, WO 3 and so on) or the electron excitation from the valence band to the conduction band (e. g. SnO 2). TM oxides are known to have diverse magnetic properties: diamagnetic (e. g. TiO 2, ZrO 2), paramagnetic (e. g. VO 2, NbO 2), ferromagnetic (e. g. CrO 2, La 0. 67 Ca 0. 33 MnO 3), ferrimagnetic (e. g. Fe 3 O 4, MnFe 2 O 4) and antiferromagnetic (e. g. NiO, LaCrO 3). TM oxides with partially filled 3 d-shell are expected to be ‘metallic’ according to Bloch-Wilson theory, but in practice they are Mott insulators (localized 3 d electrons) because of correlation energy (U) involved in the transfer of d-electrons between adjacent sites. Certain TM oxides also show insulator-metal (I-M) transitions induced by change of temperature, pressure or composition. For example, VO 2 and Ba 2 IrO 4 are known for their temperature and pressure induced I-M transitions, respectively. La 1 -xSrxCoO 3 becomes metal at a particular Sr concentration being one of the examples for composition-dependent I-M transition. TM oxides are usually synthesized by conventional ceramic method in which stoichiometric mixture of starting materials is reacted at elevated temperatures. Multiple prolonged heating with intermittent grindings in ceramic method generally results in thermodynamically controlled products. The metastable phases which are of interest may not be obtained by ceramic method. Chimie douce/soft chemistry methods are generally adopted to stabilize the metastable phases. The guiding principle behind the chimie douce is to have kinetic control (rather than thermodynamic control) to realize metastable phases. Accordingly, metastable derivatives are obtained by choosing appropriate precursors, or adopting sol-gel and molten flux or ion exchange/intercalation methods. The present thesis is devoted to an investigation of transition metal oxides towards development of functional materials exhibiting visible light absorption/emission and lithium insertion/extraction for cathode materials in lithium ion battery. TM oxides find application as photovoltaic materials, luminescent emission materials, photocatalysts, light absorption/pigment materials and so on, based on their optical properties. Ferroelectric TM oxides with perovskite structure [Green coloured (KNbO 3) 1 -x (BaNi 1 / 2 Nb 1 / 2 O 3 -δ) x] are studied currently as photovoltaic materials which show high open circuit voltage (Voc = 3. 5 V) despite very low short circuit current (Vsc = 40 nA cm- 2). TM oxides are also known to exhibit photoluminescent emission which could be due to the doping activator ions (e. g. MnII doped Zn 2 GeO 4) or TM oxide (e. g. CaWO 4) itself being self-activator. While the green and red emissions are common for TM oxides, blue emission is rare (e. g. Ar+ irradiated SrTiO 3 is a blue emitter). Coloured TM oxides with band gap in visible region are employed as photocatalysts for solar water splitting (e. g. yellow BiVO 4, yellow Ag 3 PO 4, yellow TaON, red Fe 2 O 3) and photo-oxidation of organic pollutants (e. g. TiO 2 -xNx and CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12). The coloured TM oxides also find application as pigments from early times, for example, Egyptian blue (CaCuSi 4 O 10), Han blue (BaCuSi 4 O 10), Han purple (BaCuSi 2 O 6), Malachite green (Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2), Ochre red (Fe 2 O 3) and many others. A list of pigments based on TM oxides is given in Table 1. Pigment materials are applied as colouring materials in inks, dyes, paints, plastics, ceramics glazers, enamels and textiles. Table 1.

Though d-d transitions are parity forbidden, the selection rules get relaxed due to different reasons such as symmetry reduction (due to distortion) and vibronic couplings. The colour of the TM oxides is influenced mainly by two factors (i) oxidation state of TM ion present and (ii) ligand field around the TM ion produced by anion geometry. In order to develop new pigment oxides, our strategy was to choose colourless metal oxides having unusual (five coordinated geometry) or irregular/distorted (distorted octahedral/tetrahedral) coordination geometries around metal ion and produce coloured oxides by substituting 3 d-TM ions at the metal ion site. We made a detailed study on the origin of the colour and pigment quality of the resulting coloured oxides. In the present thesis, which has two parts, the first part (Part 1) discusses the development of 3 d-TM ion substituted coloured oxides with potential for pigment applications. Chapter 1. 1 describes the purple inorganic pigment, YGa 1 -xMnxO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 10), based on the hexagonal YGaO 3. The metastable series of oxides were prepared by a sol-gel technique where the dried gels, obtained from aqueous solutions of metal nitrates-citric acid mixtures, were calcined for a short duration in preheated furnace around 850 °C/ 10 mins. The purple colour of the oxides arises from the specific trigonal bipyramidal ligand field around MnIII that obtains in the YGaO 3 host. Other hexagonal RGaO 3 hosts for R = Lu, Tm and Ho substituted with MnIII also produce similar purple coloured materials. In Chapter 1. 2, we present a study on substitution of 3 d-TM ions in LiMgBO 3 host [where Mg(II) has a trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) oxygen coordination) ]. We find that single-phase materials are formed for LiMg 1 -xCo(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 1. 0), LiMg 1 -xNi(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1), LiMg 1 -xCu(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1) and also Li 1 -xMg 1 -xFe(III) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1) of which the Co(II) and Ni(II) derivatives are strongly coloured, purple-blue and beige-red respectively, thus identifying TBP CoO 5 and NiO 5 as the new chromophores for these colours. Chapter 1. 3 describes the synthesis, crystal structures and optical absorption spectra/colours of 3 d-TM substituted α-LiZnBO 3 derivatives: α-LiZn 1 -xMIIxBO 3 [MII = CoII (0 < x < 0. 50), NiII (0 < x ≤ 0. 05) and CuII (0 < x 0. 10) ] and α-Li 1 +xZn 1 - 2 xMIIIxBO 3 [MIII = MnIII (0 < x ≤ 0. 10) and FeIII (0 < x 0. 25) ]. The crystal structure of the host α-LiZnBO 3, which is both disordered and distorted with respect to Li and Zn occupancies and coordination geometries, is largely retained in the derivatives, giving rise to unique colours [blue for CoII, magenta for NiII and violet for CuII], that could be of significance for the development of new, inexpensive and environmentally-benevolent pigment materials, especially for the blue colour. Accordingly, the work indentifies distorted tetrahedral MO 4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu) (together with a long M-O bond that gives a trigonal bipyramidal geometry) structural units as the new chromophores for the blue, magenta and violet colours respectively, in the α-LiZnBO 3 host. In Chapter 1. 4, we describe the synthesis, crystal structures and optical absorption spectra of 3 d-TM substituted spiroffite derivatives, Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu; 0 < x ≤ 1. 0). The oxides are readily synthesized by solid state reaction of stoichiometric mixtures of the constituent binaries at 620 °C/ 12 h. Rietveld refinement of the crystal structures from powder XRD data shows that the Zn/MO 6 octahedra are strongly distorted, as in the parent Zn 2 Te 3 O 8 structure, consisting of five relatively short Zn/MII – O bonds (1. 898 – 2. 236 Å) and one longer Zn/MII– O bond (2. 356 – 2. 519 Å). We have interpreted the unique colors and the optical absorption/diffuse reflectance spectra of Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 in the visible, in terms of the observed/irregular coordination geometry of the Zn/MII – O chromophores. We could not however prepare the fully-substituted M 2 Te 3 O 8 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu) by the direct solid state reaction method. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling of the electronic structure of both the parent and the transition metal substituted derivatives provides new insights into the bonding and the role of transition metals toward the origin of color in these materials. We believe that transition metal substituted spiroffites Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 reported here suggest new directions for the development of colored inorganic materials/pigments featuring irregular/distorted oxygen coordination polyhedra around transition metal ions. Red coloured materials are rare in nature. Li 2 MnO 3 is a unique oxide with an unusual red colour imparted by MnIV ions. Chapter 1. 5 describes a detailed experimental investigation of Li 2 MnO 3 together with other related MnIV oxides that probes the red colour of Li 2 MnO 3 as well as its photoluminescence. Optical absorption spectra reveal a strong band gap absorption with a sharp edge at ~ 610 nm and a transparent region between ~ 610 and ~ 650 nm that causes the red colour of Li 2 MnO 3 samples. Octahedral MnIV ligand field transitions, corresponding to both MnIV at ideal sites and MnIV displaced to Li sites in the rock salt based layered structure of Li 2 MnO 3, are observed in the excitation spectra of Li 2 MnO 3 samples. Optical excitation at the ligand field transition energies produces tunable emission in the red-yellow-green region, rendering Li 2 MnO 3 a unique MnIV oxide. The honeycomb ordered [LiMn 6] units in the structure likely causes both the absorption and photoluminescence properties of Li 2 MnO 3. Lithium containing TM oxides with rock salt related structure are being investigated extensively for application as next generation cathode materials for Lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Recent research is focused on lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) which are solid solutions between Li 2 MO 3 (where M = Ti, Mn and Ru) and LiMO 2 (where M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). LLOs have excess lithium in the TM layer in addition to lithium in lithium layer of rock salt derived structure. LLOs have gained attention because of their higher discharge capacity in the range of ~ 250 mAhg- 1. While most of the LLOs investigated so far contain 3 d-TM ions (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), recently there has been an interest in the study of the role of ruthenium in addition to 3 d-TM ions. We have investigated ruthenium containing LLOs with a view to probe (i) the role of ruthenium and (ii) the concentration of excess lithium in the TM layers in producing higher discharge capacities. The results are discussed in the Part 2 of the thesis. Li 5 NiMnRuO 8 (Li[Li 0. 25 Ni 0. 25 Mn 0. 25 Ru 0. 25]O 2) form in the Li 2 RuO 3 crystal structure. Electrochemical studies indicate that the Co-containing oxides exhibit a higher initial discharge capacity (for e. g. ~ 180 mAhg- 1 for Li 4 CoRuO 6) as well as a higher reversible discharge capacity (~ 130 mAhg- 1 for Li 4 CoRuO 6) compared to the corresponding Ni-analogs. Participation of oxide ions (higher oxidation state of Ru) in the redox process could explain the higher discharge capacity during the first cycle. Reduced capacity (capacity fade) during the subsequent cycles could arise from the oxygen evolution due to the redox process (2 O 2 - → 2 O- → O 2), which is not reversible. The present work shows that ruthenium incorporation in rock salt layered oxides along with Co/Ni appears to give a beneficial effect in producing a higher discharge capacity. In addition, the compounds crystallizing with the R- 3 m structure (related to LiCoO 2) appear to give a better reversible capacity than the compounds crystallizing in the C 2 /c structures (Li 2 TiO 3 and Li 2 RuO 3) ...|$|E

The surface area of the material was enhanced upon reaction. In addition, reactivity comparisons between goethite and red mud were carried out to study the formation of carbon oxides during reaction...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the illuminations attributed to various artists, several trompe l’oeil borders with shell gold backgrounds were also analyzed (ff. 119 r, 155 r, 156 r, and 191 r). Examination in transmitted light revealed the reflective and solid-looking gold backgrounds to be surprisingly translucent. Additionally, pigment(s) added to or applied with and on the shell gold are visible as a base tone in the transmitted light images of the borders on f. 108 v, where the miniature is by Simon Marmion, and on f. 13 r in the calendar roundel by the Master of the Dresden Prayerbook (Figs.  1 d, 3 d). In general, red lead was the primary pigment found mixed with the shell gold (Fig.  16), but combinations of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> and <b>red</b> lead were also used to modulate the value and warmth of the gold tone.|$|R
2500|$|Most of the basal {{part of the}} Mesozoic {{sequence}} {{consists of}} the more than [...] thick, soft, bright-red, and Triassic-aged rocks known as the Chugwater Formation. The distribution of Mud cracks, fossilized reptiles and amphibians suggest deposition in a tidal flat environment with a sea several kilometers southwest of Jackson Hole. Evaporite deposits of a few beds of white gypsum (calcium sulfate) were likely formed after shallow bodies of salt water were cut off from the sea. A small amount of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> creates the <b>red</b> color and the formation erodes into colorful hills east and south of the park.|$|R
30|$|Bauer’s {{painting}} style changed markedly {{during and}} after his expedition to Australia with Matthew Flinders (1801 – 1806), and he favoured a more delicate watercolour style in transparent watercolour [1, 6, 38]. After 1800, Bauer largely abandoned the opaque painting technique he had used for the Flora Graeca paintings. Having more time to paint these at his leisure in Australia and after he returned to England in 1806, {{it is likely that}} he was able to spend more time on the more technically complex transparent watercolour technique. To do so also required a change to his pigment palette. Opaque pigments used in the Flora Graeca paintings such as lead white, red lead and vermillion were perhaps more suited to the bodycolour painting traditionally used in both manuscript illumination and portrait miniature painting [22, 26, 38]. XRF analysis carried out at the Natural History Museum in 2016 revealed that, at least in the small sample of paintings analysed, lead, copper and mercury were absent from Bauer’s palette during these years. Pigments in the later paintings contained iron, aluminium, sulphur, potassium and barium, suggesting that he abandoned the use of the opaque copper greens and blues, vermillion, red lead and lead white used throughout the Flora Graeca in favour of more transparent laked pigments. As noted above, ultramarine, indigo and an unknown, transparent blue were found in several instances, but no red pigment used in these paintings produced a Raman spectrum. Furthermore, levels of iron in these pigments were only slightly higher than the paper background, largely ruling out the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>reds,</b> and suggesting Bauer's preference for organic red lakes at this time.|$|R
30|$|Esters, ketones and ether esters are {{suitable}} solvents for clear and pigmented PU coating systems. Traditional extenders, such as barytes, calcium carbonate, talc, kaolin, mica, and silica {{may be used}} in one- and two-component systems. Among the conventional inorganic pigments, titanium dioxide, titanium yellow, various <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> cadmium <b>reds</b> and yellows, some carbon blacks and chrome oxide green {{are suitable}} for most of the 2 K PU systems. Organic pigments frequently found in the PU paint formulations, include quinocridone and perylene reds, monoazo and isoindoline yellows, and phthalocyanine blues and greens. The use of organic pigments from other classes may involve undesirable effects on the curing process of PU paint films [10]. Commercial PU coatings contain various additives, such as catalysts, flattening, leveling, thickening and anti-foaming agents. The presence of catalysts offers advantageous rates of polyurethanes reaction at lower temperatures. Those used in PU industry essentially consist on tertiary amines and tin complexes compounds [9].|$|R
40|$|New geopolymer {{formulations}} {{were designed}} by sodium silicate/NaOH activation of metakaolin, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> and <b>red</b> mud mixtures. The effects of source materials on the microstructure and mechanical properties were studied. Each formulation induces different degree of geopolymerization reaction as reflected by the phase composition where the amorphous phase is predominant. These vestiges are related to silica provided by sodium silicate more reactive in the geopolymerization than the silica of metakaolin. Moreover, the variation in strength between the geopolymers is attributed to the same factors, with higher porosity and nonreacted phases found in the red mud based geopolymer matrix. In function of curing time, the mechanical strength increased from day 1 to 28 for the samples with a low amount of red mud. In these two cases, longer curing time improves the geopolymerization state resulting in higher compressive load. The metakaolin and metakaolin/red mud products exhibited comparable water absorption and density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|Raw lacquer can be [...] "coloured" [...] by the {{addition}} of small amounts of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> giving <b>red</b> or black depending on the oxide. There is some evidence that its use is even older than 8,000 years from archaeological digs in China. Later, pigments were added to make colours. It is used not only as a finish, but mixed with ground fired and unfired clays applied to a mould with layers of hemp cloth, it can produce objects without need for another core like wood. The process is called [...] "kanshitsu" [...] in Japan. Advanced decorative techniques using additional materials such as gold and silver powders and flakes ("makie") were refined to very high standards in Japan also after having been introduced from China. In the lacquering of the Chinese musical instrument, the guqin, the lacquer is mixed with deer horn powder (or ceramic powder) to give it more strength so it can stand up to the fingering.|$|R
25|$|Characteristically vessels were elaborately {{decorated}} with swirling patterns and intricate designs. Sometimes decorative incisions were added prior to firing, and sometimes these {{were filled with}} coloured dye to produce a dimensional effect. In the early period, the colours used to decorate pottery were limited to a rusty-red and white. Later, potters added additional colours to their products and experimented with more advanced ceramic techniques. The pigments used to decorate ceramics were based on <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> for <b>red</b> hues, calcium carbonate, iron magnetite and manganese Jacobsite ores for black and calcium silicate for white. The black pigment, which was introduced during the later period of the culture, was a rare commodity: taken from a few sources and circulated (to a limited degree) throughout the region. The probable sources of these pigments were Iacobeni in Romania for the iron magnetite ore and Nikopol in Ukraine for the manganese Jacobsite ore. No traces of the iron magnetite pigment mined in the easternmost limit of the Cucuteni-Trypillia region {{have been found to}} be used in ceramics from the western settlements, suggesting exchange throughout the entire cultural area was limited. In addition to mineral sources, pigments derived from organic materials (including bone and wood) were used to create various colours.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic {{colorants}} {{are added}} to a glaze or a clay to create color. Carbonates and oxides of certain metals, characterize most colorants including the commonly used cobalt carbonate, cobalt <b>oxide,</b> chrome <b>oxide,</b> <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> and copper carbonate. These colorants can create a multitude of colors depending on other materials they interact with and to which temperature and in which atmosphere they are fired.|$|R
30|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{the main}} {{component}} of the red pigment used for the background drapery. It is evidenced by elevated Fe counts on spots within the contours of drapery (Fig.  7 c). Generally, XRF analysis permits the distinction between pure <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (hematite) and <b>red</b> ochre by the detection of Si, Al, Ti and Mn lines in XRF spectra of the latter. However, {{in the case of the}} hidden painting, the detection of low-Z elements was not possible because of the attenuation of the signal by the upper painting and the varnish layer(s). As for Mn, its omnipresence in XRF spectra is likely due to the upper painting, which appears dark brown in the majority of the analysed spots. These limitations of XRF elemental analysis allow the identification of only general types of red pigments based on <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> in the case of hidden paintings, whereas a more precise assignment as hematite or red ochre would be possible on the analysis of painting cross-sections. Depending on the analysed spot, the XRF spectra from the drapery spots are featured by low intensity Hg and As lines, suggesting admixtures of vermilion and orpiment, respectively. The identification of orpiment is also supported by the detection of shiny yellow crystals on the highlighted drapery folds by digital microscopy. Along with orpiment, lead white was likely used for the highlighted drapery folds and the light shade of the diagonal line visible to the right from man’s figure.|$|R
