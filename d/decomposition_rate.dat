25|$|Gunpowder is {{classified}} as a low explosive because of its relatively slow <b>decomposition</b> <b>rate</b> and consequently low brisance. Low explosives deflagrate (i.e., burn) at subsonic speeds, whereas high explosives detonate, producing a supersonic wave. Ignition of powder packed behind a bullet must generate enough pressure to force it from the muzzle at high speed, {{but not enough to}} rupture the gun barrel. Gunpowder thus makes a good propellant, but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications. Gunpowder was widely used to fill artillery shells and in mining and civil engineering to blast rock until {{the second half of the}} 19th century, when the first high explosives were put into use. Gunpowder is no longer used in modern weapons nor is it used for industrial purposes due to its relatively inefficient cost compared to newer alternatives such as dynamite and ammonium nitrate/fuel oil. Today gunpowder firearms are limited primarily to hunting, target shooting, and bulletless historical reenactments.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{environmental}} {{controls on}} {{soil organic matter}} decomposition is of importance for developing models that predict the effects of environmental change on global soil carbon stocks. There is uncertainty about the environmental controls on <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> at temperature and moisture extremes, particularly at high water content levels and high temperatures. It is uncertain whether observed declines in <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> at high temperatures are due to declines in the heat capacity of extracellular enzymes as predicted by thermodynamic theory, or due to simultaneous declines in soil moisture.

We found support for the hypothesis that <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> are high at high temperatures, provided that enough moisture and oxygen are available for decomposition.

Recent theoretical work suggests that macrodetritivores increase the resistance of African savanna ecosystems to changing climatic conditions, but experimental evidence is lacking. We examined the effect of large fungus-growing termites and other non-fungus-growing macrodetritivores on <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> empirically with strong spatiotemporal variability in rainfall and temperature. Non-fungus-growing larger macrodetritivores (earthworms, woodlice, millipedes) promoted <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> relative to microbes and small soil fauna (+ 34 %) but both groups reduced their activities with decreasing rainfall. However, fungus-growing termites increased <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> strongest (+ 123 %) under the most water-limited conditions, making overall <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> mostly independent from rainfall. We conclude that fungus-growing termites are of special importance in decoupling <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> from spatiotemporal variability in rainfall due to the buffered environment they create within their extended phenotype (mounds), that allows decomposition to continue when abiotic conditions outside are less favorable.

2500|$|This {{high rate}} of {{decomposition}} {{is the result of}} phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities. In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other decomposers such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above ground biomass and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon. The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the decomposition process the microbial community is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The <b>decomposition</b> <b>rate</b> can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen. High temperatures and precipitation increase <b>decomposition</b> <b>rate,</b> which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants [...] through surface or ground waters. [...] The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.|$|E

40|$|Altered surface ultraviolet-B (UV-B) {{radiation}} {{resulting from}} a combination of factors that include changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations, cloud cover, and aerosol conditions may affect litter decomposition and, thus, terrestrial nutrient cycling on a global scale. Although litter <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> vary across biomes, patterns of decomposition suggest that UV-B radiation accelerates litter decay in xeric environments where precipitation is infrequent. However, under more frequent precipitation regimes where litter decay rates are characteristically high, the effect of UV-B radiation on litter decomposition has not been fully elucidated. To evaluate this association between moisture regime and UV-B exposure, a litter decomposition experiment was designed for aspen (Populus tremuloides) leaf litter, where conditions that influence both abiotic (photodegradation) and biotic (microbial) processes could be manipulated quantitatively. We found that experimentally increasing UV-B exposure (0, 7. 4, and 11. 2 kJ m- 2 d- 1, respectively) did not consistently increase litter <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> across simulated precipitation frequencies of 4 -, 12 -, and 24 -days. Instead, a UV-B exposure of 11. 2 kJ m- 2 d- 1 resulted in a 13 % decrease in <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> under the 4 -day precipitation frequency, but an increase of 80 % under the 24 -day frequency. Furthermore, the same UV-B dose increased litter <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> under the 24 -day precipitation frequency by 78 % even in conditions where microbial activity was suppressed. Therefore, under more xeric conditions, greater exposure to UV-B radiation increased <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates,</b> presumably through photodegradation. In contrast, when decomposition was not moisture-limited, greater UV-B exposure slowed <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates,</b> most likely from the resulting inhibition of microbial activity. Ultimately, these experimental results highlight UV-B radiation as a potential driver of decomposition, as well as indicate that both the direction and magnitude of the UV-B effect is dependent on moisture availability, a factor that may change according to future patterns in global precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increased}} complexity of experimental and theoretical {{studies on the}} biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationship, a major challenge is to demonstrate whether the observed importance of biodiversity in controlled experimental systems also persists in nature. Due to their structural simplicity and their low levels of human impacts, extreme species-poor ecosystems may provide new insights into B-EF relationships in natural systems. We address this issue using shredder invertebrate communities and organic matter <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> in 24 high-altitude (3200 - 3900 m) Neotropical streams as a study model. We first assessed the effects of stream characteristics and shredder diversity and abundance on organic matter <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> in coarse-and fine-mesh bags. We found the interaction term shredder richness x shredder abundance had the most significant impact on <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> in the field, although water discharge may {{also play a role}} locally. We also examined the relative contribution of the three most abundant shredders on <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> by manipulating shredder richness and community composition in a field experiment. Transgressive overyielding was detected among the three shredder species, indicating complementary resource use and/or facilitation. By integrating survey and experimental data in surface response analyses we found that observed B-EF patterns fit those predicted by a linear model that described litter <b>decomposition</b> <b>rates</b> as a function of increasing shredder richness and the relative abundance of the most efficient shredders. Finally, the validity of our approach was tested in a broader context by using two independent but comparable data sets from 49 French and Swedish streams showing more complex shredder community structure.

We used a cotton-strip assay to evaluate cellulose decomposition potential (CDP) as loss of cotton-strip tensile strength in streams upstream and downstream of 4 mountain lakes in a lake district in the Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho. In addition, we used this assay to determine decomposition potentials along a longitudinal gradient in 1 stream–lake network. Decomposition coefficients (k) were 43 % greater in lake-outflow streams than lake-inflow streams.

Using a reciprocal transplant design, we examined how litter chemistry and soil characteristics independently and jointly influenced litter decomposition.

Across the landscape, decomposition differed more along soil moisture gradients than across fire management regimes. These findings suggest that fire frequency has a limited effect on litter decomposition in this ecosystem, and encourage extending current decomposition frameworks into disturbed systems. However, litter from different species lost different masses due to fire, suggesting that fire may impact decomposition through the preferential combustion of some litter types.
