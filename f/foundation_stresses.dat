40|$|Abstract Some {{numerical}} parameters-sensitivity {{analysis has}} been conducted to evaluate the stability and propagation of the interface cracks at heel of concrete gravity dam. In this paper, utilizing the software ANSYS to simulate the stress and displacement fields of {{the tip of the}} interface cracks between concrete gravity dam and <b>foundation,</b> the <b>stress</b> intensity factor (SIF) of the interface crack is analyzed using facture mechanics. Three impacting factors have been discussed, such as the crack length, the angle of crack, and the water height. Critical length and loads of interface crack propagation are obtained using composite fracture criteria. The results indicate that the coarse interface retards the propagation of interface crack, and redounds to stability of gravity dam. It is found that the interface crack often propagates alone the interface between dam and foundation, simultaneously the branch crack kinks to foundation at the specific condition. ...|$|R

The {{numerical}} analysis of finite element coupling infinite element is recently used to si-mulate {{the effects of}} unbounded <b>foundation</b> of <b>stresses</b> and displacements.

Calculation results show that using Goodman contact element to simulate the interaction of pile and soil {{has the advantage of}} flexibility;and the graphic formula of the calculation curves of nonlinear µ−E model and K-G model accords with that of the meas-ure curve while the elastic calculation curve is far from the measure curve;the skin friction and pile-tip resistance pressure of the corner pile is the largest, the side pile less, and the center pile the least.

40|$|The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) {{has emerged}} as a {{potentially}} disruptive force in higher education. Today there are hundreds of MOOCs available and millions of individuals around the world participating in these open and unlimited web-based courses. Much of the discourse surrounding the MOOC phenomenon questions its efficacy in replacing or supplementing traditional face-to-face formats in colleges and universities. Detractors point to such issues as low retention rates, difficulties in classroom management and dubious methods of grading and assessment. While these might be legitimate concerns, the discussion often loses sight of the more far-reaching impacts that such open environments might provide for knowledge creation and learning in more generalized populations.

40|$|The role women play in {{the media}} can be {{analyzed}} {{in terms of their}} activity – women as creators of messages, or passivity – women as the recipients of mass messages. The latter as- pect causes most controversy and frequently leads to the creation of sexual stereotypes. The range of male and female images in the mass media is highly diversified and not necessarily objective. While women tend to be increasingly present in the media, and the number of pro- grams they prepare increases, men continue to prevail in the media sector. They hold a definite majority of managerial posts and more frequently act as experts and commentators on social and political events. The Communication of the European Commission for 2006 – 2010 stresses the role of the media and information campaigns in the elimination of sexual stereo- types. In 2010, the Commission adopted a new five-year strategy to facilitate better use of fe- male potential. It should be the superior objective of a policy of gender equality in the media to broadcast balanced messages free from stereotypes. It is also significant to ensure women a greater participation in decision-making with respect to the mass media, increasing their op- portunities to utilize the media to voice their opinions and facilitating women’s professional promotion in media institutions. These objectives were already embraced in the National Pro- gram in Aid of Women’s Rights that was implemented in Poland from 2003 through 2005. In 2010, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights and the „Feminoteka” <b>Foundation</b> <b>stressed</b> the issue of women’s discrimination in the Polish mass media. Monitoring of pro- grams demonstrated that the principle of gender equality was not observed. The so-called female press is a significant element of the media market. The issues dis- cussed in this sector usually concentrate on stereotypical female roles in society. Recently, however, a clear diversification of topics handled by the press can be noted and the efforts some periodicals are making in order to break gender stereotypes. Such attempts have been made by two new periodicals addressed mainly at women: „Bluszcz” and „Zadra”. An analy- sis of the content of „Bluszcz” did not evidence the abandonment of the traditional image of women though. A perusal of „Zadra” led to completely different conclusions. This is a femi- nist periodical that mainly discusses the issues of the social and political activity of women. The paper also emphasizes the increasing participation of women in the internet and in the social media...|$|R
