50|$|The <b>kilopound</b> {{per square}} inch (ksi) is a scaled unit derived from psi, {{equivalent}} to a thousand psi (1000 lbf/in2).|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from {{combining}} the words [...] "kilo" [...] and [...] "pound"; it is occasionally called a <b>kilopound.</b> Its symbol is kip, or less frequently, klb. When {{it is necessary to}} clearly distinguish it as a unit of force rather than mass, it is sometimes called the kip-force (symbol kipf or klbf).Note that the symbol kp usually stands for a different unit of force, the kilopond or kilogram-force used primarily in Europe prior to the introduction of SI units.|$|E
50|$|Metric prefixes {{are widely}} used outside the system of metric units. Common {{examples}} include the megabyte and the decibel. Metric prefixes rarely appear with imperial or US units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, <b>kilopound</b> or 'kip'). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., megaelectronvolt, gigaparsec, millibarn). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly {{by people who are}} familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage. In geology and paleontology, the year, with symbol a (from the Latin annus), is commonly used with metric prefixes: ka, Ma, and Ga.|$|E
40|$|The Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM) will {{demonstrate}} {{the performance of}} AF-M 315 E monopropellant in orbit. Flight certification requires a safe-life analysis of the titanium alloy fuel tank to ensure inherent flaws will not cause failure during the design life. Material property inputs for this analysis require testing to determine the stress intensity factor for environmentally-assisted cracking (K (sub EAC)) of Ti 6 Al- 4 V {{in combination with the}} AF-M 315 E monopropellant. Testing of single-edge notched specimens SE(B) representing the bulk tank membrane and weld material were performed in accordance with ASTM E 1681. Specimens with fatigue pre-cracks were loaded into test fixtures so that the crack tips were exposed to the monopropellant at 50 degrees Centigrade for a duration of 1, 000 hours. Specimens that did not fail during exposure were opened to inspect the crack surfaces for evidence of crack growth. The threshold stress intensity value, KEAC, is the highest applied stress intensity that produced neither a failure of the specimen during the exposure nor showed evidence of crack growth. The threshold stress intensity factor of the Ti 6 Al- 4 V forged tank material when exposed to AF-M 315 E monopropellant was found to be at least 22. 0 <b>kilopounds</b> per square inch. The stress intensity factor of the weld material was at least 31. 3 <b>kilopounds</b> per square inch...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{units are}} based on {{customary}} units, but use power-of-ten factors and metric prefixes. For example, distance to target for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet. Telephone transmission line length and loop distances are measured in kilofeet. [...] In some fields of civil engineering (especially structural engineering), and architecture, large loads and forces (such as {{the weight of a}} building or the amount of load applied to a column) are measured in kips (<b>kilopounds</b> or 1000 pounds-force) instead of short tons-force (2000 pounds-force), which are used in virtually all other non-metric industries in the United States, as well as in common usage among the public, when dealing with large values of force.|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} changes occurring {{during exercise}} and its possible consequences have been receiving considerable attention lately. In this paper, we studied {{the changes in}} hemorheological and microcirculatory parameters, {{before and after the}} exercise, in the subjects undergoing mild exercise (n = 20). A cycle ergometer adjusted at 2. 5 <b>kilopounds</b> was used for 15 minutes. The whole blood viscosity showed a significant increase after exercise at all shear rates (0. 512 - 51. 2 /s) except at the high shear rate (94. 5 /s). However, the significant level was more (P < 0. 005) at low shear rates (0. 512 - 4. 39 /s). A significant elevation in plasma viscosity was observed after the exercise (P < 0. 0008). Red cell rigidity showed a significant increase after the exercise (P < 0. 001) while red cell aggregation and hematocrit failed to show any significant change. Microcirculatory studies showed {{a significant increase in the}} basal perfusion level after exercise (P < 0. 0002) when compared to the resting state value. There was a significant decrease in reactive hyperaemia perfusion index after exercise (P < 0. 0007). Hence, it is evident from this study that short-term exercise significantly alters hemorheological and microcirculatory parameters...|$|R
