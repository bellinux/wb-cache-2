40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that perinatal asphyxia (PA) augments adult hyperemotionality and increases corticosterone (CORT) release. Term fetuses were exposed to PA (12 min) by occluding (OCCL) the arteries feeding one uterine <b>horn.</b> <b>Control</b> subjects were derived from the opposite, non-occluded (N-OCCL) horn, and from Vaginal delivery groups. Newborn pups were fostered to newly parturient dams.

As compared to controls, OCCL adult rats showed a tendency to spend time near the wall rather than the center of the arena (thigmotaxis). Approaches to a novel object were slower in OCCL offspring relative to controls. Behavioral testing was associated with a significant increase in CORT, with greater magnitudes of response in OCCL offspring. Collectively, our findings provide clear evidence for magnified emotional responses and HPAA activity in response to novelty in adult offspring exposed to PA...|$|E

40|$|Summary. This paper reports {{studies on}} the {{incorporation}} of [U- 14 C]-glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins of the rat uterus in the presence ofan IUD after treatment with oestrogen and progesterone and on Day 5 of pregnancy {{at the time of}} implantation. The results show that there is an increase in the incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins in the IUD horn compared with that of the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> of ovariectomized and oestrogen-treated animals. The increase in weight of the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> can be interpreted as due to an increased oestrogen-like response by the uterus in the presence of an IUD. This response may be caused by oestrogens, histamines or other amines. A significant decrease in the incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins of the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> was found on treatment of the animals with oestrogen+progester-one and progesterone alone for 6 hr. Treatment of the animals for 9 days with oestrogen+progesterone also significantly depressed the rate of protein synthesis in the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> On Day 5 of pregnancy at the time of implantation, there was a statistically significant decrease in the incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins of the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> These experiments indicated an increased sensitivity of the uterus to progesterone in the presence of an IUD. The uterus shows an increased oestrogen-like response in the presence of an IUD. The increased sensitivity of the uterus to progesterone at the time of implantation produces asynchronous changes in the uterus and results in an anti-implantation effect of the IUD. The mode of action of an IUD in the light of these observations is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} glomerular {{development and}} expression of insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors in an experimental model of {{intrauterine growth restriction}} (IUGR). Material and Methods: We studied three groups of Sprague-Dawley fetuses: IUGR - restricted by ligation of the right uterine artery; C-IUGR - left <b>horn</b> <b>controls,</b> and EC - external controls (non-manipulated). Body and organs were weighed, and glomerular number and volume were analyzed. Expression of IR beta, IRS- 1, IRS- 2 and IGF-IR beta was analyzed in liver, intestine and kidneys by immunoblotting. Results: Organ/body weight ratios were similar. In IUGR, glomerular number and volume were increased compared to C-IUGR and EC (p < 0. 001). In the IUGR liver, increases were found in IGF-IR beta compared to C-IUGR and EC; IR beta compared to EC, and IRS- 2 compared to C-IUGR. However, decreases in IR beta were noted in IUGR compared to C-IUGR; IRS- 1 compared to C-IUGR and EC, and IRS- 2 compared to EC. In IUGR intestine, increases were detected in IR beta, IRS- 1 and IGF-IR beta compared to C-IUGR and EC. In IUGR kidneys, increases were observed in IR beta and IGF-IR beta compared to C-IUGR and EC, and IRS- 1 compared to EC.

40|$|Summary. Measurements ofhistamine {{in control}} and IUCD-containing uterine horns of the rat in di-oestrus and L 4 of {{pregnancy}} showed that device-containing horns had a higher concentration and content per <b>horn</b> than did <b>control</b> <b>horns</b> at both times. In <b>control</b> <b>horns,</b> the histamine content on L 4 was about one-half of the value observed in di-oestrus, while in IUCD-containing horns the histamine content on L 4 {{was the same as}} the di-oestrous value. These data are interpreted in terms of a chronic inflammatory response in the IUCD-containing horn. The contraceptive action of a foreign body in the uterus is still only partially understood, but a number of changes are known to be brought about by an IUCD. The decidual cell reaction is inhibited in the rat uterine horn con¬ taining an IUCD (Doyle & Margolis, 1964) and it has been suggested (Shel¬ esnyak, 1966; Marcus, 1964) that this inhibition may be due to a depletion of the histamine available for stimulation of the decidual response. This paper presents measurements of histamine {{in control and}} IUCD-containing uterine horns of the rat. Female rats of the Holtzmann strain were used. L 0 designates the day spermatozoa were found in the vaginal smear. IUCDs, when present, con¬ sisted of about 1 cm of 3 - 0 surgical silk suture inserted with an atraumatic needle into one horn. Uterine histamine was extracted by the method of Code & Mclntyre (1956) and assayed on the guinea-pig ileum. For each measurement on whole uterine horns, five to eight horns were transected at the utero-tubal and utero-cervicaljunctions and pooled. In addition, some measurements were made on pools of anti-mesometrial tissue, obtained by cutting eight to twelve whole horns longitudinally with scissors into approximately two halves and using only the half opposite the mesometrium. In every case, the measurements on IUCD-containing horns were compared with the measurements on the <b>control</b> <b>horns</b> from the same animals.

On G 8, ten pregnant rats meeting flight criteria (at least five implantation sites each horn) were placed into NASA flight cages (animal enclosure modules, AEMS, five rats per cage), loaded onto the mid-deck of the space shuttle Atlantis, and on G 9 (November 3, 1994) they were launched into orbit. On gestation day 20, (November 14, 1994) the shuttle returned to Edwards Air Force Base, California and the flight animals were recovered from the shuttle and subjected to unilateral hysterectomy to provide fetal material from one horn to investigators identified by NASA to study selected fetal parameters. After unilateral hysterectomy, the animals were allowed to recover and deliver vaginally. There were three groups (n = 10 each group) of control animals housed at KSC in the study. A synchronous control group, delayed 24 hours with reference to the flight group, received the same surgeries and was housed five rats per AEM and exposed to all flight conditions (identical temperatures, lighting and humidity) except microgravity.

40|$|Summary. In mice of four genetically {{different}} strains, a silk suture {{was placed}} {{in one of the}} uterine horns while the remaining horn was left untreated. When the females were mated, no evidence of implanta-tion was found in the threaded horn. In the contralateral horn, implanta-tion occurred in only about 50 % of the mice and embryonic mortality was increased. In some females the uterine horns were scratched 3 days after sterile mating to evoke a decidual reaction. Deciduomata were inhibited completely in the threaded horn, and partially in the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> The four strains differed both in the proportion of females with im-plantations in the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> and in the degree of decidual growth inhibition. The effects of an IUD on implantation and on decidual reac-tion were correlated. When an IUD was removed after plug formation, but before the blastocysts entered the uterus, implantation occurred in both horns in about 40 % of the females. These results suggest that an IUD in mice may exert its effect on fertility by impairing the uterine sensitivity to mechanical stimuli at the time of implantation and that the extent of this action is genetically determined...|$|R

40|$|During this {{research}} period, September 16, 1990 to March 15, 1991, a design method for selecting a low-loss impedance material coating for a <b>horn</b> antenna pattern <b>control</b> has been developed.

For moment method solutions of the electric and magnetic current distributions on the radiating aperture and the outer surface of the horn antenna, triangular surface-patch modes are introduced to replace the sinusoidal surface-patch modes as expansion and testing functions to provide a more physical expansion of the current distributions. In the synthesis problem, a numerical optimization process is formulated to minimize the error function between the desired waveguide modes and the modes provided by the horn transition with impedance surfaces. Since the modes generated by the horn transition with impedance surface are computed by analytical techniques, the computational error involved in the synthesis of the antenna pattern is minimum.

40|$|Summary. In rats {{provided}} with a surgically created anastomosis be-tween the two uterine horns and subsequently mated, implantation occurs with great regularity. Implantation sites were seen in twenty-six out of the thirty-two rats examined at laparotomy on Day 10 of pregnancy. In rats with such an anastomosis and unilaterally ovariectomized, implantation occurred in both uterine horns. There was evidence of implantation in nine out of twelve rats in the left uterine horn, even though the left ovary had been removed, indicating that the anastomosis was patent. Out of fifteen successfully mated rats with {{a connection between the}} two uterine horns and a silk suture in the lumen of the left uterine horn, only one rat showed evidence of implantation in the left uterine horn on Day 10 of pregnancy. There were no signs of implantation sites in the right horn in any animal in this series. The results demonstrated inhibition of implantation in the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> when an intra-uterine device was placed in the experimental horn in rats with an anastomosis between the two horns.
