When a Detective card is drawn, a Detective pawn, which is waiting outside of the mansion, moves one space closer to the mansion.

40|$|In Trypanosoma brucei {{only two}} {{promoters}} for protein-encoding genes have been characterized so far.

Internal promoters usually located at their 5 ' <b>end</b> <b>drive</b> transcription {{of several of the}} latter elements. During a search for promoter activity within RIME and Ingi we focused on a region at the 5 ' end of both elements, which we termed rime 5. A 50 kDa nuclear protein was found to specifically bind to the double strand and single strand sense of rime 5 DNA. However, constructs containing several rime 5 fragments inserted upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene failed to promote both transcription and expression of this gene in transient transfection assays. Finally, we have analyzed the expression of the Ingi elements and despite the high level of transcripts detectable in the cytoplasm, antibodies raised against two different domains of the single open reading frame did not detect any component in total extracts from T. brucei, suggesting that few Ingi copies, if any, are actually active.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to “rectify the weld cracks by the fabrication of customized jig plates”. In the engine section of the industry, there were frequent rejections of the catalytic converters due to weld cracks. When the catalytic converter assembly line was inspected, tiny cracks in the weld were found visually. Then they were tested through bench magnifiers and dye penetration test for confirmation and it was confirmed to have cracks in the weld. The crack was found in the casting to shell joint of the catalytic converter. Then the casting was tested for its contaminants which could also cause cracks in the weld. The DED (double <b>end</b> <b>drive)</b> welding jig plate setup was also checked thoroughly for any defects. In order to check whether the type of welding used gives better penetration and strength, weld penetration test was done. Finally, after several inspections of the welding process it was found that the crack was due to the biasing of the axis of jig plates. Then, finally the biasing was avoided by fabricating a new jig plate. Thus the entire defect is drastically reduced by minimizing the cracks and thus maintaining the efficiency of the engine...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedBreather solitons in a one-dimensional lattice of coupled nonlinear oscillators are numerically investigated. These are localized nonpropagating steady states that exist at frequencies either below the linear cutoff frequency (corresponding to the extended mode {{in which all}} the oscillators are in-phase) or above the upper linear cutoff frequency (corresponding to the extended mode in which each oscillator is 180 ° out-of-phase with its immediate neighbors). The lattice is damped and parametrically driven. A nonlinear Schrodinger theory, which assumes a modulational amplitude that is weakly nonlinear and slowly varying in space, is compared to the numerical data. The error is roughly 5 % at low amplitudes and 20 % at high amplitudes. The regions in the drive parameter plane (amplitude vs frequency) where the breathers exist are numerically determined and compared to theory. A substantial discrepancy occurs at lower drive amplitudes where the theory predicts that the lower cutoff breather should exist, but where an instability is observed. Also in contrast to the theory, the region of the upper cutoff breather has relatively large areas in which quasiperiodicity occurs or the motion decays to rest. Quasiperiodicity is also observed in the lower cutoff breather. Finally, instead of a global parametric drive, an <b>end</b> <b>drive</b> is investigated. It is found that, for drive frequencies outside the linear propagation band, there is an amplitude threshold for the periodic ejection or "shedding" of propagating breather solitons. The quasiperiodicity that occurs for a global parametric drive may be a consequence of soliton shedding. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
