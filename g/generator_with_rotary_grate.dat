40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique flywheel-based regenerative energy recovery, storage and release system {{developed at the}} author's laboratory. It can recover and store regenerative energy produced by braking a motion <b>generator</b> <b>with</b> intermittent <b>rotary</b> velocity such as the rotor of a wind turbogenerator subject to intermittent intake wind and the axels of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles during frequent coasting and braking. Releasing of the stored regenerative energy in the flywheel is converted to electricity by the attached alternator. A proof-of-concept prototype called the SJSU-RBS was designed, built and tested by author's students with able assistance of a technical staff in his school.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{incidence}} of apical root cracks and dentinal detachments after canal preparation <b>with</b> hand and <b>rotary</b> files at different instrumentation lengths. Methods Two hundred forty mandibular incisors were mounted in resin blocks with simulated periodontal ligaments, and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> and hand files, namely K 3, ProTaper, and nickel-titanium Flex K files to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, or beyond AF. Digital images of the apical surface of every tooth were taken during the apical enlargement at each file change. Development of dentinal defects was determined by comparing these images with the baseline image. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results Apical crack developed in 1 of 80 teeth (1. 3 %) with hand files and 31 of 160 teeth (19. 4 %) <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files. Apical dentinal detachment developed in 2 of 80 teeth (2. 5 %) with hand files and 35 of 160 teeth (21. 9 %) <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files. Instrumentation <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files terminated 2 mm short of AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks and detachments occurred when instrumentation <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files was terminated short of AF, as compared with that terminated at or beyond AF (P <. 05). The AF deviated from the anatomic apex in 128 of 240 teeth (53 %). Significantly more apical dentinal detachments appeared in teeth with a deviated AF (P =. 033). Conclusions Rotary instruments caused more dentinal defects than hand instruments; instrumentation short of AF reduced the risk of dentinal defects...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{burning of}} the medical waste is {{becoming}} attr active in China because Chinese government has banned landfilling of medical waste. Many advantages {{can be found in}} this method, such as reduction in waste vol-ume, destruction of pathogens and transformation of waste into the form of ash. However, the medical waste with high moisture in China is not suitable to be trea ted in the present direct mass burning incinerators. In this paper, a novel integral incinera tor is developed with combining a f eeder, a <b>rotary</b> <b>grate,</b> a primary com-bustion chamber (PCC) and a “coaxial” secondary combustion chamber (SCC) into a unique unit. Its capa-bility is 10 ton/day. As the air excess level in the PCC was only 40 % stoichiometric ratio, the PCC acted as a gasifier. The 1. 0 excess air ratios in the SCC preserved the purpose of full combustion of flue gas. Tempera-ture and pollutants concentration in the SCC were m easured to understand the combustion behavior of vola-tile organics. Emission concentrations of pollutants before stack were also tested and compared with the China National Incineration Emission Standard. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of three methods in removal of Resilon/new Epiphany self-etch (SE) soft resin endodontic obturation system. Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted single rooted human teeth were prepared for endodontic treatment and obturated with Resilon/Epiphany SE. The roots were randomly divided into three groups; group 1 roots were retreated using Mtwo R/Mtwo files; group 2 were retreated using Mtwo R/Mtwo accompanied with chloroform; and group 3 were retreated using Mtwo R/Mtwo accompanied with Endosolv R. The cleanliness of canal walls was determined using scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and LSD tests. Results: Endosolv R combined <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files was more efficient in material removal compared to chloroform combined <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files and rotary files alone (P 0. 05). Conclusion: All techniques left filling material remnants and debris on the root canal walls.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the dentinal cracks after root canal preparation <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files: Gates Glidden, ProTaper Universal, ProTaper Next, and HyFlex CM at different instrumentation lengths. Methodology. Sixty-five mandibular premolars were mounted in the acrylic tube with simulated periodontal ligaments and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented <b>with</b> different <b>rotary</b> files, namely, ProTaper Universal, ProTaper Next, and HyFlex CM, to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, and beyond AF. The root apex was stained with 1 % methylene blue dye and digital images of apical surface of every tooth were taken and development of dentinal defects was determined by using stereomicroscope. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results. Instrumentation <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files terminated 2 [*]mm short AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks were seen when instrumentation <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> files terminated 1 [*]mm short apical foramen when compared with the instrumentation terminated at or beyond apical foramen (p< 0. 05).
