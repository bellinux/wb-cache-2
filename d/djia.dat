2500|$|Similarly, {{there was}} a panic in the {{financial}} world during the year of 1997; the Asian Financial Crisis. Like the fall of many foreign markets, the Dow suffered a 7.18% drop in value (554.26 points) on October 27, 1997, in what later {{became known as the}} 1997 Mini-Crash but from which the <b>DJIA</b> recovered quickly.

2500|$|The {{major event}} {{of the year for}} the United States was the stock market crash on Wall Street, which was to have {{international}} effects.

Then, from October 24October 29, stock prices suffered three multi-digit percentage drops, wiping out more than $30 billion from the New York Stock Exchange (10 times greater than the annual budget of the federal government). On December 3 U.S. President Herbert Hoover announced to the U.S. Congress that the worst effects of the recent stock market crash were behind the nation, and that the American people had regained faith in the economy.|$|E
2500|$|From 2000 to 2001, the Federal Reserve, {{in a move}} {{to protect}} the economy from the overvalued stock market, made {{successive}} interest rate increases; while this may have initiated the readjustment, it is starkly contrasted with the severe, prolonged recession that would have occurred had the unsustainable growth continued unabated. Using the stock market as an unofficial benchmark, a recession would have begun in March 2000 when the NASDAQ crashed following {{the collapse of the}} dot-com bubble. [...] The Dow Jones Industrial Average was relatively unscathed by the NASDAQ's crash until the September 11, 2001 attacks, after which the <b>DJIA</b> suffered its worst one-day point loss and biggest one-week losses in history up to that point. [...] The market rebounded, only to crash once more in the final two quarters of 2002. [...] In the final three quarters of 2003, the market finally rebounded permanently, agreeing with the unemployment statistics that a recession defined in this way would have lasted from 2001 through 2003.|$|E
