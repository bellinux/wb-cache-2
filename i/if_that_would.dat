5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> really happen.|$|E

He served the 20th District in the 140th and 141st New York State Legislature and {{represented}} the 18th District in the 142nd, 143rd, 144th, 145th and 146th New York State Legislatures. In March 1918, Cotillo opposed the proposed prohibition of alcohol in the state. Although he believed in temperance, he doubted <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be achieved by prohibition; he advocated education and not infringing on civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are young}} {{girls who have}} been {{injected}} with the genes of endangered species, giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. These superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the chimera anima, the monsters created when alien parasites infect a living host. They are later called on to fight the aliens that were {{the source of the}} Chimera Anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally. The head of the project, Ryô Shirogane, originally intended to inject a Chimera Anima with the endangered animal genes directly to see <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reverse the effects of the infection. Instead, it was accidentally injected into five different girls when the earthquake happened.|$|E

25|$|With the German {{invasion}} of France, at first only Polish armoured units were pressed in formation, {{but after the}} Germans broke through the French front, all Polish formations were moved to the front-line, although the units still had not received all of their equipment and supplies from the French logistics services. None of the units were completely equipped {{by the time they}} entered combat and particularly the 3rd and 4th divisions were still in the middle of organization. Polish units fought in the southern section of the front and all continued to fight despite Philippe Pétain’s call for an armistice and demobilization on 16 June. The Polish commander-in-chief, general Władysław Sikorski, on June 19, announced in a radio bulletin that Poland would continue to fight as an ally of the United Kingdom. Polish units were ordered to reach the French ports in the north, west and south in preparation for naval evacuation to Great Britain, or <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> prove impossible, to cross the Swiss frontier.|$|E

The final song was streamed live on the band's Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. Iommi {{has said that he}} does not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, [...] "I wouldn't write that off, if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't know <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> happen."

500|$|In October 2013, Paul was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie Gattaca, Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier, the Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper. After a week of almost daily news reports of new allegations of plagiarism, Paul said that he was being held to an [...] "unfair standard", but would restructure his office in order to prevent mistakes in the future, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be what it would take [...] "to make people leave me the hell alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E
60|$|But now {{it seemed}} to her to be certain that the day of her {{marriage}} would never come. All those expectations must be banished, and she must look elsewhere--if elsewhere there might be any relief. She knew well <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she <b>would</b> separate herself from the Jew, the pocket of her aunt would be opened to relieve the distress of her father--would be opened so far as to save the old man from perishing of want. Aunt Sophie, if duly invoked, would not see her sister's husband die of starvation. Nay, aunt Sophie would doubtless so far stretch her Christian charity as to see that her niece was in some way fed, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> niece <b>would</b> be duly obedient. Further still, aunt Sophie would accept her niece as the very daughter of her house, as the rising mistress of her own establishment, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> niece <b>would</b> only consent to love her son.

2500|$|... "We do {{not suggest}} {{that the risk of}} discriminatory {{enforcement}} is insignificant here," [...] Marshall admitted, since the village had said that it had relied on the experience of its police officers and would do so in the future. But it was too soon to tell <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lead to constitutional issues in practice. And furthermore, it was likely that [...] "the village w take no further steps to minimize the dangers of arbitrary enforcement" [...] since it could adopt administrative regulations that could narrow or clarify the vague terms in the ordinance. In fact, Marshall wrote, the village's decision to base its enforcement on the marketing of products, rather than their design, was a better standard since it did not require analysis of each individual item, and thus was less likely to be enforced unfairly.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens criticizes Moore for stating, in his film, that Iraq had {{not killed}} or {{attacked}} an American: [...] "Moore asserts that Iraq under Saddam had never attacked or killed or even threatened (his words) any American. I never quite know whether Moore is as ignorant as he looks, or even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be humanly possible." [...] Hitchens writes that Palestinian terrorists Muhammad Zaidan and Abu Nidal had been {{free to move}} in and out of Baghdad, and that Saddam's armed forces had exchanged fire and killed American soldiers during the first Gulf War. When interviewed by Jake Tapper, Moore denied having said Hussein's regime had not ever killed an American, insisting his movie had been misquoted: [...] "That isn't what I said. Quote the movie directly. Murdered. The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an American citizen." [...] His narration is reproduced verbatim in The Official Fahrenheit Reader, including a chapter on critiques and supporting evidence.|$|E
