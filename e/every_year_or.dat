25|$|The popular {{image is}} of Johnny Appleseed {{spreading}} apple seeds randomly everywhere he went.

This area included the towns of Mansfield, Lisbon, Lucas, Perrysville, and Loudonville.|$|E

25|$|Pignut hickory {{begins to}} bear seed in {{quantity}} in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur <b>every</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two with light crops in other years; frost can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually {{less than half of}} the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate. The hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) can seriously reduce germination. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by squirrels and chipmunks.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from the molding. This {{is done in}} a hot bath, via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages the molding. In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped into the hot bath via an overhead conveyor. The advantage to using a hot bath is that it is simpler than induction heating and it helps cure thermoset moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the hot bath solution needs cleaning or replacement <b>every</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the fall}} of large {{portions}} of former Byzantine and Sasanian provinces to the Arab armies, a large indigenous Christian population of varying ethnicities came under Arab Muslim dominance. Historically, a number of minority Christian sects were persecuted as heretic under Byzantine rule (such as non-Chalcedonians). As Muslim army commanders expanded their empire and attacked countries in Asia, North Africa and southern Europe, they would offer three conditions to their enemies: convert to Islam, or pay jizyah (tax) <b>every</b> <b>year,</b> <b>or</b> face war to death. Those who refused war and refused to convert were deemed to have agreed to pay jizya. It is a common agreement that after {{the rapid expansion of}} Islam from the 7th century onward, many Christians chose not to convert to Islam. Many scholars and intellectuals like Edward Said believed Christians in the Arab world have made significant contributions to the Arab civilization since the 7th century AD and still do. Some of the top poets at certain times were Arab Christians, and many Arab (and non-Arab) Christians were physicians, writers, government officials, and people of literature.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{seven years}} after he first {{requested}} it, Garcia received his second custom guitar (Tiger) from Irwin {{in the summer of}} 1979. The first concert that Garcia played Tiger was August 4, 1979 at the Oakland Auditorium Arena. Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover. The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was cocobolo, with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and flame maple, in that order. The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil DiMarzio SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups <b>every</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two. The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate {{in the back of the}} guitar. In terms of weight, everything included made Tiger tip the scales at 13½ pounds. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} decade, the Savoy Operas (as the series {{came to be}} known, after the theatre Carte later built to house them) were Gilbert's {{principal}} activity.

After Pinafore came The Pirates of Penzance (1879), Patience (1881), Iolanthe (1882), Princess Ida (1884, based on Gilbert's earlier farce, The Princess), The Mikado (1885), Ruddigore (1887), The Yeomen of the Guard (1888) and The Gondoliers (1889). Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually designed the costumes himself for Patience, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, and Ruddigore. [...] He insisted on precise and authentic sets and costumes, which provided a foundation to ground and focus his absurd characters and situations.|$|E

500|$|As {{with many}} Southern California rivers, the Santa Ana is heavily {{polluted}} and used. The main stem above Seven Oaks Dam is free-flowing, as {{are many of}} its upper tributaries. Once the river enters the Inland Empire basin, however, much of its flow is diverted for municipal and agricultural water use. Most of the flow in the river below the city of San Bernardino consists of effluent from 45 wastewater treatment plants and dry season urban runoff, which is collected behind Prado Dam. Any flow that makes it downstream to Orange County is diverted by another pair of dams into approximately [...] of groundwater recharge basins, providing approximately [...] of municipal water for the county <b>every</b> <b>year,</b> <b>or</b> one-third of its water supply. Downstream of that dam, the river gathers further urban runoff before finally making it into the Pacific.

500|$|Silky sharks in {{most parts}} of the world are thought to {{reproduce}} year-round, whereas mating and birthing in the Gulf of Mexico take place in late spring or early summer (May to August). However, in some cases, the presence of reproductive seasonality may have been obscured by biases in data collection. Females give birth after a gestation period of 12months, either <b>every</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> every other year. The litter size ranges from oneto16 and increases with female size, with six to 12 being typical. The pups are born in reef nursery areas on the outer continental shelf, where ample food supplies and protection from large pelagic sharks occur. The risk of predation has selected for fast growth in young sharks, which add [...] to their length within their first year of life. After a few months (or by the first winter in the Gulf of Mexico), the now-subadult sharks migrate out from the nursery into the open ocean.|$|E
