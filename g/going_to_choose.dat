5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E

During a visit in 2004, Texas Tech basketball coach Bob Knight asked Crabtree which sport he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose.</b> Though the decision was not an easy one, he opted to play college football exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Omniscience is the {{capacity}} to know everything that {{there is to know}} (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level predeterminism such as hard theological determinism or predestination – that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, {{as is the case with}} libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an incompatible-properties argument for the existence of God, known as the argument from free will, and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of omnipotence with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose,</b> then they are responsible for letting them choose it).|$|E

25|$|In 1914 {{only two}} U.S. states allowed twenty round {{championship}} bouts to a verdict, Colorado and Louisiana, and no promoters in either state were offering large enough purses to risk losing the Championship title for. To earn {{as much money}} as he could from being the Champion, Welsh fought in as many ten round 'no verdict' matches as he could. As long as he was on his feet {{at the end of the}} ten rounds, he could not lose his title. Still, Welsh wanted to show he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> soft opposition and began a series of bouts against serious contenders. His first defence was against Matty Baldwin on 27 October in Boston, a match he won on points. This was followed six days later by a contest against Al Wolgast, the former champion who had avoided Welsh when he had the title to lose. The fight was a near sell out at Madison Square Garden in New York, with the crowd firmly behind Wolgast. Although the first few rounds were fairly even between the two fighters, at the end of the fifth round Wolgast blocked an uppercut with his right arm. The blow broke his ulna three inches (76mm) above the wrist, forcing Wolgast to box on with just his left hand. Wolgast kept on fighting but could not continue after the eighth.|$|E

Sigurd tells the old man that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a horse, and asks the old man to come with him to help him decide. The old man says that they should drive the horses down to the river Busiltjörn. The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and {{handsome}} grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from [...] "Sleipnir's kin" [...] and that [...] "he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse." [...] The old man vanishes. Sigurd names the horse Grani, and the narrative adds that the old man was none other than (the god) Odin.|$|E
500|$|Cindy begins helping Darren plan {{his wedding}} to girlfriend Nancy.

Waring felt that Cindy does not plan to split Darren and Nancy up but that there is [...] "a little part of [...] that thinks, 'Surely he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> me?" [...] Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks [...] "that it should be her". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is [...] "the worst possible thing she could have done, because she thinks it means something but Darren thinks otherwise". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy {{she will have to}} let him go leaves her [...] "devastated". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says [...] "that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it". Dawson felt that Darren's relationship with Cindy was [...] "just sex", adding that [...] "it was more of a raw attraction rather than something that would work well in the long-term". Dawson added that it was good to revisit the relationship as the pair have been through a lot together. He added that since his relationship with Cindy [...] "Darren has matured ... Their recent goodbye scene was a great one to bring a bit of closure to what they had".|$|E

2500|$|In late 2010, TVNZ {{garnered}} criticism over various {{comments made}} by Breakfast host Paul Henry.

[...] Henry also questioned whether the Governor-General of New Zealand Anand Satyanand was [...] "even a New Zealander", going on to ask, [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time ... are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?" [...] Following widespread public complaints and official criticism, Henry was suspended from TVNZ for 2 weeks without pay, eventually resigning from the broadcaster. Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of political correctness, and critics accusing him of pandering to the lowest common denominator.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{plays the}} small forward {{position}} {{though he is}} also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end; he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33, and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for being a prolific scorer {{with a variety of}} crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6ft 8in (2.03m) and 235pounds (107kg), he has strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post. He also likes creating space from his defenders which allows him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line. Anthony is often known for being one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, [...] "If you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, {{it would have to be}} Anthony." [...] Despite being a prolific scorer, he has been criticized for his defense and has never been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team.|$|E
