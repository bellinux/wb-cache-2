40|$|A new {{approach}} is presented for computing displacement histories of single linear oscillators with arbitrarily light damping and general forcing—of particular use for efficient Monte Carlo simulation of modal systems with ultra-light damping and very broadband non-Gaussian excitation. Solution methods are initially presented within a state transition context, to show limitations of FFT solutions, and to establish, for long-run non-stationary stochastic analysis via fast Laplace, {{the need for}} appropriate zero-padding, high cut-off frequency, and fixed-step sampling. Truncation errors arising in single-transition time-domain convolution are then examined via the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. Errors are shown to be minimum when transition intervals are chosen as integer multiples of the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> <b>period,</b> precisely where the O (Δτ 2 Δf′) error can be evaluated, and the velocity transition equation can be dispensed with. The paper shows that an optimum O (Δτ 4 Δf‴) integration scheme {{can be used for}} fast time-domain convolution in a two-stage algorithm. First, phased-pairs of accurate displacements are efficiently predicted at selected transition times. These are then used as boundary conditions in adaptive Chebychev polynomial solution giving continuous displacement histories for selected cycles—this considerably reduces the number of multiplications and integrations normally required. Two-stage integration turns out to be at least 100 times faster than explicit short-transition time-domain solution, and for general applications, at least as fast as the Laplace/IFFT approach. But for non-stationary probability density estimation, involving far-future history prediction the speed advantage over fast Laplace can be enormous...|$|E

40|$|The large-amplitude intermediate-period, 4 - 9 seconds, microseisms are {{effectively}} removed from high-magnification l g-period seismograms with maximum agnification near 50 seconds period.

Addition of the filter galvanometer greatly increases the usefulness of these instruments for studies of long-period microseisms and for clear detection and resolution of the long-period components of both body and surface waves from small shocks at very great dis-tances. Magnification equations and theoretical magnification curves show that extremely high sensitivities for desired periods and low sensitivities for undesired periods can be obtained by com-bining one or more filter galvanometers in seismograph systems, varying the <b>damping</b> constants and <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> of the components, and varying the coupling between the components.

40|$|A mode {{acceleration}} formulation {{is presented}} {{for the transfer}} function of absolute acceleration response of a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator which is supported on a base-excited, classically damped and flexible-base primary system. The primary system response has been {{described in terms of}} fixed-base primary mode shapes, with the response in last few modes assumed to be pseudo-static. Base flexibility has been assumed to be described by complex-valued impedance functions, and the effects of kinematic interaction have been assumed to be negligible. The proposed formulation can be used within the framework of any power spectral density function-based random vibration approach to generate floor response spectra of desired level of confidence. A numerical study is carried out {{with the help of an}} example primary system and band-limited white noise to illustrate the proposed formulation. It has been shown that the proposed formulation gives very accurate estimates of floor response spectra if pseudo-static response is assumed to be in those primary modes only which are stiff enough to the base excitation. It has also been shown that neglecting soil-structure interaction may give too over-conservative or unconservative estimates, depending on the <b>damping</b> ratio, <b>natural</b> <b>period,</b> and location of the oscillator, energy distribution in the excitation process, and shear wave velocity of soil...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{buildings}} in Japan during large earthquakes is seen mostly in low-rise buildings {{which tends to}} resonate with the earthquake ground motion. In this paper, a novel vibration control device that utilizes frictional forces is presented aimed towards appliction in low-rise buildings. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the installed damping device. The proposed ibration control device, {{as shown in the}} detailed drawing in Figure 2, has a structure in which contact with the beam occurs through the action of spring force alone, such that when the building is deformed in an earthquake, damping occurs through the action of frictional forces. In order to evaluate the device, vibration experiments were carried out on a miniature model, as shown in Figure 3. The investigation aimed to: 1) ascertain the appropriate rigidity for the parts on which the damping device is to be installed, 2) analyze the suitable spring tensions and frictional forces, and 3) evaluate the damping effects and construct a vibration model. The results confirmed that the vibration control device confers significant <b>damping</b> in the <b>natural</b> <b>period</b> range of low-rise buildings.

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of blood pressure using a fluid-filled catheter and an electromechanical transducer is widely accepted in clinical practice. However, errors {{associated with the}} measurement are often not appreciated and these catheter-manometer systems are frequently unable to accurately reproduce applied pressures. To assess the accuracy of catheter-manometer systems used for invasive arterial blood pressure measurements, in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed. The frequency response (described in terms of <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency and <b>damping</b> factor) {{for a variety of}} cannulae, pressure tubing and stopcocks (and combinations thereof) and their dependence on various parameters (catheter length, lumen diameter, fluid temperature and catheter material) were measured using an hydraulic pressure generator. The design and construction details of the pressure generator are presented. It was found that the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency of the catheter-manometer system is directly proportional to lumen diameter of the pressure tubing/catheter. Furthermore, damping factor is inversely related to the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency and stiffer catheter material (for identical radius ratios) results in higher <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency. Catheter length is inversely related to <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency and the resonant frequency decreases for an increase in fluid operating temperature. It was established that all catheter-manometer systems tested were under-damped (0. 15 < β < 0. 37) and that the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency ranged from 10. 5 Hz for 1500 mm to 27. 0 Hz for pressure tubing of 300 mm in length. Furthermore, catheter-manometer systems which had pressure tubing in excess of 300 mm in length did not comply with the bandwidth requirements for accurate dynamic blood pressure measurement. For the in vivo assessment of the catheter-manometer system, the blood pressure waveform was analysed in the time and frequency domains. It was established that in 60 percent of the cases, the systolic pressure peak was higher when measured by a narrow bandwidth catheter-manometer system compared to that measured by a wide bandwidth system. Furthermore, values of dp/dt maximum were lower for wide bandwidth catheter-manometer systems than those measured by narrow bandwidth systems for heart rates above 90 beats per minute. In the frequency domain analysis, artifact was sometimes found to occur at frequencies higher than the bandwidth of the catheter-manometer system. This high frequency artifact was found to distort the blood pressure waveform and resulted in false high dp/dt and peak systolic pressures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} the Complex Mode Indication Function (CMIF) and its application in spatial domain parameter estimation. The concept of CMIF is developed by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Frequency Response Function (FRF) matrix at each spectral line. The CMIF is defined as the eigenvalues, which are the square of the singular values, solved from the normal matrix formed from the FRF matrix, [] []) () (ww jHjH H, at each spectral line. The CMIF appears to be a simple and efficient method for identifying the modes of the complex system. The CMIF identifies modes by showing the physical magnitude of each mode and the <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency for each root. Since multiple reference data is applied in CMIF, repeated roots can be detected. The CMIF also gives global modal parameters, such as <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequencies, mode shapes and modal participation vectors. Since CMIF works in the spatial domain, uneven frequency spacing data such as data from Spatial Sine Testing can be used. A second stage procedure for accurate <b>damped</b> <b>natural</b> frequency and <b>damping</b> estimation as well as mode shape scaling is also discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Over the {{following}} years many of the installations in the North Sea, installed in the 1980 s, {{will have to be}} decommissioned. Due to rules and regulations most of them will be taken onshore for recycling. In this report a study of the decommissioning process of a SPM buoy in the Statfjord field is perfomed. The column of the buoy is containing 18 compartments and weighs about 7150 tonnes. The topside is weighing about 519 tonnes. The height of the buoy is about 182 m measured from the unijoint. In the decommissioning process the hydrostatics, structural and hydrodynamics should be investigated. In the hydrostatic analysis hand calculations are performed to find equilibrium and ballast condition for given sequences during the operation. In the structural analysis the same sequences are analyzed. The global stress on the buoy is calculated by hand to see of the longitudinal strength of the buoy is satisfying. The hydrodynamic part of the report investigates the difference of linear frequency domain analysis and non- linear time domain analysis, to see if the simpler linear analysis is accurate enough. The hand calculations used in the hydrostatic and structural parts are performed in MathCAD. The calculations for the hydrostatic part are performed by integrating over the geometry to find the hydrostats. The hydrostats was then compared with results obtained in AutoHydro, a program for simulating hydrostatic analysis. To calculate the global stresses the shear force diagram was set up, and later the bending moment and stress diagrams. In the hydrodynamic analysis two programs were used to run the simulations. Wadam was used for the frequency domain analysis and OrcaFlex for the time domain. In both programs Morison theory was used. The hand calculations put up in MathCAD are good enough for rough estimations. The VCB, GMT and LCF are not satisfying for small trim angles. The calculations are satisfying when the buoy is positioned vertically. The bending moment is not zero at bulkhead 19, due to approximation of the lever arm. In the hydrodynamic analysis the <b>damping</b> near the <b>natural</b> <b>period</b> is important. The non- linear Morison theory has only impact near the <b>natural</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R
