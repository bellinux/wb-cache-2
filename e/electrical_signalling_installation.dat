The regulation of the processes of work action and the cognitive regulation of operators are jointly studied in the comparison of two real-world case studies focused on the maintenance of railway infrastructure: {{the maintenance of the}} line and the repair of <b>electrical</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>installations.</b> The interactions between the affirmation of autonomy or the exercise of discretion and different approaches to the time management of working activities affect in various ways the reliability of the system. In urgent cases, the affirmation of autonomy may promote reliability, while in case of time pressure the exercise of discretion may increase the risk of unreliability...|$|R

40|$|Electrophysiological signal {{in plant}} is a weak <b>electrical</b> <b>signal,</b> which can {{fluctuate}} {{with the change}} of environment. An amplification detection system was designed for plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> acquisition by using integrated op-amps (CA 3140, AD 620, and INA 118), patch electrode, data acquisition card (NI USB- 6008), computer, and shielded box.

In this paper, we compute 11 statistical features from the raw non-stationary plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> time series to classify the stimulus applied (causing the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal).</b> By using different discriminant analysis based classification techniques, we successfully establish {{that there is}} enough information in the raw <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> to classify the stimuli.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that higher plants respond to environmental stimuli producing <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> that are in practise the information carriers in intracellular and intercellular communication. Since the amplitude of the biosignal can give only indistinct information about plant reaction, helping to distinguish when plant remain in a normal or in a stimulated situation, it is unable to answer what stimuli causes plant's reaction and the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> generation. In order to relate plant electric wave signals characteristics to solar radiation (400 to 1100 nm) and PAR (400 to 700 nm), measurements were performed on a single stem chrysanthemum plant. All measurements were conducted in Faraday cage {{in order to avoid}} electronic noise from external sources. The <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> from chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum moriflorum) plant were detected through an advanced measuring data acquisition system, included Ag/AgCl electrodes, which were placed on plant leaves. The amplitude of the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (v), solar radiation intensity (W m- 2) and PAR (μmol s - 1 m- 2) in leaves level as well the temperature (°C) and the humidity (%) of the air inside the Faraday cage were measured. The results revealed that <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude alteration related more to PAR than to incoming light intensity variation.
