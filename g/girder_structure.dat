5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and <b>girder</b> <b>structure</b> supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E

40|$|The {{governing}} {{differential equations}} of equilibrium for flexural-torsional-distortional analysis of thin-walled box <b>girder</b> <b>structures</b> with various shapes were derived {{in this work}} using V.

The obtained equations were {{used to evaluate the}} cross sectional deformations of some box <b>girder</b> <b>structures</b> having rectangular (doubly symmetric) and trapezoidal (mono symmetric) shapes. Evaluation of Vlasov’s coefficients for the obtained differential equations of equilibrium formed a major part of this work.

Cross sectional deformations of the box <b>girder</b> <b>structures</b> were obtained by integration of the differential equations of equilibrium using method of trigonometric series with accelerated convergence.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{differential}} equations of equilibrium for flexural-torsional-distortional analysis of thinwalled mono symmetric box <b>girder</b> <b>structures</b> were derived using Vlasov’s theory. To {{ensure that the}} derived equations depict the real life behaviour of mono symmetric box <b>girder</b> <b>structures</b> the interaction between all the strain modes of flexure, torsion and distortion were taken into consideration. By carrying out analysis using similar equations derived by the authors for flexural-torsional analysis, flexural-distortional analysis and torsional-distortional analysis of mono symmetric box girder frames, the effects of flexural-torsional-distortional strain modes interactions on the behaviour of such structures were established. This involved flexural-torsional analysis, flexural-distortional analysis, torsional-distortional analysis and flexural-torsional-distortional analysis of a mono symmetric box girder frame. The derived equations are fourth order ordinary differential equations of equilibrium which were integrated by method of trigonometric series with accelerated convergence. The results show that flexural-torsional analysis, flexural-distortional analysis and torsional-distortional analysis have inherent errors due to the negligence of full interactions between the strain modes of flexure, torsion and distortion...|$|R

Accordingly, we conducted hydraulic model tests that reproduced the vertical and longitudinal behaviors of floating ice sheets carried by tsunami run-up. We clarified the characteristics of wave force for tsunamis that contain sea ice sheets and the impact of such tsunamis against bridge girders. In this test we reproduced a flow that contained solid substances and liquid substances. We confirmed that the wave force of a tsunami whose ice cover rate is 80 % is about 2. 5 times the wave force of a tsunami that contains no ice.

More {{than half of the}} railway bridges in US were built before 1950 and many show signs of distress. There is a need for efficient methods to evaluate the safety reserve in the railway bridges by identification of the most sensitive parts of the bridge. ^ An accurate estimation of remaining fatigue life of a structural component is very important in prioritizing bridge rehabilitation and replacement. However, existing procedures to evaluate the fatigue behavior of bridges are based on estimation rather than the exact formulas because the load and the resistance models contain many uncertainties. Therefore, probabilistic methods are the most convenient way to provide levels of safety for various design cases. ^ The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a reliability model for railway bridges, in particular for the fatigue and strength limit states. It will be demonstrated on two through-plate <b>girder</b> <b>structures.</b> The research involved nonlinear finite element method (FEM) analysis of typical railway bridges, development of statistical parameters of live load and resistance, and calculation of a reliability index for various considered conditions. The findings of this research with final conclusions will serve as a basis for the development of more rational provisions for the design and evaluation of railway bridges. ...|$|R

This paper examines the challenges faced and lessons learned relating to slope stability, foundations, girder design and erection, and environmental issues, during {{the construction of the}} NSRB. Scheduled for completion in 2005, these twin four span (80 - 100 - 100 - 80 meters) steel <b>girder</b> <b>structures</b> are the only new bridges of this type and length constructed in Alberta in recent years. Design standards and construction methods have changed since the last similar bridge was completed. Design procedures and construction techniques used on this bridge, that are new for the Edmonton area and in addition to the effect of large bridge size on constructability, include tangent pile walls, caisson casings, large concrete pours, and girder erections. Challenges encountered on this project include approach fills that are prone to sliding, the effects of bridge curvature on final girder camber, and the stability of girders during erection. Several other challenges and lessons learnt are also covered in the paper. The writers conclude that constructability input can still affect project budget and schedule during the construction phase.

40|$|The {{component}} {{method is}} a design approach for {{the characterization of}} the mechanical proper- ties of structural joints. initially the component method has been developed for joints between open sections and it is referred to in Eurocode 3 Part 1. 8. It allows a theoretical evaluation of the resistance, stiffness and ductility properties based on mechanical models. However, the design of joints between tubular hollow sections follows a different approach. A joint (or more precisely a joint conﬁguration, i. e. a zone where two or more members are connected) is considered as a whole when determining its resistance(s). Existing design rules for joints between tubular hollow sections are based on simple theoretical mechanical models and they are then ﬁtted through comparisons with experimental tests. As a consequence, their ﬁeld of application is often restricted to the domain for which the rules have been validated. Under the umbrella of CIDECT, a project is being carried out to develop a uniﬁed design approach for steel joints independent {{of the type of}} section of the connected elements by extending the ﬁeld of application of the “component method”. To achieve this objective, rules recommended for hollow section joints have to be “converted” into a component format. The present paper presents ways and means for the development of such a uniﬁed design approach. Components have been identiﬁed in typical hollow section joints in lattice <b>girder</b> <b>structures.</b> The paper presents also design rules (component resistances and assembly rules) for some hollow section joints as examples.
