The performance of IrDA links may be measured at IrLAP data link layer, which controls IrDA hardware. In this work a simple equation to calculate the throughput from different link parameters is derived by employing a mathematical model making use the concept of “window transmission time”. Simple equations, for the optimum values for window size and packet length can be derived, for different BER values. Optimum values for window and packet sizes for 16 Mbps are calculated, which result in maximum throughput and make the link less vulnerable to BER. 1...|$|R
