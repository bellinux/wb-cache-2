5|$|Having seen Saigon {{slip from}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> many {{occasions}} {{in the previous}} decade, Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his hold on the key southern city, turning it into his capital, and the base for his preparations for his planned conquest of the Tây Sơn and Vietnam. His enemies had regularly raided the area and confiscated the rice harvest.|$|E
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We {{went back and forth}} with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the weapon}} may be {{depicted}} as an inanimate gada, Kaumodaki sometimes appears personified {{as a woman}} known as Gadadevi or Gadanari in sculptures of Vishnu. In depictions that use this version, Vishnu rests one of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her head, while she herself holds the gada, is seen emerging from it or has the gada carved on her head/crown.|$|E
60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the box as he spoke, but {{the king}} signed {{to him to}} wait, and ordered Labakan {{to come to the}} other table and lay <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the box he had chosen.|$|R
50|$|El caballero de la mano en el pecho, {{variously}} {{translated into}} English as The Gentleman with <b>His</b> <b>Hand</b> at <b>His</b> Breast, Gentleman with <b>his</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Chest or The Nobleman with <b>his</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Chest, is an oil painting by El Greco.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} United kicked off their final home {{game of the}} season, Arsenal had {{recorded}} a tenth straight league victory at home to Everton and ensured their status as champions {{for the first time}} in seven years. Frenchman Arsène Wenger also became the first foreign manager to get <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the coveted trophy since its inception, in only his first full campaign. He completed a double three weeks later by winning the FA Cup, regarded by many fans and pundits alike as unthinkable given the circumstances four months ago.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death for their own purposes. Nevertheless the attempt to sideline Abu'l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father's deathbed, {{and was able to}} immediately assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents' houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited any of his supporters that Abu'l-Abbas could lay <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Pundalik legend, {{two of which are}} attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his waist and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form {{on the banks of the}} river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra. The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, {{and it was one}} of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.|$|E
5|$|Michaels {{then began}} a rivalry with Chris Jericho, after Jericho {{claimed that he}} was the next Shawn Michaels. On January 13, 2003, after Jericho won a battle royal to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble, {{choosing}} number two in order to start the match with Michaels, who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Michaels defeated Jericho at WrestleMania XIX. Despite this, Michaels was low-blowed after hugging with Chris Jericho. On the final episode of Raw of 2003, Michaels would defeat Triple H after a Sweet Chin Music for the World Heavyweight title in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee (Earl Hebner originally refereed the match, only to be knocked out by Triple H {{in the middle of the}} match). However, Bischoff reversed the decision due to both men's shoulders being on the mat. Angered by this, Michaels attacked Ric Flair and Bischoff. Because of Michaels putting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Bischoff, Bischoff then fired him. However, Michaels would be rehired by Steve Austin.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon {{aircraft}} of No.1 Squadron were on {{a training}} flight, during which they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage {{in an effort to}} extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because {{of his ability to}} score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field, as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his hips. During the 15 minutes before the tea break, Bradman did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd for his lack of scoring. The Australian captain reached the tea break on 78; 55 minutes after the resumption of play he played a cover drive against Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests; the last 29 runs took 70 minutes. It {{was one of his}} slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets.

After the Australian captain had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen. Bradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130. Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 4/293, a lead of 128.|$|E

25|$|The Titans {{took the}} ensuing kickoff {{and drove to}} the Patriots 33-yard line. But two penalties, a 10-yard {{intentional}} grounding call and a holding penalty, pushed them back 20 yards. McNair threw an 11-yard completion on the next play, but after that, Drew Bennett had the ball knocked out of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> fourth down and 12, and the Titans turned the ball over on downs with 1:38 left.|$|E

25|$|The film version's climax ends {{a little}} differently: As Quirrell attacks him, Harry's blood protection, which was {{provided}} by his mother's sacrifice of her own life to save him, enables Harry to kill Quirrell himself.

In the final attack, Harry lays <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Quirrell, who burns into crumbling ash. The spirit form of Voldemort renders Harry unconscious before making his escape.|$|E

Elector Joachim I Nestor renewed his protest, and when the Pomeranian dukes received their flags from the emperor, he stepped forward and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> each of them.
