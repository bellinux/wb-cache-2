5|$|Across all releases, it is {{estimated}} that <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind has sold over 200 million tickets in the United States and Canada, and 35 million tickets in the United Kingdom, generating more theater admissions in those territories than any other film. In total, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind has grossed over $390 million globally at the box office; in 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion when adjusted for inflation to current prices, while Guinness World Records arrived at a figure of $3.44 billion in 2014, making it the most successful film in cinema history.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind set {{a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E

5|$|In a 2002 {{review in}} The New York Times, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with Stella Dallas (1937) for the {{thematic}} similarity {{of the series}} of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Margaret Mitchell's novel <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind, first published in 1936, the fictional character Rhett Butler warns a group of upper-class secessionists of the folly of war with the North in terms very reminiscent of those Sherman directed to David F.

5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can {{have an effect on}} the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Winds adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E

Selznick Productions, Inc., which in 1941 became owner of one-fourth of United Artists.|$|E

5|$|Hollywood was in {{the midst}} of a widely publicized search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's {{production}} of <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.|$|E
5|$|On television, the American Broadcasting Company aired it for {{the first}} time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. {{broadcast}} attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second highest televised movie share at the time behind <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind. In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second biggest TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{claim that}} The Big Parade {{superseded}} The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually {{being replaced by}} Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind. Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, {{and it was not}} released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although {{it would have been the}} highest-grossing 'talkie', displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000). Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Winds $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide, and by 1963 it was trailing <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million, ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.|$|E

5|$|At {{least ten}} films have held {{the record of}} 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind spent twenty-five {{consecutive}} years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameron—the current holder—twice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind {{has been}} criticized as {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, it has been credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically.

The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind is a 1939 American epic {{historical}} romance film {{adapted from}} Margaret Mitchell's 1936 {{novel of the}} same name. The film was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming. Set in the American South {{against the backdrop of}} the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler. The leading roles are portrayed by Vivien Leigh (Scarlett), Clark Gable (Rhett), Leslie Howard (Ashley), and Olivia de Havilland (Melanie).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film <b>Gone</b> <b>With</b> <b>The</b> Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|Notable films {{topping the}} American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} greatest film of all time, Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950). The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.|$|E
