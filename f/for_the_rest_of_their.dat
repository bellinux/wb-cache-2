Cofresí met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) {{in exchange for his}} freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofresí's hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofresí and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives.

5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E

During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E

5|$|Bauer {{concludes that}} Brand was a courageous {{man who had}} passionately wanted to help the Jewish people, but his life was plagued after the mission by suspicion, {{including}} from {{other members of the}} Aid and Rescue Committee, because of his failure to return to Budapest.

5|$|By 1913, {{the revival}} at Azusa Street had lost momentum, {{and most of}} the media {{attention}} and crowds had left by 1915.

After Seymour {{died of a heart attack}} on September 28, 1922, Jennie led the church until 1931, when the congregation lost the building.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old {{daughter}} of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom {{died when she was}} young.

After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives. Nasser's entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing {{a bright red}} vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E

All three vessels served on {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War. While on patrol, Deutschland {{was attacked by}} Republican bombers, and in response, Admiral Scheer bombarded the port of Almería. In 1937, Admiral Graf Spee represented Germany at the Coronation Review for Britain's King George VI. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> peacetime careers, the ships {{conducted a series of}} fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and visited numerous foreign ports in goodwill tours.|$|E
5|$|Despite these difficulties, the Channel Fleet was {{possessed of}} one of the best naval commanders of the age; its commander-in-chief, Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, had learned his trade under Sir Edward Hawke and fought at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. In the spring of 1794, with the French convoy's arrival in European waters imminent, Howe had {{dispersed}} his fleet in three groups. George Montagu, in HMS Hector, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and Newfoundland as far as Cape Finisterre. Peter Rainier, in HMS Suffolk and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of the line, with several supporting vessels, under Howe's direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for the arriving French.|$|E
5|$|H.D. and Aldington {{attempted}} to salvage their relationship during this time, {{but he was}} suffering from the effects of his participation in the war, possibly post-traumatic stress disorder, and they became estranged, living completely separate lives, but not divorcing until 1938. They remained friends, however, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives. From 1920, her relationship with Bryher became closer, and the pair travelled in Egypt, Greece and the United States before eventually settling in Switzerland. Bryher entered a marriage of convenience in 1921 with Robert McAlmon, which allowed him to fund his publishing ventures in Paris by utilising some of her personal wealth for his Contact Press. Both Bryher and H.D. slept with McAlmon during this time. Bryher and McAlmon divorced in 1927.|$|E
