The Puraka {{exercise}} is shortest and counts twelve moments (matras, music beats); the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty-four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty-six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas {{for the purposes of}} <b>energizing</b> the Nadis and cleansing the body, asserting that, when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, asserting that the best exercises are those that make one feel lightness in the body and relaxation in the mind.|$|E

5|$|Garfield's accomplishments as {{president}} included {{a resurgence of}} presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, <b>energizing</b> American naval power, and purging corruption in the Post Office, all during his extremely short time in office. Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments, including a U.S. Supreme Court justice. He enhanced {{the powers of the}} presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur, as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. On July 2, 1881, he was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a lawyer and writer with a grievance. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple assault by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered for other than his assassination. Historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2014, McGary {{signed with}} the Thunder and joined them for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On the first {{possession}} of his first NBA Summer League game, McGary issued a halfcourt pass for a lob slam dunk by Jeremy Lamb, highlighting the passing that he is known for. On October 8 during training camp, McGary fractured the second metatarsal of his left foot, causing him to be sidelined for an estimated six weeks. This occurred {{three weeks before the}} team's October 29 season opener and meant McGary was expected to miss the first 14 games of the season. After missing the first 14 games, he began to be a limited participant in practices. McGary debuted with the Thunder on December 14 with 4 rebounds and 3 points in 7:15 of play against the Phoenix Suns. Subsequently, McGary was sidelined for 23 weeks with periostitis (inflammation) in his left tibia. He returned from injury on February 2 as he appeared in just his second NBA game in a 104-97 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 8, in his third NBA game, McGary posted a double double with 19 points and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers, while <b>energizing</b> the crowd and team. Then on February 9, he posted a 17-point, 10-rebound double double against the Denver Nuggets. He was one of the finalists for NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month. On March 13, McGary made his first start against the Minnesota Timberwolves in place of an injured Serge Ibaka, scoring 12 points in 22 minutes. At power forward, his defensive assignment {{was supposed to have been}} Kevin Garnett, but Garnett sat out a third consecutive game and was replaced by fellow rookie (and former Michigan State rival) Adreian Payne who had replaced Garnett in the two previous games as well. McGary had made his first college basketball start against Payne's 2012–13 Michigan State team. On March 16, McGary established a new career high by nabbing 11 rebounds in his first 6 minutes of play before going on to post a double double with 13 rebounds and 12 points in 17 minutes against Dallas Mavericks. In the April 15 season finale against the Minnesota Timberwolves, McGary posted a season-high 4 blocked shots in just 14:54 of play. During his rookie and sophomore seasons, he had multiple assignments with Oklahoma City Blue, the Thunder's D-League affiliate.|$|E
