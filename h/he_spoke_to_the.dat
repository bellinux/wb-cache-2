5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E

25|$|Fred Lip {{tried to}} smooth down the growing discontent. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> union workers of {{taylorism}} (scientific management), and proposed {{to increase the}} number of representatives on the comité d'entreprise (works council, the workers' representation in the factory), in order to have younger representatives. Although this was illegal, the union workers agreed, and elections were organized. Although Fred Lip had believed this would allow him more control of the workers, in less than a year all the young representatives joined the CFTC. Fred Lip then submitted a proposal to the inspection du travail (government labor inspection office) which would eliminate all of the sector of the company to which most of the union workers belonged, including Charles Piaget. However, he offered Piaget a promotion, naming him head of the workshop. For the next year, the workers blocked attempts to eliminate the department, opposing those who tried to move the machines out of the factory.|$|E

Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans.

The rich resources of Peru are described in relation to the mines of Tunja, where the emeralds were more numerous than in Peru. Epítome describes the process of extracting the emeralds with wooden sticks from the veins in the rocks. From the emerald mines of Tunja, he returned to Bogotá.|$|E
