5|$|As {{the night}} wore on, {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the Pashtun forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. The British had lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{this album}} {{was the least}} {{successful}} of the three albums released by the band's Mark I line-up and was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> critics upon its release. Modern reviews are generally positive and remark the variety of styles within the album and the boldness of the song arrangements.|$|E

5000|$|Lewis has criticised British {{involvement}} in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. He said: [...] "It’s sickening {{to think of}} British-built weapons being used against civilians {{and the government has}} an absolute responsibility to do everything in its power to stop that from happening. But as ministers {{turn a blind eye to}} the conflict in Yemen, evidence that humanitarian law has been violated is becoming harder to <b>ignore</b> <b>by</b> the day." ...|$|R
50|$|A skeptical position, {{which was}} taken by Blavatsky in respect of the materialistic science, was {{motivated}} by her outrage over the <b>ignore</b> <b>by</b> the scientists the spiritual dimension of reality. On the other hand, the assertion that spiritual truths can be proven from a scientific point of view, was a constant theme of Blavatsky's claims. The efforts of the theosophists were focused on the legitimation {{of all forms of}} extrasensory and mystical experience.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Saadiq {{released}} his debut solo album Instant Vintage, which received critical acclaim and earned him five Grammy Award nominations. However, despite attaining a following among listeners in Europe, {{it was largely}} <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> contemporary R listeners in the United States and did not sell well. After its release, he was dropped by his record label Universal Records.|$|E
5|$|In protest, Adams briefly {{threatened}} to boycott Canada's annual Juno Awards, where his album {{had been almost}} completely <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the awards committee. He did end up winning the Entertainer of the Year Award (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, Bawdsey was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the Germans for {{the entire}} war, while St Athan was {{attacked}} by a Junkers Ju 88 only weeks after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed to explode.|$|E

The Department of Homeland Security admitted a [...] "breakdown in an internal process" [...] <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> objections <b>by</b> the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to an unnamed portion of the document.|$|R
50|$|Although EBITDA {{is not a}} {{financial}} measure recognized in generally accepted accounting principles, it is widely used {{in many areas of}} finance when assessing the performance of a company, such as securities analysis. It is intended to allow a comparison of profitability between different companies, by discounting the effects of interest payments from different forms of financing (<b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> interest payments), political jurisdictions (<b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> tax), collections of assets (<b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> depreciation of assets), and different takeover histories (<b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> amortization often stemming from goodwill). EBITDA is {{a financial}} measurement of cash flow from operations that is widely used in mergers and acquisitions of small businesses and businesses in the middle market. It is not unusual for adjustments to be made to EBITDA to normalize the measurement allowing buyers to compare the performance of one business to another.|$|R

5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation {{became the basis for}} the formation around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete codification and execution, or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E
5|$|After the {{operation}} closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, the threat of invasion from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase French resistance in the Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.|$|E

5|$|Another {{treaty that}} fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the Senate during {{the remainder of the}} President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried to inform the British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> the music {{press in the}} US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|Director Reeves {{featured}} many {{scenes of}} intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its theatrical release throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively censored by the British Board of Film Censors. In the US, the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success, but it was almost completely <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{publication}} {{figures are}} unavailable for this book, but a first printing {{of one of}} Heyer's novels in the British Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies, and each of her books generally sold over 500,000copies in paperback. As with Heyer's other popular fiction, this book was largely <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> contemporary critics; only after her death did they begin to take more interest in her work.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} antigenic imprin­ting phenomena and antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in epidemic, infectious and postvaccinal processes. Based on published experimental data, it is shown that both phenomena {{are directly related to}} the laws of development and course of epide­mics, the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and safe use of vaccines. Their <b>ignoring</b> <b>by</b> researchers has led to failures in the design of vaccines against HIV/AIDS, dengue fever, influenza, malaria, hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. These data show that, without taking into account the two phenomena, the further development of immunology and epidemiology in the direction of breakthrough discoveries in there areas of science are impossible...|$|R

However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no positive results.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{rejection}} by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the historical record—there is no further {{reference to the}} painting in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime. Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.|$|E
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially {{the sales of}} Max and Moritz were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.|$|E
