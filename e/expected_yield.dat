40|$|This {{research}} identifies {{two problems}} in the new Federal Crop Insurance that may cause adverse selection: (a) the relationship between rate making and <b>expected</b> <b>yields</b> for individual farmers, and (b) the bias introduced in coverage protection when trends {{are not used to}} establish <b>expected</b> <b>yields.</b> A theoretical investigation using the normality assumption demonstrates the potential severity of these problems, and empirical results from farm-level data lend further support. As crop insurance changes to individualized methods of protection, these issues will be particularly important for developing rates. Key words: adverse selection, crop insurance, crop yields, normality, risks. Until recently, Federal Crop Insurance (FCl) used geographic area average yields as the basis of protection and rate making for all farmers in the specified area. Thus, farmers with lower <b>expected</b> <b>yields</b> than the area aver-age could purchase more protection than farmers with yields above the average. This caused adverse selection over time-farmers with higher <b>expected</b> <b>yields</b> (than average) opted out, and farmers with lower <b>expected</b> <b>yields</b> purchased crop insurance-thus in-creasing indemnity payments relative to pre-miums paid. One of the more significant changes made since the 1980 Federal Crop Insurance Act is a move toward developing coverage based upon individual <b>expected</b> <b>yields</b> (first the Individual Yield Coverage program and now the Actual Production History-APH-program). Under the APH program, FCI uses either ten years of certified farm data or a combination of limited farm data and an area indexing scheme to es-Jerry R.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} switching {{a large number of}} production lines between two modes, high production and low production. The switching is based on the optimal expected profit and cost yields of the respective production lines and considers both sides of the balance sheet. Furthermore, the production lines are all assumed to be interconnected through a coupling term, which is the average of all optimal <b>expected</b> <b>yields.</b> Intuitively, this means that each individual production line is compared to the average of all its peers which acts as a benchmark. Due to the complexity of the problem, we {{consider the}} aggregated optimal <b>expected</b> <b>yields,</b> where the coupling term is approximated with the mean of the optimal <b>expected</b> <b>yields.</b> This turns the problem into a two-mode optimal switching problem of mean-field type, which can be described by a system of Snell envelopes where the obstacles are interconnected and nonlinear. The main result of the paper is a proof of a continuous minimal solution to the system of Snell envelopes, as well as the full characterization of the optimal switching strategy...|$|R

500|$|Much of the {{stimulus}} for the treaty was increasing public unease about radioactive fallout {{as a result of}} above-ground or underwater nuclear testing, particularly given the increasing power of nuclear devices, as well as concern about the general environmental damage caused by testing. In 1952–53, the US and Soviet Union detonated their first thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), far more powerful than the atomic bombs tested and deployed since 1945. In 1954, the US Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll (part of Operation Castle) had a yield of 15 megatons of TNT, more than doubling the <b>expected</b> <b>yield.</b> The Castle Bravo test resulted in the worst radiological event in US history as radioactive particles spread over more than , affected inhabited areas (including Rongelap Atoll and Utirik Atoll), and sickened Japanese fishermen aboard the Lucky Dragon upon whom [...] "ashes of death" [...] had rained. In the same year, a Soviet test sent radioactive particles over Japan. Around the same time, victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima visited the US for medical care, which attracted significant public attention. In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, which had a yield of 50 megatons and remains the most powerful man-made explosion in history, though due to a highly efficient detonation fallout was relatively limited. Between 1951 and 1958, the US conducted 166 atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union conducted 82, and Britain conducted 21; only 22 underground tests were conducted in this period (all by the US).|$|E

2500|$|The {{primary device}} was a COBRA Deuterium-Tritium gas-boosted atomic bomb made by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, a very compact MK 7 device. This boosted fission device was {{tested in the}} Upshot Knothole Climax event and yielded [...] (out of 50–70 kt <b>expected</b> <b>yield</b> range), so that the planned {{operation}} Domino could be cancelled before the coming presidential election. The implosion system was quite lightweight at , because it eliminated the aluminium pusher shell around the tamper and used the more compact ring lenses, a design feature shared with the Mark 5, 12, 13 and 18 designs. The explosive material of the inner charges (I.C. for short) in the MK 7 was changed to the more powerful Cyclotol 75/25, instead of the Composition B used in most stockpiled bombs at that time, as Cyclotol 75/25 was denser than Composition B and thus could generate {{the same amount of}} explosive force in a smaller volume (it actually provided 13% more compressive energy than Comp B).
