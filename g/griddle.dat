5|$|In March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine {{received}} over $141,000 on Kickstarter. Its target donation request on {{the website}} was $50,000. PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed {{by the use of}} pancake batter in a bottle that is moved by a programmable machine arm atop the <b>griddle.</b> The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.|$|E
5|$|Homemade {{versions}} of pancake machines have been constructed. An {{example of a}} homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which {{was used for the}} organization's annual pancake day. The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving <b>griddle.</b> The pancakes were manually flipped and plated when cooking was completed. It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a <b>griddle,</b> flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Griddles</b> {{are flat}} plates of metal used for frying, {{grilling}} and making pan breads such as pancakes, injera, tortillas, chapatis and crepes. Traditional iron <b>griddles</b> are circular, with a semicircular hoop fixed to opposite {{edges of the}} plate and rising above it to form a central handle. Rectangular <b>griddles</b> that cover two stove burners are now also common, as are <b>griddles</b> that have a ribbed area {{that can be used}} like a grill pan. Some have multiple square metal grooves enabling the contents to have a defined pattern, similar to a waffle maker. Like frypans, round <b>griddles</b> are generally measured by diameter (20–30cm).|$|R
25|$|In Scotland, <b>griddles</b> are {{referred}} to as girdles. In some Spanish speaking countries, a similar pan is referred to as a comal. Crepe pans are similar to <b>griddles,</b> but are usually smaller, and made of a thinner metal.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>griddles</b> {{designed}} for stove-top use incorporate raised ridges {{in addition to}} a flat cooking area. These are either on half of the cooking surface or, in the case of reversible two-sided <b>griddles,</b> on one side with the flat surface on the other.|$|R
5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a micaceous ware and include ceramic comals (a type of <b>griddle).</b> Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably common {{at the site}}. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E

25|$|Meal offerings called mincha all {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} flour and were either completely or partially burned {{on the altar}}. Those not entirely burned on the altar were eaten by the priests. Some mincha offerings were fried or baked before being offered. Types of mincha included fine flour (solet) mixed with oil and of which a portion {{was given to the}} kohen; flour mixed with oil and fried on a <b>griddle</b> or on a pan; bread called challot mixed with oil and baked in an oven; and wafers (rekikim) smeared with oil baked in an oven.|$|E
50|$|The first flattop grills {{originated}} in Spain and {{are known as}} planchas or la plancha. Food that is cooked a la plancha means grilled on a metal plate. Plancha <b>griddles</b> or flat tops are chrome plated which prevents reaction with the food. Some base metal <b>griddles</b> will impart a subtle flavor to the food being cooked.|$|R

25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a <b>griddle,</b> 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces {{and placed in a}} strainer held over a wok of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.|$|E
500|$|Welsh cakes, or pice ar y maen meaning [...] "cakes on the stone", {{are small}} round spiced cakes, {{traditionally}} cooked on a bakestone, but more recently on a <b>griddle.</b> Once cooked, {{they can be}} eaten hot or cold, {{on their own or}} topped either with sugar or butter. The dough which is mixed with raisins, sultanas and sometimes currants, is similar to shortbread, meaning they can have the consistency of biscuits when cooked on the <b>griddle,</b> and slightly more like a cake when cooked in the oven.|$|E
500|$|Consumer {{versions}} of pancake machines {{for home use}} are simpler in operation compared to commercial machines, typically involving a basic <b>griddle</b> and a feature to adjust cooking temperature. Consumer machines are typically countertop-sized small appliances. Brands include the Severin Crepe Maker, the Cuisinart <b>Griddle</b> and Grill, Swan's Come Dine With Me Party Wok and Pancake Maker, the Roller Grill Single Plate Crepe Machine and the Andrew James Crepe Maker, among others. A review of various consumer machines published in The Daily Mail recommended various machines per situational uses. For example, the Roller Grill Single Plate Crepe Machine was recommended for use with large groups of people and the Severin Crepe Maker was recommended for [...] "technophobes" [...] who prefer a simple design The review recommended the Andrew James Crepe Maker as the overall best value.|$|E
50|$|Crepe makers were {{originally}} large cast-iron plates set {{over the fire}} to cook cereal-based batters. The machines have since evolved and the cast-iron plates were set on top of stainless steel frames. These first machines were electric machines, and later on, gas crepe <b>griddles</b> were developed as well. Although professional cast-iron crepe makers usually need to be seasoned, non-stick cast-iron <b>griddles</b> can now be commonly found on the market.|$|R
50|$|Gas <b>griddles</b> {{are by far}} {{the most}} common, due to the ready {{availability}} of natural and propane gas in commercial cooking environments, and are preferred for their rapid heat-up and more consistent temperatures. Gas burners will tend to heat the plate more evenly as a film of hot gases will cover the entire bottom plate surface. Typical <b>griddles</b> use between 25,000 and 30,000 BTU of energy per linear foot.|$|R

500|$|Bowfin (Amia calva) are basal {{bony fishes}} related to gars in the infraclass Holostei. Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, <b>griddle,</b> grinnel, cypress trout and choupique. They are {{regarded}} as taxonomic relicts, being the sole surviving species of the order Amiiformes which dates from the Jurassic to the Eocene, persisting to the present. Although bowfin are highly evolved, they are {{often referred to as}} [...] "primitive fishes" [...] because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors.|$|E
500|$|In Irish folklore, Cú Chulainn {{was later}} reimagined as an evil giant {{at odds with}} Fionn mac Cumhaill (or Finn McCool). According to the most famous folk tale, Cú Chullain's power was {{contained}} in his middle finger. Wishing to defeat Finn, he came to Finn's house, but Finn disguised himself as a baby while his wife Oona baked cakes, some with <b>griddle</b> irons inside, some without. When Cú Chulainn [...] could not bite through his cake (which had an iron in it) but the baby could (Finn's cake had no iron), in amazement Cú Chulainn felt to see how sharp the baby's teeth were, allowing Finn to bite his middle finger off and deprive Cú Chulainn [...] of both his strength and size.|$|E

2500|$|A tortilla seller is, in [...] or [...] The {{traditional}} tortilla {{has been}} made of maize corn since pre-Columbian times. It is made by curing maize in limewater in the nixtamalization process, [...] which causes the skin of the corn kernels to peel off (the waste material is typically fed to poultry), then grinding and cooking it, kneading it into a dough called masa nixtamalera, pressing it flat into thin patties, and cooking it on a very hot comal (originally a flat terra cotta <b>griddle,</b> now usually made of light sheet-metal instead).|$|E
2500|$|Pitha, in the [...] Bengali, Assamese and Oriya cuisines, {{is usually}} a thin-flat cake {{prepared}} from a batter made with soaked and ground rice. They are usually cooked on a hot <b>griddle</b> or frying pan and could be fried in oil, roasted over a slow fire or baked and rolled over a hot plate once made. In West Bengal and Bangladesh, special pithas are made in different processes such as steaming or stuffing, the bhapa and puli pithas being examples respectively.
