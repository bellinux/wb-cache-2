Organised by its host the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT), the International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD) and CTA, the Smart Tools workshop discussed and assigned tasks to bring the toolkit towards completion. Much of the debate focused on how practitioners in information projects should evalu-ate the performance of their projects for self-assessment, motivated by self-learning, with a view to developing good project management practice. Central to this is the development of a multi-layered road map that presents methodological approaches for performance evaluation to produce a user-friendly toolkit. The workshop drew up guidelines and assigned tasks for writing the tools preparatory tools, process tools and activity tools.

40|$|Summary. A {{large number}} of {{evaluation}} metrics exist for machine translation (MT) systems, but depending on the intended context of use of such a system, not all metrics are equally relevant. Based on the ISO/IEC 9126 and 14598 standards for software evaluation, the Framework for the Evaluation of Machine Translation in ISLE (FEMTI) provides guidelines for the selection of quality characteristics to be evaluated depending on the expected task, users, and input characteristics of an MT system. This approach to contextual evaluation was implemented as a web-based application which helps its users design evaluation plans. In addition, FEMTI offers <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>evaluation</b> the possibility to enter and share their knowledge using a dedicated web-based tool, which have been tested in several evaluation exercises. 1...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the Study The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} local evaluation practices in special education programs within a selected state. More specifically, this researoh sought answers to the following questions: 1. What local evaluation activities were conducted within the selected state in 1980 ? 2. Who was involved in the local evaluation activities within the selected state? 3. Who received the local evaluation results? 4. What uses have been made of the evaluation results? 5. How consistent have the evaluation practices of local special eduoation programs been with regard to what the practices and utilization of results should be? The descriptive survey method of researoh was used to accomplish the investigation. The Population and Sample The population of this study oonsisted of 159 county and 28 city school systems 1 speoial eduoation administrators. The sample selected for this study was the entire population [...] aoensus. The sample oonsisted of 137 special eduoation administrators who were currently employed in the public schools within the selected state. Findings This study gave rise to the following findings: 1. The majority of the respondents reported having conducted evaluation activities centered around personnel development and personnel performance evaluation while less than a majority focused their evaluation activities on student change. (a) The most frequently used methods, instruments, and strategies used to collect evaluation data were checklists, rating scales, questionnaires, and personal interviews. (b) The vast majority of the respondents conduot local evaluations to meet state requirements or to comply with administrative directives. (c) More than 90 percent of the respondents state that they are satisfying the state policy which requires local schools to evaluate the special education program. 2. Special education teachers, special education supervisors, and local school principals were the most involved groups in the local evaluation of special education programs. 3. Local evaluation results were most frequently disseminated among local school superintendents, local school principals, special education teachers, and the State Department of Education. 4. The three primary uses of evaluation results were reported to be (1) informing administrators, (2) staff development purposes, and (3) program improvement. (a) Success in using local evaluation results was rated highest in the act of informing administrators. 5. The evaluation activities oonducted by the local school systems do not meet the requirements of evaluation models for local program evaluation. The evaluation activities conducted by the local sohool systems did not focus enough attention on student change or growth. Conclusions Based on the findings of this study, derived from analysis of selected authorities in evaluation, from data analysis of information collected on the questionnaire, and from the personal interviews, the author has drawn the conclusions listed below: 1. The evaluation activities conducted in the selected state fall short of very desirable program evaluation as expressed by recognized <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>evaluation</b> and the prescriptions of PL- 94 - 142 2. The school systems in this study have given low priority to the inclusion of parents, handicapped students, and other interested observers in the evaluation process. 3. Much of the evaluation of special education in the local schools systems of this study appears to be more for developing favorable relations with high-level school officials than for improving the special education programs for handicapped students. 4. Most of the school systems in this study do not distribute results or receive feedback from many of the important agencies and publics associated with the school. Most of the school systems 2 ̆ 7 special education administrators in this study apparently associated the questionnaire item regarding the existence of a state evaluation policy with the mandates of PL- 94 - 142. 6. Most of the school systems in this study demonstrate a lack of internal consistency in their evaluation practices. Implications This study gives rise to the following implications: 1. The lack of adequate and consistent evaluation practices prevents appropriate analysis and future development of special education programs in most of the school systems in this study. 2. The local school systems in this study need to rethink their current practices in special education program evaluation and their level of priorities in the total education process. 3. In the absence of an effective evaluation program, special eduoation programs for handicapped students will continue to be less than effective for meeting their varied and unique needs. 4. Support and related services personnel for handicapped students 1 programs will oontinue to withdraw whatever support they now provide for public eduoation for handicapped students unless efforts are made at the local school level for the inclusion of these individuals in the evaluation process. 5. Unless great improvement is made in the local school systems in the development of programs for handicapped students, many school systems will jeopardize their cooperative agreements with community and human service agencies which provide a necessary service for handicapped students. Recommendations The following recommendations are warranted: that: 1. Studies be conducted on the quality of the academic preparation of special eduoation and general eduoation administrators who are being attracted to administe special education programs. 2. Studies be conducted to investigate the effects of program evaluation results on program improvement. 3. Studies be conducted which investigate the effects of parent and community involvement in program evaluation on student growth among handicapped students. 4. The results of this study be used by local school super intendents for staff development training for local school special education administrators. 5. Local school systems study the barriers to locally conducted evaluations of special eduoation programs and devise ways to minimize or alleviate them...|$|E

Instructional strategies of traditional programming courses {{tend to focus on}} syntactic issues and assigning practice exercises using the presentation-examples-practice formula and by showing the verbal and visual explanation of a teacher during the “step by step” process of writing a computer program. Cognitive literature regarding the mental processes involved in programming suggests that the explicit teaching of certain aspects such as mental models, strategic knowledge and metacognitive abilities, are critical issues of how to write and assemble the pieces of a computer program.

" Culture has long been used as a management term. Hence, there exists a vast variety of definitions of cultures used by managers: sub-cultures, corporate cultures, and occupational identities [...] each discussed in this edited volume. Political systems and countries can be seen as harboring diverse "evaluation cultures. " As a result of globalization, more experts and academics are now firmly inserted <b>in</b> <b>expert</b> forums, or cross-national expert "markets"; and the experience of cultural difference is very commonly shared. A senior <b>expert</b> <b>in</b> <b>evaluation</b> will be aware that in China, it is not very wise to say "no" bluntly, and that the Chinese use other ways to express their disagreement. Evaluators deal with people, individuals and communities that are best seen in the light of a multicultural perspective.

Based on various features collected from the training corpus, the system statistically learns template representations and document structure and produces well–formed texts (as evaluated by crowdsourced and <b>expert</b> <b>evaluations).</b> <b>In</b> addition to domain adaptation, Gen-Next’s hybrid approach significantly reduces complexity as compared to traditional NLG systems by relying on templates (consolidating micro-planning and surface realization) and minimizing the need for domain <b>experts.</b> <b>In</b> this description, we provide details of GenNext’s theoretical perspective, architecture and evaluations of output. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an expert {{system for the}} energy {{performance}} evaluation of buildings. The system is obtained from the integration of different <b>evaluation</b> methodologies <b>in</b> a unified framework and results in a friendly tool made available to internet users, who can obtain, in real time, good quality perfor-mance certificates. The scope of the project {{is to develop a}} performance assessment of buildings that is both complete and flexible, and that could be extended to different environmental conditions. The project has been originated from the official European procedure EPBD 2002 / 91 /CE which states the essential requirements in a performance-based building strategy. The <b>expert</b> system designed <b>in</b> the first stage of the project has been embedded in a software tool named BEEPS (Building Environment and Energy Performance System), where a Life Cycle Analysis technique is implemented to provide a material and energy balance over the entire life of the material, product or service. This embodies the knowledge of <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> energy <b>evaluations</b> and makes such knowledge available to users in a comprehensible and concise way.
