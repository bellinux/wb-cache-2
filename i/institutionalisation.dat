5|$|Costs {{increase}} with dementia severity {{and the presence}} of behavioural disturbances, and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care. Therefore, any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays <b>institutionalisation</b> or reduces caregivers' hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results.|$|E
5|$|Kelly is {{generally}} considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, <b>institutionalisation,</b> or emigration. The Whitechapel murders file details another four murders that happened after the canonical five: those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, the Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{origin of}} costs for society is the long-term care by {{health care professionals}} and particularly <b>institutionalisation,</b> which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. The cost of living at home is also very high, especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{consolidated}} {{the papal}} {{leadership of the}} Latin Church, reinforcing the link between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism and increased the tolerance of the clergy to violence. The growth {{of the system of}} indulgences became a catalyst for the Protestant Reformation in the early 16thcentury. The Crusades also had a role in the creation and <b>institutionalisation</b> of the military and the Dominican orders as well as the Medieval Inquisition.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the <b>institutionalisation</b> of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E

25|$|The MGK {{is widely}} {{perceived}} as the <b>institutionalisation</b> of the Turkish military’s influence over politics.

Her case led to the initiation of several other class action lawsuits against the province for wrongful sterilization. Muir's advocacy shed light on eugenics, <b>institutionalisation,</b> human rights for persons with a disability, and self-advocacy.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Nietzsche's {{greatest}} philosophical legacy lies in his 20th century interpreters, {{among them}} Pierre Klossowski, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, Leo Strauss, Alexandre Kojève, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze (and Félix Guattari), Jacques Derrida and Albert Camus. Foucault's later writings, for example, adopt Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop anti-foundationalist theories {{of power that}} divide and fragment rather than unite politics (as evinced in the liberal tradition of political theory). The systematic <b>institutionalisation</b> of criminal delinquency, sexual identity and practice, and the mentally ill (to name but a few) are examples used to demonstrate how knowledge or truth is inseparable from the institutions that formulate notions of legitimacy from 'immoralities' such as homosexuality and the like (captured in the famous power-knowledge equation). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's interpreters, used the much-maligned 'will to power' thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such the rhizome and other 'outsides' to state power as traditionally conceived.|$|E
500|$|Despite initial grand {{plans and}} ideals, Kew Asylum had a {{difficult}} and chequered history, contributing to several inquiries throughout its 117years of operation, including a Royal Commission. [...] Overcrowding, mismanagement, lack of resources, poor sanitation and disease were common criticisms during the asylum's first five decades; out-dated facilities and <b>institutionalisation</b> were criticisms of Kew's later period.|$|E
500|$|After the wedding, {{the couple}} moved to Suffolk, near where Rochemont {{had been offered}} a {{congregation}} and a school for boys. Barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the psalms, a common pastime in the eighteenth century, publishing them as Devotional Pieces Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of Job. Attached to this work is her essay [...] "Thoughts on the Devotional Taste, on Sects and on Establishments", which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in the <b>institutionalisation</b> of religion.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, she was criticised when {{it emerged}} {{that two of}} her nieces, Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon, had both been {{committed}} to a psychiatric hospital because they were severely handicapped. However, Burke's Peerage had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, Fenella (the Queen Mother's sister-in-law), [...] "was 'extremely vague' {{when it came to}} filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly". When Nerissa died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number.

500|$|Political {{dialogue}} with Japan began in 1990, and since then, the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries {{that do not}} form part {{of any of these}} cooperation initiatives. In 1998, NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal <b>institutionalisation</b> of relations, but reflect the Allies' desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate, the term [...] "Contact Countries" [...] was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012, the Alliance had broadened this group, which meets to discuss issues such as counter-piracy and technology exchange, under the names [...] "partners across the globe" [...] or [...] "global partners". Australia and New Zealand, both contact countries, are also members of the AUSCANNZUKUS strategic alliance, and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation. Colombia is the NATO’s latest partner and Colombia has access to the full range of cooperative activities NATO offers to partners; Colombia became the first and only Latin American country to cooperate with NATO.|$|E
500|$|Victoria's {{husband died}} in London in September 1921. After meeting {{her at the}} Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. She called a doctor, who {{prescribed}} some medicine and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacist's. When she came back, Louis was dead. On her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, {{in the words of}} her biographer, [...] "became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe's surviving royalty". In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Philip's education and upbringing during his parents' separation and his mother's <b>institutionalisation.</b> Prince Philip recalled, [...] "I liked my grandmother very much and she was always helpful. She was very good with children... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Cornwallis Code was that it, in effect, institutionalised racism in the legal system. [...] Cornwallis, in a manner not uncommon at the time, believed that well-bred gentlemen of European extraction were superior to others, including those that were the product of mixed relationships in India. [...] Of the latter, he wrote [...] "as on account of their colour & extraction they are considered {{in this country as}} inferior to Europeans, I am of opinion that those of them who possess the best abilities could not command that authority and respect which is necessary in the due discharge of the duty of an officer." [...] In 1791 he issued an order that [...] "No person, the son of a Native Indian, shall henceforward be appointed by this Court to Employment in the Civil, Military, or Marine Service of the Company." [...] Cornwallis's biographers, the Wickwires, also observe that this <b>institutionalisation</b> of the British as an elite class simply added another layer on top of the complex status hierarchy of caste and religion that existed in India at the time. Cornwallis could not have formalised these policies without the (tacit or explicit) agreement of the company's directors and employees.|$|E
500|$|Until 2002, {{the venue}} for European Council summits was the member state {{that held the}} {{rotating}} Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement {{at such a time}} as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. [...] The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an <b>institutionalisation</b> of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E

2500|$|The {{rise of the}} lunatic asylum and its gradual {{transformation}} into, {{and eventual}} replacement by, the modern psychiatric hospital, explains the rise of organised, institutional psychiatry. While there were earlier institutions that housed the 'insane', the conclusion that <b>institutionalisation</b> was the correct solution to treating people considered to be [...] "mad" [...] {{was part of a}} social process in the 19th century that began to seek solutions outside families and local communities.|$|E
2500|$|Erving Goffman {{coined the}} term [...] "Total Institution" [...] for mental {{hospitals}} and similar places which took over and confined a person's whole life. Goffman placed psychiatric hospitals {{in the same category}} as concentration camps, prisons, military organizations, orphanages, and monasteries. In his book Asylums Goffman describes how the <b>institutionalisation</b> process socialises people into the role of a good patient, someone [...] "dull, harmless and [...] inconspicuous"; in turn, it reinforces notions of chronicity [...] in severe mental illness. The Rosenhan experiment of 1973 demonstrated the difficulty of distinguishing sane patients from insane patients.|$|E
2500|$|Changes to {{psychiatric}} healthcare between 1982 and 1990 and {{in particular}} new medications, saw the reduction of patients being cared for in 'Long Stay' wards and instead moving from <b>institutionalisation</b> to assisted self-care. Hundreds of patients were supported as they gained or often regained {{knowledge of how to}} care for themselves before leaving the hospital to move perhaps into a house with three or four other patient friends initially within, and later discharged to a house outside the hospital. Many of St. Bernard's medical, nursing and para-medical staff moved from hospital based work to community support as a result and towards the end the hospital was able close wards quite dramatically ...|$|E
2500|$|The Süddeutsche Zeitung also criticised {{the court}} proceedings, {{claiming}} that exculpatory evidence was ignored {{for the most}} part. In addition, Mollath did not trust his court-appointed lawyer, who found himself nearly incapable of helping his client as a result. Like Müller, the newspaper furthermore contradicted Merk's claim that Mollath's classification as {{a danger to the}} public and his black money allegations {{had nothing to do with}} each other. According to the publication, the assumption of a [...] "black money complex/obsession" [...] was crucial to all verdicts pertaining to Mollath's <b>institutionalisation,</b> beginning in 2006 with the regional court in Nürnberg and influencing even verdicts as late as 2011 and beyond.|$|E
2500|$|Religion is {{not only}} an {{individual}} matter, but [...] "also a collective endeavour". Though individual experience and the iconoclastic picture of Zen are emphasised in the Western world, the Zen-tradition is maintained and transferred by a high degree of <b>institutionalisation</b> and hierarchy. In Japan, modernity has led to criticism of the formal system and the commencement of lay-oriented Zen-schools such as the Sanbo Kyodan and the Ningen Zen Kyodan. How to organize the continuity of the Zen-tradition in the West, constraining charismatic authority and the derailment it may bring on the one hand, and maintaining the legitimacy and authority by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand, is a challenge for the developing Zen-communities in the West.|$|E
2500|$|After the war the Government of Bangladesh confiscated the {{properties}} of the Bihari Population. A University of Dhaka law student, writing in the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, opinined about its consequences [...] "abandoned property laws have been, simply, gross denial of freedom and liberty, and <b>institutionalisation</b> of systematic socio-cultural, economic and political deprivation of Bihari community in Bangladesh". There are many reports of massacres of Biharis and alleged collaborators {{that took place in the}} period following the surrender of the Pakistani Army on 16 December 1971. In an incident on 18 December 1971, captured on camera and attended by members of the foreign press, Abdul Kader Siddiqui and Kaderia Bahini guerrillas under his command and named after him, bayoneted and shot to death a group of prisoners of war who were accused of belonging to the Razakar paramilitary forces.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, insulin {{shock therapy}} and lobotomies are viewed as being almost as barbaric as the Bedlam [...] "treatments", {{although}} the {{insulin shock therapy}} was still seen as the only option which produced any noticeable effect on patients. ECT is still used in the West, but {{it is seen as}} a last resort for treatment of mood disorders, and is administered much more safely than in the past. Elsewhere, particularly in India, use of ECT is reportedly increasing, as a cost-effective alternative to drug treatment. The effect of a shock on an overly excitable patient often allowed these patients to be discharged to their homes, which was seen by administrators (and often guardians) as a preferable solution to <b>institutionalisation.</b> Lobotomies were performed in the hundreds from the 1930s to the 1950s, and were ultimately replaced with modern psychotropic drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{youth of}} Pakistan gets {{introduced}} to tape ball cricket very early on. [...] Every city, town, and village has tape ball leagues (especially {{during the month}} of Ramadan). [...] Export of this idea from Pakistanis who settled in the west has led to its popularity throughout UK, USA, and Canada. [...] The tape ball has gained popularity in England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies, but remains most popular and widely used in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and, to a lesser extent, in Sri Lanka. Generations of professional and amateur Pakistani cricket players since the 1980s have been raised playing tape-ball cricket in their neighbourhood streets and grounds. Professional cricketers such as Saeed Anwar, Rashid Latif, Asif Mujtaba, Moin Khan and Basit Ali enjoy the medium and play regularly. Extensive enthusiasm for the medium has led to the <b>institutionalisation</b> of the tape ball in Pakistani cricket.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, the Hospital {{decided to}} move to a {{healthier}} location in the countryside. A proposal to turn the buildings over for university use fell through, and they were eventually sold to a property developer called James White in 1926. He hoped to transfer Covent Garden Market to the site, but the local residents successfully opposed that plan. In the end, the original Hospital building was demolished. [...] The children were moved to Redhill, Surrey, where an old convent was used to lodge them, and then in 1935 to the new purpose-built Foundling Hospital in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. When, in the 1950s, British law moved away from <b>institutionalisation</b> of children toward more family-oriented solutions, such as adoption and foster care, the Foundling Hospital ceased most of its operations. The Berkhamsted buildings were sold to Hertfordshire County Council for use as a school (Ashlyns School) and the Foundling Hospital changed its name to the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children and currently uses the working name Coram.|$|E
2500|$|Extensive house-to-house {{enquiries}} and searches {{were conducted}} by police. On 10 November, Dr. Bond wrote a report linking Kelly's murder with four previous ones—those of Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, and Catherine Eddowes—and providing a likely profile of the murderer. On the same day, the government offered a pardon for [...] "any accomplice, not being the person who contrived or actually committed the murder, who shall give such information and evidence as shall lead to the discovery and conviction of the murderer or murderers". Despite the offer, and a massive police investigation, no one was ever charged or tried for the murders. No similar murder was committed {{for the next six}} months, as a result of which the police investigation was gradually wound down. Kelly is generally considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, <b>institutionalisation,</b> or emigration.|$|E
2500|$|Western Europe would adopt {{these views}} later {{on with the}} {{advances}} of physicians like Philippe Pinel at the Bicêtre Hospital in France and William Tuke at the York Retreat in England. They advocated the viewing of mental illness as a disorder that required compassionate treatment that would aid in the rehabilitation of the victim. The arrival in the Western world of <b>institutionalisation</b> {{as a solution to}} the problem of madness was very much an event of the nineteenth century. [...] The first public mental asylums were established in Britain; the passing of the County Asylums Act 1808 empowered magistrates to build rate-supported asylums in every county to house the many 'pauper lunatics'. Nine counties first applied, the first public asylum opening in 1812 in Nottinghamshire. In 1828, the newly appointed Commissioners in Lunacy were empowered to license and supervise private asylums. The Lunacy Act 1845 made the construction of asylums in every country compulsory with regular inspections on behalf of the Home Secretary. The Act required asylums to have written regulations and to have a resident physician.|$|E
2500|$|The clinician-historian Joel Braslow {{argues that}} from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, {{physical}} psychiatric therapies [...] "spiral {{closer and closer}} to the interior of the brain" [...] with this organ increasingly taking [...] "center stage as a source of disease and site of cure." [...] For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history, the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients then in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors. Many doctors, patients and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances or, at least they were deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term <b>institutionalisation.</b> Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate if desperate remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless. Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients' rights.|$|E
