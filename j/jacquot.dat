On the {{crosspiece}} are statues depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Apostle. Two cherubs are on {{the arms of the}} cross. Two smaller crosses stand at each side of the central cross and from these hang the bodies of the two robbers executed alongside Jesus. At the base of the central cross is a pietà ("Vierge de pitié"). The sculpture of the bad robber with attendant demon are by <b>Jacquot</b> whilst the good robber was carved by Guillouic.|$|E

Cast names should lend the picture some Euro arthouse traction, though Stateside biz won't far exceed that of <b>Jacquot's</b> recent work." [...] While Chang criticized the characterization and depiction of Seydoux's character Sidonie Laborde, he praised Kruger's projection of [...] "regal desperation" [...] {{as well as}} Ledoyen's performance as the duchess.|$|R

2500|$|Guéhenno {{originally}} had the archetypal [...] "enclos paroissial" [...] with the parish church, an ossuary, calvary and cemetery. In 1794 however, {{troops of the}} Republican Army, pausing on their journey to Josselin, pillaged the village, burnt down the 16th-Century church and severely damaged the calvary which dated back to 1550 and was attributed to the sculptor F. Guillonic. In 1853 the new rector, Abbé <b>Jacquot,</b> set about rebuilding the calvary assisted by his rector Laumaillė and two masons; fortunately the villagers had managed to hide away the fragments left after the soldiers' attack, secreting them in the ossuary, granary and other places and having mastered the rudiments of sculpture, <b>Jacquot</b> even added some extra pieces. Two inscriptions tell the story. [...] "J.GUILLOUIC A FACIT CESTE CROUA DE P LES PRROISSIES 1550" [...] and [...] "REFAIT EN 1853 <b>JACQUOT</b> R DREAN M. LAUMAILLÉ VICAIRE." [...] <b>Jacquot</b> also added several sculptures to a new ossuary built in 1863. The church was also rebuilt. The calvary has three crosses emerging from a large granite pedestal, the central cross being occupied by Jesus Christ whilst the two robbers executed alongside Jesus hang from the two smaller crosses. At the front of this pedestal, a smaller granite slab forms an altar table and facing the calvary <b>Jacquot</b> placed a column on which the instruments of the passion were carved, a rooster sitting {{at the top of}} the column representing Saint Peter's denial of Christ. <b>Jacquot</b> also added to the sides of the altar table the images of the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and Ezekiel. <b>Jacquot</b> died in 1866, aged 66 years. The calvary was designated a [...] "monument historique" [...] in 1927. Apart from the rooster topped column and the four prophets which are attributable to <b>Jacquot</b> alone, <b>Jacquot</b> also made some other alterations to pieces originally sculpted by Guillonic. As a result, the attributions are not always crystal clear.|$|E

2500|$|On each {{face of the}} {{pedestal}} is a bas-relief depicting {{a scene from the}} passion. The first on {{the pedestal}}'s south side shows Jesus praying in the Garden of Olives/Gethsemane as three of his apostles sleep ("Agonie du Christ"). The bas-relief {{at the rear of the}} calvary, the eastern side, shows the flagellation. Jesus is surrounded by two soldiers holding whips. The third relief on the west side depicts Christ's resurrection and in the final relief on the north side Jesus sits between two Roman soldiers who are kneeling and mocking him, one handing him a reed and joking that he should hold it as his sceptre; the [...] "Christ aux outrages" [...] or [...] "Dėrision du Christ". It is not thought that the bas-reliefs are by either Guillouic or <b>Jacquot</b> but that they are the work of two different 16th Century sculptors.|$|E
2500|$|The altar table {{comprises}} {{a smaller}} pedestal {{at the front}} of the larger pedestal and on this is a bas-relief which depicts Jesus' apparition before the empty tomb. [...] Beneath this is an inscription added by Abbé <b>Jacquot</b> stating that any visitor saying prayers at the calvary will be given 40 days of grace after saying [...] "5 Paters and 3 Ave Marias." [...] On the altar table's surface is a depiction of the entombment ("Mise au tombeau") attended by Saint Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, John the Evangelist and three female saints. This is attributed to Guillouic. To the side of the altar there are statues of the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel and Daniel. Each carries a banner. Isaiah's banner reads [...] "Salvabos gregem meum", Jeremiah's reads [...] "Saturabitur opprobriis", Ezechiel's reads [...] "Et cum sceleratis reputatus est" [...] and Daniel's [...] "Christus occidetur".

6000|$|The [...] "Odes Funambulesques" [...] contain many {{examples}} of M. De Banville's skill in reviving old forms of verse--triolets, rondeaux, chants royaux, and ballades. Most of these were composed for the special annoyance of M. Buloz, M. Limayrac, and a M. <b>Jacquot</b> who called himself De Mirecourt. The rondeaux are full of puns in the refrain: [...] "Houssaye ou c'est; lyre, l'ire, lire," [...] and so on, not very exhilarating. The pantoum, where lines recur alternately, was borrowed from the distant Malay; but primitive pantoum, in which the last two lines of each stanza are the first two of the next, occur in old French folk-song. The popular trick of repetition, affording a rest {{to the memory of}} the singer, is perhaps the origin of all refrains. De Banville's later satires are directed against permanent objects of human indignation--the little French debauchee, the hypocritical friend of reaction, the bloodthirsty chauviniste.

50|$|Sade's {{life and}} works {{have been the}} subject of {{numerous}} fictional plays, films, pornographic or erotic drawings, etchings, and more.These include Peter Weiss's play Marat/Sade, a fantasia extrapolating from the fact that Sade directed plays performed by his fellow inmates at the Charenton asylum. Yukio Mishima, Barry Yzereef, and Doug Wright also wrote plays about Sade; Weiss's and Wright's plays have been made into films. His work is referenced on film at least as early asLuis Buñuel's L'Âge d'Or (1930), the final segment of which provides a coda to 120 Days of Sodom, with the four debauched noblemen emerging from their mountain retreat. In 1969, American International Films released a German-made production called de Sade, with Keir Dullea in the title role. Pier Paolo Pasolini filmed Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975),updating Sade's novel to the brief Salò Republic; Benoît <b>Jacquot's</b> Sade and Philip Kaufman's Quills (from the play of the same name by Doug Wright) both hit cinemas in 2000.

[...] These are not very exalted subjects, or what are called exalted, and do not go beyond simple, smiling beauty and nature. But what then?

The sweet flowers are springing there; the fat muttons are waiting there; the pleasant sun shines there; be content and humble, and take your share of the good cheer.|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation looks at several readings and {{interpretations of the}} works of the Marquis de Sade, from the eighteenth century to the present. Ever since he was imprisoned under the Old Regime following highly publicized instances of physical and sexual abuse, Sade has remained a controversial figure who has been both condemned as a dangerous criminal and celebrated as an icon for artistic freedom. The most enduring aspect of his legacy has been a vast collection of obscene publications, characterized by detailed descriptions of sexual torture and murder, along with philosophical diatribes that offer theoretical justifications for the atrocities. Not surprisingly, Sade's works have been subject to censorship almost from the beginning, leading to the author's imprisonment under Napoleon and to the eventual trials of his mid-twentieth-century publishers in France and Japan. The following pages examine the reception of Sade's works in relation to the legal concept of obscenity, which provides a consistent framework for textual interpretation from the 1790 s to the present. I begin with a prelude discussing the 1956 trial of Jean-Jacques Pauvert, in order to situate the remainder of the dissertation within the context of how readers approached a body of work as quintessentially obscene as that of Sade. At Pauvert's trial there emerged an opposition between readings that concentrate on the prurient nature of the texts and those that instead attempt to justify their place in society by stressing their intellectual merit. This opposition remains in effect throughout the remaining chapters, each of which focuses on a particular historical moment in the reception of Sade's works and on a certain reader or group of readers. Chapter One establishes Sade himself as the first reader of his texts, and discusses how he situated them with respect to the genre of obscene books that had developed in France throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Chapter Two focuses primarily on Rétif de la Bretonne as the first reader of Sade, one who publicly condemned the author and his works on moral grounds while simultaneously composing his own erotic novel in the Sadean vein. Chapter Three deals with the onset of a tendency among nineteenth-century French authors to admire him as the "Divine Marquis," with a particular focus on Flaubert and his discussion of Sade in his correspondence. The second half of the dissertation focuses on the reception of Sade's works during the twentieth century. Each subsequent chapter examines the interaction of mainstream intellectual readings [...] such as those of the surrealists, post-war essayists like Blanchot and Bataille, or Pasolini in Salò [...] and the underground readings that occur in the realms of erotic fiction and film, paying special attention to how Sade was used in various political and artistic debates. Finally, my conclusion discusses the place of Sade in contemporary society, including in recent films such as Benoît <b>Jacquot's</b> Sade and Philip Kaufman's Quills...|$|R
