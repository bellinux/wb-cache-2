40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} {{have been}} made in shallow, small-diameter boreholes in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas off the Alaskan coasts since 1975. Methods for making access holes with light-weight equipment are described. These included augering, water jet drilling, rotary water jet drill-ing, and <b>driving.</b> <b>Pipe</b> or tubing was placed in the access holes and logged at discrete, closely-spaced depth intervals, usually one metre, t o obtain the temperature profiles. Temperature profiles in the Norton Sound area of the Bering Sea show that permafrost is absent except possibly very near shore in areas of rapid shore-line retreat. Subzero temperatures were found in all holes drilled in Kotzebue Sound, and in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Holes drilled in the Chukchi Sea near Barrow suggest that the shore-line is stable, or nearly so, and that ice-bearing per-mafrost is probably thin or absent a kilometre or more off-shore. In the Beaufort Sea (Elson Lagoon) near Barrow, the shore-line is retreating rapidly (i. e., a few metres per year) whereas. temperature pro-files near Prudhoe Bay suggest a retreat rate of a metre per year or less. The depth to ice-bonded per-mafrost, as determined by temperature measurements, increases with distance off-shore when the soil conditions are constant. However, ice-bonded permafrost may be found near the sea bed in areas of very fine-grained compact soils even when these occur far off-shore. The thermal data has been use...|$|E

40|$|In many {{countries}} water supply is {{a service that}} is seriously underpriced, especially for residential consumers. This {{has led to a}} call for setting cost recovery policies to ensure that the tariffs charged for water supply cover the full cost of service provision. Identification of factors <b>driving</b> <b>piped</b> and non-piped water demand is a necessary prerequisite for predicting how consumers will react to such price increases. Using cross-sectional data of 1, 800 households from Southwest Sri Lanka, we estimate water demand functions for piped and non-piped households using appropriate econometric techniques. The (marginal) price elasticity is estimated at − 0. 15 for households exclusively relying on piped water, and at − 0. 37 for households using piped water but supplementing their supply with other water sources. The time cost elasticity for households relying on non-piped water only is estimated at − 0. 06 on average, but varying across sources. For both piped and non-piped households, we find evidence of substitutability between water from different sources. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of pricing policy...|$|R

5000|$|The reserve {{was bought}} by the RSPB in 1977 using money raised in a {{sponsored}} birdwatch by the RSPB's junior branch. The name Fowlmere comes from {{the nature of the}} site before 1800 when it was an area of open water which was a habitat for large numbers of wildfowl. In 1850 attempts were made to drain the area but failed. In the 1890s watercress began to be grown and ponds were dug and lined with clay. The watercress growers gained more control over the water levels by <b>driving</b> <b>pipes</b> into the ground from which the water bubbled to the surface and still flow when the water table is high enough. However due to extraction of water for people in surrounding areas, the water flowing out of the spring is decreased over its 19th-century levels, and during dry periods the Environment Agency provides extra water. The watercress was washed and packed on site before being taken by horse and cart to Shepreth station and thence to Covent Garden Market in London. Watercress growing continued until the 1960s. The abandoned cress beds became overgrown with reeds and the site is now managed to preserve a wide variety of habitats.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Drivability {{analyses}} performed {{using the}} one-dimensional wave equation {{have been an}} accepted engineering practice for the installation of driven piles for over thirty-five years, due {{to the ability to}} accurately predict <b>driving</b> performance. <b>Pipe</b> ramming represents an analogous application to pile driving, yet drivability analyses are not yet common, despite the ability to predict the rate of driving and the driving stresses that are induced by the impact energy delivered by the pipe ramming hammer. This paper presents a case history of an instrumented, 2, 440 mm diameter pipe driven through an active highway embankment using pipe ramming. The performance of the rammed pipe is described in terms of pipe-hammer energy transfer, ramming-induced stresses, and total, static and dynamic soil resistance. Drivability analyses calibrated using new pipe ramming-specific static soil resistance model and dynamic soil parameters generated using the results of several instrumented pipe rams are performed and compared to the observed field results. The comparison of observed and predicted driving performance indicates that drivability analyses can satisfactorily predict the penetration resistance and ramming-induced stresses and be used to plan pipe ramming installations...|$|R
40|$|In {{centrifugal}} tests, conventional sensors {{can hardly}} capture {{the performance of}} reinforcement in small-scale models. However, recent advances in fiber optic sensing technologies enable the accurate and reliable monitoring of strain and temperature in laboratory geotechnical tests. This paper outlines a centrifugal model test, performed using a 60 [*]g ton geocentrifuge, to investigate the performance of pipe piles used to reinforce the loess foundation below a widened embankment. Prior to the test, quasidistributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensors were attached {{to the surface of}} the pipe piles to measure the lateral friction resistance in real time. Via the centrifuge actuator, the <b>driving</b> of <b>pipe</b> piles was simulated. During testing, the variations of skin friction distribution along the pipe piles were measured automatically using an optical fiber interrogator. This paper represents the presentation and detailed analysis of monitoring results. Herein, we verify the reliability of the fiber optic sensors in monitoring the model piles without affecting the integrity of the centrifugal model. This paper, furthermore, shows that lateral friction resistance developed in stages with the pipe piles being pressed in and that this sometimes may become negative...|$|R

40|$|Framed by {{a common}} {{research}} program of Chinese Academy of Sciences and of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft a cooperation project on the acoustics of Chinese and European wind instruments has been established. A first set of experiments is dedicated to reed vibration and sound of individual pipes of a sheng, a typical Chinese free-reed instrument. The investigated pipe of the sheng was mounted in a tailored transparent boot, which allowed the measurement of the velocity of reed vibration by using a laser vibrometer. Simultaneously, {{the sound of the}} pipe was detected by a microphone located in the near field of the sound source. The pressurized air for exciting the sheng pipe was provided by a bidirectional laboratory wind system, developed originally for <b>driving</b> organ <b>pipes.</b> Both the reed velocity and sound pressure signals were synchronously sampled by a four channel AD board and recorded by a laptop. The measurements were carried out in a semi-anechoic chamber. Reed velocity and sound pressure as functions of wind pressure and air consumption were studied experimentally. Spectra of reed velocity and sound pressure were calculated from the recorded signals by a special sound analysis software. The attack transients which are very important for the perceived sound of the instrument, were also analyzed.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for energy has motivated {{the oil and}} natural gas exploration in very hostile environments, including very deep water operation and the transport of corrosive fluids. Technological advances favor the use of high strength steel pipelines either clad or mechanically lined with a corrosion resistant alloy (CRA), such as Alloy 625, for the transport of corrosive hydrocarbons. Moreover, these pipelines are subjected to severe installation conditions and a case of interest is the pipe reeling process which allows pipe welding and inspection to be conducted at onshore facilities. While cost effective, fracture assessments and specification of critical flaw sizes for the girth welds of lined/clad pipes become more complex due to the dissimilar nature of these materials and the high levels of plastic strain imposed during installation. In particular, effective analyses of crack driving forces in undermatched or partially mismatched pipe girth welds remain essential to determine more accurate acceptable flaw sizes for the piping system based upon conventional ECA procedures. This work focuses on development of a procedure to determine the elastic-plastic crack <b>driving</b> forces for <b>pipe</b> girth welds with circumferential surface cracks subjected to bending load {{for a wide range of}} geometries and weld mismatch levels based upon the EPRI methodology and its applicability to ECA analysis of undermatched clad pipe girth welds.

30|$|The {{numerical}} modelling of pile penetration into stiff clays, where the pile was pre-drilled {{to a depth}} of 18  m and only the last hammer blows were simulated,was presented by Mabsout and Tassoulas (1994). Soon afterward, a special finite element analysis technique called “zipper-type” was successfully used to simulate the pile installation process. In this modelling technique, a reserved hole with a diameter of 1  % of the pile diameter was simulated in the axis of penetration. This reserve hole was able to expand so that the contact between the soils and pile was established in the penetration process of sleeve. To analyze the soil plugging effect in the open-end pipe pile, Henke and Grabe (2008) developed the {{numerical modelling}} of <b>driving</b> open-end <b>pipe</b> pile into soils using the “zipper-type” technique. In their model, a rigid tube of 1  mm wall thickness was created along the open-end pipe pile wall, it penetrated throughout the whole soil layer. Before penetration of pile, the interaction between the pipe pile and soils was assumed to be frictionless. During pile penetration, the pipe pile slided over the rigid tube, and separated the soils from rigid tube. By taking this method, the contact between the driven pile and surrounding soils could be established. The Coulomb friction model was used throughout all analyses for the contact. Due to the full penetration of the rigid tube, the soils {{at the bottom of the}} pipe pile couldn’t plug into the pipe pile, which produced a certain influence on the result of soil plugging. This paper simulates the vibratory driving of sleeve, and a rigid tube with a thickness of 1  mm is modelled along the sleeve wall to allow penetration of sleeve (Fig.  1). However, the length of the rigid tube in this model is the same as that of the sleeve, which does not penetrate throughout the whole layer. As the sleeve is being driven, the soils at the bottom of the rigid tube can plug into the sleeve. Therefore, numerical modelling can provide a more precise simulation of the soil plug.|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1996, a unique multi-phase, multi-stage, {{low-pressure}} permeation grouting pilot program was performed inside portions of four unlined waste disposal trenches at Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 4 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The project was deemed a non-time-critical removal action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA); however, due to a history of heavy precipitation in the fall, the schedule was fast-tracked to meet an October 31, 1996 grouting completion data. The technical objective of the removal action was to reduce the off-site transport of Strontium 90 ({sup 90 }Sr) by grouting portions of four waste disposal trenches believed {{to be responsible for}} over 70 % of the {sup 90 }Sr leaving the site. A goal of the grouting operation was to reduce the average in situ hydraulic conductivity of the grouted waste materials to a value equal to or less than 1 X 10 {sup {minus} 6 } cm/sec. This target hydraulic conductivity value was established to be at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of the surrounding natural ground.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{prototype}} sensor-based platform moving inside a subsurface network of pipes {{with the task}} of monitoring the soil moisture content is presented. It comprises of a mobile platform, a modified commercial soil moisture sensor (Diviner 2000), a network of subsurface polyvinylchloride (PVC) access <b>pipes,</b> <b>driving</b> hardware and image processing software. The software allows the composition of two-dimensional (2 D) or three-dimensional (3 D) images with high accuracy and at a large scale. The 3 D soil moisture images are created by using 2 D slices for better illustration of the soil moisture variability. Three case studies of varying soil moisture content using an experimental soil tank were examined. In the first case study, the irrigation water was applied uniformly on the entire tank surface. In second and third case studies, the irrigation water was applied uniformly only {{on the surface of the}} intermediate and last part of the soil tank respectively. The processed images give a detailed description of the soil moisture distribution of a layer at 15 cm depth under the soil surface in the tank. In all case studies that have been investigated, the distribution of soil moisture was characterized by a significant variability (difference between poorly and well-drained regions) of the soil tank. A very poorly-drained region was located in the middle of the soil tank, while well-drained soil areas were located southwest and northeast. The knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is a valuable tool for proper management of crop irrigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Impact driving {{technique}} {{is commonly used}} in offshore environments to install pipe piles. This technique consists in striking the pile head with a hammer to reach the required installation depth. The quest for offshore wind energy demands that pipe pile foundations be installed in increasingly challenging geotechnical conditions. To reach final installation depth, the pile has now to be driven through very dense soil with high resistance and even into rock layers. This increases the difficulty of pile driving while avoiding its damage during hammering. The objective of this thesis is to portray stresses in a <b>pipe</b> pile during <b>driving</b> into rock layer and to assess the structural integrity of the pile toe. An analytical approach has been attempted first {{to solve the problem}} for the static case. On one hand, an original analytical solution of a pipe pile subjected to non-axial static loading has been developed based on the Airy stress function. This solution gave results approaching those of Boussinesq’s plane strain solution for the case of large diameters. On the other hand, two novel closed-form solutions for cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion in a rock mass governed by a particular case of the Hoek-Brown yield criterion were developed and validated numerically. Two numerical methods were implemented to simulate dynamic <b>pipe</b> pile <b>driving</b> into rock: the Lagrangian method consisting in an axisymmetric modelling based on the “zipper type” technique and the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian method (CEL- 3 D). Stresses in tubular piles during impact driving were evaluated, allowing the structural integrity of the pile toe to be assessed. To validate the proposed numerical models, a 1 g reduced scale model was built, featuring different synthetic rock resistances. The developed experimental model is able to simulate <b>pipe</b> pile <b>driving</b> into rock. Comparison between numerical simulations (CEL- 3 D) and experimental tests showed similar results in terms of strains at the pile toe level. Based on numerical simulations and experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The power form of the Extended Drucker-Prager yield criterion can emulate the mechanical behaviour of rock mass governed by the Hoek-Brown yield criterion. • The “zipper-type” {{technique is}} applicable to quasi-static cone penetration into dense sand and fully coring penetration of <b>pipe</b> pile undergoing <b>driving.</b> • <b>Pipe</b> pile <b>driving</b> into good quality rock mass (σc> 20 MPa) entails a significant risk of damaging the pile toe; the use of high steel grade is recommended.
