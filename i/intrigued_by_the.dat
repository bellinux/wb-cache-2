5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland, who was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> story because {{he had not seen}} many television episodes about vegetarianism. The designs for Paul and Linda McCartney are unusual for The Simpsons in that the characters have brown and blue irises, respectively. Most The Simpsons characters simply have black spots in the centers of their eyes.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} in the possibility of an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano. Having already climbed the mountain, he was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|During Murray's 1935 trip to Palestine, she {{had taken}} the {{opportunity}} to visit Petra in neighbouring Jordan. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> site, in March and April 1937 she returned in order {{to carry out a}} small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site, subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra. Back in England, from 1934 to 1940, Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at Girton College, Cambridge, and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942.|$|E

50|$|Scapin the Schemer (Les Fourberies de Scapin) is a three-act {{comedy of}} <b>intrigue</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French playwright Molière. The title {{character}} Scapin {{is similar to}} the archetypical Scapino character. The play was first staged on 24 May 1671 in the theatre of the Palais-Royal in Paris.|$|R
5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{viewpoints}} of the two. Loran's {{view was that}} Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in {{his choice of}} drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sound {{of a kind of}} drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Ape Escape lasted approximately two-and-a-half years. Shortly after the development team began conceiving {{the design and}} concept for Ape Escape, they attended a meeting regarding the {{development of}} the DualShock. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> potential of the controller, the team implemented its use in Ape Escape, making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay. Conceptualizing the controls for the controller's analog sticks was the greatest challenge for the team, and the controls underwent great testing prior to finalization.|$|E
50|$|The {{attempt to}} control the {{creation}} of human life is a dominant theme that drives various story lines. A second key theme forms around <b>the</b> <b>intrigues</b> made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dyad Group and the Proletheans, along with <b>the</b> earlier <b>intrigues</b> made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> authors of Project Leda (see the Greek myth Leda and the Swan), Mrs. S., Sarah’s foster mother, and her political network.|$|R
50|$|The Provisional Government, {{even after}} giving Kerensky dictatorial powers, {{failed to meet}} the {{challenges}} of war weariness, growing discontent among peasants and workers, and <b>intrigues</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bolsheviks. Public opinion, especially in the Army, had turned against the sacrifices for a hopeless war. The Bolsheviks proposed a revolutionary foreign policy that would immediately end the war and promote revolution across Europe.|$|R

5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|Witherspoon's second love-triangle {{movie was}} the film {{adaptation}} of the 1930s circus drama Water for Elephants. She began circus training in March 2010 {{for her role as}} Marlena, a glamorous performer stuck in a marriage to a volatile husband (Christoph Waltz) but <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> circus's new veterinarian (Robert Pattinson). The movie was filmed between late May and early August 2010 in various locations in Tennessee, Georgia, and California. It was released on April 22, 2011 and received mixed critical reviews.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E

50|$|The grave {{itself is}} the resting place of an unnamed {{individual}} who died in 1816 and was elevated to national <b>intrigue</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mysterious headstone and romanticized tale. Accounts of the stranger increase in oddity over time and help to incite further speculation as to {{the identity of the}} person buried in the grave. The reported location of the woman's death, Room 8 at Gadsby's Tavern, is also a tourist destination, and supposedly her ghostly visage can be seen standing at the window.|$|R
50|$|Thorpe was {{introduced}} {{at a young}} age by her parents to the Washington social scene and quickly became immersed in the world of diplomatic <b>intrigue.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time she was in her late teens, she had been romantically linked to foreign diplomats many years her senior. In 1936, Arthur Pack, second secretary at the British embassy in Washington, became Thorpe's choice for a husband; but in the 1930s, in the wake of two quick pregnancies and Pack's work-connected travels, the relationship became distant.|$|R
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibility of doing away {{with much of the}} complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding {{that it was a}} result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E
50|$|Further <b>intrigue</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Clan Campbell {{brought the}} {{downfall}} of the Clan Donald of Dunnyveg and by 1620 Sir James MacDonald had lost control of Islay and Kintyre. However, during the Civil War the lands were back {{in the hands of the}} MacDonalds briefly when they were supporters of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. A notable member of the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg is Alasdair Mac Colla who is famed for his victories with the Royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose during Scottish Civil War of the 1640s.|$|R
5000|$|In October-November 1991 they {{recorded}} {{their next}} album, Get Your Wah Wahs Out, with Elliot producing again. By 1992 they had signed with Shock Records' label, Shagpile Records and released the album that year. McFarlane felt {{the title was}} apt as it [...] "featured an unsettling sonic assault of wah wah and fuzzed guitar effects that was remarkably <b>intriguing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same token". In October 1993 they followed with a six-track album, Couch, produced by Darren McBain, Dave Lokan and Lizard Train; and recorded at Big Sound Studios in April.|$|R
50|$|In 1545, Paul handed over, {{from land}} once {{belonging}} to the Papal States, further territories in northern Italy to his son who took the additional title of the Duke of Parma. Paul thus established his family as an Italian ducal dynasty, a project at which the Borgia Pope Alexander VI had failed. Two years later Pier Luigi was assassinated by his new subjects under a Spanish mandate. Despite <b>intrigues</b> <b>by</b> Charles V, <b>the</b> Pope reacted promptly and soon established Ottavio, Pier Luigi's son, on the ducal throne. He secured this by marrying Ottavio (1547-86) to the eldest illegitimate daughter of Charles V, Margaret. Ottavio was given the additional title of Duke of Piacenza and initially established his court there where work was begun on a huge Farnese palace {{on the banks of}} the River Po. However, during construction, and probably in response to political <b>intrigues</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Piacentine nobility, Ottavio Farnese moved his court to Parma where he had the Palazzo della Pilotta constructed in 1583.|$|R
5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> article, Valiente wrote {{a letter}} to Williamson in 1952, who in turn put her in contact with Gardner. Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter {{eventually}} suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes ("Dafo"), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. Before she left the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, High Magic's Aid, in which he describes a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly did so in order to gauge her opinion on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E
2500|$|The 17th {{century is}} {{noted for its}} biographical [...] "mémoires".

40|$|The {{rediscovery of}} a large, mythological {{painting}} by Benedetto Luti on the New York art market in 2015, leads {{to reconsider the}} mutual connections within a group of works of the painter and allows a reflection on {{the relevance of the}} nude in the Arcadian aesthetics. Additionally, the issue is made more <b>intriguing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> provenance of the painting from a private club in San Francisco.

5|$|<b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> work of Frederick Winsor, who {{had been}} championing the {{introduction}} of gas lighting in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At {{the request of the}} Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829. A tale of star-crossed love amidst a royalist uprising in Brittany, {{it was the first}} work to which he signed his own name. Hańska was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to writing}} the story, Hergé had read Balzac et son monde ("Balzac and His World"), a 1955 book written {{by his friend}} Félicien Marceau. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> work of Honoré de Balzac, Hergé was {{inspired}} by the way in which Balzac had introduced an array of characters from his earlier work into The Human Comedy, and he subsequently adopted this trait for The Red Sea Sharks, in which a wide range of characters from The Adventures of Tintin make a reappearance. Hergé also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later reappear in Flight 714 to Sydney.|$|E
