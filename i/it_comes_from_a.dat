Packing low carbon steel parts with a {{carbonaceous}} material and heating for some time diffuses carbon into the outer layers. A heating period of a few hours might form a high-carbon layer about one millimeter thick.|$|E

25|$|Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson, {{scientists}} from Argonne National Laboratory, gave detailed {{answers to the}} conspiracists' claims on the laboratory's website. They show that NASA's portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the scientific process, any hypothesis that is contradicted by the observable facts may be rejected. The 'real landing' hypothesis is a single story since <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single source, {{but there is no}} unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classes of}} matroid have been defined from {{well-known}} families of graphs, by phrasing a characterization of these graphs {{in terms that}} make sense more generally for matroids. These include the bipartite matroids, in which every circuit is even, and the Eulerian matroids, which can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. A graphic matroid is bipartite {{if and only if}} <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bipartite graph and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if it comes from an Eulerian graph. Within the graphic matroids (and more generally within the binary matroids) these two classes are dual: a graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is Eulerian, and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.|$|E

25|$|Four {{explosion}}s {{were clearly}} detected. The fourth explosion {{was so strong}} that the stern of the Cuban ship was submerged and water came in through the hatchway of the engine room. At that time the hydrophones reported a sound similar to a liquid bubbling when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> submerged container that is suddenly opened. The sounds indicated that the U-boat had been hit. To finish the U-boat off, the patrol boat launched two more depth charges, set to explode at 250 feet. A few minutes later, a dark stain was observed {{on the surface of the}} water. A spurt of a black and viscous substance smelling like gasoline came up from the deep. Although there was little doubt that the U-boat had been sunk, Delgado was ordered to take a sample of the contaminated seawater to confirm the victory. But even then it wasn't until after the war, when the Allies seized Germany's naval records, that proof of U-176s sinking was found. According to the seized documents, U-176 was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Reiner Dierksen, had sunk eleven enemy ships in her career, and was herself sunk with all hands lost.|$|E

500|$|Maclean (1972) {{similarly}} suggests <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{corruption of}} the Old Norse name for the spring on Hirta, Childa, and states that a 1588 map identifies the archipelago as Kilda. He also speculates that {{it refers to the}} Culdees, anchorites who might have brought Christianity to the island, or be a {{corruption of the}} Gaelic name for the main island of the group, since the islanders tended to pronounce r as l, and thus habitually referred to the island as Hilta. Steel (1988) adds weight to the idea, noting that the islanders pronounced the H with a [...] "somewhat guttural quality", making the sound they used for Hirta [...] "almost" [...] Kilta. Similarly, St Kilda speakers interviewed by the School of Scottish Studies in the 1960s show individual speakers using t-initial forms, leniting to /h/, e.g. ann an Tirte (...) and gu Hirte (...)

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track [...] "Stockholm Syndrome", {{which is the first}} Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives {{eventually}} expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa. It was described by prominent music critic Robert Christgau as a [...] "simulated Neil Young ballad". The song [...] "Autumn Sweater", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while [...] "Center of Gravity" [...] has been described as [...] "a simple lo-fi devotional love song". Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, [...] "I think it's a nice, evocative title—it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> movie, but I'm not telling what movie.

2500|$|Moghadam {{traced the}} {{etymology}} {{of the word}} mate. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Persian verb mandan (...) , meaning [...] "to remain", which is cognate with the Latin word [...] and the Greek menō ( [...] , which means [...] "I remain"). It means [...] "remained" [...] {{in the sense of}} [...] "abandoned" [...] and the formal translation is [...] "surprised", in the military sense of [...] "ambushed". [...] "Shāh" [...] (...) is the Persian word for the monarch. Players would announce [...] "Shāh" [...] when the king was in check. [...] "Māt" [...] (...) is a Persian adjective for [...] "at a loss", [...] "helpless", or [...] "defeated". [...] So the king is in mate when he is ambushed, at a loss, helpless, defeated, or abandoned to his fate.|$|E
2500|$|The Geordie word , {{meaning a}} toilet {{and place of}} need and {{necessity}} for relief or bathroom, has an uncertain origin, though some have theorised that it may come from slang used by Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall, which may have later become [...] in the Romanic Italian language (such as in the Westoe Netty, {{the subject of a}} famous painting from Bob Olley). However, gabbinetto is the Modern Italian diminutive of gabbia, which actually derives from the Latin [...] ("hollow", [...] "cavity", [...] "enclosure"), the root of the loanwords that became the Modern English cave, cage, and gaol. Thus, another explanation would be that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Modern Romanic Italian form of the word , though only {{a relatively small number of}} Italians have migrated to the North of England, mostly during the 19th century.|$|E
