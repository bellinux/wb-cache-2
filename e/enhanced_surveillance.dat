On 14 January, it was reported {{there had been a}} fatality linked to the Ebola virus. The case occurred in the Tonkolili district. Prior to this case WHO had advised, [...] "we anticipate more flare-ups and must be prepared for them... massive effort is underway to ensure robust prevention, surveillance and response capacity across all three countries by the end of March." [...] On 16 January, it was reported that the woman who died of the virus may have exposed several individuals; the government announced that 100 people had been quarantined. On the same day, WHO released a statement, indicating that originally the 90-day <b>enhanced</b> <b>surveillance</b> period was to end on 5 February. Investigations indicate the female case was a student at Lunsar in Port Loko district, who had gone to Kambia district on December the 28th until returning symptomatic. Bombali district was visited by the individual, for consultation with an herbalist, later going to a government hospital in Magburaka. WHO indicates there are 109 contacts, 28 of which are high risk, furthermore, there are three missing contacts.The source or route of transmission which caused the fatality is still unknown. A second new case was confirmed on 20 January; the patient had contact with the previous fatality. On 17 March, the WHO declared the country Ebola-free.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW Molecular {{methods for}} the {{diagnosis}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are replacing bacterial culture in many settings. This review focuses on recent progress {{in the development of}} molecular tests to detect resistant N. gonorrhoeae both to <b>enhance</b> <b>surveillance</b> and to guide decisions about individual patient management. RECENT FINDINGS Assays to <b>enhance</b> <b>surveillance</b> have been developed to detect determinants of resistance for all antibiotics used as first-line gonorrhoea treatment, or to detect specific 'superbug' strains, but few have been applied in clinical practice. The most advanced strategy relevant to individual case management is to identify ciprofloxacin-sensitive strains so that unnecessary use of ceftriaxone can be avoided. Cross-reactivity with pharyngeal commensal Neisseria species reduces specificity and is a challenge for many assays. SUMMARY Progress with laboratory-based molecular tests to detect gonococcal resistance is being made but substantial challenges remain. No laboratory-based assay has been subjected to a field evaluation and no assay so far {{can be used as a}} point-of-care test. Given the threat of antimicrobial resistance, now is the time to exploit the molecular technologies used for diagnosis and to invest in the development of molecular gonococcal resistance tests that can be implemented for public health good...|$|R
