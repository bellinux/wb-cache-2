However, {{if there is}} a <b>justified</b> <b>doubt</b> that the uranium enrichment is performed with the aim to produce nuclear weapons, this certainly causes great concern. In this case, the international community can apply pressure to a certain country if it determines that the country does not want to cease activities of making its own nuclear weapons. The international community pressure on the country can be intesified until its political leadership is not made to question and cease all activities of producing nuclear weapons. This pressure can be political, economic, and as a last resort-military. As a gesture of goodwill the country can stop the uranium enrichment process. In this way, the country shows that it finally gives up the intention to produce nuclear weapons. However, when military pressure is applied, i. e. military strikes (air strikes for example) on nuclear plants used for uranium enrichment, this certainly creates a risk of releasing radioactivity into the environment. That is why the aim {{of this paper is to}} signal this very fact. Using military force in these cases leads to additional radioactive contamination of the environment, so this way of solving conflicts should be avoided within the international community...|$|E

Comments, additions and corrections are welcome and should be sent to boerger@di. unipi. it and huggins@acm. org 1. Hartmut Ehrig asked the first author to write for this column what are the distinguishing features of the ASM approach to specification and verification of complex computing systems. In [21] an attempt had already been made to answer that question by discussing, in general comparative terms, some specific features which are characteristic for the ASM approach with respect to other well known approaches in the literature. That explanation seems to have been understood, as shown by the many positive reactions, but even more the numerous critical reactions of colleagues in the field who felt—rightly—that ASMs put <b>justified</b> <b>doubt</b> on cherished denotational, declarative, logical, functional and similar widespread beliefs in pure, i. e. not operational methods.

40|$|With {{an intent}} to attain {{security}} for claim the Polish Code of Civil Procedure provides {{a possibility of}} issuing legal decisions called provisional court orders. According to the regulation of the section 730 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter called the ccp) the provisional court order can be issued whenever there is a <b>justified</b> <b>doubt</b> arises that the creditor's claim cannot be satisfied or there is a fear, {{on the side of}} the creditor, of other legal effects of the court's final decision. Apart from the above regulation the Polish ccp in the section 443 provides for special rulings of a provisional character in the course of divorce litigation. These are designed for settlement of relations between husband and wife pending the action. The Polish doctrine has not settled whether the rulings within the meaning of section 443 of the ccp belong to a group of provisional court orders or they constitute a separate category of court decisions. In order to solve this question the author compares objectives of giving respective decisions, conditions (grounds) of their issuing, the scope and stability of findings, the course of proceedings to take evidence and other matters of procedure. Upon ascertainment of the existence of substantial differences, the author concludes that provisional court orders and rulings within the meaning of the section 443 of the ccp are in fact two distinct types of court decision.

40|$|In {{this review}} the PAST, PRESENT and PROSPECT will be {{considered}} as three separate periods {{in the history of}} the breeding and development of rose cultivars. The recurring theme is the genetic variation. This theme was chosen because there is <b>justified</b> <b>doubt</b> as to sufficient genetic variation available among current progenitors to ascertain the vitality and productivity of future cultivars in cross-breeding. This seems particularly true for glasshouse cultivars. The above three periods are defined as follows. PAST: the era from pre-history until about the year 1875, the PRESENT era from about 1875 until 1967, and the PROSPECT (future) from 1967 onwards. With probably over 5000 years, the PAST covers the longest time lapse. It ended around the year 1875, with the discovery of aimed cross-breeding. Not accidentally, Mendel published his famous laws about inheritance about simultaneously. It is remarkable that many rose breeders still like to think in terms of Mendelian or qualitative inheritance. Quantitative inheritance or additive gene action, seems either little known or not used. The PRESENT period started with the knowledge about aimed cross-breeding, and ended with the introduction of biotechnology in rose breeding in 1967. This period has covered about 90 years only. The PROSPECT, which in fact is the FUTURE era, has already begun in 1967, and is about 28 years on the way. To start with, the breeding and genetic variation occurring in the PAST period {{will be considered}}. It is assumed that early horticulturists sampled desirable rose species from the wild and planted them in collections. According to Wiley (1955) and Krussmann (1987), several species and most likely cultivars of them too, were grown in gardens in China, Persia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and in Italy, long before the beginning of the Christian era. It is uncertain, however, whether all the roses of ancient horticulture were seedlings, or that certain strains were already vegetatively propagated. A fact is, that during this whole period, new cultivars exclusively arose by sowing the seeds that resulted from open-pollination. Particularly in the beginning, domestication of species and their probable inter-specific hybrids supposedly was a slow process. However, as unsuitable primitive forms were discarded and propagation methods improved, progress towards tame forms was more rapid. Introduction of new genotypes and exchange of species and cultivars by travellers, considerably broadened the genetic variation available to horticulturists. It should be noted, by the way, that domestication of a species, any species in fact, necessarily involves a narrowing of the genetic variation available. In a few cases only, early breeders kept record of the female parent and the year of introduction of a new cultivar. These records, however, have enabled to ascertain part of the descent of later cultivars Although it was instinctively felt that neighbouring plants in collections had a relation to the new forms obtained, breeders did not yet realize that characters of the male parent could be turned over by pollination. Afterwards, it was established that from initially mainly diploid, gradually new cultivars were and later tetraploids. Particularly nowadays, important cultivars are almost exclusively tetraploid. Modern research demonstrated that in crossing diploid an...|$|E

Some publications contain no statement whether such pH adjustment was performed, or about the prevailing pH value during the test. The corresponding test results are, therefore, not meaningful and were not considered.

40|$|Einstein’s {{critique}} of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was based fully on logical and philosophical arguments, while this interpretation seemed to be strongly supported by von Neumann who argued that any local (or hidden-variable) theory is not admissible by the quantummechanical mathematical model. However, his statement was not true as shown convincingly by J. Bell in 1964; an unphysical assumption was involved in von Neumann’s approach. After modifying the corresponding axiomatic basis Bell derived some inequalitities, which was believed to hold {{for any kind of}} local (hidden-variable) theories applied to EPR experiments in Bohm’s modification (coincidence measurement of spin orientations). These inequalities were then violated by experimental data, which was interpreted mostly as an important support of the Copenhagen interpretation. However, Einsteins objections were not removed, and thus the question has remained: Do the assumptions involved in Bell’s approach cover really all possible hidden-variable theories or not?

This worldview emphatically acknowledges an impenetrable region of “unknowable”: we cannot know where and when opportunities exist or whether they can be actualized by any given agent. Davidsson is, therefore, <b>justified</b> to <b>doubt</b> that the propensity conceptualization can facilitate the production of predictive knowledge involving the causal interaction between empirically tractable entities with events of “action” and “success”.

This latter body did not long survive its founder, at least as a veritable communism, by reason of the insurgent individualism of its vigorous sons.

Moreover, in a note, he positively exhibits an acquaintance, in addition, with the works of Bishop Wordsworth and of Archbishop Trench; and even shows that he has read Hudson's commentary on Josephus. And yet people say that our Biblical critics do not equal the Germans in research! But Mr. Gladstone's citation of Cuvier and Sir John Herschel about the Creation myth, and his ignorance of all the best modern writings on his own side, produced a great impression on my mind.

However unwillingly, I have felt bound to consider the possibility that Mr. Gladstone's labours in this matter may have carried him no further than Josephus and the worthy, but somewhat antique, episcopal and other authorities to whom he refers; that even his reading of Josephus may have been of the most cursory nature, directed not to the understanding of his author, but to the discovery of useful controversial matter; and that, in view of the not inconsiderable misrepresentation of my statements to which I have drawn attention, it might be that Mr. Gladstone's exposition of the evidence of Josephus was not more trustworthy.

In the latter, there is a gradual ascent from the simplest forms of conversation to the language of impassioned intellect,—yet the intellect still remaining the seat of passion: in the former, the invocation is at once made to the imagination and the emotions connected therewith. Hence the movement throughout is the most rapid of all Shakespeare’s plays; and hence also, {{with the exception of the}} disgusting passage of the Porter (Act ii. sc. 3), which I dare pledge myself to demonstrate to be an interpolation of the actors, there is not, to the best of my remembrance, a single pun or play on words in the whole drama. I have previously given an answer to the thousand times repeated charge against Shakespeare upon the subject of his punning, and I here merely mention the fact of the absence of any puns in Macbeth, as <b>justifying</b> a candid <b>doubt,</b> at least, whether even in these figures of speech and fanciful modifications of language, Shakespeare may not have followed rules and principles that merit and would stand the test of philosophic examination. And hence, also, there is an entire absence of comedy, nay, even of irony and philosophic contemplation in Macbeth,—the play being wholly and purely tragic. For the same cause, there are no reasonings of equivocal morality, which would have required a more leisurely state and a consequently greater activity of mind;—no sophistry of self-delusion,—except only that previously to the dreadful act, Macbeth mistranslates the recoilings and ominous whispers of conscience into prudential and selfish reasonings; and, after the deed done, the terrors of remorse into fear from external dangers,—like delirious men who run away from the phantoms of their own brains, or, raised by terror to rage, stab the real object that is within their reach:—whilst Lady Macbeth merely endeavours to reconcile his and her own sinkings of heart by anticipations of the worst, and an affected bravado in confronting them. In all the rest, Macbeth’s language is the grave utterance of the very heart, conscience-sick, even to the last faintings of moral death. It is the same in all the other characters. The variety arises from rage, caused ever and anon by disruption of anxious thought, and the quick transition of fear into it.|$|R

If it could be proved that the man had bought this weapon, or even such a weapon, in Paris then,--so said all the police authorities,--it might be worth while to make an attempt to hang him. Men very skilful in unravelling such mysteries were sent to Paris, and the police of that capital entered upon the search with most praiseworthy zeal. But the number of life-preservers which had been sold altogether baffled them. It seemed that nothing was so common as that gentlemen should walk about with bludgeons in their pockets covered with leathern thongs. A young woman and an old man who thought that they could recollect something of a special sale were brought over,--and saw the splendour of London under very favourable circumstances;--but when confronted with Mr. Emilius, neither could venture to identify him.

The blows from the bludgeon could be counted. The very moment in which they had been struck had been ascertained. His very act in hurling the weapon over the wall was all but seen. And yet nothing could be done. [...] "It is a very dangerous thing hanging a man on circumstantial evidence," [...] said Sir Gregory Grogram, who, a couple of months since, had felt almost sure that his honourable friend Phineas Finn would have to be hung on circumstantial evidence. The police and magistrates and lawyers all agreed that it would be useless, and indeed wrong, to send the case before a jury. But there had been quite sufficient evidence against Phineas Finn! ...|$|R
