5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the <b>electromagnetic</b> field including <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the <b>electromagnetic</b> force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves {{at the speed of light}} within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile <b>electromagnetic</b> theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome. Through {{the work of}} leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to <b>electromagnetic</b> theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all <b>electromagnetic</b> phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the <b>electromagnetic</b> force.|$|E
5|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect. Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation is {{a tiny fraction of the}} total energy released during the event.|$|E
5|$|During the quark epoch of {{the early}} universe, the electroweak force {{separated}} into the <b>electromagnetic</b> and weak forces.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing <b>electromagnetic</b> transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron. In the <b>electromagnetic</b> process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an <b>electromagnetic</b> separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|February 18: Construction begins for Y-12, {{a massive}} <b>electromagnetic</b> {{separation}} plant for enriching uranium at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation, {{a few other}} events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to radio-based methods, some projects, such as SEVENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) at the University of California, Berkeley, are using {{other regions of}} the <b>electromagnetic</b> spectrum to search for extraterrestrial signals. Various other projects are not searching for coherent signals, but want to rather use <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation to find other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, such as megascale astroengineering projects.|$|E
5|$|In modern quantum physics, the <b>electromagnetic</b> {{field is}} {{described}} by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this theory, light {{is described by}} the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the <b>electromagnetic</b> field, called photons. In QED, photons are massless particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel {{at the speed of}} light in vacuum.|$|E
5|$|It has {{not been}} shown that long term {{exposure}} to <b>electromagnetic</b> fields is harmful to human health, but it is recommended to avoid subjects who are pregnant or who utilize pacemakers. Guidelines place the limit for safe continuous exposure between 100μT and 200μT. The field and frequencies output by <b>electromagnetic</b> articulographs are comparable to those put out by computer terminals with the maximum measured being about 10μT.|$|E
5|$|Members of the British mission {{occupied}} {{several key}} {{positions in the}} <b>electromagnetic</b> project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of}} the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for the <b>electromagnetic</b> project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending to policy questions such as whether to expand the <b>electromagnetic</b> plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to the <b>electromagnetic</b> project, both in Berkeley and at the Y-12 <b>electromagnetic</b> separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.|$|E
5|$|Our {{main source}} of {{information}} about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light more generally <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation. Observational astronomy may be divided according to the observed region of the <b>electromagnetic</b> spectrum. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.|$|E
5|$|Photons inside superconductors do {{develop a}} nonzero {{effective}} rest mass; as a result, <b>electromagnetic</b> forces become short-range inside superconductors.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, the <b>electromagnetic</b> {{nature of}} light was {{demonstrated}} by the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Should {{evidence}} for extraterrestrial intelligence {{take the form}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> signals, the Secretary-General of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) should be contacted, and may request in the next ITU Weekly Circular to minimize terrestrial use of the <b>electromagnetic</b> frequency bands in which the signal was detected.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods for}} observing the {{absorption}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation in the visible spectrum were known {{as early as the}} 1860s.|$|E
5|$|The Universe is {{composed}} almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter. Other contents are <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation (estimated {{to be from}} 0.005% to close to 0.01%) and antimatter. The total amount of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation generated within the universe has decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the pressure of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of observations made using <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation, neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information, {{is known as}} multi-messenger astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>electromagnetic</b> field can be {{understood}} as a gauge field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the <b>electromagnetic</b> field, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this <b>electromagnetic</b> force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the <b>electromagnetic</b> force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling <b>electromagnetic</b> force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy of}} an emitted photon is {{proportional}} to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the <b>electromagnetic</b> spectrum. Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the <b>electromagnetic</b> interactions between the electrons and other factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{left-hand}} side {{is like the}} original Dirac equation, and the right-hand side is the interaction with the <b>electromagnetic</b> field.|$|E
5|$|Under Lorentz boosts {{they behave}} differently, {{showing that the}} two vectors aren't {{separate}} physical objects. The electric and magnetic components mix. See the illustration on the right. The <b>electromagnetic</b> field tensor displays the manifestly covariant mathematical structure of the <b>electromagnetic</b> field. It has six independent components at an event.|$|E
5|$|Various {{diagnostic}} techniques preceded <b>electromagnetic</b> articulography.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} X-rays in 1895, just as {{the studies}} of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain {{of the nature of}} X-rays, but soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation, in other words, another form of light. At that time, the wave model of light—specifically, the Maxwell theory of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation—was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with <b>electromagnetic</b> waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in the laboratory of Arnold Sommerfeld suggested that X-rays had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. However, X-rays are composed of photons, and thus are not only waves of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation but also exhibit particle-like properties. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of X-rays from electrons. Therefore, these particle-like properties of X-rays, such as their ionization of gases, caused William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that X-rays were not <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation. Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed for most scientists that X-rays were a form of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation.|$|E
5|$|According to Baum, even if an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization were {{to communicate}} using <b>electromagnetic</b> signals alone, it could send humanity information with which humans themselves could create lethal biological weapons.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The <b>electromagnetic</b> force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the <b>electromagnetic</b> force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of <b>electromagnetic</b> forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an <b>electromagnetic</b> field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, <b>electromagnetic</b> and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. <b>Electromagnetic</b> fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of <b>electromagnetic</b> fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an <b>electromagnetic</b> wave. <b>Electromagnetic</b> waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit <b>electromagnetic</b> radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, a programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>electro{{magnetic}}</b> process, {{a magnetic}} field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an <b>electromagnetic</b> separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build.
