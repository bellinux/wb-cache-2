40|$|CIVINSA {{simulated}} {{tracer study}} is {{performed on the}} Alamitos <b>Groundwater</b> <b>Barrier</b> Project (ABP), Los Angeles, California. The ABP consists of 43 injection wells that create a freshwater barrier to prevent intrusion of seawater into the coastal aquifer of southern Los Angeles County. The injection wells currently use a blend of recycled and imported water. Regional water quality regulations dictate the quantity of recycled water that can be injected into the aquifer. The regulations also require that the travel-time between the injection wells and the local production wells be greater than one year. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the travel time of injected water into the ABP. A previously calibrated three-dimensional, finite element, coupled groundwater flow and transport model is used to simulate the movement of a conservative tracer in the Alamitos Barrier Project. The results of the simulations show that tracer travel times between the injection wells and the production wells typically exceed 60 years. The model results exhibit a high amount of numerical error when large time steps are used. Time-step sensitivity analysis indicates that a time step of one day or less will minimize model error. Further analysis of local head boundary conditions is recommended in order to provide a wider range of tracer travel times given variations in boundary hydraulic head levels. U. S.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of small dams often requires the reduction or control of groundwater seepage through or under earthen dams. The slurry trench method {{is well known}} for creating impermeable <b>groundwater</b> <b>barriers</b> and has been used for decades to create economical and positive cutoff walls in the core or foundation soils beneath dams and dikes of many types and sizes. This paper examines three innovative modifications of the slurry trench method and their applications in the {{rehabilitation of}} three small dams. Case histories of each dam and slurry trench method are described. The slurry trench technique uses an engineered fluid for support of trench walls. Usually the fluid is bentonite slurry that coats the trench walls and permanently blocks the free flow of water. If, however, the fluid is degradable, a permeable backfill, such as sand or gravel can be backfilled in the trench to create a permeable zone such as a toe drain or chimney drain. This method is known as the bio-polymer trench drain method and has been used {{for more than a decade}} in the waste remediation industry to collect contaminated groundwater, and more recently in the rehabilitation of dams.

40|$|A multi-proxy {{approach}} study (cladocerans, diatoms, geochemistry, plant macrofossils, pollen), {{was performed}} on a sediment core from Lake Vrana (Vransko Jezero), a large and deep karstic lake on the northern Adriatic island of Cres, Croatia. Considerable lake-level changes occurred during the last approx. 16, 000 years. The stratigraphic evidence suggests that periods of enhanced precipitation and the post-LGM rise in sea level were the main driving forces. The lake records indicate early human impacts. Sediment echo-sounding indicated that > 25 m of lake sediments lies within the site, from which 5 m have been cored. Shallow lake stages occurred from 14. 4 14 C ky BP to early Holocene. Prior to Alleröd, interglacial sediments were redeposited, reflecting the influences of rising sea-level (forming a local <b>groundwater</b> <b>barrier),</b> a temporary increase in precipitation, and lake-level changes. There {{appears to be a}} hiatus in the sequence, for no sediments assignable to the Alleröd chronozone could be found. A discordance in the echo profile at the appropriate horizon in the sequence supports this interpretation. Groundwater level increased again at 10. 6 ky BP (during Younger Dryas chronozone), a swamp vegetation formed, which gave way to a shallow lake. During the Preboreal chronozone, this freshwater lake persisted with fluctuating levels. The establishment and subsequent persistence of the present deep water lake at about 8. 5 ky BP, correspond with findings of a pluvial period at the Dalmatian coast, which lasted from 8. 4 to 6 ky BP. First human catchment disturbances were related to settlements of Neolithic or Bronze Age. The increase in summer drought, coupled with forest clearance during Illyrian times, are assumed to be responsible for the change towards present evergreen oak vegetation in the lake catchment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether 222 Rn in groundwater can be used as a tracer for LNAPL quantification at a field site treated by dual-phase LNAPL removal. After the break of a pipeline, five hectares of soil in the nature reserve Coussouls de Crau in southern France were contaminated by 5, 100 m 3 of crude oil. Part of this oil seeped into the underlying gravel aquifer and formed a floating oil body on > 3 hectares. The remediation consists in plume management by hydraulic <b>groundwater</b> <b>barriers</b> with re-injection of treated waters, and LNAPL extraction in the source zone. 222 Rn measurements were performed in 21 wells in and outside the source zone over more than 15 months. In pristine groundwater, the radon activity was relatively constant and remained always > 11 Bq L- 1. The radon activities in the groundwater of source zone wells were not more variable, but the mean activities were generally significantly lower than upgradient, due to partitioning of 222 Rn into the oil phase. The lowest activities were found in zones with high NAPL recovery efficiency. LNAPL saturations around each recovery well were furthermore calculated during a period of high groundwater level, using a laboratory-determined crude oil-water partitioning coefficient of 38. 5 ± 2. 9. This yielded an estimated volume of residual crude oil of 465 ± 139 m 3 below the capillary fringe.

Acid mine drainage (AMD) can have severe impacts on aquatic resources, can stunt terrestrial plant growth and harm wetlands, contaminate groundwater, raise water treatment costs, and damage concrete and metal structures. Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are one of the passive treatment technologies widely accepted for sustainable in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater and may be used in the management of localised seepage plumes from mine residues that contaminate shallow <b>groundwater.</b> These <b>barriers</b> provide chemical interactions with AMD as the polluted water flows through it. The ability of PRBs to remediate contaminants is dependent on the type of reactive material used. Some of the reactive media remove contaminants through physical contact while others work by altering the biogeochemical processes in the treatment zone, thus providing conditions conducive for contaminant immobilization or (bio) degradation. A variety of materials has been employed to remove contaminants including heavy metals, chlorinated solvents, aromatic hydrocarbons, and pesticides.

40|$|Cerro Prieto is {{the oldest}} and largest Mexican {{geothermal}} field in operation and has been producing electricity since 1973. The large amount of geothermal fluids extracted to supply steam to the power plants has resulted in considerable deformation {{in and around the}} field. The deformation includes land subsidence and related ground fissuring and faulting. These phenomena have produced severe damages to infrastructure such as roads, irrigation canals and other facilities. In this paper, the technique of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) is applied using C-band ENVISAR ASAR data acquired between 2003 and 2006 to determine the extent and amount of land subsidence in the Mexicali Valley near Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field. The DInSAR results were compared with published data from precise leveling surveys (1994 - 1997 and 1997 - 2006) and detailed geological information in order to improve the understanding of temporal and spatial distributions of anthropogenic subsidence in the Mexicali Valley. The leveling and DInSAR data were modeled to characterize the observed deformation in terms of fluid extraction. The results confirm that the tectonic faults control the spatial extent of the observed subsidence. These faults likely act as <b>groundwater</b> flow <b>barriers</b> for aquifers and reservoirs.

Due to the nonlinear nature and chemical complexity of the problem, in most cases, it is impossible to verify reactive transport codes analytically, and code intercomparisons are the most suitable method to assess code capabilities and model performance. This paper summarizes model intercomparisons for six hypothetical scenarios with generally increasing geochemical or physical complexity using the reactive transport codes CrunchFlow, HP 1, MIN 3 P, PFlotran, and TOUGHREACT. Benchmark problems include the enhancement of porosity and permeability through mineral dissolution, as well as near complete clogging due to localized mineral precipitation, leading to reduction of permeability and tortuosity. Processes considered in the benchmark simulations are advective-dispersive transport in saturated media, kinetically controlled mineral dissolution-precipitation, and aqueous complexation. Porosity changes are induced by mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions, and the Carman-Kozeny relationship is used to describe changes in permeability as a function of porosity. Archie’s law is used to update the tortuosity and the pore diffusion coefficient as a function of porosity. Results demonstrate that, generally, good agreement is reached amongst the computer models despite significant differences in model formulations. Some differences are observed, in particular for the more complex scenarios involving clogging; however, these differences do not affect the interpretation of system behavior and evolution...|$|R

In a series of laboratory studies, we have determined {{the effectiveness of this}} barrier at destroying nitrate and perchlorate in groundwater from Mortandad Canyon at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This groundwater was obtained from a monitoring well, MCO- 5, which is located in the flowpath of the discharge waters from the LANL Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility (RLWTF). Water with elevated nitrate levels has been discharged from this plant for many years, until recently when the nitrate levels have been brought under the discharge limits. However, the historical discharge has resulted in a nitrate plume in the alluvial groundwater in this canyon.

In the southern and central part of the barrier no interaction of groundwater with lagoon water was observed. In the northern part, however, lagoon water intrusion into the barrier was identified. This effect is apparently caused by different vegetation types on the barrier influencing subsurface hydrological processes. The central and the southern areas are characterised by natural dune vegetation (high infiltration, low evapotranspiration rates) whereas the northern part is covered by extensive pine tree plantations (low infiltration, high evapotranspiration rates).

The YF hydraulic conductivity is four orders of magnitude below that of the surrounding Judea Group rocks, and only a limited volume of water can leak through the fault.

40|$|Shallow {{tunneling}} {{may encounter}} {{a number of}} problems, {{the most important of}} which is high water inflows in transmissive areas that are often associated with fractures or discontinuities. Moreover, research into shallow tunneling may be limited by the duration and cost of the civil engineering works. Two important aspects that are often overlooked are: variable groundwater behavior of faults (conduit, barrier, conduit-barrier), and role of groundwater connectivity between fractures that cross the tunnel {{and the rest of the}} rock massif. These two aspects should be taken into account in the geological and groundwater characterization to correct the tunnel design and minimize hazards.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of using a}} sub-surface lime-fly ash barrier to reduce the oxidation of a pyritic soil layer and to improve groundwater and surface water quality was investigated for land affected by acid sulphate soils near Berry in southeastern NSW, Australia. Prior to {{the installation of the}} lime-fly ash <b>barrier,</b> <b>groundwater</b> and surface water analyses indicated a highly acidic environment. High concentrations of dissolved aluminium, total iron and sulphate in the groundwater were a result of falling groundwater tables and biotic oxidation. Traditional management techniques of ground water manipulation, via floodgates or weirs, would be rendered ineffective in arresting biotic oxidation where the pyrite layer is submerged. The study combined field and laboratory analysis {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of the lime-fly ash barrier at the study site. A comprehensive field study incorporated the installation of piezometers and observation wells to determine the level of the phreatic surface along with the monitoring of water quality parameters at the site of the lime-fly ash barrier, and also floodgate sites and the site of the self-regulating tilting weir. The installation of the lime-fly ash barrier was undertaken by the pumping of a slurry through boreholes via pressure pumping. The subsurface lime-fly ash barrier, as an acid sulphate soil remediation technique, was shown to significantly improve groundwater quality. Groundwater pH increased to values between 4. 5 and 5. 5. The concentration of the pyritic oxidation products, acidic cations Al³+ and Fetotal, basic cations Ca²+ and Mg²+ and anions Cl- and SO 4 ² -, also, on average decreased in the groundwater after the installation of the lime-fly ash barrier. A comparison between the average roundwater table elevations before and after the installation of the barrier also indicated a perched water table, which would reduce the exposure of pyritic soil to oxygen, and in turn reduce pyritic oxidation and the generation of acidic products. The Lime-fly ash barrier is effective in remediating acid sulphate soils in areas in which floodgates and weirs cannot be installed. A comparison of the result shows that the lime-fly ash barrier had greater success in increasing the groundwater pH than the self-regulating tilting weir. The lime-fly ash barrier treats acid sulphate soils and the related environmental problems before they occur, whereas, the floodgates treat the pyrite oxidation products generated after they have been discharged into the flood mitigation drains. Significantly greater concentrations of Al³+, Fetotal and SO 4 ²- were found in the groundwater at the floodgate sites...|$|R
40|$|This report briefly reviews issues {{regarding}} {{the implementation of}} the zero-valent iron permeable reactive barrier (PRB) technology at sites managed by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). Initially, the PRB technology, using zero-valent iron for the reactive media, was received with great enthusiasm, and DOE invested millions of dollars testing and implementing PRBs. Recently, a negative perception of the technology has been building. This perception is based on the failure of some deployments to satisfy goals for treatment and operating expenses. The purpose of this report, therefore, is to suggest reasons for the problems that have been encountered and to recommend whether DOE should invest in additional research and deployments. The principal conclusion of this review is that the most significant problems have been the result of insufficient characterization, which resulted in poor engineering implementation. Although there are legitimate concerns regarding the longevity of the reactive media, the ability of zero-valent iron to reduce certain chlorinated hydrocarbons and to immobilize certain metals and radionuclides is well documented. The primary problem encountered at some DOE full-scale deployments has been an inadequate assessment of site hydrology, which resulted in misapplication of the technology. The result is PRBs with higher than expected flow velocities and/or incomplete plume capture. A review of the literature reveals that cautions regarding subsurface heterogeneity were published several years prior to the full-scale implementations. Nevertheless, design and construction have typically been undertaken as if the subsurface was homogeneous. More recently published literature has demonstrated that hydraulic heterogeneity can cause so much uncertainty in performance that use of a passive PRB is precluded. Thus, the primary conclusion of this review is that more attention must be given to site-specific issues. Indeed, the use of a passive PRB requires an unusually comprehensive hydrologic characterization so that the design can be based on a thorough understanding of subsurface heterogeneity rather than on average values for hydraulic parameters. Scientists and engineers are capable of conducting the level of investigation required. However, design costs will increase, and the pre-design field work may demonstrate that a passive PRB is not suitable for a particular site. In such cases, an option to consider is hydraulic augmentation, such as pumping (in which the system is no longer passive) or gravity flow from drains. In these circumstances, operation of the treatment media is under known hydraulic conditions. These systems typically contain the treatment media in a vault or in drums. Most of the media problems in such systems have been related to the exclusion of air and can be addressed by better engineering design or by frequent maintenance. Finally, a number of outstanding issues require resolution for further application of this technology. Of particular interest to DOE is resolving the removal mechanisms for uranium and technetium. Few data are available for the latter, and for the former, the technical literature is contradictory. Determining the mechanisms has long-term cost implications; engineers must consider whether it is appropriate to remove or simply abandon a barrier that is no longer functioning. Other issues that are unresolved include determining how hydraulic performance is affected by the emplacement method and quantifying the effects of varying <b>groundwater</b> types on <b>barrier</b> longevity...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project was to develop {{reactive}} membrane barriers [...] a new and flexible technique to contain and stabilize subsurface contaminants. Polymer membranes will leak once a contaminant is able to diffuse through the membrane. By incorporating a reactive material in the polymer, however, the contaminant is degraded or immobilized within the membrane. These processes increase the time for contaminants to breakthrough the barrier (i. e. the lag time) and can dramatically extend barrier lifetimes. In this work, reactive barrier membranes containing zero-valent iron (Fe{sup 0 }) or crystalline silicotitanate (CST) were developed to prevent the migration of chlorinated solvents and cesium- 137, respectively. These studies were complemented {{by the development of}} models quantifying the leakage/kill time of reactive membranes and describing the behavior of products produced via the reactions within the membranes. First, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) membranes containing Fe{sup 0 } and CST were prepared and tested. Although PVA is not useful in practical applications, it allows experiments to be performed rapidly and the results to be compared to theory. For copper ions (Cu{sup 2 +}) and carbon tetrachloride, the barrier was effective, increasing the time to breakthrough over 300 times. Even better performance was expected, and the percentage of the iron used in the reaction with the contaminants was determined. For cesium, the CST laden membranes increased lag times more than 30 times, and performed better than theoretical predictions. A modified theory was developed for ion exchangers in reactive membranes to explain this result. With the PVA membranes, the effect of a <b>groundwater</b> matrix on <b>barrier</b> performance was tested. Using Hanford groundwater, the performance of Fe{sup 0 } barriers decreased compared to solutions containing a pH buffer and high levels of chloride (both of which promote iron reactivity). For the CST bearing membrane, performance improved by a factor of three when groundwater was used in place of deionized water. The performance of high density polyethylene (HDPE) membranes containing Fe{sup 0 } was then evaluating using carbon tetrachloride as the target contaminant. Only with a hydrophilic additive (glycerol), was the iron able to extend lag times. Lag times were increased by a factor of 15, but only 2 - 3 % of the iron was used, likely due to formation of oxide precipitates on the iron surface, which slowed the reaction. With thicker membranes and lower carbon tetrachloride concentrations, it is expected that performance will improve. Previous models for reactive membranes were also extended. The lag time is a measurement of when the barrier is breached, but contaminants do slowly leak through prior to the lag time. Thus, two parameters, the leakage and the kill time, were developed to determine when a certain amount of pollutant has escaped (the kill time) or when a given exposure (concentration x time) occurs (the leakage). Finally, a model was developed to explain the behavior of mobile reaction products in reactive barrier membranes. Although the goal of the technology is to avoid such products, {{it is important to be}} able to predict how these products will behave. Interestingly, calculations show that for any mobile reaction products, one half of the mass will diffuse into the containment area and one half will escape, assuming that the volumes of the containment area and the surrounding environment are much larger than the barrier membrane. These parameters/models will aid in the effective design of barrier membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural and}} {{engineered}} system at Yucca Mountain (YM) defines the site-specific {{conditions under which}} one must determine {{to what extent the}} engineered and the natural geochemical barriers will prevent the release of radioactive material from the repository. Most important mechanisms for retention or enhancement of radionuclide transport include precipitation or co-precipitation of radionuclide-bearing solid phases (solubility limits), complexation in solution, sorption onto surfaces, colloid formation, and diffusion. There may be many scenarios that could affect the near-field environment, creating chemical conditions more aggressive than the conditions presented by the unperturbed system (such as pH changes beyond the range of 6 to 9 or significant changes in the ionic strength of infiltrated waters). For an extended period of time, the near-field water composition may be quite different and more extreme in pH, ionic strength, and CO{sub 2 } partial pressure (or carbonate concentration) than waters at some distance from the repository. Reducing conditions, high pH (up to 11), and low carbonate concentration may be present in the near-field after reaction of infiltrating <b>groundwater</b> with engineered <b>barrier</b> systems, such as cementitious materials. In the far-field, conditions are controlled by the rock-mass buffer providing a near-neutral, oxidizing, low-ionic-strength environment that controls radionuclide solubility limits and sorption capacities. There is the need for characterization of variable chemical conditions that affect solubility, speciation, and sorption reactions. Modeling of the groundwater chemistry is required and leads to an understanding of solubility and speciation of the important radionuclides. Because experimental studies cannot be performed under the numerous potential chemical conditions, solubility limitations must rely on geochemical modeling of the radionuclide's chemistry. Fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as solubility products, complex stability constants, and redox potentials for radionuclides in different oxidation states, form the underlying database to be used for those calculations. The potentially low solubilities of many radionuclides in natural waters constitute the first barrier for their migration from the repository into the environment. Evaluation of this effect requires a knowledge of the site-specific water chemistry and the expected spatial and temporal ranges of its variability. Quantitative determinations of radionuclide solubility in waters within the range of chemistry must be made. Speciation and molecular complexation must be ascertained to interpret and apply solubility results. The solubilities thus determined can be used to assess the effectiveness of solubility in limiting radionuclide migration. These solubilities {{can also be used to}} evaluate the effectiveness of other retardation processes expected to occur once dissolution of the source material and migration begin. Understanding the solubility behavior of radionuclides will assist in designing valuable sorption experiments that must be conducted below the solubility limit since only soluble species participate in surface reactions and sorption processes. The present strategy for radionuclide solubility tasks has been to provide a solubility model from bulk-experiments that attempt to bracket the estimate made for this Analysis and Modeling Report (AMR) of water conditions on site. The long-term goal must be to develop a thermodynamic database for solution speciation and solid-state determination as a prerequisite for transport calculations and interpretation of empirical solubility data. The model has to be self-consistent and tested against known solubility studies in order to predict radionuclide solubilities over the continuous distribution ranges of potential water compositions for performance assessment of the site. Solubility studies upper limits for radionuclide concentrations in natural waters. The concentration in the aqueous phase is controlled by the radionuclide-bearing solid phase and by the complexation reactions with ligands present in solution. Meaningful and acceptable thermodynamic data resulting from solubility and speciation data should meet the following criteria: (1) Approach to equilibrium from both under- and over-saturation; (2) Accurate determinations of solution concentrations; (3) Well-characterized solubility controlling solid phase; and (4) Knowledge of the nature (oxidation state, coordination environment) of the species involved in the equilibrium reactions under consideration...|$|R
