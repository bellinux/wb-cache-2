I {{had thought}} that, by this time, {{we had done}} with that stale, second-hand, one-sided, and {{misunderstood}} saying of Raffaelle's; or that at least, {{in these days of}} purer Christian light, men might have begun to get some insight into the meaning of it: Raffaelle was a painter of humanity, and assuredly there is something the matter with humanity, a few dovrebbe's, more or less, wanting in it. We have most of us heard of original sin, and may perhaps, in our modest moments, conjecture that we are not quite what God, or nature, would have us to be. Raffaelle had something to mend in Humanity: I should have liked to have seen him mending a daisy!--or a pease-blossom, or a moth, or a mustard seed, or any other of God's slightest works. If he had accomplished that, one might have found for him more respectable employment,--to set the stars in better order, perhaps (they seem grievously scattered as they are, and to be of all manner of shapes and sizes,--except the ideal shape, and the proper size); or to give us a corrected view of the ocean; that, at least, seems a very irregular and improveable thing; the very fishermen do not know, this day, how far it will reach, driven up before the west wind:--perhaps Some One else does, but that is not our business. Let us go down and stand by the beach of it,--of the great <b>irregular</b> <b>sea,</b> and count whether the thunder of it is not out of time. One,--two:--here comes a well-formed wave at last, trembling a little at the top, but, on the whole, orderly. So, crash among the shingle, and up as far as this grey pebble; now stand by and watch! Another:--Ah, careless wave! why couldn't you have kept your crest on? it is all gone away into spray, striking up against the cliffs there--I thought as much--missed the mark by a couple of feet! Another:--How now, impatient one! couldn't you have waited till your friend's reflux was done with, instead of rolling yourself up with it in that unseemly manner? You go for nothing. A fourth, and a goodly one at last. What think we of yonder slow rise, and crystalline hollow, without a flaw? Steady, good wave; not so fast; not so fast; where are you coming to?--By our architectural word, this is too bad; two yards over the mark, and ever so much of you in our face besides; and a wave which we had some hope of, behind there, broken all to pieces out at sea, and laying a great white table-cloth of foam {{all the way to the}} shore, as if the marine gods were to dine off it! Alas, for these unhappy arrow shots of Nature; she will never hit her mark with those unruly waves of hers, nor get one of them, into the ideal shape, if we wait for a thousand years. Let us send for a Greek architect to do it for her. He comes--the great Greek architect, with measure and rule. Will he not also make the weight for the winds? and weigh out the waters by measure? and make a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder?

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method of {{controlling}} wave energy converters (WECs) in <b>irregular</b> <b>seas.</b> The method controls the WEC so that its displacement frequency response achieves a predetermined characteristics, which is chosen to enhance performance. The design of the controller described is based upon a feedback structure, through deriving the control force from the required displacement of the WEC, rather than the actual displacement. The control setpoint (the required displacement) is synthesized from the incident wave, so prediction of the incoming waves is required, in common with other methods of control in <b>irregular</b> <b>seas.</b> The method is demonstrated using a linear time-domain model of a heaving cylinder. The control signal is generated using both impulse-response functions and transfer functions in order to compare the performance of each, in terms of control signal accuracy and power output, under conditions of reduced wave prediction time. The characteristics of the control force demand and power flow in the controlled system, and the effect on performance of errors both in synthesizing and predicting the incoming wave are investigated.

The seabed imperfection {{is one of the}} important design parameters determining the burial depth in order to achieve the required uplift resistance for a given pipeline. In this paper, the effect of variability in seabed profile on the performance of upheaval behaviour of buried offshore pipeline is investigated. The variation in the seabed profile is modelled using random field theory. The field observed imperfection height and correlation length are used to draw the samples of seabed profile for Monte-Carlo simulation using optimised Latin hypercube (LHC) sampling technique. In order to assess the safety, a numerical model of pipeline-seabed system was developed in ABAQUS assuming linear elastic behaviour for the pipe material. The interaction between pipe and seabed soil was modelled using pipe-soil interaction elements in ABAQUS. The effect of <b>irregular</b> <b>seabed</b> on the performance of offshore pipeline against upheaval buckling was quantified {{on the basis of the}} probability of failure calculated using the simulation results. Analysis results showed that the <b>irregular</b> <b>seabed</b> profile can significantly increase the vulnerability of the pipeline (failure probability) during upheaval buckling.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to be able to evaluate a ship’s response to waves, because any added resistance or loss of speed may cause delays or course alterations, leading to financial losses. The slow steaming approach is increasing in popularity for commercial vessels, as it provides a method of reducing fuel use, and therefore operating costs, in the current economic climate.

40|$|Offshore bottom-fixed structures, such as jackets, are {{typically}} designed {{with a natural}} period of 3 seconds or less. This {{means that there is}} limited dynamic excitation from wave loads at design sea-states. The benefit of this is reduced uncertainties from the dynamic effects in the design phase. However, some jacket structures in deep water or soft soilconditions may have natural periods exceeding 4 seconds, which implies large dynamic effects. For a jack-up, industry guidelines are developed to account for the dynamic structural response in both ULS and FLS conditions. Although advanced methods are available to determine the dynamic amplification factors (DAF), they are unsuitable to estimate the dynamic response in the concept design phase. The current simplified method is based on a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system. However, the estimator is not very accurate for the DAF of a structure in <b>irregular</b> <b>seas,</b> and must be used with caution. The most correct method for estimating the extreme static and dynamic responses is stochastic time-domain simulation. In this paper, it is investigated whether an analytical formulation is appropriate for DAF in <b>irregular</b> <b>seas,</b> as a function of natural period. The models used are a slender cylinder and a dynamically sensitive jacket, in an extreme seastate. Non-linear quasi-static and dynamic time-domain analysis are carried out with USFOS, a computer program especially designed for space frame offshore structures, using linear wave theory and the Morison equation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was done to}} develop tools to predict parametric roll motion of ships in regular and <b>irregular</b> <b>sea</b> and provide guidelines to avoid parametric roll during initial design stage. A post Panamax hull form (modified C 11 Hull form, Courtesy of MARIN) was used to study parametric roll in ships. The approach of the study has been to simplify the roll equation of motion to a single degree of freedom equation so as to utilize the tools available to analyze the system retaining the non-linear character of the system. The Hill? equation is used to develop highly accurate stability boundaries in the Ince-Strutt Diagram. The effect of non-linear damping has also been incorporated into the chart {{for the first time}} providing a simple method to predict the bounded roll motion amplitude. Floquet theory is also extended to predict parametric roll motion amplitude. Forward speed of the vessel has been treated as a bifurcation parameter and its effects studied both in head and following sea condition. In {{the second half of the}} research, parametric roll of the vessel in <b>irregular</b> <b>sea</b> is investigated using the Volterra Quadratic model. GM variation in <b>irregular</b> <b>sea</b> was obtained using transfer functions of the Volterra model. Heave and pitch coupling to roll motion was also studied using this approach.

40|$|Traditionally {{ships are}} {{designed}} to be symmetric about their centerline which makes head seas a very safe heading for roll motion stability. However, in the recent years several incidents of large amplitude roll motion in head seas have been reported which have later been attributed to parametric roll. Parametric roll motion is a phenomenon in which a ship exhibits a large amplitude of roll motion even when it is moving into head seas with no direct excitation. This phenomenon is particularly an issue for modern high-speed fine form container ships and has gained attention relatively recently. This instability is dangerous because of its manifestation in counter-intuitive headings. Also the roll amplitude during parametric roll rises exponentially with time which gives ship captains and masters very less time to react. While this instability has been studied extensively in regular waves, its manifestation in <b>irregular</b> <b>seas</b> has not received sufficient attention. This dissertation aims at the development of design criteria based on analytical techniques which can help a designer quickly quantify the stability of a vessel to parametric excitation. For accurate simulation of parametric response of a vessel/platform in <b>irregular</b> <b>seas,</b> an in-house time domain simulation program has been developed and validated against available experiments. The roll equation of motion is then simplified into a single degree of freedom model for analytical assessment. The existing single degree of freedom models in the literature are compared against the time domain simulation tool to gain an understanding {{of the extent to which}} the simplified models capture the dynamics of the phenomenon. In order to improve the roll modeling, a new approach is suggested to overcome some of the limitations of the existing models. This new model is then investigated using two analytical approaches, one from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and the other from stochastic dynamics to come up with two independent measures of stability. Both of these measures are used to demonstrate their potential as a design criteria which can be used by a ship designer.
