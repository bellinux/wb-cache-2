5000|$|NPML {{detection}} {{was first}} described in 1996 [...] and eventually found wide application in HDD read channel design. The “noise predictive” concept was later extended to handle autoregressive (AR) noise processes and autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) stationary noise processes [...] The concept {{was extended to}} include a variety of non-stationary noise sources, such as <b>head,</b> <b>transition</b> jitter and media noise; it was applied to various post-processing schemes. Noise prediction became {{an integral part of}} the metric computation in a wide variety of iterative detection/decoding schemes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a genetic-algorithm-based {{approach to the}} problem of UAV path planning in dynamic environments. Variable-length chromosomes and their genes have been used for encoding the problem. We model the vehicle path as a sequence of speed and <b>heading</b> <b>transitions</b> occurring at discrete times, and this model specifically contains the vehicle dynamic constraints in the generation of trial solutions. Simulation {{studies have shown that the}} proposed algorithm is effective in finding a near-optimal obstacle-free path in a dynamically changing environment, and the algorithm can guarantee that all candidate solutions lie within a feasible and reachable path space...|$|R

5000|$|On November 11, Trump telephoned <b>transition</b> <b>head</b> Chris Christie {{and told}} him his {{involvement}} with the Bridgegate scandal was a political liability and his performance <b>heading</b> the <b>transition</b> unsatisfactory (Trump, later, also expressed private frustration at Christie's retention of lobbyists in key transition posts). At {{the end of the}} call, Trump fired Christie from his position as transition chair. Over the next twenty-four hours, and with little warning, Christie loyalists were quickly removed from the transition team in what was characterized by NBC News as a [...] "Stalinesque purge". Transition executive Richard Bagger, for instance, found himself suddenly locked-out of the transition team's offices. Bill Palatucci, Mike Rogers, and others, were also among those removed.|$|R

40|$|How the {{integrin}} <b>head</b> <b>transitions</b> to the high-affinity conformation is debated. Although experiments link activation {{with the}} opening of the hinge angle between the βA and hybrid domains in the ligand-binding headpiece, this hinge is closed in the liganded αvβ 3 integrin crystal structure. We replaced the RGD peptide ligand of this structure with the 10 th type III fibronectin module (FnIII 10) and discovered through molecular dynamics (MD) equilibrations that when the conformational constraints of the leg domains are lifted, the βA/hybrid hinge opens spontaneously. Together with additional equilibrations on the same nanosecond timescale in which small structural variations impeded hinge-angle opening, these simulations allowed us to identify the allosteric pathway along which ligand-induced strain propagates via elastic distortions of the α 1 helix to the βA/hybrid domain hinge. Finally, we show with steered MD how force accelerates hinge-angle opening along the same allosteric pathway. Together with available experimental data, these predictions provide a novel framework for understanding integrin activation...|$|R
