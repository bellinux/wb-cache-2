50|$|The two {{ends of the}} cannula are {{inserted}} {{through the}} septa covering donating and <b>receiving</b> <b>flasks.</b> The cannula extends {{below the surface of}} the fluid to be transferred. A vacuum is applied to the <b>receiving</b> <b>flask,</b> and the low pressure relative to the donating flask causes the fluid to flow through the cannula.|$|R
50|$|The two {{ends of the}} cannula are {{connected}} similarly. The <b>receiving</b> <b>flask</b> is connected to its own gas bubbler, while the donating flask is connected to a source of inert gas. By increasing the inert gas pressure, the pressure within the donating flask is raised higher than the <b>receiving</b> <b>flask,</b> and the fluid is forced through the cannula.|$|R

50|$|The {{last two}} {{attributes}} of Erlenmeyer flasks make them especially appropriate for recrystallization. The sample to be purified is heated to a boil, and sufficient solvent is added for complete dissolution. The <b>receiving</b> <b>flask</b> {{is filled with}} a small amount of solvent, and heated to a boil. The hot solution is filtered through a fluted filter paper into the <b>receiving</b> <b>flask.</b> Hot vapors from the boiling solvent keep the filter funnel warm, avoiding the premature crystallization.|$|R

50|$|Filtration under inert {{conditions}} poses {{a special}} challenge {{that is usually}} tackled with specialized glassware. A Schlenk filter consists of sintered glass funnel fitted with joints and stopcocks. By fitting the pre-dried funnel and <b>receiving</b> <b>flask</b> to the reaction flask against a flow of nitrogen, carefully inverting the set-up, and turning on the vacuum appropriately, the filtration may be accomplished with minimal exposure to air.|$|R
50|$|The round bottoms {{on these}} types of flasks allow more uniform heating and/or boiling of liquid. Thus, round-bottom flasks are used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} where the contents are heated or boiled. Round-bottom flasks are used in distillation by chemists as distilling <b>flasks</b> and <b>receiving</b> <b>flasks</b> for the distillate (see distillation diagram). One-neck round-bottom flasks are used as the distilling flasks in rotary evaporators.|$|R

50|$|Pressure-equalizing {{dropping}} funnels have {{an additional}} narrow-bore glass tube from the bulb of the funnel, {{to the ground}} glass joint around the stem. These replace the liquid volume lost in the bulb with the equivalent gas volume from the flask into which the reagent is flowing, and are useful when handling air-sensitive reagents in a sealed, inert-gas environment. Without this tube, or some other means to equalize the pressure between a sealed <b>receiving</b> <b>flask</b> and the bulb of the funnel, the flow of fluid from the bulb will rapidly come to a halt.|$|R

50|$|The main {{drawback}} {{of pressure}} transfer, is that transfer can be slow {{due to the}} small pressure difference between donating and <b>receiving</b> <b>flasks.</b> Inert gas lines are usually vented out of a gas bubbler placed in-line to prevent overpressure. The vents need to be isolated by capping the bubbler outlet, or stopping the egress of inert gas with a stopcock or pinch clamp, to ensure sufficient pressure to complete the transfer. The use of a mercury bubbler instead of one filled with oil used to be popular, but is out of favor due to the difficulty in dealing with mercury spills.|$|R
