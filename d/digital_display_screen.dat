The hybrid animation experiments with the potential of screening abstract animation as large-scale projection in alternative spaces such as the public space venue provided by the event and bringing it to a public general audience. Both animations were selected by the ‘Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival 2014 ’ (SICAF) for its curated ‘Special Programme’ titled ‘SICAF on Media Canvas’ {{which is part of}} the animation festival in collaboration with Gana Art gallery who exhibit works of global media artists on the ‘Media Canvas’. The animations were invited as two of six international animations selected by SICAF: 'Interior', 'Coincidence' (Sabrina Schmid, UK), 'Colorimetry in Motion' (Nicolas Menard, Canada), 'Music Box' (Stuart Pound, UK), 'Land' (Masanobu Hiraoka, Japan), 'X, X' (Max Hattler, UK). The animations screened on the large-scale LED digital display 'Media Canvas', located on the facade of a building in Seoul Square, South Korea, which has also become one of Seoul's icons. It is one of the largest digital display screens in the world comprising an LED panel of 99 meters wide by 78 meters tall, which covers the front facade of an office building from the 4 th floor to the 23 rd floor. The animations screened from 22 - 27 July 2014. The documentation video shows the screening of the animation 'Interior' (excerpt) on the digital display Media Canvas, filmed on location at 8 pm on Tuesday 22 nd July 2014...|$|E
