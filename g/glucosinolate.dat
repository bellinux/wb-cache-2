5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including <b>glucosinolate,</b> myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E

40|$|<b>Glucosinolates</b> present {{classical}} {{examples of}} plant compounds affecting insect-plant interactions. They are found {{mainly in the}} family Brassicaceae, which includes several important crops. More than 120 different <b>glucosinolates</b> are known. The enzyme myrosinase, which is stored in specialized plant cells, converts <b>glucosinolates</b> to the toxic isothiocyanates. Insect herbivores may reduce the toxicity of <b>glucosinolates</b> and their products by excretion, detoxification, or behavioral adaptations. <b>Glucosinolates</b> also affect higher trophic levels, via reduced host or prey quality or because specialist herbivores may sequester <b>glucosinolates</b> for their own defense. There is substantial quantitative and qualitative variation between plant genotypes, tissues, and ontogenetic stages, which poses specific challenges to insect herbivores. Even though <b>glucosinolates</b> are constitutive defenses, their levels are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors including insect damage. Plant breeders may use knowledge on <b>glucosinolates</b> to increase insect resistance in Brassica crops. State-of-the-art techniques, such as mutant analysis and metabolomics, are necessary to identify the exact role of <b>glucosinolates.</b> ...|$|R

(Most <b>glucosinolates</b> are actually derived from chain-elongated homologues of these amino acids, e.g. glucoraphanin is derived from dihomomethionine, which is methionine chain-elongated twice).

40|$|ABSTRACT: An UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMSn {{profiling}} {{method was}} used to identify the <b>glucosinolates</b> and flavonoids of Rorippa indica (Cruciferae), a wild vegetable and Chinese herb used to treat cough, diarrhea, and rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty-three <b>glucosinolates,</b> more than 40 flavonol glycosides, and 18 other phenolic and common organic compounds were identified. The <b>glucosinolates</b> and polyphenols were separated by UHPLC. High-resolution deprotonated molecules provided high accuracy mass values {{that were used to}} determine formulas and provide putative identification of the <b>glucosinolates</b> and flavonoids. The fragments from multistage mass spectrometry were used to elucidate the structures. The concentrations of the main components were based on UV peak areas and molar relative response factors with a single calibration standard.

2500|$|Broccoli sprouts {{contain a}} {{particular}} <b>glucosinolate</b> compound, glucoraphanin, which {{is found in}} vacuoles within the cytoplasm of the plant cell. [...] The membrane of the plant cells also contain an enzyme, myrosinase, which is walled off from the vacuoles of glucoraphanin. [...] Only when the plant cell is ruptured by cutting, chewing, etc. do the two substances {{come into contact with}} each other. [...] In the moist environment of the cell, this leads to a chemical reaction wherein the myrosinase converts the glucoraphanin to an isothiocyanate, sulforaphane. [...] It is predominantly the sulforaphane for which broccoli sprouts have been so widely researched. [...] The glucoraphanin of itself is inert.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} pungent {{taste of}} horseradish {{is from the}} compound allyl isothiocyanate. Upon crushing the flesh of horseradish, the enzyme myrosinase is released and acts on the glucosinolates sinigrin and gluconasturtiin, which are precursors to the allyl isothiocyanate. [...] The allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a natural defense against herbivores. Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of the <b>glucosinolate,</b> separate from the myrosinase enzyme. When an animal chews the plant, the allyl isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal. [...] Allyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading {{over the course of}} days at [...] [...] Because of this instability, horseradish sauces lack the pungency of the freshly crushed roots.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 {{a team of}} Johns Hopkins University {{scientists}} isolated a cancer-fighting phytochemical in broccoli called glucoraphanin, {{which is}} the <b>glucosinolate</b> precursor of sulforaphane (SGS). [...] When chewed, broccoli releases glucoraphanin and myrosinase, an enzyme found {{in another part of}} the plant cell, which work together to produce sulforaphane, which, in turn, activates a transcription factor, Nrf2 in the cell. Once activated, Nrf2 then translocates to the nucleus of the cell, where it aligns itself with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of target genes. The target genes are associated with a process that assists in regulating cellular defences. [...] Such cytoprotective genes include that for glutathione. [...] Around 200 genes have been well-characterised, as many as 1700 are thought to be related to this aspect of cellular defense.|$|E

40|$|Broccoli (Brassicaceae) are an {{excellent}} dietary source of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and health-promoting phytochemicals (<b>glucosinolates</b> and phenolic compounds). <b>Glucosinolates</b> are a class of organic compounds derived from glucose and different aminoacids, and characterized by {{the high number of}} different side chains. Anthocyanins represent the largest group of natural, water-soluble plant pigments, and approximately 400 anthocyanins have been determined. <b>Glucosinolates</b> and anthocyanins protects plants against various biotic and abiotic stresses and possess antioxidant and antinflammatory activity in humans. In addition, <b>glucosinolates</b> have gained much attention due to the anticarcinogenic activity of isothiocyanates, their major hydrolysis products, molecules able to induce phase 2 detoxication enzymes and protect animals against chemically induced cancer (Zhang, 2012). Young broccoli plant are an especially good source of <b>glucosinolates</b> and anthocyanins and several studies report that growth and environmental conditions could affect the profiles of these secondary plant metabolites (Perez-Balibrea et al., 2008).

50|$|Goitrin is a sulfur-containing oxazolidine, a cyclic thiocarbamate, {{that reduces}} the {{production}} of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine. It is found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, brussels sprouts and rapeseed oil, and is formed by the hydrolysis of a glucosinolate: progoitrin or 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl <b>glucosinolate.</b> The unstable isothiocyanate (2-hydroxy-3-butenyl isothiocyanate) derived from the latter <b>glucosinolate</b> spontaneously cyclizes to goitrin, because the hydroxy group is situated in proximity to the isothiocyanate group (allowing a five-membered ring to be formed). Hence, the oxygen in the molecule stems from the hydroxy group of the original unstable isothiocyanate.
