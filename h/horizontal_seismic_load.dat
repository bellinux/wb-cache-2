Floor constructions and {{the roof of the}} building are both made as solid reinforced concrete plate. The vertical load-bearing structure of the building consists of a brick masonry walls, but in the stair core area the walls are made of reinforced concrete. The first part of the thesis presents analysis and design of the typical reinforced concrete plate in accordance with the Eurocode standards. An idealized mathematical model of the plate was made in the program SAP 2000. The analysis of the plate is concluded by the upper and lower reinforcement plans, which are annexed to this thesis. In {{the second part of the}} thesis is checked a load-bearing capacity of a brick masonry on the ground floor while the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> operate on them. In the vertical load is checked the wall, where the average compressive stresses, in the horizontal cross section of the wall, are higher. It is established that the load-bearing capacity of the wall is appropriate. In the operation of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> is estimated the total shear resistance of the masonry without the contribution of the reinforced concrete wall in the stair core.

40|$|Issues, {{related to}} the {{clarification}} of hydrodynamic pressure on arch and gravity dams, were the topic of all last congresses on seismic resistance, because they are directly connected with reliability control of these important facilities. Impact of water pressure on the dam in case of earthquake depends {{on a number of}} factors, including vibratory energy absorption by the bottom of the reservoir that plays a significant role. However the determination of the absorption parameter involves considerable difficulties, because it is influenced by properties of a bottom material and alluviums, silt, debris and so on. It makes this characteristic substantially uncertain. Stationary and non-stationary plane problems of hydromechanics for a semi-infinite fluid layer of finite depth are considered. Hydrodynamic pressure on the vertical upstream face of the dam under the <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>load</b> with energy absorption on the reservoir bottom and a layer of sediment is determined. Uncertain factors are the amplitude of the impact and the absorption parameter. Point estimation (based on probability theory) and interval estimation (using theory of possibilities) of the spread of hydrodynamic pressure on dam under acoustic resonance and non-resonance conditions are given...|$|E

The displacement and axial force increased with the increased seismic intensity. The displacement and axial force decreased with the increased the length of bar strip.

It is harmful to the whipping lash effect {{in the top of the}} high-rise building when it is forced, moved and deformed, the phenomenon of whipping lash effect is evident in high-rise building. In order to research the essence of the whipping lash effect and avoid it, firstly the whipping lash effect is introduced, also we have distinguished the whipping lash effect and cantilever structure by analysising the non-statically structure and statically structure. Then we have made three different high-rise building models which are put on the dead load, live load and <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>load,</b> also we have gotten the maximum displacement, maximum displacement angle, velocity, acceleration, shear force and moment, then we have analysised and compared displacement, movement and force.

Furthermore the floor size and horizontal stiffness in the same floor are different tremendously, otherwise there are many dislocation floor in the same floor, according to different function in the same floor. Irregular plane in the building may happen according to the situation above. It is harmful to the force,, displacement and deformation in irregular plane.

40|$|Aseismatic {{reinforcement}} {{projects are}} proceeding at many {{places in the}} JR East jurisdiction. Up to now, we have adopted the method by which we increase bearing force by adding braces, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In this method, however, there are major restrictions because the work is done on buildings in use. Some works also involve compensation for business in commercial areas where construction takes place. Furthermore, placing wall-type aseismatic mechanisms is undesirable in terms of construction planning as that narrows usable space range. There is thus demand for a reinforcement method to solve those problems by effectively improving aseismatic performance while minimizing obstruction to existing buildings. Reinforcement work is often carried out in parallel with improvement work for barrier-free access involving installing escalators or elevators. As we usually do not regard escalators or elevators as construction members, we had not considered having them bear horizontal force. But, if we can regard those, escalators in particular, as components of aseismatic mechanisms, we can effectively improve aseismatic performance while keeping obstruction to existing buildings at a minimum. We thus have decided to undertake development of new aseismatic structure using escalators. In this article, we call escalators that resist horizontal force “aseismatic escalators”. We have designed the structure of such aseismatic escalators {{to be able to}} reduce the number of reinforcement members such as braces by making them bear part of horizontal force at earthquakes in the longitudinal direction, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The premise is that steps, motors and other mechanical parts of such escalators are not damaged, even when bearing <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>load.</b> 2. 1 Specifications of Aseismatic Escalators Taking into account the premise that mechanical parts of aseismatic escalators such as steps and motors will not be damaged, w...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{building}} structures situated in a seismic area deals with some spe¬cial provisions {{in order to satisfy}} the design concept for earthquake loads. Thus, some inelastic deformations must be concentrated in predefined zones for seismic energy dissi¬pation. Therefore, it is important to evaluate correctly the load bearing capacity of each basic structural element, such as beams, columns and joints too. At the "Politehnica" University of Timisoara, it was developed an experimental test program for a specific steel and composite (steel-concrete) joint. Two load hypotheses were considered in order to simulate the permanent <b>loads</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> (<b>seismic)</b> <b>loads,</b> respectively, acting on the structure and the corresponding joints.

40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} the knowledge on the seismic behavior of dowel beam-to-column connections, typically employed in precast buildings in Europe. Despite the large diffusion {{of the industrial}} buildings, a high seismic vulnerability was exhibited by these structures, mostly due to the connection systems deficiencies, during some recent earthquakes (Emilia 2012, Turkey 2011). An experimental campaign was conducted on a typical dowel connection between an external column and a roof beam. In this paper, the performed cyclic shear test is described. According to the experimental results, the seismic response {{of the system is}} evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness and failure mechanism. Moreover, the complete damage pattern of the test is described by means of the instrumentations records. The connection failure occurred due to the concrete cover failure in the column (splitting failure). Such a mechanism corresponds to a negligible energy dissipation capacity of the connection, compared to the overall seismic response of the structure. The experimental results are also compared with the results of a similar monotonic shear test, as well as with some literature relationships for predicting the strength of dowel connections under <b>horizontal</b> (<b>seismic)</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that allowable stress design method {{is going to be}} switched over to limit state design method for port and offshore structures in Japan, two of the authors have already studied the <b>load</b> factors of <b>seismic</b> <b>loads</b> based on reliability theory.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the damped spring controlled system to reduce the earthquake-induced forces in the structure of cable-stayed bridges by applying STAAD-Pro structural analysis. The total length of the proposed cable-stayed bridge is 450 ft from abutment to abutment. It has symmetrical span arrangement with 250 ft (main span length) and 100 ft (each of side span length) respectively. It consists of dual H-type tower and the warren truss type steel girder. The girder has 10 ft each panel bays and 5 ft in height. A reinforced concrete, H-type tower, rises 50 ft above the truss girder base. Its apex is 15 ft high in pylon that supports a dual-plane cable system. Two pairs of cables on each side are arranged as a fan type cable system. Cables are installed from the outermost cable connections; from the ends of the bridge to the tower with 50 ft spacing to distribute axial load throughout the deck. HS 20 - 44 AASHTO loading will be applied. Effects of impact loading, wind loading, temperature forces and <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>loading</b> will also be considered. Firstly, the static analysis of cable-stayed bridge is accomplished without considering the effect of earthquake forces. After that the spring supports are installed between tower and girder for effective flexible responses of the cable-stayed bridge due to the horizontal earthquake forces only. The intelligent control system is used to guarantee the relative movements between the connected structural parts. The bridge is analyzed and designed by using the STAAD-Pro engineering software in this study. The materials and loads are specified according to the AASHTO specifications.

30|$|The {{spalling}} or delamination {{of concrete}} cover could occur anywhere along {{the height of}} the RC column. The previous researches as stated in the preceding paragraph represent repair where damages occur either locally or entirely along {{the height of the}} RC column. However, a critical situation arises when the damages are localised at a region around the beam-column joint. This type of localised damage is usually induced by large <b>horizontal</b> loadings (e.g. <b>seismic</b> <b>load).</b> The loads bring about an excessive superimposed moment and shear at the joint resulting in a localised damage in this region. The damage may be repaired by a patching method or a combination of patching with other retrofitting technique. The decision depends on the extent of damage and the intended performance level of the structure to anticipate future loadings. If patching method is the final option to be carried out to repair the damaged RC column, this method should guarantee that the patched RC column will have a similar performance to the undamaged RC column.|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{retrofitting}} {{of historical}} structures {{is a complex}} operation often needed to save their cultural value. This requires background knowledge acquired from several research and application fields. Suitably designed strengthening systems are required that do not adversely affect {{the nature of the}} structure itself, in order to efficiently protect cultural heritage buildings against earthquakes. When put into practice, any interventions for cultural heritage conservation should be easy to of install, noninvasive and the reversible. In this work, cable systems made of high-strength materials are proposed for the seismic reinforcement of masonry domes. Because of the significant influence of geometrical factors on the performance of the strengthening system, interventions must take into account the specific characteristics of the building, the stages of its construction, and its current state, which is inherently subject to variations.

40|$|Masonry walls enclose {{rooms in}} {{buildings}} {{and may have}} a load bearing function. Load bearing walls not only transfer vertical loads but also <b>horizontal</b> (wind or <b>seismic)</b> <b>loads.</b> Masonry walls are usually bonded at their vertical intersection forming T or H shaped sections. In this vertical intersection, shear is an important design parameter. A standardized test {{for this type of}} shear is not available. Usually, the triplet shear test is applied. However, the triplet test is only intended to establish the initial shear strength of bed joints. Other tests in which shear and pre compression are applied in bed joints are the diagonal tension test and the compression wallette tests with inclined bed joints. In this paper research into the behavior of H shaped specimens loaded in shear is discussed. The specimens, 500 mm high and 550 mm long, were made from calcium silicate units with thin bed joints. Their dimension was roughly at a 1 : 5 scale, i. e. wall thickness was 50 mm compared to wall thickness in buildings up to 300 mm. Two different support conditions were applied. Results are compared with diagonal tension tests on masonry simultaneously made from the same materials, results from literature, push over tests on real sized walls and results from numerical simulations.

The design provisions of current seismic codes are generally not very accurate for assessing the structural effects of near-fault ground motions. In the present work, six- and twelve-storey r. c. spatial frames are designed according to {{the provisions of the}} Italian <b>seismic</b> code, considering <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>seismic</b> <b>loads</b> in a high-risk seismic region and assuming low and high ductility classes. A lumped plasticity model based on the Haar-Kàrmàn principle is used to describe the inelastic behavior of the r. c. frame members. In particular, the lumped plasticity model for a column includes a piecewise linearization of the bounding surface of the axial load-biaxial bending moment elastic domain, at the end sections where inelastic deformations are expected. Moreover, the lumped plasticity model for a girder takes into account the potential plastic hinges along the span, due to the vertical ground mo-tion, so avoiding the computational effort required by the sub-discretization of the frame member. The nonlinear dynamic response of the test structures is studied with reference to the horizontal and vertical components of near-fault records. The occurrence of a directivity effect at arbitrary orientations is checked rotating the horizontal components of the se-lected motions, rather than considering only fault-normal and fault-parallel orientations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, {{the problem}} of {{determining}} pseudo-dynamic pressure and its associated forces on a rigid vertical retaining wall is solved analytically using the horizontal slices method for both reinforced and unreinforced walls. The use of this method {{in conjunction with the}} suggested equations and unknowns offers a pseudo-dynamic method that is then compared with the results of an available software. In the proposed method, different seismic accelera-tions have been modeled at different soil structure heights. Reinforced soil pressure on a retaining wall and the angle of the critical failure wedge are calculated using the new formulation. It is shown that as the <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> acceleration coefficient increases the angle of the critical failure wedge is reduced and that the maximum extension force can be increased for each layer by using stronger and longer reinforcements. The results of the pseudo-dynamic method show that both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> accelerations are essential coefficients for calculation of the required length and extension force of the reinforcements and that their importance increases as the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>seismic</b> accelerations increase.
