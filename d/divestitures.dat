40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} relationships existing between the <b>divestiture</b> of {{a portion of}} a company and the subsequent performance of the divesting company. Of additional interest was whether significant performance differences were exhibited by companies divesting for different reasons, changing diversification levels, and size of <b>divestiture.</b> ^ This study measured the effects of <b>divestiture</b> on the overall performance of the divesting company and the impact of the <b>divestiture</b> on the shareholders of the firm. ^ Overall company performance was measured by the profitability ratio, Return On Equity. Shareholder welfare was measured by the cumulative abnormal return to shareholders. ^ The research results support the contention that <b>divestiture</b> is an often used, unique, and important strategic option in the management of companies. ^ This research presents findings of interest with respect to the overall effectiveness of <b>divestiture,</b> the reasons for <b>divestiture,</b> and returns to shareholders. Little evidence was found that suggested the overall performance of companies improved after <b>divestiture.</b> The reasons given by companies for the <b>divestiture</b> had little effect on the subsequent performance of the firm. Change in diversification level demonstrated little impact on firm performance. The size of the <b>divestiture</b> (as a percentage of parent firm 2 ̆ 7 s total assets) had little effect on overall firm performance. The findings pertaining to shareholder wealth suggest that the stated reason for <b>divestiture</b> {{and the size of the}} <b>divestiture</b> do have significant effects on shareholder returns, but the diversification level does not. ...|$|R
40|$|Business acquisition, {{resource}} redeployment, and asset <b>divestiture</b> are {{elements of}} a dynamic process in which firms change their businesses by recombining internal and external resources. Analyzing 253 horizontal acquisitions, we show that post-acquisition resource redeployment leads to asset <b>divestiture</b> from the business that receives the redeployed resources, but not from the business that contributes the new resources. Consistent with scale economies rationales, we find that strategic similarity also leads to greater asset <b>divestiture</b> from the target firms. Many theoretical perspectives are skeptical about the positive rationale for acquisitions {{and many of these}} believe that asset <b>divestiture</b> is evidence of acquisition failure. Our arguments and analysis help refine the accepted wisdom. In particular, the pattern of resource redeployment and asset <b>divestiture</b> in our analysis suggests that acquisitions provide a means of reconfiguring the structure of resources within firms and that asset <b>divestiture</b> is a logical consequence of this reconfiguration process.

Drawing upon agency theory and information economics literature, this paper examines the relationship between information asymmetries, family ownership and the <b>divestiture</b> financial performance in Western European countries. Based on a sample of 115 Western European <b>divestiture</b> transactions carried out between 1996 and 2010, we find support for the assertion that information asymmetry impacts <b>divestiture</b> financial performance. We also show that the influence of information asymmetries is moderated by family ownership, which acts as a signal of <b>divestiture</b> quality...|$|R

25|$|Allis-Chalmers was a U.S. {{manufacturer}} of machinery for various industries. Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery {{for use in}} industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis-Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company (steam engines and mill equipment), Fraser & Chalmers (mining and ore milling equipment), the Gates Iron Works (rock and cement milling equipment), and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company (engines and compressors). It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s a series of <b>divestitures</b> transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO.|$|E

This conclusion explains the hesitancy of many local governments, despite the federal government mandate, to accept the housing stock of privatizing enterprises. ...|$|R
