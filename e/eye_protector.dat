40|$|AIMS: To {{find out}} the {{prevalence}} of ocular injury and infection among dental personnel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and four dental personnel. METHOD: A questionnaire completed by researchers and observation during practice. RESULTS: The response rate was 81 %. Dentists and dental technicians had a similar prevalence (42. 3 %) of foreign bodies in their eyes {{during the period of}} one month. Almost 50. 5 % of dentists rarely had foreign bodies in their eyes, while only 22. 2 % of dental technicians claimed the same. The majority of dental surgery assistants (73. 6 %) never experienced foreign bodies in their eyes. Only 27. 0 % of female personnel had foreign bodies in their eyes as compared to 73. 0 % of male personnel, while only 28. 5 % of females had conjunctivitis as compared to 71. 4 % among male personnel. 75 % of regular <b>eye</b> <b>protector</b> wearers (EPW) never had foreign bodies while 67. 2 % EPW never had conjunctivitis. Dental technicians were more prone to ocular injury, 13. 8 % as compared to 4. 4 % of dentists. Only 30 % of the regular <b>eye</b> <b>protector</b> wearers suffered ocular injury. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the eyes should be emphasised and practised at undergraduate level. The awareness of eye protection should be highlighted at all clinical and research symposia. Further studies should be conducted to assess the financial implications of ocular injuries and infections in dental institutions and practices. Recommendations are made for universal precautions and the observation of safety at work guidelines by all dental team members. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|X-ray guided interventional {{procedure}} {{is a common}} diagnostic and/or treatment modality for various vascular and cardiac diseases. Advanced technology has enabled interventional radiologists in performing more complex neuro-radiology procedures, resulting in concomitant increase in radiation dose to the patients. The main contributions of this thesis were firstly, characterisation of the MOSkin detector in kilovoltage photon beams and testing its suitability for in-vivo patient’s dose measurements during interventional radiology procedures. Secondly, a comprehensive evaluation of the exposure parameters contributions on patient’s dose during neurointerventional procedures was performed. It {{was found that the}} lateral x-ray tube contributed considerably high radiation dose to patient’s eye lens. This led to the design and fabrication of a novel type of eye lens protector for those procedures that patient’s eye is repeatedly positioned within the lateral tube exposure field, where the applying of collimation on lateral beam is not possible. The eye lens protector was designed to be placed within the x-ray field of view, attenuating the direct beam from the lateral x-ray tube while being sufficiently radiolucent not to perturb the radiological image and the interventional procedure. Finally, a new type of an anthropomorphic head phantom was fabricated with more options for dosimeter placement and more similar tissue substitute materials to actual human eye, in order to evaluate the dose delivered to the patient’s eye lens during a clinical neuro-interventional procedure. The MOSkin detector has been proven to be a reliable and suitable dosimetry system for the measurement of the radiation dose in kilovoltage photon beams and has been successfully utilised during 35 clinical neuro-interventional procedures to evaluate the radiation dose received by the patients’ eye lenses. This study revealed that among the 35 patients, the left outer canthus regions of 8 patients and left eyelid region of one iv patient were found to receive higher dose than the recommended threshold dose for cataract formation (500 mGy). Based on the study of the contribution of exposure parameters on patient’s dose, it is recommended that the judicial use of acquisition imaging techniques {{and the use of the}} lateral x-ray tube particularly in the anterior-oblique orientation, in order to reduce the patient’s eye lens dose during neuro-interventional procedures.

40|$|Introduction: The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z 94. 3 - 07 {{ballistic}} {{impact test}} for industrial lenses, tests {{the ability of}} a lens material to withstand the impact of a 6. 4 mm diameter steel ball travelling at a speed of 46. 5 ± 0. 5 m/s. The specific testing is waived if the lens made of various materials meets a minimum centre thickness requirement. New lens materials, like Hi-Vex, are not included in this list. The first study compared the breakage speed of Hi-Vex lenses to CR 39 lenses at different conditioned temperatures. In the process of carrying out the literature review, it became apparent that the definition of lens failure varied. This led to the question as to how naïve individuals may interpret a National Standard definition of lens failure after being impacted by a missile. Naïve subjects were asked to classify impacted lenses as either pass or fail based on the written CSA Z 94. 3 - 07 failure criterion. Purpose:   Study 1 : To investigate the impact resistance of a mid-index plastic lens material Hi-Vex (n= 1. 56) at different temperatures. Study 2 : To investigate if people actually understood what the CSA classifies as a failed lens. Methods:  Study 1 : Two groups of plano hard coated lenses were tested: CR 39 and Hi-Vex. Lenses were ordered with 3 mm centre thickness, cut to 50 mm diameter and edged to achieve the Hide-a-Bevel® which was in agreement with the CSA requirement for prescription industrial safety lenses and frames. A pneumatic gun was used to propel a 6. 35 mm steel ball at the centre of each lens. Impact speed was varied using the Zippy Estimation by Sequential Testing (ZEST) protocol to determine the threshold breakage speed. Combined uncertainties as defined in the International organization for standardization (ISO) Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement were used to determine the statistical significance of all comparisons of the data sets. Study 2 : Ten graduate students from the School of Optometry and ten patients from the general public were given 25 spectacle lenses that had been subjected to the ballistic impact test. They were asked to classify the lenses as either a pass or fail after reading the definition of a failure under the ballistic impact test in CSA Z 94. 3 - 07 clause 6. 1. 3. 1. Lenses were presented to the participants in the same order. The responses of both groups of participants were compared to the classification of two experienced researchers who agreed on 100 % of the lens outcomes. Results:  Study 1 : The threshold breakage speeds of the industrial thickness Hi-Vex and CR 39 lenses at 24 °C were 50. 88 m/s and 50. 64 m/s and at - 29 °C, 52. 57 m/s and 52. 56 m/s respectively. Both comparisons were not statistically significant. The corresponding threshold breakage speeds for Hi-Vex and CR 39 lenses at - 49 °C were 66. 38 m/s and 49. 66 m/s and at 50 °C were 57. 01 m/s and 53. 54 m/s respectively. Both comparisons were statistically significant. Study 2 : There were only two lenses in which all participants agreed with the outcome. These lenses were failed lenses. The naïve subjects were more likely to classify a lens that passed as a failure than a failed lens as a pass. This trend was more obvious in the general public results although the results across the various lenses for the graduate students and general public were not statistically different. Conclusions:  Study 1 : We found that the mean breakage speeds of the Hi-Vex and CR 39 lenses were greater than the level required of <b>eye</b> <b>protector</b> lenses by the Standards American National Standards institute (ANSI) Z 87. 1 - 2010 and CSA Z 94. 3 - 07. Hi-Vex was also superior to CR 39 at more extreme temperatures with a threshold breakage speed of 57. 01 ± 3. 51 m/s at 50 °C and 66. 38 ± 4. 00 m/s at - 49 °C. Although its impact resistance was less than that of both Trivex and Polycarbonate lenses, Hi-Vex may provide an acceptable level of impact protection in industrial settings. This is the first study to concomitantly assess impact resistance of a new lens material as well as compare the impact resistance at various temperatures. Study 2 : Simply reading the definition of a lens failure is insufficient. Some type of training with actual lenses may be necessary. Whether revising the text of the Standard or repeating the instructions several times would reduce this problem is uncertain. Both the graduate students and general public tended to be more conservative in their classification of failure. If there were any visible damage to the lens {{as a result of the}} impact, at least one person would classify the lens as a failure regardless of whether the damage met the CSA definition. This result suggests that the vision care community and CSA may need to educate the public on the meaning of impact resistance of eye protectors...|$|E
