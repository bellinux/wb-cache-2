25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected to be grateful for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, EastEnders {{clashed with}} Coronation Street {{for the first}} time. EastEnders won the battle with 8.4 million viewers (41% share) whilst Coronation Street lagged behind with 7.3 million viewers (34 percent share). On 21 September 2004, Louise Berridge, the then {{executive}} producer, quit following criticism of the show. The following day the show received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of Emmerdale against it. Emmerdale was watched by 8.1 million people. The poor ratings motivated the press into reporting viewers were bored with implausible and ill-thought-out storylines. Under new producers, EastEnders and Emmerdale continued to clash at times, and Emmerdale tended {{to come out on}} top, giving EastEnders lower than average ratings. In 2006, EastEnders regularly attracted between 8 and 12 million viewers in official ratings. EastEnders received its second lowest ratings on 17 May 2007, when 4.0 million viewers tuned in. This was also the lowest ever audience share, with just 19.6 percent. This was attributed to a conflicting one hour special episode of Emmerdale on ITV1. However, ratings for the 10pm EastEnders repeat on BBC Three reached an all-time high of 1.4 million. However, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> EastEnders had higher ratings than Emmerdale despite the two going head-to-head.|$|E

In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, Ike admitted, [...] "Yeah, I hit her, but I didn't hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.... If she says I abused her, maybe I did." [...] He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs, Taking Back My Name (1999), writing: [...] "Sure, I've slapped Tina.... There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I have never beat her." ...|$|E

I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact {{the only thing you can}} judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{introduced}} a fast-paced style of basketball called [...] "Showtime", {{described as a}} mix of [...] "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams." [...] Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, [...] "There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> [...] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." [...] Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I was over , I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A {{lot of the time}} {{that is one of the}} ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E

In Castrovalva, the Doctor's companion Adric was abducted by the Master and forced to create a block transfer computation. Later, in The King's Demons, Kamelion is controlled by the Master before the Doctor steals him away, with the Master regaining control of Kamelion in Planet of Fire. In the second episode of The Ultimate Foe, Sabalom Glitz chose to go with the Master in search of Time Lord secrets.|$|E

Hooja's men, working in relays, were commencing to show the effects of the strain under which they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> forced to work without food or water, and I think their weakening aided us almost as much as the slight freshening of the wind.|$|R

2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th. As an evidence of this I recall the three charred and burned heads we picked up in the village near the scene of the big war dance, when we visited the village with Capt. Benteen and Lieut. Wallace {{on the morning of the}} 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time...I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement...My Medal of Honor and its inscription have served me as proof positive that I was at least in the vicinity at the time in question, otherwise I should be tempted to deny all knowledge of the event.|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of a}} {{model of}} {{evolution}} accounts {{for the fact that}} not all events are equally likely to happen. For example, a transition, which is a type of point mutation from one purine to another, or from one pyrimidine to another is much more likely to happen than a transversion, which is the chance of a purine being switched to a pyrimidine, or vice versa. These differences are not captured by maximum parsimony. However, just because some events are more likely than others {{does not mean that they}} always happen. [...] We know that throughout evolutionary history there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> there was a large gap between what was most likely to happen, and what actually occurred. When this is the case, maximum parsimony may actually be more accurate because it is more willing to make large, unlikely leaps than maximum likelihood is. Maximum likelihood has been shown to be quite reliable in reconstructing character states, but it does not do as good of a job at giving accurate estimations of the stability of proteins. Maximum likelihood always overestimates the stability of proteins, which makes sense since it assumes that the proteins that were made and used were the most stable and optimal. The merits of maximum likelihood have been subject to debate, with some having concluded that maximum likelihood test represents a good medium between accuracy and speed. However, other studies have complained that maximum likelihood takes too much time and computational power to be useful in some scenarios.|$|E

30|$|The GBI is {{a measure}} of chronic-intermittent forms of affective {{disorders}} and identifies the full range of severity of unipolar and BD—from sub-syndromal to syndromal (Depue et al. 1981, 1989). It consists of three clusters of items: depressive, hypomanic and biphasic (defined as the tendency to vacillate between depression and hypomania in the same item). The GBI has 73 items that are scored on a 0 – 4 Likert scale related to the chronicity of the symptom described. It is possible to use the scoring system of the GBI as a Likert scale yielding continuous scores of affective disturbance or dysregulation in the domains of depressive, hypomanic and biphasic symptoms. We used a selection of ten items from the depression domain of which the majority selected being consistent with a recent factor analysis informing the development of a shorter version of the GBI (Youngstrom et al. 2013). The items were: (1) Have you had periods of sadness and depression when almost everything gets on your nerves and makes you irritable or angry (other than related to the menstrual cycle)?; (2) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> of several days or more when you were so sad that it was quite painful or you felt that you couldn’t stand it?; (3) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you looked back over your life and could see only failures or hardships?; (4) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you <b>were</b> feeling low and depressed, and you also had to struggle very hard to control inner feelings of rage or an urge to smash or destroy things?; (5) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you exploded at others and afterwards felt bad about yourself?; (6) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you hated yourself or felt that you were stupid, ugly, unlovable, or useless? (7) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> of several days or more when you really got down on yourself and felt worthless?; (8) Have you had periods when it seemed that the future was hopeless and things could not improve?; (9) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> periods lasting several days or more when you were so down in the dumps that you thought you might never snap out of it?; and (10) <b>Have</b> there <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> you <b>have</b> felt that you would be better off dead?
