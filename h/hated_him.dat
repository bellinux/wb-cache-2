25|$|Macleod {{returned}} to Scotland in 1928 to become Regius Professor of Physiology (in succession {{to his former}} teacher, Prof. John Alexander MacWilliam who retired in 1927) and later Dean of the University of Aberdeen Medical Faculty. Between 1929 and 1933 {{he was also a}} member of the Medical Research Council. He wrote a report on the discovery in 1922 to explain his side of the story, but otherwise refrained from active involvement in controversy about credit.

25|$|By March 1822, it {{had been}} two years since she had seen her daughter. She plotted to kidnap Allegra from the convent and asked Shelley to forge a letter of {{permission}} from Byron. Shelley refused her request. Byron's seemingly callous treatment of the child was further vilified when Allegra died there at age five from a fever some scholars identify as typhus and others speculate was a malarial-type fever. Clairmont held Byron entirely responsible {{for the loss of}} their daughter and <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> {{for the rest of her}} life. Shelley's death followed only two months later.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{tries to}} mend the long-broken {{relationships}} with his parents. He remembers {{that as a}} boy his mother insisted on his institutionalization, overruling his father's wish {{to keep him in}} the household. Charlie returns after many years to his family's Brooklyn home and finds that his mother now suffers from dementia. Although she recognizes him, she is mentally confused. Charlie's father, who had broken off contact with the family many years before, does not recognize him. Charlie is only able to reconnect with his now-friendly younger sister, Norma, who had <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> for his mental disability when they were growing up, and is now caring for their mother in their newly depressed neighborhood. When Norma asks Charlie to stay with his family, he refuses but promises to send her money.|$|E
25|$|After a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at {{his side}} and quickly learns of the present danger: Onslaught. He observes the {{conflict}} between the psionic entity and Earth's heroes with Uatu the Watcher, who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action: an alliance with the one who <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> the most, Cable. Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught would be most vulnerable through the astral plane and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse would remove the captive Franklin Richards, greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the Invisible Woman, who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse's motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Fitzwalter, however, {{remained}} a vigorous opponent of John's later measures. Matthew Paris said that John specially <b>hated</b> <b>him,</b> Archbishop Stephen Langton, and Saer de Quincy. In August 1213, {{he was at}} St Paul's Cathedral in London when Archbishop Langton read a charter signed by Henry I and announced that services could be conducted ahead of {{the lifting of the}} interdict on England. On 4 November 1214 Fitzwalter met in secrecy with the Archbishop and the other barons at Bury St Edmunds. The assembled barons resolved to withdraw their fealty from King John and swore at the altar of the abbey church that they would wage war on John if he did not accept their demands of a charter by Christmas. The barons and the King both began to arm themselves, and John secured the support of the Pope and took up the cross as a crusader. By January, John still refused to accede to the barons' demands and when Fitzwalter and several other barons visited him in armour at the headquarters of the Knights Templar in England in London (the modern Inns of Court) he asked for a truce until Easter.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} feud on the SmackDown! brand {{was between}} Hulk Hogan and Mr. McMahon. One month prior at No Way Out, during a match between Hogan and The Rock, McMahon {{came down to}} the ring, only to distract Hogan, which allowed the referee, Sylvan Grenier to give The Rock a chair, which Rock used to hit Hogan and pin him for the win. After No Way Out, McMahon proclaimed that Hulkamania was dead and proclaiming a new 'mania; McMahonamania. On the March 6 episode of SmackDown!, Hogan informed McMahon that Hulkamania was not dead and that McMahon {{had nothing to do with}} creating it. McMahon informed Hogan that he did not hate Hulkamaniacs or Hulkamania, but he hated Hogan. He then told Hogan that he <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) for Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and for testifying against him in the steroid trial in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded by challenging Hogan to a match at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from professional wrestling. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night. Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked with a steel chair from behind. Shortly afterward, McMahon hit Hogan several times with the chair in the head, causing him to bleed. McMahon then signed the contract and forced Hogan to sign with his blood.|$|E
25|$|A {{second volume}} of the series {{launched}} alongside Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten in 2014. Angel defends Magic Town against threats such as Amy Madison during Faith's absence, and acquires several new allies: Eldre Koh, an ancient Nitobe demon freed from his prison {{by the end of}} magic; Detective Brandt; Rory, a magically-mutated bartender; and the mutant Tricia and her boyfriend Parker. Angel is also aided by Sophronia and Lavinia, as well as Nadira, a Slayer who <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> for his actions as Twilight but found inner peace after being mutated, and has a deep connection with the magic of Magic Town, which has become sentient. Following Illyria's death in Buffy Season Nine, Angel finds Fred alive again, having been restored by the reset of the laws of magic; she is forced to share her body with Illyria but is able to keep the ancient demon mostly under control. Faith also returns, now working for Zane Pharmaceuticals. A crossover with Buffy Season Ten reveals a new demon villain: Archaeus, who sired the Master and is able to control all the vampires from that bloodline, including Angel, Spike and Drusilla. Angel travels to San Francisco to help Buffy combat the demon lord, discovering that Buffy and Spike are now in a relationship, which Angel believes will not last. Meanwhile, Faith and Fred discover Drusilla in Magic Town, building a vampire army for Archaeus, who follows Angel back to London. The season ends with a conflict between Archaeus and his vampire army (including Drusilla and Detective Brandt), and Angel and his makeshift 'family' (Faith, Fred/Illyria, Koh, Nadira, Sophronia and Lavinia, and the Magic Town populace). Observing the battle, the sentient magic is almost convinced to join Archaeus, but ultimately defends Nadira from him and traps Archaeus inside a statue.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the revelation}} of his true nature in the game's ending was third on 1UP.com's list of top-five video-game {{spoilers}} (reducing [...] "at least two 1UP staffers {{to a state of}} misty-eyed mourning"), Tidus' resurrection in the sequel was called unrealistic. GamesRadar's Dave Meikleham found the character's fate in the first game confusing; he appears to be alive in the epilogue despite his disappearance, which is not explained until the sequel's end. Matthew Walker of Cheat Code Central wrote that Tidus told his father he <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> in the climax, but later appreciated him. According to Walker, the game's final scene was intended to give hope that Tidus was alive; Walker found the ending (where Sin's defeat makes Tidus disappear) sad.|$|E
500|$|As a consequence, Russell was {{extremely}} sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not. He {{was active in}} the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called [...] "Felton X", presumably {{in the tradition of the}} Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an [...] "X", and even purchased land in Liberia. Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: [...] "I dislike most white people because they are people... I like most blacks because I am black"; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: [...] "I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If I looked at it objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency." [...] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he <b>hated</b> <b>him,</b> Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.|$|E
500|$|Lu'lu' al-Kabir died in 1008 and was {{succeeded by}} Mansur. Mansur {{attempted}} to concentrate further power {{into his hands}} {{at the expense of}} the Aleppine aʿyān (local elite), though he formally continued his predecessors' policy of separating the Emirate of Aleppo's civil administration from its military command. On the diplomatic front, he maintained the Byzantines' virtual protectorate over Aleppo, though he also developed contacts with the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate. Basing his information on the chronicles of medieval Aleppine historians, historian Suhayl Zakkar wrote, Unlike his father, Mansur was over-confident, short-sighted, a drunkard, ' oppressor and unjust'. Because of this the Aleppines <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> and several of their poets cursed him in their poems. ... The population of Aleppo ... began to search for a way to get rid of him. As time went by he was heedlessly and arrogantly increasing his oppression. ... the Aleppines found that the restoration of the Hamdanid dynasty would be the solution. They recalled and emphasized the fact that Mansur himself was the son of [...] Hamdanids' slave who had betrayed his masters and who had usurped their rights.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{was created}} in spring 2009 during a story conference, where {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer, storyliner Dominic Treadwell-Collins, series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown, series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke were considering what {{to do for the}} Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone <b>hated</b> <b>him,</b> and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept for as long as possible, and managed the story on a need-to-know basis. The live episode's director, Clive Arnold, became the seventh person to discover the identity of the murderer. They went through the characters to decide who would create a [...] "shiver" [...] moment, and decided against Janine, even though she could have done it, because she has killed before. The killer was going to be Archie's wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), until producers discovered Windsor had planned to leave the show, so they decided on Stacey. Although scripts initially diverted attention away from Stacey, Santer realised that drawing attention away from her too much might make it more apparent.|$|E
