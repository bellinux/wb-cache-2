Clinical care and pedagogic concern would be cast onto the rubbish-tip of civilization. -Barbara Sichtermann, "The Lost Eroticism ofthe Breasts" It's often speculated in the breastfeedingliterature that one reason breastfeeding has been such a hard sell in the post-industrial West is that we prefer to think ofthe female breast as the most sociable of sex aids, rather than as a customized food delivery system for babies and young children. I t is not just that the breast is considered by some to be too sexy for motherhood, hence the property of adult males, and an object that must be protected from the wear and tear that breastfeeding is sometimes reputed to involve. Instead, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> argument more closely, the breast in question [...] which is an idealized, deodor-ized, and denatured breast [...] promises a certain kind of Disneyfied, cartoon sex that is free fiom many of the risks relating to real, grungy, grown-up sex. Whiie on the one hand this breast is being protected from the hard yakka oflong-term lactation, it is also being straight-jacketed into a particularly narrow concept of nooky, a kind of second-base substitute for the real thing. Not just adult males, but women too, have been seduced by this notion of the breast as both exquisitely refined, yet erogenous, a part of the sexual body that can be adored without the ambivalence or horror that the genitals are apt to inspire. This is sex with arrested development, safely packaged in broderie anglaise, and draped by a cashmere twin-set, awaiting its first grope in the secure darkness of cinema or car.

40|$|Credit from stored grain Cue: Farmers {{are often}} {{forced to sell}} their crops when prices are low, because they need money quickly. One way to get better prices {{is known as the}} {{warehouse}} receipt system. Under this system, farmers are able to deposit their harvested maize in a warehouse and be given a receipt which states the amount {{and the quality of the}} grain they have stored. The farmer can then, if they wish, give this receipt to a bank in order to obtain a loan, enabling them to buy inputs for the new season or pay for other items. Later in the season when grain prices should have risen, the farmer can sell the stored maize, repay the loan and hopefully have some money left over. So in Zambia, a few years ago the Zambia Agricultural Commodity Agency tried to set up a warehouse receipt system. But it failed. So why did a system that sounded so good for commercial farmers not deliver better profits? To find out, Chris Kakunta spoke to Rob Munro, a marketing adviser for USAID, which helped to set up the pilot project. IN:	?Essentially it was a very donor-driven ? OUT:	?a commercial commodities market. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Rob Munro of USAID in Zambia, on some of the challenges connected with the warehouse receipt system, in providing credit to smallholder farmers. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Munro	Essentially it was a very donor-driven entity, in that the commodity traders and the banks never really bought into the concept of warehouse receipts. Kakunta	And that led to it failing? Munro	Essentially yes. But I think one of the key problems here, and this will bring us on to lessons which we?ve learnt from that experience, is that a warehouse receipt system depends on the existence of a functioning, high volume commodities market. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> year in particular, there is very little maize stored in warehouses. There is very little maize in total, from this particular harvest and there is no incentive for farmers to be depositing crop into a warehouse, looking for higher prices further into the year. Kakunta	If we have to really look at the system itself, does it really work? Munro	I think the answer to that is yes. It requires the presence of a very strong commodities market where there is plenty of supply, ample demand, multiple buyers and also, critically, a credible pricing system. Kakunta	What is the way forward in terms of warehouse receipt system here in Zambia? Munro	I think it?s important to realise that from a smallholder?s point of view, a warehouse receipt is not the answer to all his or her marketing problems. I think where the primary value of it lies is that by putting commodity into a secure storage at grades and standards in terms of quality and quantity which are recognised by the industry, that warehouse receipt becomes a very valuable trading tool. So I think that?s its primary use as a trading tool, allowing small, relatively small parcels of crop to be aggregated into a large parcel which is then accessible by commercial markets. Secondary to that is a financing option. And I think it?s important to realise that the cost of finance is very high. You need to be very sure, if you are looking for finance from a warehouse receipt, you need to be very sure that the gains in price which you are hoping to take advantage of later on in the season are significantly more than your costs of finance. There have been examples in Zambia, one in particular I?m thinking of, where a crop was deposited at the beginning of the marketing season, held onto until later on in the year, and by the time that crop was released from the warehouse it was actually worth less than the combination of its underlying price and the price of storage and finance. So it?s a risky? like any financing, like any market speculation, it?s a risky business. And therefore it?s not the answer for all smallholders. But I think, like I said, more importantly it?s a valuable tool for bringing your crop into a commercial commodities market. End of track.

40|$|Cue: Kenya is {{a country}} {{well-known}} for its livestock keeping. Recently however, {{some have argued that}} the nature of livestock keeping in Kenya needs to change, in order to increase the economic benefit to the country. Central to this idea is the need to export more animals and animal products to foreign markets, where Kenyan exports can earn good prices. But if a country is serious about selling livestock to foreign markets, achieving the highest standards of animal health is critically important. Where health standards are low, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease can easily occur, leading to bans on all animal movements and the closing of borders to livestock trade. But how can costly disease outbreaks be stopped? To find out, Eric Kadenge spoke to Dr David Ikiror, an animal health scientist working in Kenya. IN: 		?Just like human beings? OUT:		? reap the maximum benefits. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 05 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr David Ikiror, emphasising how good livestock health can bring substantial economic benefits. Transcript Ikiror	Just like human beings, we need to be healthy in order to be productive. So for you {{to be able to get}} the optimal production and productivity from your livestock, surely you have to keep your livestock healthy otherwise the feeding and the other things that you do alone will not be enough. And also of course, if you keep your livestock healthy, then also you can access markets. Kadenge	Now that is very very interesting and I would like to go ahead and find out - what are some of the ways that we can prevent our animals from getting sick? Ikiror	We all know that proper feeding is very very important in maintaining human health. The same thing applies to animals. They need to get a balanced diet: proteins, they need to get vitamins, they need to get energy, they need to get water, mineral salts, they are all very necessary to keep our animals healthy. Also we need to, just like for human beings, we need to talk of hygiene. We need to have a clean environment where our animals stay. In other words, if an animal is kept like in a zero grazing unit, you need to be cleaning the place - removing the dung, removing the urine - to make sure that the environment is clean. And of course even the housing is important especially for young animals. They should be housed in such a way that you protect them from excesses of weather, like excessive wind, which can predispose them to pneumonia or also rainfall. We need to make sure that our animals are protected from pests. We are talking of things like ticks, so we need to dip our animals regularly. We need to make sure that our animals also are de-wormed; de-worm them regularly to lower the worm burden. We need to make sure that also our animals are vaccinated against some - there are some diseases which can be protected through vaccination. So those are some of the ways in which we can keep our animals healthy. Kadenge	And for the sake of maybe a farmer or a livestock trader as you said - that would like to be able to maybe identify when his livestock has a disease, are there some common things that one can probably notice that will indicate that an animal is unhealthy? Ikiror	We can talk of somebody knowing the signs of a healthy animal. A healthy animal will usually show a smooth hair coat, smooth skin, it will be active and the eyes will not be tearing. If it is an animal with a tail - the tail will be moving continuously, it will be walking normally. If the urine is passed, it will be normal urine. The dung also it will be normal - normal colour, normal consistency. Then if it is an animal that?s for example producing milk - if it is a cow or a goat which is milking then the milk will be normal, of normal colour and consistency. And also <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> animal on the body, you will not see any sign of parasites for example. That is a sign of an animal that is healthy. So in other words, the normal things that you would expect a normal animal to have. Kadenge	Is there anything else that you would like to add? Ikiror	What I would like to add is to say that basically, livestock is now being identified as one of the important engines that will spur economic development. In fact if we talk about the recovery of the economy, livestock is being earmarked as one of the main drivers. And it is being seen not only producing food for our consumption but we are also thinking in terms of producing these animal products and also animals themselves for the export markets. And as a farmer it will be very very necessary for us to double our efforts and even improving our livestock and also its important not only to look at the health but let?s look at the kind of breeds that we keep in our area. That?s why I am saying that it is important that we seek advice from experts so that we can get advice on which animals to keep in which particular area and on the general management. The important thing is we should move away from subsistence form of livestock production to more market oriented. That way as farmers and as a nation we can reap the maximum benefits. End of track. Dr David Ikiror, an animal health scientist working in Kenya describes the basic principles of good livestock health and argues t hat livestock farmers must become more market oriented...|$|E
