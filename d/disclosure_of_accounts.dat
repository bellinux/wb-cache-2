40|$|Not for Profit Organizations (NPOs) are {{the subject}} {{in the middle of}} a {{relevant}} debate by scholars, politicians and public opinion and some efforts were done to measure economic dimensions of “third sector” by Research centres and international institutions while there is a remarkable lack of homogeneity concerning NPOs’ accounting regulation in the European Union. Each country has its own accounting regulatory system, strongly depending by civil and tax laws; this reduces both NPO’s disclosure and prevents scholars to comprehend the real state of social economy system at European level and their financial performance. Moreover it makes NPOs’ chance to operate in a foreign country into the enlarged EU very difficult and make difficult an homogeneity in NPOs treatment at European level. A European agenda to support the accountability development in the third sector should define a minimum common framework for institutional and governance features, financial accounting and social accountability for different kinds of NPO, beginning starting from the different national regulations. In particular an hypothesys of “European NPOss’ framework” for financial reporting (a first step to a better accountability) hasve to consider different regulations in order to: a) legal entities form in which NPOs arehave constituted instituted in EU countries end and their regulations (specific for NPOs or general for commercial entities); b) accounting and auditing obligations (keep accounting records, prepare annual accounts, provide financial reporting) and audit them; c) mandatory annual report provided by the NPOs (mission statement, asset and liability statement, statement of financial activities, explanatory notes, trustees report) d) <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> disclosure (make the accounts available to the public on request or deposit it in a public register); e) accounting principles for NPOs (cash or accrual basis, light regulation for smaller entities, Ifrs implementation); f) a model for NPOs financial performance evaluation based on financial statement (significant ratio in accounting aggregates; To define a common framework we start from a comparationmatching between Spanish, Italian, and English regulations (law and practice) applied to NPOs to highlight similarities and differences.

ABSTRACT: Managers are allowed considerable discretion over how they announce an accounting restatement. Some firms issue a press release that discloses the restatement in the headline (high prominence); others provide a press release with a headline on a different subject (for example, earnings news) but discuss the misstatement in the press release (medium prominence); and most of the remaining firms simply change the comparative-period amounts reported in an earnings release, with no direct mention of the restatement (low prominence). Mean three-day returns are negative and differ substantially across these categories <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> prominence (- 8. 3 %,- 4. 0 %, and- 1. 5 % for high, medium, and low prominence, respectively). We investigate whether this pattern is due to differences in the severity <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> irregularity or in the relative transparency of the three press release formats. Our tests support the latter explanation. We also find that companies providing less prominent press release <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> their restatement {{are less likely to be}} sued for securities fraud. In sum, both return and litigation tests indicate that ―silence can be golden. ‖ Stealth <b>Disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accounting</b> Irregularities: Is Silence Golden? I...|$|R

The primary objective {{of the study is}} to analyse the financial characteristics of firms that provide extensive disclosures, and assess the financial impact of their motives, such as for example the need to raise equity finance. The study examines the financial attributes of firms that disclose information about key accounting issues including risk exposure, changes in <b>accounting</b> policies, use <b>of</b> international financial reporting standards and hedging practices. Firms are inclined to disclose accounting information in order to assure the market participants that their accounting policies are consistent with the accounting regulation and meet the information needs of their stakeholders. The study shows that in order to raise finance in the capital and debt markets, firms tend to provide extensive accounting disclosures. Firms that provide informative accounting disclosures appear to display higher size, growth and leverage measures. The findings also show that the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> sensitive <b>accounting</b> information has not adversely affected firms' profitability. In fact, firms that provide detailed accounting disclosures tend to exhibit higher profitability. The implementation of international financial reporting standards enhances the quality and the comparability of financial statements; hence it promotes consistency and reliability in financial reporting and facilitates companies in raising capital internationally. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In some cases the underlying is not an object, but a procedure which is developed with the purpose of standardising the calculations as to become comparable (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 1980 a). In the beginning of the 1970 ’s in the accounting information literature, simultaneously with the foundation of the American Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), an academic discussion regarding which qualitative characteristics accounting information ought to have, emerges (e. g.
