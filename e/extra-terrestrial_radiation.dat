It allows for variation in incident direct and diffuse radiation associated with location (latitude), time of year, time of day, and atmospheric condition, which is expressed as the degree of transmission of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>radiation.</b> It also allows for variation in photosynthetic capacity associated with average specific leaf N of the canopy and its distribution in the canopy. Daily canopy photosynthesis, intercepted radiation, and radiation use efficiency (RUE) are obtained by numerical integration of instantaneous values calculated at specific times of the day. The framework predicted experimentally determined RUE values accurately and quantified the contribution of each major factor to variation in RUE.

A tendency occurred towards {{a reduction in}} UV intensity during the months of June, July, August and September in each year. A calculation was made, and averaged, over several years regarding the ratio of UV intensity for each month to the average global solar radiation for that month, on a horizontal surface. The average annual ratio {{was found to be}} 3. 87 % with a lowest value of 3. 3 % and a highest value of 4. 35 %. The measured UV intensity in Bahrain was compared with those measured in countries in the Arabian Gulf, Middle East, Northern Europe and in Alaska. An empirical equation has been developed which estimates the monthly average UV intensity, with a maximum monthly percentage error of not more than 24 %.

Since FPGAs offer flexibility, the effects {{of radiation}} on them need to be studied and robust methods of fault tolerance need to be devised. In this paper a new fault-tolerant design strategy has been presented. This strategy exploits the relation between changes in inputs and the expected change in output. Essentially, it predicts {{whether or not a}} change in the output is expected and thereby calculates the error. As a result this strategy reduces hardware and time redundancy required by existing strategies like Duplication with Comparison (DWC) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). The design arising from this strategy has been simulated and its robustness to fault-injection has been verified. Simulations for a 16 bit multiplier show that the new design strategy performs better than the state-of-the-art on critical factors such as hardware redundancy, time redundancy and power consumption...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze global, {{direct and}} diffuse solar {{radiation}} data on a horizontal surface observed at stations in Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou {{for the period of}} 1961 to 2000. The data include monthly averages of the daily clearness index (G=G 0 : the ratio of global to <b>extra-terrestrial</b> solar <b>radiation)</b> and the diffuse fraction (D=G: the ratio of diffuse to global solar radiation. The present study has processed and analyzed the data, including variables or statistics of mean, and annual monthly and daily total, the diurnal variation and the frequency of daily totals of global solar radiation. A correlation be-tween daily values of clearness index and diffuse fraction is obtained and recommended correlation equations were calculated. The annual variations and trend of yearly series are analyzed for daily global, direct and diffuse radia-tion on a horizontal surface, as well as for daily clear-ness index and diffuse fraction in Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou. The results show: 1) the east China is charac-terized by a decrease in global and direct radiation and a little increase in diffuse radiation and a negative linear relationship was obtained between clearness index and dif-fuse fraction. 2) The annual variations of global, direct and diffuse radiation for Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou are similar with relative low values of global and direct radiation in June due to the Meiyu period. 3) The acceler-ation of air pollution and decrease of relative sunshine are the possible causes for the decrease of global and direct radiation. 1...|$|R

Daily data on sunshine duration (n) and global solar radiation (Rs) from the Constanta weather station were used {{for a period of}} 30 years, between 1971 and 2000.

40|$|Daily global solar {{radiation}} is fundamental to most ecological and biophysical processes because it {{plays a key role}} in the local and global energy budget. However, gridded information about the spatial distribution of {{solar radiation}} is limited. This study aims to parameterise the Bristow-Campbell model for the daily {{global solar radiation}} estimation in the Tibetan Plateau and propose a method to rasterise the daily global solar radiation. Observed daily solar radiation and diurnal temperature data from eleven stations over the Tibetan Plateau during 1971 - 2010 were used to calibrate and validate the Bristow-Campbell radiation model. The <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> and clear sky atmospheric transmittance were calculated on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Results show that the Bristow-Campbell model performs well after adjusting the parameters, the average Pearson's correlation coefficients (r), Nash-Sutcliffe equation (NSE), ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), and root mean-square error (RMSE) of 11 stations are 0. 85, 2. 81 MJ m(- 2) day(- 1), 0. 3 and 0. 77 respectively. Gridded maximum and minimum average temperature data were obtained using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and validated by the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) stations' data. The spatial daily global solar radiation distribution pattern was estimated and analysed by combining the solar radiation model (Bristow-Campbell model) and meteorological interpolation model (PRISM). Based on the overall results, it can be concluded that a calibrated Bristow-Campbell performs well for the Tibetan Plateau and can provide reasonably accurate global solar radiation estimates. The Bristow-Campbell radiation model coupled with the PRISM is effective in rasterising global solar radiation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The sun {{produces}} {{a vast amount}} of energy. The energy emitted by the sun is called solar energy or solar radiation. Despite the considerable distance between the sun and the earth, the amount of solar energy reaching the earth is substantial. At any one time, the earth intercepts approximately 180 106 GW. Solar radiation is the earth primary natural source of energy and by a long way. Other sources are: the geothermal heat flux generated by the earth interior, natural terrestrial radioactivity, and cosmic radiation, which are all negligible relative to solar radiation. As a consequence, the solar radiation influences many aspects of the earth, including weather and climate, ocean, life on earth, agronomy and horticulture, forestry, ecology, oenology, energy, architecture and building engineering, or materials weathering. These lecture notes intend to present the fundamentals in solar radiation at earth surface to a wide community. Its content originates from lectures given to students of master degree level or higher, engineers and researchers in climate, geophysics and environment sciences, life sciences, or energy. This document should be valuable to any engineer, scientist and practitioner. The solar radiation received at a given geographical site varies in time: between day-night due to the earth rotation and between seasons because of the earth orbit. At a given time it also varies in space, because of the changes in the obliquity of the solar rays with longitude and latitude. Notwithstanding the effects of the clouds and other atmospheric constituents, the solar radiation received at a given location and time depends upon the relative position of the sun and the earth. This is why both sun-earth geometry and time {{play an important role in}} the amount of solar radiation received at earth surface. A major part of this textbook is devoted to this matter. The geometry of the earth relative to the sun is described as well as its variation throughout the year. The concept of time is very important in solar radiation. It is detailed here and the notions of mean solar time and true solar time are dealt with. The apparent course of the sun in the sky is described; the solar zenithal, elevation and azimuthal angles are defined. These angles are identical at top of the atmosphere and earth surface; no change is introduced by the atmosphere. Equations are given in this part that can be easily introduced in e. g., a spreadsheet or a computer routine, to compute all quantities and reproduce the figures. Both horizontal and inclined surfaces are dealt with. The amount of solar radiation that is intercepted by the earth varies because of variations in sun-earth distance and as far as the spectral distribution is concerned by day-to-day variations due to solar activity. The closer to the sun the earth, the greater the solar irradiance impinging on a plane normal to the sun rays and located at the top of the atmosphere. The total solar irradiance, often abbreviated in TSI, is the yearly average of this irradiance during a year integrated over the whole spectrum. The variations within a year amount to ± 3 % of the TSI. The spectral distribution of the <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> is such that about half of it lies in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It produces daylight and is well perceived by the human vision system. Other parts of it are in the near-infrared and ultraviolet ranges. A series of equations is offered to compute the extra-terrestrial total radiation for any instant and for any inclined surface. During its path downwards to the earth surface, the constituents of the atmosphere deplete the incident solar radiation. On average, less than half of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> reaches ground level. A good knowledge of the optical properties of the atmosphere is necessary to understand and model the depletion of the radiation. The description and modelling of the optical processes affecting the solar radiation within the atmosphere is called radiative transfer. The phenomena of scattering and absorption are presented and the effects of molecules, aerosols, gases and clouds on radiation are discussed. Several examples are given that illustrate atmospheric effects as a function of the solar zenithal angle and atmospheric optical properties. Even when the sky is very clear with no clouds, approximately 20 % to 30 % of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> is lost during the downwelling path by scattering and absorption phenomena by aerosols and molecules. The role of the clouds is of paramount importance: optically thin clouds allow a small proportion of radiation to reach the ground while optically thick clouds create obscurity by stopping the radiation downwards. The magnitude of the depletion of the radiation varies with wavelength and the spectral distribution of the solar radiation is modified as the radiation makes its path downwards. The spectral distribution is discussed for several different conditions. The direct, diffuse and reflected components of the solar radiation at earth surface are defined. How to compute them on an inclined surface is briefly discussed and equations are provided. The direct radiation is the radiation coming from the direction of the sun. Only direct radiation is present at the top of the atmosphere. On the contrary, the radiation at surface comprises a direct and a diffuse components, the sum being called the global radiation. If a tilted surface is under concern, then it may also receive a reflected component that is a part of the radiation reflected by the surrounding landscape. How to compute each component on an inclined surface is briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|In the BOSS {{experiment}} (biofilm organisms surfing space), {{which was}} performed {{in the context of}} the successfully finalized EXPOSE-R 2 mission, an international consortium of scientists investigated the ability of a variety of organisms to survive in space and on Mars as a function of their life style. The question in focus is whether there are different strategies for individually living microorganisms (planktonic state) compared to a microbial consortium of the same cells (biofilm state) to cope with the unique mixture of extreme stress factors including desiccation, gamma-, ionizing- and UV radiation in this environment. Biofilms, in which the cells are encased in a self-produced matrix of excreted extracellular polymeric substances, are one of the oldest clear signs of life on Earth. Since they can become fossilized they might also be detected as the first life forms on other planets and moons of the solar system and are therefore ideal candidates for astrobiological investigations. As an exam- ple for the organisms that attended the EXPOSE-R 2 mission the results of the flight and mission ground reference analysis of Deinococcus geothermalis are presented. Deinococcus geothermalis is a non-spore-forming, gram-positive, orange-pigmented representative of the Deinococcus family which is unparalleled in its poly-extreme resistances to a variety of envi- ronmental stress factors on Earth. The results demonstrate that Deinococcus geothermalis remains viable in the desiccated state over almost 2 years, whereas culturability was pre- served in biofilm cells at a significantly higher level than in planktonic cells. Furthermore, cells of both sample types were able to survive simulated space and Martian conditions and showed high resistance towards <b>extra-terrestrial</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> Additionally results of cultivation-independent investigations of pigment stability, membrane integrity, enzyme ac- tivity, ATP content and DNA integrity will be discussed. To conclude, biofilms exhibit an enhanced rate of survival compared to their planktonic counterparts when exposed to space and Martian conditions. This seems to indicate an advantage of living as a biofilm when facing the poly-extreme conditions of space or Mars. The findings will contribute to the understanding of the opportunities and limitations of life under the extreme environmental conditions of space or other planets as function of the state of life and aims to contribute to the understanding of the adaptation mechanisms that allow microorga isms to survive in extreme environments, possibly including space and the surface of Mars...|$|R

The lens was positioned approximately 1 m above ground level, pointed directly upward, with {{the top of the}} camera oriented to magnetic north. Photography was performed only on uniformly overcast days to ensure no overexposure of photos that would give false measures of canopy coverage during analysis. Three {{photographs were}} taken within each quadrat at 5 m, 10 m, and 15 m as measured from the corner of the quadrat along the 20 m side and 1 m {{from the edge of the}} 2 m side. Gap Light Analyser (GLA) V 2 (Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, New York, USA) was used to analyze the canopy photographs. This program determined direct and diffuse light at the point at which the image was taken (i.e., 1 m above ground). Data for total <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> and the monthly cloudiness index for the region (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2014) were used to calculate the spectral fraction (the percentage of all solar radiation falling at ground level that is photosynthetically active) and the beam fraction (the percentage of direct and diffuse light as modified by clouds) as described in Frazer et al. (1999). These data, along with the mean elevation and the approximate center co-ordinate of all sites, were entered into the GLA program to calculate the incoming PAR at each site. The GLA software allows a user-defined setting of the color threshold when converting to black and white. For this reason, all images were converted into black and white within the program using the same threshold setting of 220, chosen subjectively to best match the unmodified photographs, and used for all photographs for consistency between analyses.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop the indicatri es of reflected solar radiation from different natural surfaces and to show comparisons between values sensed in space of emergent radiation to ground values obtained from accounting for anisotropic reflection and estimating the effect of the intervening atmosphere. Thus, this study demonstrated that a prior knowledge of the angular distribution of reflected radiation allows determining the true hemispherical reflected radiation from a narrow field of view instrument such as found on a flying platform. Measurements for determining the indicatrices were made from a tower-mounted Nimbus MRIR and, in one case, with a hand-held TIROS five-channel radiometer. Anisotropy of reflected radiation was found for all surfaces examined and increased with decreasing solar angle. Different surfaces showed different degrees and patterns of fonvard and backscatter. A clearly defined anti-solar point was found for plowed field, various agricultural crops and vegetated desert surfaces, while snow, the Alkali Flats, and Bonneville Salt Flats showed a broad pattern of backscatter. As a consequence of surfaces exhibiting well-defined antisolar points the anisotropic correction factors relating normal reflectances to 2 π reflected values were less than 100 percent for solar angles greater than approximately 60 °. All surfaces examined showed anisotropic correction factors increasing with decreasing solar angles. The albedo over the White Sands dune field decreased with decreasing solar angles due to large shadow patterns which are produced at low solar angles. The sand dunes values were derived from aircraft measurements. Comparisons were made between estimated emergent radiation {{from the top of the}} earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere accounting for anisotropy of the ground reflection pattern and estimates of atmospheric attenuation to values of reflected radiation obtained from the MSS subsystem of the ERTS program for the lava beds region and White Sands area in New Mexico. Also comparisons were shown between the estimated emergent radiation from the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface for the same features and spectral bands to the values sensed in space.
