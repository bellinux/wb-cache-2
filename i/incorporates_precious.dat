In 1984, Theo was persuaded to produce a Collection to be sold on the international market <b>incorporating</b> <b>precious</b> metals, crystal, enamelling, stone-carving, precious gems and porcelain. The St Petersburg Collection was launched {{to the public at}} Marshall Fields, Chicago in 1985.Theo’s Fabergé’s daughter, Sarah Fabergé launched her first designs for the St Petersburg Collection in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The codex is {{the second}} oldest {{surviving}} manuscript of the Primary Chronicle, after the Laurentian Codex. The Hypatian manuscript dates back to ca. 1425, but it <b>incorporates</b> much <b>precious</b> information from the lost 12th-century Kievan and 13th-century Galician chronicles. The codex was possibly compiled {{at the end of}} the 13th century.|$|R
5000|$|A dance card [...] or {{programme}} du bal (also {{known by}} its German-language name, Tanzkarte) is used by a woman to record {{the names of the}} gentlemen with whom she intends to dance each successive dance at a formal ball.They appear to have originated in the 18th century, but their use first became widespread in 19th century Vienna, especially at the massive balls during Fasching before Lent. An actual dance card is typically a booklet with a decorative cover, listing dance titles, composers, and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady's wrist or ball gown. From the 19th century until World War I, dance cards for the elite of Austria-Hungary were often very elaborate, with some even <b>incorporating</b> <b>precious</b> metals and jewels.|$|R
50|$|The pipes may be custom made, {{allowing}} the smoker {{to specify the}} dimensions and design. Midwakh are crafted {{from a variety of}} materials including wood, bone, base metal, marble, steel, gold, silver, plastic (with a metal bowl), or glass. They may <b>incorporate</b> <b>precious</b> items such as diamonds, gemstones and rings of precious metal inscribed with symbols, such as a falcon similar to the one shown in the UAE coat of arms. The pipe may be crafted to resemble a dromedary camel, a highly revered animal in the UAE; the opening of the bowl shaped as the camel's mouth, with a small hole connected to a metal shaft inside the body of the pipe to conduct the smoke to the user. Among many modern variations of the midwakh, some are covertly disguised as pens, some can be split apart for cleaning, and some can have double bowls or double stems. Most midwakhs crafted today have a mouthpiece sized to fit a plastic filter.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 My thesis project {{explores the}} use of {{carefully}} orchestrated, patterned paintings depicting domestic interiors with bold, flat, layered planes of color, repeated motifs, and a shallow sense of space. Pattern is everywhere I look - in nature, decorative home furnishings, on clothing, animals, etc. I love pattern and my paintings reflect the joyful contemplation of their orderly repetition. I find inspiration in decorative organic form. From wind-swept leaves dancing on an afternoon run and a beautiful bouquet of flowers at the local market stand to the clothes in my closet and cherished domestic objects, pattern adorns every corner of my life. I have <b>incorporated</b> <b>precious</b> items from my own home, memories of places and things, as well as imagery gleaned from photographs and online content of interiors I can only dream of. The patterns adorning the surface of my work are born from the desire for order and predictability. A sense of balance, repetition, joyful color, {{and a little bit}} of friendly confusion guide my decision-making process. My painting represents an artful meditation on everyday, domestic life...|$|R

40|$|The {{universal}} {{thinking about}} jewelry {{is that it}} is an art form with monetary value. Often, people consider jewelry or body ornamentation to be a symbol of riches—precious items with great monetary value. As a result, most jewelers prefer to use precious metals, gemstones and the like, in its production. This thesis explores the meanings and forms of jewelry that does not <b>incorporate</b> such <b>precious</b> materials. Instead of focusing on the value of the materials, their other qualities and the alternative aesthetics will be approached and discussed. Creating new meanings and visual designs that address the beauty, style, wearability, and form of jewelry will be another point to be dealt with. In short, I want to focus on the beauty of the form and the story each piece tells...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy demand}} {{of the world}} is {{increasing}} and the depletion of its reserves of fossil fuels are making energy production more expensive. The challenge therefore falls on researchers to develop novel ways of meeting this increased energy demand which are both cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Utilisation of biomass will be vital in achieving this goal because of its abundance and availability. In particular, levulinic acid has been identified as a valuable chemical feedstock. It can be easily converted into γ-valerolactone, which has vast potential applications in both the fuel and chemicals industries. The work presented in this thesis primarily focusses on the hydrogenation of levulinic acid into γ- valerolactone. Hydrogenation of levulinic acid is well known, but catalysts that facilitate it usually <b>incorporate</b> expensive <b>precious</b> metals. In order for a process to become truly sustainable, the catalysts should also be sustainable. This requirement makes research into the use of cheap and abundant materials as catalysts desirable. The work presented in this thesis investigated the use of critical, precious metal catalysts compared with the cheaper, abundant, and non-critical base metals as potential replacements. An investigation into lactic acid hydrogenation to 1, 2 -propanediol as a model reaction for levulinic acid hydrogenation was also carried out. Chapter 3 provides comparative data of a 5 wt. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the synthesis and characterisation of layered hydroxy anion exchange materials. The incorporation of rare-earth cations into these materials {{offers the potential}} to combine the optical, magnetic and catalytic properties of the lanthanides with the flexibility of intercalation hosts. A {{review of the literature}} surrounding intercalation chemistry and materials is presented in Chapter 1. Here the synthesis, structure and anion exchange reactions of layered hydroxides and their applications in the fields of catalysis, separation science, polymer additives and biological storage and delivery are discussed. Chapter 2 describes the hydrothermal synthesis and anion exchange capacity of new anion exchange host lattices containing the smaller lanthanide cations, with the composition Ln 2 (OH) 5 NO 3 • 1. 5 H 2 O (Ln = Y, Gd - Lu), with Gd marking a limiting cation radius. Anion exchange reactions are facile {{with a wide range of}} organic carboxylates and sulfonates and investigations into their selectivity and optical properties have been carried out. This family has also been expanded to include Ln 2 (OH) 5 X• 1. 5 H 2 O (X = Cl, Br; Ln = Y, Dy, Er, Yb) and crystal structures for orthorhombic and monoclinic Yb 2 (OH) 5 Cl• 1. 5 H 2 O are reported. The findings of a time-resolved in situ X-ray powder diffraction study form the basis of Chapter 3. Three different phases with the layer composition [Yb 2 (OH) 5]+; Yb 2 (OH) 5 NO 3 • 1. 5 H 2 O d = 9. 2 Å (1), Yb 2 (OH) 5 NO 3 • 2 H 2 O d = 9. 4 Å (2) and Yb 2 (OH) 5 NO 3 •H 2 O d = 8. 5 Å (3) were observed and shown to ultimately transform to a 3 D structure Yb 4 O(OH) 9 NO 3 d = 8. 0 Å (4). Single crystal structures are given for phases 2 and 3, and the structure of 4 has been refined. The effects of temperature and metal concentration on phase formation have been investigated and compared with ex situ results. A full kinetic analysis is presented including the activation energy for the formation of phase 2. The values extracted indicate that the mechanism of crystallisation is phase boundary controlled. In Chapter 4 the room temperature precipitation synthesis of a related family of anion exchange host lattices with the composition, Ln 2 (OH) 5 NO 3 •H 2 O (Ln = Y, Eu–Er) and MgAl layered double hydroxides <b>incorporating</b> the <b>precious</b> metals Ru and Pd are discussed. Details of synthetic routes to the novel materials described and the methods of characterisation used are given in Chapter 5. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
