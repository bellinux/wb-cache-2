5|$|Cancer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to {{grow out of}} control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the base {{sequence of the}} DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according {{to the effects of}} the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{definition}} {{of climate change}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the statistical properties (principally its mean and spread) of the climate system when considered {{over long periods of}} time, regardless of cause. Accordingly, fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades, such as El Niño, do not represent climate change.|$|E
25|$|In Pressure Support, the set inspiratory {{pressure}} {{support level}} is kept constant {{and there is}} a decelerating flow. The patient triggers all breaths. If there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the mechanical properties of the lung/thorax and patient effort, the delivered tidal volume will be affected. The user must then regulate the pressure support level to obtain desired ventilation.|$|E

Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the Milgram study, wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.|$|E

25|$|Polymer {{degradation}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the properties—tensile strength, color, shape, or molecular weight—of a polymer or polymer-based product {{under the}} influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, chemicals and, in some cases, galvanic action. It is often due to the scission of polymer chain bonds via hydrolysis, leading to a decrease in the molecular mass of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|Aberration {{should not}} be {{confused}} with parallax. The latter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the apparent position of a relatively nearby object, as measured by a moving observer, relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame. The amount of parallax depends on the distance of the object from the observer, whereas aberration does not. Aberration is also related to light-time correction and relativistic beaming, although it is often considered separately from these effects.|$|E

25|$|Phase 5 - Differentiation: At {{this stage}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the {{dynamics}} of identity as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the former colonial power as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting language change (with the aid of social differentiation) the new English koiné starts to show greater differentiation.|$|E
25|$|In LiDCO, the {{independent}} calibration technique is lithium chloride dilution using the Stewart-Hamilton principle. Lithium chloride dilution uses a peripheral vein and a peripheral arterial line. Like PiCCO, frequent calibration is recommended when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Q. Calibration events {{are limited in}} frequency because they involve the injection of lithium chloride and can be subject to errors {{in the presence of}} certain muscle relaxants. The PulseCO algorithm used by LiDCO is based on pulse power derivation and is not dependent on waveform morphology.|$|E
25|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} play {{an important}} role in action potentials. If enough channels open when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the cell's membrane potential, a small but significant number of Na+ ions will move into the cell down their electrochemical gradient, further depolarizing the cell. Thus, the more Na+ channels localized in a region of a cell's membrane the faster the action potential will propagate and the more excitable that area of the cell will be. This is an example of a positive feedback loop. The ability of these channels to assume a closed-inactivated state causes the refractory period and is critical for the propagation of action potentials down an axon.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the source}} of an EPR {{spectrum}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra for a single electron spin would consist of one line. However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constant of a nucleus {{is directly related to}} the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.|$|E
25|$|The key {{symptom of}} a glacier in disequilibrium is {{thinning}} along {{the entire length of}} the glacier. For example, Easton Glacier (pictured below) will likely shrink to half its size, but at a slowing rate of reduction, and stabilize at that size, despite the warmer temperature, over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier (pictured below) will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with shallow slopes such as Grinnell Glacier are most likely to fall into disequilibrium if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the local climate.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 8: Euler walks are {{possible}} if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. If we have 2 nodes {{with an odd}} number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired must begin at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must now have an even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> parity from an odd to even degree.|$|E
