40|$|Evaluating {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions at farm level {{is an important}} tool to mitigate climate change. Livestock account for 80 % of the total GHG emissions in Uruguay, and beef cow-calf systems are possibly the largest contributors. In cow-calf grazing systems, optimizing forage allowance and grazing intensity may increase pasture productivity, reproductive performance, beef productivity, and possibly reduce GHG emissions. This study estimated GHG <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> of live weight gain (LWG) and per hectare from 20 cow-calf systems in Uruguay, with different management practices. The GHG emissions were on average 20. 8 kg CO 2 -e. kg LWG- 1, ranging from 11. 4 to 32. 2. Beef productivity and reproductive efficiency were the main determinants of GHG emissions. Five farm clusters were identified with different productive and environmental efficiency by numerical classification of relevant variables. Improving grazing efficiency by optimizing the stocking rate and forage production can increase beef productivity by 22 % and reduce GHG <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> LWG by 28 % compared to “low performance ” management. Further improvements in reproductive efficiency can increase productivity by 41 % and reduce GHG <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> LWG by 23 %, resulting in a “carbon smart” strategy.

Lower CH 4 <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> milk were estimated on farms with high-producing cows consuming rations with lower neutral detergent fiber concentrations and higher amounts of concentrates.

The study also showed that higher N 2 O emissions were associated with higher amounts of commercial nitrogen fertilizer application; however, the main source of N 2 O emissions was from the manure deposited during the grazing period. Future approaches to reduce farm gate emissions of CH 4 per kg of milk in specialized dairy farms could include incorporating dietary fats in rations, feeding adequate amounts of concentrates and feeding forage at a more digestible stage. These findings are strongly influenced by the assumptions made in calculating CH 4 and N 2 O emissions but do highlight the critical areas which affect greenhouse gas emissions.

In summer, a semi-closed greenhouse improved energy use efficiency by 20 – 30 % and split-root fertigation by 0 – 15 %. Raising light intensity and applying inter- row lighting allowed higher yields in autumn to mid-winter without affecting electricity use efficiency.

This creates significant uncertainties when quantifying estimates of annual N 2 O emissions from grazed grasslands. Despite these uncertainties, the majority of studies are short-term in nature (< 1 year) and as a consequence, {{there is a lack}} of data on interannual variation in N 2 O emissions. The objectives of this study were to (i) quantify annual N 2 O emissions and (ii) assess the causes of interannual variation in emissions from grazed perennial ryegrass/white clover grassland. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured from fertilized and grazed perennial ryegrass/white clover grassland (WC) and from perennial ryegrass plots that were not grazed and did not receive N input (GB), over 4 years from 2008 to 2012 in Ireland (52 ? 512 ̆ 7 N, 08 ? 212 ̆ 7 W).

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{was based on}} a review of published measurements of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission from fertilized fields. From the literature data selections were made to analyze the importance of factors that regulate N 2 O production, including soil conditions, type of crop, nitrogen (N) fertilizer type and soil and crop management. Reported N 2 O losses from anhydrous ammonia and organic forms of N fertilizers or combinations of organic and synthetic N fertilizers are higher than those for other types of N fertilizer. However, the management and environmental conditions represented by the set of measurement data is too limited to be used for estimating emission factors for each fertilizer type individually. The literature data are appropriate for estimating the order of magnitude of emissions. The fertilizer-induced N 2 O emission is higher for measurements covering longer periods than for measurements which represent short periods. Therefore, a simple method to estimate the total annual direct N 2 O emission from fertilized fields was based on those measurements covering periods of one year, resulting in the following equation: N 2 O <b>emission</b> (<b>kg</b> N ha- 1. yr- 1) = 1 + 1. 25 +/- 1 % of the N application (kg N ha- 1. yr- 1).

40|$|Brazil has {{the largest}} herd of beef cattle in the world, {{estimated}} at approximately 200 million animals. Production is predominantly pasture-based and low input and hence time to slaughter is long, which promotes high methane (CH 4) <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> of product. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of increasing animal productivity using fertilizers, forage legumes, supplements and concentrates, on the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in five scenarios for beef production in Brazil. A life cycle analysis (LCA) approach, from birth of calves to mature animals ready for slaughter at the farm gate, was utilized using Tier 2 methodologies of the IPCC and the results expressed in equivalents of carbon dioxide (CO 2 eq) per kg of carcass produced. Fossil CO 2 emitted in the production of supplements, feeds and fertilizers was included using standard LCA techniques. The first four scenarios were based solely on cattle production on pasture, ranging from degraded Brachiaria pastures, through to a mixed legume/Brachiaria pasture and improved N-fertilized pastures of Guinea grass (Panicum maximum). Scenario 5 was the most intensive and was also based on an N-fertilized Guinea grass pasture, but with a 75 -day finishing period in confinement with total mixed ration (TMR). Across the scenarios from 1 to 5 the increase in digestibility promoted a reduction in the forage intake per unit of animal weight gain and a concomitant reduction in CH 4 emissions. For the estimation of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from animal excreta, emission factors from a study in the Cerrado region were utilized which postulated lower emission from dung than from urine and much lower emissions in the long dry season in this region. The greatest impact of intensification of the beef production systems was a 7 -fold reduction of the area necessary for production from 320 to 45 m 2 /kg carcass. Carcass production increased from 43 to 65 Mg per herd across the scenarios from 1 to 5, and total <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> carcass were estimated to be reduced from 58. 3 to 29. 4 kg CO 2 eq/kg carcass.

Emission of GHG was estimate using life cycle assessment with kg of milk and kg of energy corrected milk (ECM) delivered to the dairy factory, and kg of cheese at the retailor level in Denmark as functional units. Allocation at farm gate, between milk and meat, was made by biological relation between energy requirement to milk and meat production or economic allocation and at the dairy between cheese and whey using either economic allocation or system expansion. Inventory data was based on farm, herd and plant production data from commercial farms participation in on farm research activities with controlled production of hay, in combination with production information from cheese processing and literature estimates, all build into a static model. There was no effect of proportion of herbs in the hay on the emission of GHG, but an effect of breed. The <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> cheese was lowest from Jersey, 9. 88 kg CO 2 eq. per kg cheese, compared to 12. 1 and 12. 7 from two Holstein herds, although the <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> ECM at farm gate was highest from Jersey, but this was more than offset by higher utilization of Jersey milk for cheese. The emission from farm to retailor was below 10 % of the total emission, with the largest contribution from use of energy during manufacturing at the dairy, including storage. Methane with approximately 50 % of all emission was the major source, followed by emission associated to production of feed and rising of heifers. Use of energy for hay drying adds 7 - 8 % to the emission and soil carbon change in average 3 %, with some variation between farms. The sensitivity analysis showed a potential 6 - 7 % lower emission of methane due to the increased amount of herbs, while a higher amount of roots due to herbs only has marginal effect on soil carbon at product level.

Garlic leaves contain similar compounds as garlic bulbs, but are discarded in field after garlic bulb harvest. We speculate that feeding garlic leaves might show similar effect as garlic constituents in sheep and could be potential animal feed supplement. Thus, we examined the effect of freeze dried garlic leaves (FDGL) on rumen fermentation, methane emission, plasma glucose kinetics and nitrogen utilization in sheep. Methods Six sheep were fed Control diet (mixed hay and concentrate (60 : 40)) or FDGL diet (Control diet supplemented with FDGL at 2. 5  g/kg BW 0. 75 of sheep) using a crossover design. Methane gas emission was measured using open-circuit respiratory chamber. Plasma glucose turnover rate was measured using isotope dilution technique of [U- 13 C]glucose. Rumen fluid, feces and urine were collected to measure rumen fermentation characteristics and nitrogen utilization. Result No significant difference in rumen fermentation parameters was noticed except for rumen ammonia tended to be higher (0. 05  < P <  0. 1) in FDGL diet. Methane <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> dry matter ingested and methane <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> dry matter digested were lower (P <  0. 05) in FDGL diet. Plasma glucose concentration was similar between diets and plasma glucose turnover rate tended to be higher in FDGL diet (0. 05  < P <  0. 1). Nitrogen retention was higher (P <  0. 05) and microbial nitrogen supply tended to be higher (0. 05  < P <  0. 1) in FDGL diet.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between emission of methane (CH 4) and faecal and urinary losses of nitrogen (N) in dairy cattle, various dietary strategies were evaluated using a mechanistic model of fermentation and digestion processes. To simulate faecal and urinary composition, an extant dynamic, mechanistic model of rumen function and post-absorptive nutrient supply was extended with static equations that describe intestinal digestion and hindgut fermentation. The extended model predicts organic matter, carbon and N output in faeces and urine. Methane emissions were simulated using the same model including a mechanistic description of methanogenesis in the rumen and in the hindgut. Four different types of grass silage were explored at high and low N fertilization levels and early or late cutting. For each grass silage, 10 supplementation strategies that differed in level and type of supplement (no supplement, maize silage, straw, beet pulp, potatoes) and level of concentrate (20 or 40 % of total diet DM) were studied. Simulated total N and CH 4 excretion ranged from 211 to 588 g/d and 334 to 441 g/d, respectively, with a small, positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 15). When expressed per unit fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), a reduced N excretion (g N/kg FPCM) was associated with increased CH 4 emission (g CH 4 / kg FPCM) although the coefficient of determination was small (r 2 = 0. 22). This relationship varied between different treatments. For example, reducing N fertilization level lowered N excretion per kg FPCM, but increased CH 4 <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> FPCM, whereas supplementation with maize silage reduced both N excretion and CH 4 <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> FPCM. The ratio of urea-N in urine to total N excretion was negatively related to emission of CH 4 per kg FPCM (r 2 = 0. 54). This is of particular concern since urea in the urine, being quickly converted to ammonia, is susceptible to rapid volatilization. The present simulations indicate that measures to reduce N pollution from dairy cattle may increase CH 4 emission and highlight an important area for experimental research...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare added values for milk yield and {{predicted}} methane emissions of cows from local and cosmopolitan breeds reared in Italian circumstances. A number of studies showed that milk from local breeds is more suitable to be processed into cheese than that of cosmopolitan populations, so that the development of payment systems which account for the added values of milk destined to cheese production could support the conservation and valorization of local animal genetic resources. Also, the link of local breeds with traditions and the environment might partially compensate their low milk production. Breeders of Burlina, Reggiana, Rendena and Valdostana cows sell products in niche markets and they realize an extra added values per kg of milk of 66 percent, compared with Holstein Friesian. Market-oriented strategies to payment systems that include the added values of milk yield could enhance profitability and interest in rearing and safeguarding of local animal genetic resources; but, not all countries can apply these market strategies. Therefore, other alternative strategies to enrich the added values of milk production might be based on the differences in greenhouse gases emissions among breeds. Indeed, local animal genetic resources are expected reducing the greenhouse gases emissions because of their lowest metabolic body weight, respect to high selected animals. Individual methane emissions might be indirectly calculated using dry matter intake; the latter can be estimated using milk and fat production, and body weight. A reduction of 10 percent of daily methane <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> of metabolic body weight is expected for local compared with cosmopolitan breeds. In average, no differences were found among local and cosmopolitan breeds in terms of daily methane <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> of milk yield. In conclusion, animal genetic resources needs to be evaluated not only per unit of output but for other direct and indirect units of output related to social and human returns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Automobiles tend {{to become}} heavier as the safety (e. g., {{collision}} safety and comfort features) are improved. On the hand, the demand for higher fuel efficiency and lower environmental impact is also rising. The average mass of passenger cars has dramatically increased since the 70 ’s and because vehicle weight directly impacts fuel consumption, light-weighting is necessary more than ever to reduce <b>emissions.</b> 100 <b>kg</b> mass reduction achieved on a car saves 9 grams of per km at the exhaust pipe. Aluminum is the ideal light-weighting material as it allows a weight saving of up to 50 % over competing materials in most applications without compromising safety. This paper reports on developments and trends in aluminum alloy sheets for automotive body panels. As a long term vision, an (“Alu-maximised”) small family car could be 30 - 35 % lighter after primary and maximum secondary weight savings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between productivity of dairy production and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a global scale. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology {{was used to assess}} GHG emissions from dairy production and processing chains. Milk yield expressed as kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) per animal was chosen as a proxy for system productivity. On a per cow basis, GHG emissions increase with higher yields. However, GHG <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> FPCM decline substantially as animal productivity increases. The contribution of different gases to total GHG emissions of dairy production systems vary; methane and nitrous oxide emissions decrease with increasing productivity, while carbon dioxide emissions increase, but on a lower scale. Productivity increase therefore offers not only a pathway to satisfying increasing demand for milk but also a viable mitigation approach, especially in areas where milk yields are currently below 2000 kg/cow and year...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGreenhouse gas (GHG) {{emissions}} {{were evaluated}} from crop production through the on-farm {{portion of the}} milk supply chain for five production regions in the USA derived from publicly available data and from 536 surveys of farm operations collected from dairy operations nationwide. The production weighted national average footprint at the farm gate was 1. 23  kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) per kg of fat and protein corrected milk (fat, 4 %; protein 3. 3 %). Regional differences in GHG <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> milk produced can be primarily traced to differences in production and management practices. Feed-to-milk conversion efficiency is shown to be {{the single most important}} explanatory variable, followed by choice of manure management technology. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, GHG emissions reduction opportunities exist across the spectrum of dairy management options. However, as with all decisions, it is important to weigh potential trade-offs with other environmental and economic impacts...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} milk {{production}} have often focused on environmental impacts analysed using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. In grassland-based livestock systems, soil carbon sequestration {{might be a}} potential sink to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. Nevertheless, there is no commonly shared methodology. In this work, the GHG emissions of small-scale mountain dairy farms were assessed using the LCA approach. Two functional units, kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) and Utilizable Agricultural Land (UAL), and two different emissions allocations methods, no allocation and physical allocation, which accounts for the co-product beef, were considered. Two groups of small-scale dairy farms were identified based on the Livestock Units (LU) reared: 30 LU (HLU). Before considering soil carbon sequestration in LCA, performing no allocation methods, LLU farms tended to have higher GHG emission than HLU farms per kg of FPCM (1. 94 vs. 1. 59 kg CO 2 -eq/kg FPCM, P ≤ 0. 10), whereas the situation was reversed upon considering the m 2 of UAL as a functional unit (0. 29 vs. 0. 89 kg CO 2 -eq/m 2, P ≤ 0. 05). Conversely, considering physical allocation, {{the difference between the}} two groups became less noticeable. When the contribution from soil carbon sequestration was included in the LCA and no allocation method was performed, LLU farms registered higher values of GHG <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> of FPCM than HLU farms (1. 38 vs. 1. 10 kg CO 2 -eq/kg FPCM, P ≤ 0. 05), and the situation was likewise reversed in this case upon considering the m 2 of UAL as a functional unit (0. 22 vs. 0. 73 kg CO 2 -eq/m 2, P ≤ 0. 05). To highlight how the presence of grasslands is crucial for the carbon footprint of small-scale farms, this study also applied a simulation for increasing the forage self-sufficiency of farms to 100 %. In this case, an average reduction of GHG <b>emission</b> per <b>kg</b> of FPCM of farms was estimated both with no allocation and with physical allocation, reaching 27. 0 % and 28. 8 %, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature {{ranked the}} power station as Europe's 11th most {{relatively}} polluting power station due to carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> of 1.09 <b>kg</b> per kWh of energy produced, {{and the highest}} absolute emitter, with 30.1 million tonnes of CO2 per year. In July 2009, the facility was titled as the biggest carbon polluter in the European Union by the Sandbag Climate Campaign, a London-based non-profit organization.

40|$|A {{range of}} options was {{explored}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that diets for dairy cows could be formulated to reduce the carbon footprint (CFP) of feed, increase efficiency of conversion of potentially human-edible feed into milk, increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and reduce methane (CH 4) <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> milk. Diets based on grazed grass, grass silage, maize silage or straw, supplemented with raw material feeds, were formulated to meet requirements for metabolizable energy and metabolizable protein for a range of daily milk yields. At similar levels of milk yield, NUE, predicted CH 4 emissions and diet CFP were generally higher for diets based on maize silage than for those based on grazed grass, grass silage or straw. Predicted CH 4 emissions and human-edible proportion decreased, while NUE increased with the increasing level of milk yield. It is concluded that there is potential to reduce the environmental impact of milk production by altering diet formulation, but the extent to which this might occur is likely to depend on availability of raw material feeds with low CFPs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND n {{regions with}} {{intensive}} livestock systems, {{the processing of}} manure into liquid mineral concentrates {{is seen as an}} option to increase the nutrient use efficiency of manures. The agricultural sector anticipates that these products may in future be regarded as regular mineral fertilisers. We assessed the agronomic suitability and impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia emissions of using liquid mineral concentrates on arable farms. RESULTS The phosphate requirements on arable farms were largely met by raw pig slurry, given its large regional availability. After the initial nutrient input by means of pig slurry, the nitrogen/phosphate ratio of the remaining nutrient crop requirements determined the additional amount of liquid mineral concentrates that can be used. For sandy soils, liquid mineral concentrates could supply 50 % of the nitrogen requirement, whereas for clay soils the concentrates did not meet the required nitrogen/phosphate ratio. The total GHG <b>emissions</b> per <b>kg</b> of plant available nitrogen ranged from - 65 to 33 ¿kg CO 2 -equivalents. It increased in the order digestates...|$|R
