40|$|An enzymatic sensor {{employing}} lysine oxidase (LOx) {{with the}} <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> system by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde using an immunodyne ABC nylon membrane, {{in combination with}} an oxygen electrode, has been optimised to determine the lysine content in dry-cured ham and dry-fermented sausage at different cured times. The amperometric signal obtained due to the oxygen depletion (consumed oxygen) during the lysine oxidation was recorded at 5 s in the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> sensor, and the reaction rates (slope) {{were related to the}} lysine content. A linear relationship between the consumed oxygen as a function of time (mg O 2 /l/s) and the lysine concentration in the range 10 – 250 μM (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 9946) for the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> system was found. The <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> sensor showed a high specificity and sensibility. Nevertheless, the stability of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> at the assay temperature was very poor, and thus, a new membrane was required for each analysis. The analysis of lysine with the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> system in cured meat samples revealed very good agreement with the determination performed through standard HPLC methodology, which validated the use of this sensor as an alternative technique to evaluate cured meat quality.

40|$|Namen diplomske naloge je bila uspešna imobilizacija komercialnega encimskega preparata DENILITE II S na hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce in primerjava aktivnosti imobiliziranega encima s prostim encimom. Sintetizirali smo hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce po metodi kovalentne vezave in nanje imobilizirali encim. Za aktivacijo funkcionalnih skupin nosilca smo uporabili mrežna povezovalca glutaraldehid (GA) in pentaetilen heksamin (PEHA). Z različnimi koncentracijami mrežnega povezovalca smo aktivirali funkcionalne skupine nosilca ter iskali optimalno učinkovitost imobilizacije in preostalo aktivnost imobiliziranega encima. Zanimala nas je tudi stabilnost encima, kako vplivata čas in temperatura izpostavitve na ohranitev preostale aktivnosti imobiliziranega encima. Imobilizirani encim ima prednost pred prostim encimom, saj se lahko večkrat uporabi, zato smo preverili, kako vpliva večkratna uporaba na ohranitev preostale aktivnosti imobiliziranega encima. Najvišjo preostalo aktivnost imobiliziranega encima na hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce smo dosegli pri dodatku mrežnega povezovalca GA (3 %) in koncentraciji encima 0, 05 g/mL. Encim, imobiliziran na hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce pri optimalnih pogojih, smo izpostavili za določen čas različnim temperaturam in opazili, da se preostala aktivnost ne ohrani. Proučevali smo tudi vpliv večkratne uporabe imobiliziranega encima na preostalo aktivnost. Imobiliziran encim smo večkrat ponovno uporabili in ugotovili, da aktivnost encima z naraščanjem števila ciklov upada. The goal of {{the thesis}} was to {{successfully}} immobilise DENILITE II S, a commercial enzyme preparation, onto maghemite nanoparticles coated by chitosan and to compare {{the activity of the}} <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> to that of the free enzyme. The chitosan coated nanoparticles had been synthesised with the covalent bond method and the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> was added. To activate the functional groups of the carrier, glutaraldehyde (GA) and pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) were used as crosslinking agents. By applying different concentrations of the crosslinking agents, functional groups of the carrier were activated and looked to determine the optimal efficiency of the enzyme immobilisation and the remaining activity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme.</b> We were also interested in the stability of the enzyme and how the remaining activity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> was affected by exposed time and temperature. The <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> has an advantage over the free enzyme, because it can be used more timestherefore we examined how multiple usage affects the remaining activity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The highest values in the remaining activity of the enzyme immobilised onto maghemite nanoparticles coated by chitosan was achieved, when the crosslinking agent GA (3 %) was applied and with enzyme concentration at 0. 05 g/mL.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermodialysis on the enzymatic kinetic {{synthesis}} of the antibiotic cephalexin was investigated. As reference points, two existing models for an <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> (Assemblase?) and for the free enzyme were used. For Assemblase?, {{it is known that}} diffusion limitation occurs and that therefore considerably more of the undesired side-product phenylglycine is formed. The enzyme was immobilised on a membrane, and under isothermal conditions (293 K) the course of the reaction resembled that of the Assemblase? enzyme. However, if a temperature gradient was applied across the membrane, with an average temperature of 293 K for the enzyme, than the course of the reaction changed. For large temperature gradients (30 ° and more), the course of the reaction resembled that of free enzyme. Thermodialysis enhances mass transfer across the membrane and therewith reduces diffusion limitations in the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> on the membrane. The stability of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> is such that the reactor can be re-used repeatedly. This, together with the positive effect of the temperature gradient on the course of the reaction, makes thermodialysis an interesting new technique that has potential to be applied on a larger scale if the membrane surface area per volume of reactor can be improved...|$|E

40|$|Native and adamantane-modified L-phenylalanine {{dehydrogenase}} was immobilised on b-cyclodextrin coated gold nanospheres via supramolecular associations. The {{amount of}} immobilised protein {{was estimated to}} be about 100 – 110 mg per milligram of support. The nanocatalyst retained high catalytic activity and showed increased affinity for the substrate. Both <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes</b> showed fluorescence emission spectra {{similar to that of the}} native protein counterpart. The range of optimum pH for catalytic activity was increased from 11. 5 to 11. 5 – 12. 5 for the native and adamantane-modified enzymes after adsorption on gold nanospheres. Immobilised native and modified L-phenylalanine dehydrogenase retained about 20 % and 41 %, respectively, of the initial activity after 10 cycles of reuse. These results open a new perspective to the possible application of cyclodextrin-modified gold nanospheres as water-soluble carriers for enzyme immobilisation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to selective H- 2 -driven hydrogenation that exploits a sequence of <b>enzymes</b> <b>immobilised</b> on carbon particles. We used a catalyst system that comprised alcohol dehydrogenase, hydrogenase and an NAD(+) reductase on carbon black to demonstrate a greater than 98 % conversion of acetophenone to phenylethanol. Oxidation of H- 2 by the hydrogenase provides electrons through the carbon for NAD(+) reduction to recycle the NADH cofactor required by the alcohol dehydrogenase. This biocatalytic system operates over the pH range 6 - 8 or in un-buffered water, and can function at low concentrations of the cofactor (10 m NAD(+)) and at H- 2 partial pressures below 1 bar. Total turnover numbers > 130000 during acetophenone reduction indicate high enzyme stability, and the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes</b> can be recovered by a simple centrifugation step and re-used several times. This offers a route to convenient, atom-efficient operation of NADH-dependent oxidoreductases for selective hydrogenation catalysis.

50|$|Gray {{undertook}} postdoctoral {{research as}} a Science Research Fellow at University College London (UCL) {{in the group}} of Professors Malcolm Lilly and Peter Dunnill. The group was receiving major funding to investigate the application of <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes</b> processes for industrial bioprocessing. While at UCL, Gray carried out research on a number of unit operations required for the large scale production of bioactive proteins production by bacteria, unit operations which subsequently became widely used for the production of proteins made using recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology. He then moved to the United States to work for Eli Lilly and Co, Indianapolis, Indiana, as a Senior Scientist. At Lilly’s he was responsible for developing production scale antibiotic fermentations. Lilly’s {{was one of the first}} companies to link the new knowledge of microbial genetics with bioengineering to improve the strains and bioprocesses used for antibiotic production.|$|R
