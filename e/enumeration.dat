The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} partially {{answers the}} question raised by Goncharov {{about the size}} of the class of positive elements of a Roger's semilattice. We introduce a notion of effective infinity of classes of computable <b>enumerations.</b> Then, using finite injury priority method, we prove five theorems which give sufficient conditions to be effectively infinite for classes of all <b>enumerations</b> without repetitions, positive undecidable <b>enumerations,</b> negative undecidable <b>enumerations</b> and all computable <b>enumerations</b> of a family of r. e. sets. These theorems permit to strengthen the results of Pour-El, Pour-El and Howard, Ershov and Khutoretskii about existence of <b>enumerations</b> without repetitions and positive undecidable <b>enumerations...</b>|$|R

5|$|The first {{complete}} {{census of}} Africans in Zambia {{was carried out}} in Zambia during May 1963, when the country was a British colony, while the <b>enumeration</b> of non-African people was performed during 1961. Before the 2010 census <b>enumeration,</b> there were four census <b>enumeration</b> exercises carried out in independent Zambia during 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. Around 60 per cent of the 2010 census was funded by UNFPA, UKAID (formerly DFID), USAID and AfDB, while the rest was contributed by the Zambian Ministry of Finance. UKAID allocated UK£3 million to the 2010 Zambian census during 2010-13 for financial and technical support.|$|E

40|$|This paper shows {{estimates}} {{of the amount of}} person duplication in Census 2000. These estimates were done for the October 2001 decision of the use of census data for non-redistricting purposes. We were concerned that perhaps the estimate of erroneous <b>enumerations</b> in the 2000 Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A. C. E.) was too low because the estimate of duplicate <b>enumerations</b> as measured by the A. C. E. was less than the estimate from the 1990 Post-Enumeration Survey (PES). Our matching work attempted to identify duplicate <b>enumerations</b> across the United States. As a benchmark,we were able to compare our results to the A. C. E. results for the same geographic search areas. This work identified the amount of duplicate <b>enumerations</b> 1) outside of the geographic search area of A. C.

5|$|The census <b>enumeration</b> {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census {{supervisors}} deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census <b>enumeration,</b> there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The <b>enumeration</b> was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.|$|E

These changes increased the electorate from 64,893 to 70,640. On the <b>enumeration</b> date of 17 February 2000, the electoral quota for England was 69,934 voters per constituency.|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis {{analyzed}} the permutations {{of the top}} band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives {{the total number of}} solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second <b>enumeration</b> technique based on band generation was later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.|$|E

It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E
