60|$|Example, {{says the}} wisdom of our ancestors, is better than precept; so perhaps, if I take a single example to start with, I shall make the {{principle}} I wish to illustrate a trifle clearer to the European comprehension. In Australia, when Cook or Van Diemen first visited it, there were no horses, cows, or sheep; no rabbits, weasels, or cats; no indigenous quadrupeds of any sort except the pouched mammals or marsupials, familiarly typified to {{every one of us}} by the mamma kangaroo in Regent's Park, who carries the baby kangaroos about with her, neatly deposited in the sac or pouch which nature has provided for them instead of a cradle. To this rough generalisation, to be sure, two special exceptions must needs be made; namely, the noble Australian black-fellow himself, and the dingo or wild dog whose ancestors no doubt came to the country in the same ship with him, as the brown rat came to England with George I. of blessed memory. But of these two solitary representatives of the later and higher Asiatic fauna 'more anon'; for the present we may regard it as approximately true that aboriginal and unsophisticated Australia in the lump was wholly given over, on its first discovery, to kangaroos, phalangers, <b>dasyures,</b> wombats, and other quaint marsupial animals, with names as strange and clumsy as their forms.|$|R
50|$|The broad-striped <b>dasyure</b> (Paramurexia rothschildi) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Dasyuridae. It is endemic to Papua New Guinea. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.|$|E
50|$|Myoictis leucura, or Woolley's Three-striped <b>Dasyure</b> was {{recently}} described being genetically and morphologically {{distinct from the}} other members of the genus Myoictis. It is more similar to the M. wavicus.|$|E
50|$|The black-tailed <b>dasyure</b> (Murexechinus melanurus) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Dasyuridae. It is found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.|$|E
50|$|The red-bellied <b>dasyure</b> or red-bellied {{marsupial}} shrew (Phascolosorex doriae) is {{a species}} of marsupial in the family Dasyuridae endemic to West Papua, Indonesia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.|$|E
50|$|The long-nosed <b>dasyure</b> (Phascomurexia naso) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Dasyuridae. It is found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.|$|E
50|$|Wallace's <b>dasyure</b> (Myoictis wallacei) is {{a member}} of the order Dasyuromorphia. This {{marsupial}} carnivore is found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Specifically, is found on the Aru Islands of the Maluku Province of Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The narrow-striped <b>dasyure</b> or narrow-striped {{marsupial}} shrew (Phascolosorex dorsalis) is {{a species}} of marsupial in the family Dasyuridae found in West Papua, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.|$|E
50|$|The short-furred <b>dasyure</b> (Murexia longicaudata), {{also known}} as the {{short-haired}} marsupial mouse, {{is a member of the}} order Dasyuromorphia. It is the only species in the Murexia genus. It lives in Papua, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|The {{speckled}} <b>dasyure</b> (Neophascogale lorentzii), {{also known}} as the long-clawed marsupial mouse, {{is a member of the}} order Dasyuromorphia. It is an inhabitant of Papua, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is the only member of the genus Neophascogale.|$|E
50|$|The tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), {{also known}} as the spotted-tail quoll, the spotted quoll, the spotted-tailed <b>dasyure</b> or the tiger cat, is a {{carnivorous}} marsupial of the quoll genus Dasyurus native to Australia. With males and females weighing around 3.5 and 1.8 kg, respectively, it is mainland Australia's largest carnivorous marsupial, and the world's longest extant carnivorous marsupial (the biggest is the Tasmanian devil). Two subspecies are recognised; the nominate is found in wet forests of southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and a northern subspecies, D. m. gracilis, is found in a small area of northern Queensland and is endangered.|$|E
