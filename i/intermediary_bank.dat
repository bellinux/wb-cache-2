Every <b>intermediary</b> <b>bank</b> that handles a wire transaction can take a fee directly out of the wire payload (the assets being transferred) without the account holder's knowledge or consent. In many places, there is no legislation or technical means to protect customers from this practice. If bank S is the sending bank (or brokerage), and bank R is the receiving bank (or brokerage), and banks I1, I2 and I3 are intermediary banks, the client may only have a contract with bank S and/or R, but banks I1, I2 and I3 can (and often do) take money from the wire without any direct arrangement with the client. Clients are sometimes taken by surprise when less money arrives at bank R. Contrast this with cheques, where the amount transferred is guaranteed in full, and fees (if there are any) can be charged only at endpoint banks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} few years, Bangladesh has been {{experiencing}} what we usually know as structural transformation-the popular economic cliché. Though little in magnitude, industrial contribution to the national GDP has been gaining in importance. Banking system in Bangladesh has gone through many extensive changes in the lapse of time. It has been fashioned by economic {{as well as political}} philosophies. It has been marked by Nationalization first. Afterwards it has been deregulated but with less degree of market orientation. Restrictive regulations had made the major portion of the banking system virtually spoon-fed. Later on, financial liberalization, prudential and information regulation has set the trail ready for market based orientation. Consequently, lending norms and practices have gone through changing pattern alike. This paper tries to capture the changing structure of the credit flows by the scheduled banks in the industrial sector. Matchmaking among the surplus spending units and the deficit spending units has been the primary function of the banks these days. As the financial <b>intermediary,</b> <b>bank...</b>|$|E

The bank takes into account the effect of the optimal policy (the interest on deposits, dividend payouts, risky investments) on the probability of failure, which in turn affects the bank's ability to extract deposits. With the aid of simulations we study the effect of variables such as bank size, the riskiness of the bank's investment opportunities, and reserve requirements on the bank's optimal policy and on its probability of failure. A major finding is that small banks choose policies that render them more risky than large banks. As the risks are correctly priced by depositors, rates offered by small banks incorporate substantial risk premia. Another interesting finding is that a tighter reserve requirement induces banks of all sizes to take fewer risks. ...|$|E

40|$|The first essay {{provides}} {{evidence that}} banks are liquidity constrained and hold private information about borrowers that hinders substitution of financing sources. Using loan level {{data from a}} public credit bureau and exploiting an exogenous shock to bank liquidity, I show that adverse selection prevents full arbitrage of profitable opportunities by competing lenders and thus liquidity constraints propagate to bank-dependent borrowers. The second essay evaluates a government program that targeted credit to small firms through existing financial intermediaries. Using the program eligibility rule to identify the effect on target firms, I find that target firms' total bank debt increased by 8 cents for every dollar of program financing provided to the banks.

40|$|The {{launch of}} the euro proved to be {{extraordinarily}} smooth - auguring well for its future. If the EU can build on this initial success, then citizens - {{from anywhere in the}} world - should come to recognise the euro as a robust 'store of value' for their savings. That should complete the emergence of the euro as a tried and tested alternative to the US dollar and cement its role as a global reserve currency. By then, the political implications of the euro's economic power should be readily visible and global finance will have acquired a second leg. That will shape banking strategies just as much within EMU-land as outside it, because the cost of funds to the European economy will be set in a global market and not within any national segment. But a 'good start' is not sufficient to ensure this outcome and other supporting developments are essential. Chief amongst these is the creation of a world-scale capital market utilising the euro and founded upon European savings flows. Fundamental and enduring forces - political, economic, demographic and technical - are combining to drive a process of historic change in the channelling of Europe's savings. They may flow into marketable securities as the preferred mechanism to extend credit to the European economy (and beyond) - the securitisation process. For this analysis, securitisation is defined in the broadest sense. It means connecting the suppliers of funds directly with the users - via a market for securities, rather than through an <b>intermediary</b> <b>bank.</b> The term is often applied to the specific process of making small loans - perhaps on residential mortgages or even credit cards - into bonds that can be issued on the capital markets and purchased by large investment institutions. More generally, it can include the process of governments transforming their nonmarketable debts into highly liquid bonds that command a lower interest rate - and thus cost saving...|$|E

40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a new type of bank run, one that affects both the banks' assets and liabilities. In this paper we combine information from the commercial paper market with loan level data from the Survey of Terms of Business Loans to show that during the 2007 - 2008 financial crises banks suffered a run on credit lines. First, as in previous crises, we find an increase in the usage of credit lines as commercial spreads widen, especially among the lowest quality firms. Second, as the crises deepened, firms drew down their credit lines out of fear that the weakened health of their financial institution might affect the availability of the funds going forward. In particular, we show that these precautionary draw-downs are strongly correlated with the perceived default risk of their bank. Finally, we conclude that these runs on credit lines have weakened banks further, curtailing their ability to effectively fulfill their role as financial <b>intermediaries.</b> <b>Bank</b> assets; Bank liabilities; Financial crises; Commercial credit...|$|R
