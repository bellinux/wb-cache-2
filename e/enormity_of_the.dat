40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{existing}} polar prediction systems do not yet meet users’ needs; and possible ways forward in advancing prediction capacity in polar regions and beyond are outlined. The polar regions have been attracting more and more attention in recent years, fuelled by <b>the</b> perceptible impacts <b>of</b> anthropogenic climate change. Polar climate change provides new opportunities, such as shorter shipping routes between Europe and East Asia, but also new risks such as the potential for industrial accidents or emergencies in ice-covered seas. Here, it {{is argued that}} environmental prediction systems for the polar regions are less developed than elsewhere. There are many reasons for this situation, including the polar regions being (historically) lower priority, with less in situ observations, and with numerous local physical processes that are less well-represented by models. By contrasting <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> different physical processes in polar and lower latitudes, the need for a dedicated polar prediction effort is illustrated. Research priorities are identified that will help to advance environmental polar prediction capabilities. Examples include an improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polar observing system; <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean models, even for short-term prediction; and insight into polar-lower latitude linkages and their role for forecasting. Given <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> challenges ahead, in a harsh and remote environment such as the polar regions, {{it is argued that}} rapid progress will only be possible with a coordinated international effort.
