I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

The Vietnam War started as a Cold War, and escalated into a military conflict that spread to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1959 to April 30, 1975.|$|E

The group, chiefly {{consisting}} of teenage boys, gathered in the Sultan Razia Girls' School, where they began negotiating their surrender, but <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were ultimately killed. For almost two days as the group gathered in the abandoned Sultan Razia Girls' School and built up their fighting positions, the town officials and Northern Alliance attempted negotiations for their surrender, but the fighters vehemently refused, ultimately killing two peace envoys, one town mullah and a soldier escort. All the while they constantly fired at anyone who moved within the vicinity of the building, including civilian bystanders.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 17 February, {{security}} forces retook control of the roundabout, killing four protesters and injuring over 300 in the process. Manama was subsequently placed under lockdown, with tanks and armed soldiers taking up positions around the capital city. In response, Al Wefaq MPs, then the largest bloc, submitted their resignations from the lower house of the National Assembly of Bahrain. The next morning over 50,000 {{took part in the}} funerals of victims. In the afternoon, <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> marched to Manama.

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the railway {{connection}} to the Welsh valleys in 1878 came the regular influx of day trippers, often <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at weekends and bank holidays. The developing summer holiday trade was supported by a large number of quality hotels that provided nearly two thousand bedspaces. The biggest and grandest of the hotels were the Esplanade Hotel on the seafront built in 1887, The Marine Hotel {{at the mouth of the}} docks, The Royal Hotel at the top of Arcot Street, The Washington Hotel opposite the library and The Glendale and Lansdowne hotels on Plymouth Road. Apart from the major hotels, accommodation was also available at the smaller Dock Hotel, Penarth Hotel, Ship Hotel, Westbourne Hotel, Plymouth Hotel, Windsor Hotel, Railway Hotel and dozens of mariners' lodging houses at the top end of the town. All have now closed with the exception of the Glendale and a handful of small and more recent bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} genre in Paris was the chanson: <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were written on love, work, battles, {{religion}} and nature. Mary, Queen of Scots and wife of king Francis II wrote {{a song of}} mourning {{for the loss of}} her husband, and French poets, including Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay, had their sonnets and odes put to music. The most popular composers of songs included Clément Janequin, who wrote some two hundred and fifty pieces, and became Court composer, and Pierre Certon, who was a cleric at the Sainte-Chapelle while he wrote some three hundred chansons, ranging from religious and courtly music to popular melodies, such as the famous Sur le Pont d'Avignon. In {{the second part of the}} century, a variation of the chanson, the air de cour or simply air (melody), became popular. Airs were lighter in subject, and were accompanied by a lute. They became immensely popular in Paris.|$|E

25|$|The muqarnas {{dome type}} may have {{originated}} in Abbasid Iraq as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, {{but it was}} popular in North Africa and Spain with more intricate cell patterns in stucco on a wooden inner shell. Two outstanding examples from the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, are the 14th century Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters. In 14th century Egypt, the Mamluks began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of sultans and emirs and would construct <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{over the next two}} and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by chamfered or stepped angles and round windows in a triangular arrangement. A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, ogee, and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in spirals, zigzags, and floral designs. Bulbous minarets from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the Low Countries of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.|$|E
500|$|Conan's enemy, Thulsa Doom, is an {{amalgamation}} {{of two of}} Howard's creations. [...] He {{takes his}} name from the villain in Howard's Kull of Atlantis series of stories, but is closer in character to Thoth-Amon, a Stygian sorcerer in [...] "The Phoenix on the Sword". [...] The Doom in the film reminded critics of Jim Jones, a cult leader whose hold on his followers was such that <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> obeyed his orders to commit suicide. [...] Milius said his research on the ancient orders of the Hashishim and the Thuggee was the inspiration for Doom's snake cult. In the original Howard stories, the worship of Set, though all too fearsome, is no sect; rather, it is the centuries-old [...] formalized state religion of Stygia (which is virtually a theocracy).|$|E

Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other OSes have developed a [...] "hyperintelligent" [...] OS modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing.
