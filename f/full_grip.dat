2500|$|The {{difference}} between the riot shotgun and the combat shotgun is blurry, and may be {{more a matter of}} application than design. A combat shotgun would be used in military combat situations as a primarily offensive weapon, where a riot shotgun would be used in law enforcement or civilian situations as a primarily defensive weapon. Common additions to a combat shotgun would be provision for attaching a bayonet, and the addition of a ventilated heat shield over the barrel (though this heat shield is a common addition to riot shotguns as well) designed to prevent the operator's fingers from being burned by a barrel heated by multiple shots, and thus to allow the operator to secure a <b>full</b> <b>grip</b> on the weapon while using the attached bayonet, even when the barrel is far too hot to touch (otherwise, there is little reason to enshroud the barrel and hinder the cooling airflow). One or both of these features can be seen on many military long-arms, including the 1903 Springfield, the SMLE, M1 Garand, and Mauser rifles, to name some of the more obvious types.

Modern target style stocks have moved towards a fuller, more vertical grip, though built into the stock rather than made as a separate piece, and may be considered grip stocks.

40|$|Background: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a universal}} disease with clinical presentations and impacts varying in different ethnic groups. The process of inflammatory joint damage quantified by ESR, CRP, number of tender and swollen joints can lead to structural impairment and deformity of wrists and hands. However, the relationship between hand impairment and disability in early RA is controversial. A comparison of this relationship in different population groups would add {{to the understanding of}} country-specific impacts of RA. This study compared the correlations of disease activity and hand impairment with self-report hand function between two early RA populations from the UK and China. Methods: A cohort comparison study was conducted. 60 Chinese patients recruited from Shanghai, China were matched on gender and age with 60 patients from a prospective early RA cohort from the UK (SARAH trial). The procedures of data collection in China followed the standard operating procedures employed in the SARAH trial. Outcome measures including MHQ, medical history and physical assessments were used to assess disease activity, hand impairment and function. Results: There was no significant association (P? 0. 05) between hand function with MCP joint deformity in either population group. Correlations between hand function with range of movement measured by active wrist flexion, combined finger flexion and composite finger extension were weak in both the UK and Chinese population (r? 0. 04, p? 0. 05). The associations between self-report overall hand function and <b>full</b> <b>grip</b> strength were moderate to weak in Chinese patients (dominant r= 0. 473 and non-dominant r= 0. 347, p? 0. 05). The correlations were weak between overall hand function and pinch grip among Chinese patients (p? 0. 05). However, correlations between hand function and <b>full</b> <b>grip</b> strength were moderate in UK patients (dominant r= 0. 582 and non-dominant r= 0. 555, p? 0. 05). Moderate relationships were found between hand function and pinch strength in the UK patients (dominant r= 0. 647 and non-dominant r= 0. 624, p? 0. 05). There were strong to moderate negative correlations between hand function and pain in both population groups (UK r=- 0. 690 and China r=- 0. 458, p? 0. 05). A moderate negative correlation was found between hand function and swelling (r=- 0. 45, p? 0. 001) and a moderate correlation between dexterity and hand function (dominant r= 0. 441, non-dominant r= 0. 440, p? 0. 05) in Chinese patients. However, no significant association (P? 0. 05) was found between hand function and swelling or hand function and dexterity among UK patients. Conclusion: In early RA populations in both the UK and China, hand strength, range of movement and pain are indicators of hand function. There is a weaker correlation between hand strength with self-reported hand function in the Chinese population compared with the UK RA patients. Swelling is not an indicator of hand function in the UK population.

30|$|Managing {{scaphoid}} fractures {{remains a}} debatable issue {{because of the}} potential risk of delayed union and nonunion. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important to avoid long-term consequences associated with nonunion. Managing minimally displaced fractures of the scaphoid waist in young patients employed in physically demanding work is even more challenging due to the issues of functional limitations and time off work. The best available evidence for percutaneous screw fixation versus cast treatment suggests that percutaneous fixation results in a faster time to union by 5  (7 vs. 12) weeks and an earlier return to manual work by 7  (8 vs. 15) weeks, with similar union rates [8, 9]. Cast treatment not only results in longer duration to union but raises concerns of reduced ROM and weakened grip strength. Considering the above evidence, a young worker in a physically demanding job is likely to benefit from percutaneous fixation, which seems to decrease immobilisation time, help achieve <b>full</b> ROM and <b>grip</b> strength and allow earlier return to work. Detailed discussion with the patient is required to explain {{the pros and cons of}} each treatment modality. There is a potential requirement for a prospective randomised controlled trial to compare these two treatment modalities for minimally displaced scaphoid waist fractures in workers with physically demanding employment in order to achieve objective assessment of functional outcomes, time to union and return to work.|$|R
40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Assessment of wielded implement performance is important {{to a variety of}} human endeavours and often critical to success in a sports context, particularly so in the game of tennis. Tennis racket design and manufacture is a multimillion business involving 10 major international companies. Tennis participation is currently estimated at around 60 million individuals worldwide. Thus the importance of optimum racket performance to maximise competitive advantage and minimise the risks of injury is clear. This thesis presents work to enable advances in tennis racket performance with respect to player feel perception, measurement of physical phenomena and the correlation of these aspects within real play contexts. To investigate feel perception a methodology was adapted from the existing literature. Interview testing was conducted to elicit a comprehensive range of tennis specific vocabulary. The end goal was to create a perception relationship map or ‘feel map’. The inductive analysis was used to link all the related clustered themes identified from the vocabulary to sub and base themes describing the relationship. Further analysis introduced higher level general dimensions that unified common base themes. The resulting feel maps were created from both English and German sample groups, with a view to subsequent comparison. To complete the map and broaden its application a wide scale questionnaire was distributed to a tennis playing population. The responses provided data indicating percentile use of selected vocabulary within the tennis community and the relative importance players associate with assorted perception groups. Visual representations of the data were introduced to the map for quick and easy use and an associated lexicon compiled to provide a reference for more detailed information. The feel maps and lexicon provide users with a versatile tool {{in the form of a}} ‘perception relationship model’. The map itself can act as an overall research guide for future work in the field. The addition of percentile use and relative importance data mean the map can be used to create more informed and subtle player test questionnaires or as a design aid, with interdependency links indicating which additional factors should be considered or exploited for their influence on the characteristic areas in question. Interestingly the general dimensions of highest relative importance were sound and grip respectively. This may be due to the basic level of interaction between player and racket which ultimately has to be perceived either through the grip or from the sound. A perception test questionnaire was also created with the use of the feel map and later used to study the correlation between objective and subjective measures. To best attain objective measures from the racket an innovative instrumentation system was created. Two alternative systems were designed and tested, the first based on wired instrumentation and data capture the second based on wireless technologies as these became available. Both systems were required to take measures of grip pressure and acceleration with 6 degrees of freedom. The first system utilised uniaxial accelerometers mounted on an aluminium bracket, and a triaxial accelerometer inserted inside the butt of the racket arranged to allow measurement and calculation of acceleration from the required 6 degrees of freedom. The system could be adapted to include either TekScan multi-cell <b>full</b> <b>grip</b> coverage force measurement, or 2 single point higher sample rate single cell grip force sensors. All data was fed via 15 m of cable to data acquisition systems. This restricted the participants’ freedom of movement and encumbered the racket and thus the systems application, making it unsuitable for extensive perception or fatigue testing. The second system utilised a compact data logger with an integrated on board tri-axial accelerometer small enough to be mounted within the racket handle. A revised mount overcame the need for the aluminium throat bracket, moving the uniaxial accelerometers into a bulbous addition to the butt of the racket. The system was capable of capturing 8 channels simultaneously which allowed for the 6 accelerometers and two single cell grip force sensors to be located under the grip. The system was more difficult to adapt and maintain than the wired system, but improved freedom and reduced added weight to the racket made the system far more suitable for the planned perception and fatigue testing. Fatigue testing conducted with the wireless device investigated the effect of full body fatigue on players’ performance by monitoring the resultant effects in the racket. The protocol was based on the multistage fitness test, designed to progressively increase in difficulty until volitional fatigue. Heart rate data indicated that the protocol was successful in fatiguing the participants to a point at or near their VO 2 max. Unfortunately, with the wireless system in its early stages of development, the device failed mid way through testing. The limited data set that was collected indicated that technique was affected by fatigue. Further research is required to confirm this finding and to make comparisons between racket types during the fatiguing process. The wireless device was adapted to make it more durable and reliable before the planned perception testing was conducted. A protocol was developed to investigate the affect of changing racket moment of inertia on player perception and physical measures. The test questionnaire developed from the feel map was used to evaluate player perception ratings of various elements of racket feel, and the wireless instrumentation system was used as part of methodology designed to compile a set of comparable physical data. A detailed analysis of the results revealed that there was some evidence of correlation between the perceptions of power, balance, flexibility and control and the moment of inertia of the racket. In a design optimisation context, however, more definitive correlations would be more useful. These would be expected to be found with future testing utilising a wider range of racket properties. The research proves to a large extent the original hypothesis that through the use of non invasive instrumentation and improved player perception elicitation techniques it is possible to substantially and usefully improve the objective and subjective assessment of tennis racket performance in play to enable investigation of better design characteristics and fatigue related injury phenomena...|$|E

Imitation encompasses a set of different competences such as recognizing other people’s actions, recognizing the goal of a particular action and the objects and/or subjects involved. This project attempts to implement a similar set of abilities in a humanoid robot following a biologically motivated perspective. Motivation and biological basis: Our inspiration comes from one of the most fascinating discovery of the neurophysiology of the last decade: that is mirror neurons. This is a class of neurons found in the monkey’s frontal cortex (area F 5). A particular mirror neuron is activated both when the monkey executes an action and when it observes the same action performed by somebody else: hence the name mirror. The importance of the discovery lies in the possibility to relate mirror neurons to gesture recognition, language, and learning by imitation. Grossly simplifying, it {{is believed}} (see also [1]) that mirror neurons evolved from a phylogenetically older system used by the brain to control the interaction between hand and graspable objects. We suggest that a similar process, during ontogenesis, might also explain how the brain develops to endow a “mirror representation”. During a first stage the understanding of object properties is connected to the growing motor repertoire (e. g. precision <b>grip,</b> <b>full</b> pal...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} design {{choice for}} Haptic Shared Control is {{the magnitude of}} assisting forces: high assisting forces are beneficial during agreement between operator and controller, but also result in larger conflict forces in case of disagreement. In order to use higher forces without increasing conflict forces, literature proposes Adaptable Haptic Shared Control: using real-time operator grip force measurements to smoothly scale the magnitude of assisting forces. For <b>full</b> hand <b>grip</b> force no objective measurements comparing Haptic Shared Control versus Adaptable Haptic Shared Control are known and only very limited data on this comparison is available for finger pinching and subjective measurements. In order to prove that, using grip force to adapt the magnitude of assisting forces indeed leads to reduced conflict forces while maintaining the regular Haptic Shared Control performance during agreement, an experiment is required. It is hypothesized that Adaptable Haptic Shared Control will reduce conflict forces during disagreement and that the larger the disagreement the higher the grip force. Both an Adaptable and regular Haptic Shared Controller are designed and implemented on an actuated joystick, which is extended with a 2 D dynamometer to allow real-time grip measurements. Eighteen subjects participated in an experiment where they used the Triar joystick to steer a virtual object along a path consisting of a multisine (agreement) interspersed with straight sections containing obstacles {{that needed to be}} avoided (conflict). After the adaptable and regular haptic shared control condition a Vanderlaan questionnaire was provided to the participant with the question to score them compared to manual control. During the path following task, both the Adaptable Haptic Shared controller and regular haptic shared controller provide similar increased performance in lateral deviation compared to manual control (p< 0. 01). During obstacle avoidance, the Adaptable Haptic shared control significantly decreased conflict forces compared to haptic shared control (p< 0. 01), but at a price of brief increased grip force. No significant difference in grip force was found between obstacles sizes (conflict). The subjective usefulness and satisfying score of adaptable and regular haptic shared control are both positive compared to manual but do not significantly differ from each other. Result show that with Adaptable Haptic Shared Control humans prefer increasing their grip force to lower the Haptic Shared Control forces during disagreement. Additionally during non-conflict situations they maintain the beneficial forces of Haptic Shared Control. Biomechanical Design / BioInspired Technolog...|$|R
