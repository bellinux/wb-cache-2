5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – {{sometimes in the}} form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. <b>Inland</b> <b>water</b> transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. <b>Inland</b> <b>water</b> transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E

25|$|The biggest <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> is the {{landlocked}} Caspian Sea. The biggest lakes are Baikal (23,000km²), Ladoga (19,100km²) and Onega (9,700km²). Russia {{has more}} than 2 million rivers, the largest of which are, in order, Severnaya Dvina, Pechora, Dnieper, Volga, Ob’, Don, Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma, Indigirka and Amur. The most important inland fishing area is the Ob’–Irtysh River Basin (about 27 percent). Sixty species {{are caught in the}} inland fisheries of Russia. In volume terms, whitefish (Coregonidae), cyprinids, zanders and perch are most important. Set nets are the most common gear used in <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> commercial fisheries. Seines are also used on big rivers and lakes, and small trawls on the big lakes. In 2005, the official catch in the inland waters was 72,000 tonnes.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of access to the ocean, and limited amount of <b>inland</b> <b>water,</b> Xinjiang's fish {{resources}} are somewhat limited. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of fishing in Lake Ulungur and Lake Bosten and in the Irtysh River. A large number of fish ponds have been constructed since the 1970s, their total surface exceeding 10,000 hectares by the 1990s. In 2000, the total of 58,835 tons of fish was produced in Xinjiang, 85% of which came from aquaculture.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{and seafood}} {{play a major}} role in Kerala cuisine, as Kerala is a coastal state. An {{everyday}} Kerala meal in most households consists of rice with fish curry made of sardines, mackerel, seer fish, king fish, pomfret, prawns, shrimp, sole, anchovy, parrotfish, etc. (mussels, oysters, crabs, squid, scallops etc. are not rare), vegetable curry and stir-fried vegetables with or without coconut traditionally known as thoran or mizhukkupiratti. As Kerala has large <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> bodies, freshwater fish are abundant, and constitute regular meals.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} National Waterways was {{introduced}} in 1982 to promote the development of <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> transport in the country. At present, out of six declared National Waterways, developmental works are being carried out on NW-1, 2, and 3 only by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI). The first three National Waterways (NW-1, 2 & 3) are being developed for shipping and navigation by providing basic inland transport infrastructural facilities, including navigational channel with required depth and width, aids for day and night navigation, and terminals at selected locations for berthing and loading/unloading of vessels.|$|E

25|$|By 1937, {{plans were}} being {{finalised}} {{for the construction}} of several more hydro-electric plants. The plans called for stations at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls, Leixlip (all in Leinster), Clady, Cliff and Cathaleen's Fall (between Belleek and Ballyshannon in County Donegal), Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra (in County Cork). All these new plants were completed by 1949, and together harnessed approximately 75% of Ireland's <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> power potential. Many of these plants are still in operation – however as could be expected with continuing growth in demand their combined capacity falls far short of Ireland's modern needs.|$|E
25|$|After the {{constraints}} and restrictions of World War II, the town entered another period of {{rapid economic growth}} that lasted three decades. The almost-euphoric economic expansion led to plans for disproportionate and oversized development projects, {{most of which were}} never realized. For example: The construction of a four-lane highway and the urban renewal and reconfiguration of the area to the south of the old town. An <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> transport port with two basins in Aufeld was also envisioned as part of a plan to make the High Rhine and the Aare navigable.|$|E
25|$|The Yangtze {{has long}} been the {{backbone}} of China's <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.|$|E

The 5653m long qanat tunnel, passing under Monte Salviano, features vertical shafts up to 122 m depth; even longer ones were run obliquely through the rock.

25|$|The {{newly formed}} Bangladesh Army had {{shortage}} of trained personnel; no Mukti Bahini officers were trained or experienced in administration, and (at most) had commanded a battalion. Eleven hundred Bengali officers and 23,000 soldiers were interned in West Pakistan, awaiting repatriation to Bangladesh. The officers included generals and brigadiers with {{training and experience}} to impart to the Bangladeshi forces. Although Osmani may have hoped to become defense minister, when the government abolished the post of commander-in-chief {{he retired from the}} army on 7 April and was appointed Minister for Air and <b>Inland</b> <b>Water</b> Transport five days later (armed-forces personnel may not hold political office).|$|E

Paul Hall led the SIU in the General strike of 1947 when seamen won unprecedented gains in wages and conditions.

25|$|Kannur {{district}} has had industrial importance from very early days.

Nevertheless, Kannur is an industrially backward district. There is only one major and five mini industrial estates in the district. Keltron Complex, Mangattuparamba and Western India Plywood's, Valappattanam are the two major industries.

25|$|Assam’s {{agriculture}} {{is yet to}} experience modernisation in a real sense. With implications for food security, per capita food grain production has declined {{in the past five}} decades. Productivity has increased marginally, but is still low compared to highly productive regions. For instance, the yield of rice (staple food of Assam) was just 1531kg per hectare against India’s 1927kg per hectare in 2000–01 (which itself is much lower than Egypt’s 9283, US’s 7279, South Korea’s 6838, Japan’s 6635 and China’s 6131kg per hectare in 2001| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211180852/http://faostat.fao.org/site/340/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=340| archivedate=11 February 2007}}). On the other hand, after having strong domestic demand, and with 1.5million hectares of <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> bodies, numerous rivers and 165 varieties of fishes, fishing is still in its traditional form and production is not self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} archaeological {{sciences}} {{are used in}} underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including {{the area where the}} timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or <b>inland</b> <b>water,</b> identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence {{on the nature of the}} landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, erosion by rivers and deposition by rivers or in the sea.|$|E
