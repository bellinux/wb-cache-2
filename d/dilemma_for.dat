5|$|Tallard's march {{presented}} a <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> Eugene. If the Allies {{were not to}} be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough. if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off {{with the rest of his}} army to forestall Tallard.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} vote. This posed another <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> politicians since they could {{be seen to be}} withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males {{as long as they were}} over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E

5|$|The interdiction effort during Commando Hunt VI (15 May through 31 October 1971) {{was thrown}} off by Lam Son 719 during April and May. During the offensive, 80 {{percent of all}} U.S. aerial sorties were {{directed}} to support it. This highlighted what was now rapidly becoming a dual <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> the Air Force: First, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia meant that there were fewer and fewer air assets available with which to conduct more and more missions. During Commando Hunt, for example, 1,777 aircraft were utilized during the campaign. By {{the time of the}} opening of Commando Hunt VI, that figure had decreased to 1,199 aircraft and this number dropped to 953 before that phase was completed; Second, this state of affairs was exacerbated by the withdrawal of sorties to conduct missions for Operation Freedom Deal in Cambodia.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> MENA {{democracy}} promotion projects {{aimed at}} engaging civil society {{is that they}} often end up selectively working with NGOs that are seen as non-threatening to regimes and not {{in opposition to the}} donor's policy in the region – thus largely ruling out work with Islamist civil society groups for U.S.–funded projects.|$|E
25|$|Some early Western {{societies}} integrated same-sex relationships. The {{practice of}} same-sex love in ancient Greece often {{took the form}} of pederasty, which was limited in duration and in many cases co-existed with marriage.

25|$|In a {{milestone}} {{for the process}} of the free elections, Casimir's nephew, Louis I of Hungary, became king after the agreement between him, Casimir III the Great and the Polish nobility (Privilege of Buda). Louis had no sons, which created another <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> the succession of the Polish throne. In an attempt to secure the throne of Poland for his line, he gathered the nobles and sought their approval to have one of his daughters retained as the queen regnant of Poland in exchange for the Privilege of Koszyce (1374).|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{religious}} courts resolve mamzer {{status by}} generally {{ruling that the}} child was born within the marriage despite the existence of evidence to the contrary.

A 2006 case, in which a child born eight months and two weeks after a divorce, was declared the former husband's child rather than the child of the wife's subsequent husband, and this was reported as causing a <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> the subsequent couple.|$|E

25|$|A second <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> U.S. {{democracy}} promotion in the MENA {{region is}} aid prioritization. Critics say {{the priorities of}} Western aid must {{be viewed as a}} whole, and therefore question the vastly greater amounts spent on military aid than democracy aid. Massive foreign aid to countries like Jordan and Egypt, for example, gives regimes the ability to both co-opt and repress their populations by supporting state job and economic infrastructures and funding state security apparatuses. This results in often contradictory U.S. positions on democracy, with officials praising Arab security structures that are used to crack down on activists and civil society while simultaneously funding technical assistance aimed at promoting democracy in Egypt and Palestine for example.|$|E
25|$|For Newcastle United, the FA Cup final {{was their}} {{final game of}} the season, meaning that they were {{uninhibited}} in their squad selection for the match. The biggest selection <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> manager Ruud Gullit was who to pick to play up front alongside captain Alan Shearer: Scottish forward Duncan Ferguson, who was due for an operation on his groin two days later, or Georgian Temur Ketsbaia. Ketsbaia ultimately got the job, with Ferguson named as a substitute. After marking David Ginola out of the game in their semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, 20-year-old full-back Andy Griffin was selected {{on the right side of}} Newcastle's defence to perform a similar task against Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs.|$|E
25|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} followed {{shortly after}} the presidential election where the opposition party garnered most of the seats, giving them the power to pass constitutional amendments. Park, feeling threatened, {{declared a state of}} national emergency on December 6, 1971. In the midst of this domestic insecurity, the Nixon Doctrine had eased tensions among the world superpowers on the international scene, which caused a <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> Park, who had justified his regime based on the state policy of anti-communism. In a sudden gesture, the government proclaimed a joint communiqué for reunification with North Korea on July 4, 1972, and held Red Cross talks in Seoul and Pyongyang. However, there was no change in government policy regarding reunification, and on October 17, 1972, Park declared martial law, dissolving the National Assembly and suspending the constitution.|$|E

25|$|Arendt {{argues that}} the {{consistent}} mistreatment of refugees, {{most of whom were}} placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, they must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state. Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state, national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests. This presents a <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> liberalism in that liberal theorists are typically committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the death}} of William the Conqueror in 1087 his lands {{were divided into two}} parts. His Norman lands went to the eldest son Robert Curthose and his English lands to the younger William Rufus. This {{presented}} a <b>dilemma</b> <b>for</b> those nobles who held land {{on both sides of the}} waterway of the English Channel, who decided to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the Rebellion of 1088, under the leadership of the powerful Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror. As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English lords with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to the King of France, notably Le Maine. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests, exemplified by his response to the attempt by Elias de la Flèche, Count of Maine, to take Le Mans in 1099. William came into conflict with Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury over Gregorian reforms in the Church. Eventually Anselm went into exile and Pope Urban II, involved in a major conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, came to a concordat with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical status quo. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign. William died while hunting in 1100.|$|E

Most of the cases in the book are not classic ethical dilemmas in the sense of there being uncertainty about the morality of a situation. The book is so filled with examples of unethical behavior that we wonder if anyone reading it would ever agree to see a doctor again. Instead, the dilemmas here focus on how the trainee should respond to unethical situations, and therefore, the issues are important ones...|$|R
