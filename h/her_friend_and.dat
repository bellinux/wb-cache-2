5|$|In March 1995, American Tejano music singer Selena {{was shot}} and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, <b>her</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> former manager of the singer's boutiques. The impact of the singer's death had a {{negative}} impact on Latin music, her genre—which she catapulted it into the mainstream market—suffered and its popularity waned following Selena's death. She continued to be the last remaining Tejano recording artist to appear on the United States Billboard 200 chart since 2000. In the fall of 2011, Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica and Capitol Latin senior vice president Sergio Lopes had the idea of turning Selena's songs into duets in popular music genres. Mexican singers Cristian Castro, Samo, American singers Don Omar, Carlos Santana, Selena Gomez (who was named after Selena), and Spanish singer Juan Magan lent their voices for the duet/remix style album. The project—named Enamorada de Ti—was released in April 2012 and debuted and peaked at number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart. Lo Mejor de...Selena followed the commercial success of Enamorada de Ti, released on the twentieth anniversary of Selena's death. It was also made available for digital download and released as a double disc.|$|E
