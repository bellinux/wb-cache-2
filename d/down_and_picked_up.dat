25|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, he was in Đà Lạt {{when his}} plane had no fuel left, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, to go to the military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
25|$|After {{thoroughly}} {{cleaning the}} diamond, the diamond {{is picked up}} using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond {{for the first time}} through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{finally agreed}} to leave if {{he was given a}} dignified send-off, so the other generals {{arranged}} a ceremonial farewell at Tan Son Nhut on February 24. Military bands played as he theatrically bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket; Khánh said he was taking his beloved homeland with him, and vowed to one day return. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers, most notably Kỳ and Thi, as well as Taylor, all met him at the airport. The foes managed smiles and handshakes for the media cameras. To make the coup [...] "appear as much as possible the doing of Vietnamese themselves", Taylor had not made any public statement after Khánh’s ouster, on orders from the State Department. Wearing his Grand Cross of the National Order, and carrying two more plastic bags filled with Vietnamese soil, Khánh then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a meaningless world tour, starting with a report to the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
60|$|Trent stooped <b>down</b> <b>and,</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> the knife, cut {{the bonds}} which had bound the boy. He {{staggered}} {{up to his}} feet with a weak, little laugh.|$|R
5000|$|Dedicated bus lanes, where buses, taxi, {{and private}} rental cars are only allowed to drive, this reduces {{congestion}} with set <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> of passengers, <b>and</b> normal commuters ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I hoped {{there would}} be a lord; it's just like a novel!" [...] And then, [...] "Oh you adorable creature!" [...] she {{suddenly}} cried, stooping <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> the small dog again.|$|R
2500|$|After being {{attacked}} by multiple church members, Sheriff Deputy Ray Thatcher was confronted by William Thomas Jr. carrying a rifle. [...] Thatcher, who was the designated SWAT sniper for {{the day of the}} shootout, fired his Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic sniper's rifle from close range, killing William Thomas Jr. and Aruguster Tate (Thomas Jr.'s father-in-law) during the shootout. [...] Thatcher claimed Thomas circled around him pointing a cocked rifle at him, while facing him, before Thatcher fired. [...] Thatcher claimed that Tate then stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> Thomas's rifle and pointed it at Thatcher before he fired. [...] Thatcher admitted to shooting both men, each of whom was struck with four bullets. [...] Of the reported hundreds of firearms rounds fired during the shootout, the only ones reported to be from law enforcement officers were those of Deputy Townsend and a single shot from Deputy Rothrock.|$|E
60|$|But Kent {{had ceased}} to listen. He had {{suddenly}} stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> something off the floor.|$|E
60|$|Inspector French stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the paper-weight. Across it was stamped {{the name}} of Sanford Quest.|$|E
6000|$|At that Montgomery stopped. [...] "Good God!" [...] said he, stooping <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> some of {{the crushed}} {{vertebrae}} to examine them more closely. [...] "Good God!" [...] he repeated, [...] "what can this mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, what a {{screaming}} {{and what a}} fighting! How many sorts there are! What are those beautiful little ones, like great white swallows, with crested heads and forked tails, who hover, <b>and</b> then dip <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> something? ...|$|R
6000|$|To their {{surprise}} Mr. Nott stooped <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> one of {{the coins}} handed it gravely to Renshaw. [...] "Would ye mind heftin' that 'ere coin in your hand--feelin' it, bitin' it, scrapin' it with a knife, and kinder seein' how it compares with other coins?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her words {{seemed to}} bring him back to his old self. He stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> his cap.|$|E
60|$|She leaned <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a sea-fishing rod. Jacob {{was terrified}} {{as he saw}} her swaying {{backwards}} and forwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did it!"' Steven bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the box. He {{carried it}} over to the guide-light, sitting down on the curb to examine it.|$|E
5000|$|... "In a Little Spanish Town" [...] {{includes}} audience participation, {{which was}} worked into the stage version of their {{act in a}} humorous way. Alpert would ask the audience to clap hands twice {{at the end of}} each bar of the chorus. On stage, trombonist Bob Edmondson would attempt to join the hand-clapping, having to hurriedly put <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> his trombone each time.|$|R
50|$|Just {{outside the}} museum is the Union Pacific Semaphore. Built in 1920 in Swissvale, Pennsylvania, this style B lower {{quadrant}} semaphore was originally located in Nephi, Utah along the Union Pacific Railroad line. It was used to signal trains to either slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> orders, or proceed to the next signal. It is said that the design of traffic stoplights were adopted from this type of device.|$|R
50|$|When a {{major event}} occurs at Wembley Stadium, all London Midland {{services}} call here always stopping at platforms 5 and 6. Virgin Trains' services are formed of trains which are too long for the platforms and take longer to set <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up.</b> As a result, these services will make additional stops at Watford Junction or Milton Keynes, for customers to change onto London Midland or Southern services.|$|R
60|$|Nikasti made no reply. Lutchester {{looked at}} him for a moment thoughtfully. There was a light once more in the beaten man's eyes--a queer, secretive gleam. Lutchester stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the knife from the floor.|$|E
6000|$|So we [...] "trotted" [...] at no mean pace. As {{we passed}} it, Bastin stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> {{the head of}} the image of Oro, much as Atalanta in Academy {{pictures}} is represented as doing to the apples, and bore it away in triumph.|$|E
60|$|With this {{he began}} to march {{along the road to}} the opening in the rocks ahead, and the others kept close behind him. But the Scoodlers closed up in front, as if to bar their way, and so the shaggy man stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a loose stone, which he threw at the creatures to scare them from the path.|$|E
40|$|Having {{just put}} aside the silver plectrum, She sits <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> the gilded needle. To make drawing lots she writes in small {{standard}} script, Competing at gathering flowers she breaks her delicate nails. They are easy to turn over but it’s {{hard to know what}} they express. They can reach out so one doesn’t object to their softness. Holding a golden shuttle, she weaves by the loom, Close-fitting sleeves conceal slenderness. ...|$|R
60|$|Uncle Palladius was {{the head}} of a large family, and as strangers were rare in their Valley they all {{gathered}} around the girl and looked at her curiously, while one pure white kitten came softly up and rubbed its back against Dot's leg. She stooped <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> the pretty kitten snuggled it close in her arms and gently caressed it. Then she sat down upon a cushion, while the other kittens gathered around her or stretched themselves lazily upon the carpet near by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Baker," [...] said Charley, with {{infinite}} gravity, [...] "if {{that bag}} SHOULD TUMBLE OFF A DOZEN TIMES between this and Laurel Hill, I'll hop <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up</b> myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was so old," [...] {{explained}} the Witch of the North, [...] "that she dried up {{quickly in the}} sun. That {{is the end of}} her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear." [...] She reached <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.|$|E
60|$|They had {{travelled}} {{little more}} than a hundred yards, when Henry, who was in front, bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> something with which his snowshoe had collided. It was dark, and he could not see it, but he recognised it by the touch. He flung it back, so that it struck the sled and bounced along until it fetched up on Bill's snowshoes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{ought to}} be whipped for his impudence,' said the Captain; 'but never fear, Miss Brady, I shall not touch him; your FAVOURITE is safe from me.' So saying, he stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the bunch of ribands which had fallen at Nora's feet, and handing it to her, said in a sarcastic tone, 'When ladies make {{presents}} to gentlemen, {{it is time for}} OTHER gentlemen to retire.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stay!' {{cried the}} horse, 'do not throw them away! Perhaps we shall find them of use. Get <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> them up.' So Petru got <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> them <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{they all went}} on.|$|R
50|$|Back in The Darkroom, Peter {{brings up}} Spider-Man {{in the plot}} to Norman Osborn's amnesia and Gwen expresses her hatred of the superhero at full blast, {{mentioning}} her belief that it was Spider-Man and the other freak (Dr. Octopus, though his name is never spoken) who killed her father. She walks out on Peter, and {{as he tries to}} calm her down, the phone rings. Torn between calming Stacy <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> the phone, he fails at both, learning from the answering machine that Harry Osborn is coming back to town.|$|R
50|$|UCLA's {{undersized}} defense {{continued to}} play well in the third quarter, but the larger Spartans were beginning to wear them <b>down</b> <b>and</b> began <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> bigger <b>and</b> bigger chunks of yardage on the ground.|$|R
60|$|There {{was but a}} {{smouldering}} log {{or two in the}} fireplace, and {{no doubt}} Mountain saw that the paper was in no danger as it lay amongst the ashes, or she would have seized it at the risk of burning her own fingers, and ere she uttered the above passionate defence of her conduct. Perhaps George was absorbed in his dismal thoughts; perhaps his jealousy overpowered him, for he did not resist any further when she stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the paper.|$|E
60|$|She bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a sharp {{stone and}} flung it quickly at him. He {{had no time to}} duck. It hit him on the temple. With a cry he put his hand to his head and when he took it away it was wet with blood. Ethel stood still, panting with rage. He turned very pale, and without a word, taking up his coat, went away. Ethel let herself fall back into the water and the stream carried her slowly down to the ford.|$|E
6000|$|... "There he is!" [...] cried Mrs. Flanders, coming {{round the}} rock and {{covering}} the whole space of the beach in a few seconds. [...] "What has he got hold of? Put it down, Jacob! Drop it this moment! Something horrid, I know. Why didn't you stay with us? Naughty little boy! Now put it down. Now come along both of you," [...] and she swept round, holding Archer by one hand and fumbling for Jacob's arm with the other. But he ducked <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the sheep's jaw, which was loose.|$|E
50|$|When play begins {{each player}} views one pile of four cards. Players may trade cards {{in their hands}} with cards in the middle, as many as they like, holding {{no more than four}} cards at a time. That is to say, players must discard to the middle first, and then select their new cards. Players may change as many cards (1-4) as they like. Players can, at any time, place their pile face <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a {{different}} pile and continue to play. When a player has four of a kind in one pile, he or she places his or her pile face up.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{fundamental}} importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless {{have been a}} tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not qualitatively apparent. One anecdote describes Thomas Hunt Morgan banning the Friden calculator from his department at Caltech, saying [...] "Well, I am {{like a guy who}} is prospecting for gold {{along the banks of the}} Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in placer mining." ...|$|R
60|$|They were {{standing}} almost {{in front of}} it. The gate was open and Tavernake beat against the panels {{with the flat of}} his hand. Then, with a cry of triumph, he stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> something <b>up</b> from a crack in the flagged stones.|$|R
