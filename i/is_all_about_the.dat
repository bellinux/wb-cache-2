500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been paid to the film's focus on sexuality and gender identity. Sharalyn Orbaugh has noted that the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell begins with the [...] "perfect paradoxical introduction to a narrative that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of sex/gender identity and self-identity in general in a future world where sexual reproduction has given way to mechanical replication". Motoko's female identity and appearance are countered by an autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a cyborg body without reproductive organs which cannot menstruate. Orbaugh describes the juxtaposition of the opening scene depicting the creation of Motoko's body and to her lack of menstruation as setting the theme of [...] "reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject".|$|E

At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema has got to be in the present tense." ...|$|E

While the BBC wanted the series to match the success of Cold Feet, producer Rob Bullock stressed that [...] "Cold Feet is about a different period of life. It's about people in their early thirties. Mutual Friends moves things on—what's happening to our characters as they approach 40 is very different. Why do so many lives fall apart at 40? Because things haven't worked out how we hoped and we've had to turn to Plan B.
