5|$|An <b>investigation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Board of Works in 1751 {{concluded}} that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation.

Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The Jewel Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E
5|$|An <b>investigation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan and City of London Police forces {{identified}} Gardstein's accomplices, most of {{whom were}} arrested within two weeks.

The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.|$|E
