40|$|Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. We {{demonstrate}} alteration in {{diamond-like carbon}} (DLC) film structure, chemistry and adhesion on steel, related to {{variation in the}} argon plasma pretreatment stage of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. We relate these changes to the alteration in substrate structure, crystallinity and chemistry due to application of an argon plasma process with negative self bias up to 600 V. Adhesion of the DLC film to the substrate was assessed by examination of the spallated fraction of the film following controlled deformation. Films with no pretreatment step immediately delaminated. At 300 V pretreatment, the spallated fraction is 8. 2 %, reducing to 1. 2 % at <b>450</b> <b>V</b> and 0. 02 % at 600 V. For bias voltages below <b>450</b> <b>V</b> the adhesion enhancement is explained by a reduction in carbon contamination on the substrate surface, from 59 at. % with no treatment to 26 at. % at <b>450</b> <b>V,</b> concurrently with {{a decrease in the}} surface roughness, Rq, from 31. 5 nm to 18. 9 nm. With a pretreatment bias voltage of 600 V a nanocrystalline, nanostructured surface is formed, related to removal of chromium and relaxation of stress; X-ray diffraction indicates this phase is incipient at <b>450</b> <b>V.</b> In addition to improving film adhesion, the nanotexturing of the substrate prior to film deposition results in a DLC film that shows an increase in sp 3 /sp 2 ratio from 1. 2 to 1. 5, a reduction in surface roughness from 31 nm to 21 nm, and DLC nodular asperities with reduced diameter and increased uniformity of size and arrangement. These findings are consistent with the substrate alterations due to the plasma pretreatment resulting in limitation of surface diffusion in the growth process. This suggests that in addition to deposition phase processes, the parameters of the pretreatment process need to be considered when designing diamond-like carbon coatings.

To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the exon 15 of BRAF, mutation hot spot of the gene, in 667 canine primary tumors and 38 control tissues. Sequencing analysis revealed that a single nucleotide T to A transversion at nucleotide 1349 occurred in 64 primary tumors (9. 6 %), with particularly high frequency in prostatic carcinoma (20 / 25, 80 %) and urothelial carcinoma (30 / 45, 67 %).

The results show a clear fatigue endurance “trough” in LOC LBE, while no such a strong temperature dependence of the fatigue endurance is observed when the steel is tested in vacuum. The fractographic observations by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that ductile microdimples are prevalent on the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum, whereas the fracture surfaces produced in LOC LBE at all the temperatures are characterized by quasi-cleavage. Interestingly, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), martensitic laths close to the fatigue crack walls or to the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum are found to have transformed into very fine equiaxed subgrains.

40|$|International audienceThe nitroderivatives of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are potentially important photosensitisers in the atmospheric condensed phase. Here we show that the triplet state of 1 -nitronaphthalene (31 NN*) is able to directly react with phenol, causing its transformation upon irradiation of 1 NN in aqueous solution. Additional but less important processes of phenol degradation are reactions with OH and 1 O 2, both photogenerated by irradiated 1 NN. Dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were detected as main phenol transformation intermediates, likely formed by dimerisation of phenoxy radicals that would be produced upon phenol oxidation by 31 NN*. Very interestingly, irradiation with 1 NN shifted the fluorescence peaks of phenol (Ex/Em ¼ 220 e 230 / 280 e 320 nm and 250 e 275 / 280 e 320 nm, with Ex/ Em ¼ excitation and emission wavelengths) to a region that overlaps with "M-like" fulvic substances (Ex/ Em ¼ 250 e 300 / 330 e 400 nm).

Cell transplantation of human and mouse cells into immune compromised mice has greatly enhanced our understanding of stem cell function, regeneration, and cancer.

By contrast, large-scale cell transplantation of fluorescent blood and cancer cells into syngeneic and irradiated zebrafish has now become routine 1 – 7. However, these approaches require that donor cells are from the same strain of syngeneic zebrafish or that the recipient immune system is transiently ablated by whole body γ-irradiation two-days prior to transplantation. Irradiated recipients eventually recover their immune system by 20 days post-irradiation and kill engrafted cells 1, 2, 6, making long-term engraftment studies difficult.

Methods Nine clinical isolates (P- 1 to P- 9) were susceptibility tested by EUCAST EDef 7. 2 and Etest. P- 4, P- 5, P- 7, P- 8 and P- 9 were available for further studies. Relatedness was evaluated by MLST. Additional genes were analysed by sequencing (including FKS 1, ERG 11, ERG 2 and TAC 1) and gene expression by quantitative PCR (CDR 1, CDR 2 and ERG 11). UV-spectrophotometry and GC-MS were used for sterol analyses. In vivo virulence was determined in the insect model Galleria mellonella and evaluated by log-rank Mantel-Cox tests. Results P- 1  + P- 2 were susceptible, P- 3  + P- 4 fluconazole resistant, P- 5 pan-azole resistant, P- 6  + P- 7 pan-azole and echinocandin resistant and P- 8  + P- 9 MDR. MLST supported genetic relatedness among clinical isolates. P- 4 harboured four changes in Erg 11 (E 266 D, G 307 S, G <b>450</b> <b>E</b> and <b>V</b> 488 I), increased expression of ERG 11 and CDR 2 and a change in Tac 1 (R 688 Q). P- 5, P- 7, P- 8 and P- 9 had an additional change in Erg 11 (A 61 E), increased expression of CDR 1, CDR 2 and ERG 11 (except for P- 7) and a different amino acid change in Tac 1 (R 673 L). Echinocandin-resistant isolates harboured the Fks 1 S 645 P alteration. Polyene-resistant P- 8  + P- 9 lacked ergosterol and harboured a frameshift mutation in ERG 2 (F 105 SfsX 23).
