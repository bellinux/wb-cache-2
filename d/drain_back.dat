5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the flood diversion channel in 2001, to discharge excess water into the Ouse Flood Relief Channel, {{was part of a}} larger scheme, which included the raising of flood banks further upstream, and the provision of a flood storage area. To allow for the drainage of surface water from the Nar Ouse Regeneration Area, the channel below the bridge on Wisbech Road has been enlarged. Part of Blubberhouse Creek has been re-excavated, to create a flood relief basin. Although it will not normally contain any water, in storm conditions where high water levels in the Ouse prevent the discharge of water from the Nar, the basin may be filled to a depth of up to , and will <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> into the river once tide levels fall, normally after 5 to 6 hours. This work was completed in April 2011.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E

50|$|The {{first episode}} had 31 million {{cubic meters of}} lava flow into Kīlauea Iki with 1 million cubic meters <b>draining</b> <b>back.</b> During the {{following}} episodes, a total of 71 million cubic meters of lava was ejected during a month-long eruption that stopped on December 20, 1959. Only 8 million cubic meters of lava remained, 63 million cubic meters of lava <b>drained</b> <b>back</b> into Kīlauea magma reservoir.

2500|$|These {{collectors}} {{could be}} used to produce approximately 50% and more of the hot water needed for residential and commercial use in the United States. In the United States, a typical system costs $4000–$6000 retail ($1400 to $2200 wholesale for the materials) and 30% of the system qualifies for a federal tax credit + additional state credit exists in about half of the states. [...] Labor for a simple open loop system in southern climates can take 3–5 hours for the installation and 4–6 hours in Northern areas. [...] Northern system require more collector area and more complex plumbing to protect the collector from freezing. [...] With this incentive, the payback time for a typical household is four to nine years, depending on the state. [...] Similar subsidies exist in parts of Europe. A crew of one solar plumber and two assistants with minimal training can install a system per day. [...] Thermosiphon installation have negligible maintenance costs (costs rise if antifreeze and mains power are used for circulation) and in the US reduces a households' operating costs by $6 per person per month. Solar water heating can reduce CO2 emissions of a family of four by 1 ton/year (if replacing natural gas) or 3 ton/year (if replacing electricity). Medium-temperature installations can use any of several designs: common designs are pressurized glycol, <b>drain</b> <b>back,</b> batch systems and newer low pressure freeze tolerant systems using polymer pipes containing water with photovoltaic pumping. European and International standards are being reviewed to accommodate innovations in design and operation of medium temperature collectors. Operational innovations include [...] "permanently wetted collector" [...] operation. This innovation reduces or even eliminates the occurrence of no-flow high temperature stresses called stagnation which would otherwise reduce the life expectancy of collectors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drain</b> <b>back</b> level basins (DBLB) or contour basins are {{a variant}} of basin {{irrigation}} where the field is divided {{into a number of}} terraced rectangular bays which are graded level or have no significant slope. Water is applied to the first bay (usually the highest in elevation) and when the desired depth is applied water is permitted to <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> off that bay and flow to the next bay which is at a lower elevation than the first. Each bay is irrigated in turn using a combination of drainage water from the previous bay and continuing inflow from the supply channel. Successful operation of these systems is reliant on a sufficient elevation drop between successive bays. These systems are commonly used in Australia where rice and wheat are grown in rotation.|$|E
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{there is}} a tray above a reservoir of nutrient solution. Either the tray is filled with growing medium (clay granules being the most common) and then plant directly or place the pot over medium, stand in the tray. At regular intervals, a simple timer causes a pump to fill the upper tray with nutrient solution, after which the solution <b>drains</b> <b>back</b> down into the reservoir. This keeps the medium regularly flushed with nutrients and air. Once the upper tray fills past the drain stop, it begins recirculating the water until the timer turns the pump off, and {{the water in the}} upper tray <b>drains</b> <b>back</b> into the reservoirs.|$|R
30|$|The drain-back rate of {{the lava}} that filled the crater was {{estimated}} to be 200 – 105 m 3 / 100 days which corresponds to less than 1 vol.% of the total amount of em-placed lava in the crater, suggesting that large increase of the andesitic lava’s viscosity may have prevented it from <b>draining</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
50|$|Economic Geyser is {{believed}} to be named for its behavior during its active days. It is reported that most of the water ejected <b>drained</b> <b>back</b> into the vent after the eruption, thus making the geyser appear to conserve its water.

50|$|Another lower-maintenance {{concept is}} the 'drain-back'. No {{anti-freeze}} is required; instead, all the piping is sloped to cause water to <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> to the tank. The tank is not pressurized and operates at atmospheric pressure. As {{soon as the}} pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty before freezing can occur.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the compressor, oil {{is added to the}} refrigerant during installation or commissioning. The type of oil may be mineral or synthetic to suit the compressor type, and also chosen so as not to react with the refrigerant type and other components in the system. In small refrigeration systems the oil is allowed to circulate throughout the whole circuit, but care must be taken to design the pipework and components such that oil can <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> under gravity to the compressor. In larger more distributed systems, especially in retail refrigeration, the oil is normally captured at an oil separator immediately after the compressor, and is in turn re-delivered, by an oil level management system, back to the compressor(s). Oil separators are not 100% efficient so system pipework must still be designed so that oil can <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> by gravity to the oil separator or compressor.|$|E

5000|$|If {{however the}} {{evaporator}} is located below the condenser, the liquid can <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> by gravity instead of requiring a wick, {{and the distance}} between the two can be much longer.

5000|$|The {{water from}} the basin (A) flows by gravity into the air supply {{container}} (C).

50|$|The {{next step}} {{separates}} the ammonia and water. The ammonia/water solution flows to the generator (boiler), where heat {{is applied to}} boil off the ammonia, leaving most of the water (which has a higher boiling point) behind. Some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia; this water is removed in the final separation step, by passing it through the separator, an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles, allowing the water vapor to condense and <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> to the generator.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, a {{volcanic}} cone may fill with lava but not erupt. Lava which pools within the caldera {{is known as}} a lava lake. Lava lakes do not usually persist for long, either <b>draining</b> <b>back</b> into the magma chamber once pressure is relieved (usually by venting of gases through the caldera), or by draining via eruption of lava flows or pyroclastic explosion.|$|R

50|$|The SRT-4 {{used the}} same basic engine block as the {{naturally}} aspirated 2003+ 2.4L, and {{was different from the}} years previous used in the naturally aspirated Chrysler 2.4L mid-size cars such as the PT Cruiser and four-door Stratus. The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. The SRT-4 intercooler was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by Valeo, unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow.|$|E
50|$|In {{a splash}} {{lubrication}} system no oil pump is used. Instead the crankshaft dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and due to its high speed, it splashes the crankshaft, connecting rods {{and bottom of the}} pistons. The connecting rod big end caps may have an attached scoop to enhance this effect. The valve train may also be sealed in a flooded compartment, or open to the crankshaft {{in a way that it}} receives splashed oil and allows it to <b>drain</b> <b>back</b> to the sump. Splash lubrication is common for small 4-stroke engines.|$|E
