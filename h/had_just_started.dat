5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

Hewett came to know Bandelier and consider him his mentor in his own studies.

25|$|Ramtanu Lahiri was son of Ramakrishna Lahiri. They {{belonged to}} a deeply {{religious}} family attached to the dewans of the Nadia Raj. Some of them were also employed as dewans or occupied other high positions in the Raj.

25|$|The 1930 London Naval Treaty {{established}} that the ten-year battleship-building holiday agreed at Washington would be extended for a further five years, until 31 December 1936. France and Italy were, however, authorized to build the replacement tonnage that the Washington Naval Treaty entitled them to lay down. Nevertheless, France and Italy refused to adhere to any qualitative limitations, which were mainly concerning the maximum displacement of cruisers, as France argued that construction <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> in Germany of the armor-clad Deutschland, and following the new limits' rejection by France, Italy was no longer prepared to accept new restrictions concerning battleships.|$|E
25|$|Stan Winston, {{responsible}} for creature effects in Aliens, was approached {{but was not}} available. Winston instead recommended Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis, two former workers of his studio who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> their own company, Amalgamated Dynamics. Even before principal photography had begun, the practical effects crew was developing models of the Alien and the corpses of the Sulaco victims. Richard Edlund's Boss Film Studios was hired for compositing and other post-production effects. A small number of shots contain computer-generated imagery, most notably the cracking alien head once the sprinklers cause thermal shock. Other CGI elements include shadows cast by the rod puppet alien, and airborne debris in outdoor scenes.|$|E
25|$|The band first hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, {{formerly}} of Trapeze. According to Ian Paice, Glover {{had told him}} and Lord {{a few months before}} his official resignation that he wanted to leave the band, so they had already started to drop in on Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece band, with Hughes as both bassist and lead vocalist. According to Hughes, he was persuaded to join under the guise that the band would be bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> Bad Company. Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in Northeast England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.|$|E

25|$|In November 1971 a fourteen-strong {{party of}} {{students}} from Ainslie Park School in Edinburgh was staying with three leaders at Edinburgh Council's Lagganlia outdoor training centre in Kincraig. In overall charge was 23-year-old Ben Beattie, the school's instructor in outdoor education, who had quite extensive mountaineering experience although his experience in the Cairngorms in winter was very limited. Also on the expedition was Beattie's girlfriend, twenty-year-old Catherine Davidson, who {{was a student at}} teacher training college and who was approved by the school to help run the mountaineering club. She had less overall mountaineering experience but she had twice been in the Cairngorms in winter. Accompanying them was Sheila Sunderland, aged eighteen, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> as a Lagganlia volunteer trainee instructor and had no experience in the Cairngorms.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E
25|$|Peiper {{lived in}} France {{following}} his 1956 release from jail. In 1974 he was identified {{by a former}} Communist resistance member of the region who issued a report for the French Communist Party. In 1976 a Communist historian, investigating the STASI archives, found the Peiper file. On June 21, tracts denouncing his presence were distributed in Traves. A day later, {{an article in the}} Communist publication L'Humanité revealed Peiper's presence in Traves, and he received death threats. Because of the death threats, Peiper sent his family back to Germany, but he remained in Traves. During the night of July 13/14, 1976, a gunfight took place at Peiper's house and his house was set on fire. Peiper's charred corpse was later found in the ruins with a bullet in his chest. The perpetrators were never identified, but were suspected to be former members of the World War II French Resistance or Communists. Peiper <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> writing a book about Malmedy and what followed.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{creating}} {{the show that}} was to become Shortland Street, Caterina De Nave set out to pursue many goals, {{one of which was}} to have strong powerful women as primary characters to counter stereotype the weak and vulnerable women often portrayed in dramas. De Nave and Television New Zealand also wished for as wide demographics as possible and many measures were set about to ensure the soap would reach a diverse audience. To fulfill this, De Nave created the roles of teenagers such as Nick Harrison, Stuart Neilson and Kirsty Knight to draw in a young audience. Family units were also commonly used in soap operas to sustain a wide variety of demographics in one group of characters and as such, the characters of Nick and Stuart were built around a family unit, with the single mother of Nick's, Jenny, being created to represent single parent families. Jenny was characterized to embody the strong matriarch De Nave wished to portray. Maggie Harper <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> a 4-year course on the natural healing technique, the Feidenkrais method, when she was cast in the role. She was said to bring her own strength and experience to the part. Jenny made her debut on the show's second episode, screened 26 May 1992.|$|E
25|$|Matthew's {{strong winds}} knocked {{power lines and}} cell towers, which limited {{communications}} {{in the days following}} the storm, and left about 80% of the Tiburon Peninsula without power. A damaged antenna cut communications with Sud, and there were interruptions to the Digicel mobile phone network. Excessive flooding along 13watersheds, as well as the heavy forestry damage, killed many forest and fruit species. The flooding produced mudslides that washed out roads and bridges. Along Route Nationale #2, the hurricane washed away the Petit-Goâve Bridge, which is the only bridge linking the nation's capital Port-au-Prince with southwestern Haiti. This meant that relief workers and supplies temporarily had to travel by air to reach the most affected areas. A temporary bridge to transport humanitarian relief was constructed by October6. Across southern Haiti, the hurricane damaged 70% of the polling locations for the Haitian presidential election scheduled for October9; {{as a result of the}} storm, the election was postponed to an undetermined date on October5. Nationwide, Matthew damaged over 400schools, while 150other schools functioned as shelters for around 16,000evacuees. Damage to schools affected about 130,000children, many of whom <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> their school year, and were in need of a new location for their education. Of the nation's 15main hospitals, one was destroyed and another four were damaged, with 35medical clinics damaged, many of these were understaffed and unable to cope with the number of incoming patients.|$|E
