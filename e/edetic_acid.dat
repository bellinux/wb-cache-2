40|$|The {{effects of}} several strong acids, weak acids, a {{proprietary}} decalcifier, and <b>edetic</b> <b>acid</b> on the immunohistochemical staining of cryostat and fixed paraffin embedded sections of tissue {{from a variety}} of normal and pathological calcified and uncalcified specimens were studied. Even decalcification in strong acids (HCl, HN 03, 5 % trichloracetic acid, HCl-edetic acid did not diminish the reactivity of many useful antigens (including leucocyte common antigen, intermediate filaments, S 100 protein and epithelial membrane antigen). Weaker acids (formic acid, acetic acid) and <b>edetic</b> <b>acid</b> decalcified more slowly and generally showed greater preservation of antigenic reactivity with better morphology and staining quality. Trichloracetic acid was also useful as a quick one step fixation and decalcifying agent for both cryostat and routinely processed sections.

Patterns of reactivity were distinct and allowed the different diseases to be distinguished. All lymphoid tumours expressed leucocyte common antigen, with B cell tumours staining with MB 1 and MB 2, and T cell tumours staining with MT 1 and UCHL 1. T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) /lymphoblastic lymphoma all stained with MT 1, but some were negative with UCHL 1. B cell ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma also stained with MT 1, but could be distinguished by its reactivity with MB 1 and MB 2. Reed-Sternberg cells did not stain with any reagent. Normal and neoplastic myeloid cells stained with MT 1. Carcinomas stained with CAM 5. 2 but were negative for lymphoid markers except MB 2 staining in some cases. A case of neuroblastoma could be distinguished from ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma by its lack of reactivity with all antileucocyte antibodies and its staining with antineurone specific enolase.

40|$|Eleven {{children}} and adolescents with previously normal renal function who received ifosfamide {{for the treatment of}} extrarenal solid tumours underwent detailed investigation of glomerular and renal tubular function to assess the incidence and extent of renal damage. None had received cisplatin. Glomerular filtration rate (measured by plasma clearance of 51 Cr labelled <b>edetic</b> <b>acid)</b> was reduced in six children. All 11 patients had evidence of proximal, and six of distal, tubular damage. Proximal tubular toxicity was indicated by phosphaturia and hypophosphataemia (n = 4), glycosuria (n = 5), increased urine beta 2 microglobulin excretion (n = 11), and generalised aminoaciduria (n = 10); distal tubular damage caused a reduction of the osmolality of the urine in an early morning sample.

In this study a heparin and soluble theophylline mixture {{was used to measure}} accurately platelet numbers in patients with such pseudothrombocytopenia. In four normal volunteers, a theophylline concentration of more than 7 mg/ml produced no significant difference in platelet numbers between theophylline and heparin and EDTA- 2 K anticoagulated bloods. When blood treated with EDTA- 2 K was used in seven patients with pseudothrombocytopenia, falsely low platelet counts were observed in three patients immediately after sampling; in blood treated with theophylline, white cell and platelet counts remained unchanged for up to six hours after sampling. Microscopical examination of the EDTA- 2 K anticoagulated blood showed massive platelet clumping, but no aggregates were seen in theophylline anticoagulated blood.

40|$|The {{suggestion}} that the intestinal mucosa may be abnormally permeable and a site of absorption of antigens in rheumatoid arthritis was tested {{by the use of}} a 51 Cr-EDTA (<b>edetic</b> <b>acid)</b> absorption test. 24 patients with rheumatoid arthritis excreted significantly more 51 Cr-EDTA than did 34 controls. Intestinal permeability was normal in untreated patients but almost invariably abnormal in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Studies in patients with osteoarthritis showed that the permeability abnormalities were due to an effect of NSAIDs on both the proximal and the distal intestine and that the effect was systemically mediated. Indium- 111 -labelled leucocyte scans showed ileocaecal inflammation in 6 of 9 patients on or recently on NSAIDs. Although increased intestinal permeability {{does not seem to be}} important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, the administration of NSAIDs may lead to loss of intestinal integrity, thus facilitating antigenic absorption and perhaps contributing to persistence of the disease...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the glomerular filtration rate was analysed prospectively. The method uses an x ray fluorescence technique to measure disappearance from the plasma of injected non-ionic iodinated contrast media. Eighty seven patients were studied. Fifty four had an intravenous dose of 100 ml iohexol (Omnipaque) and 33 had 50 ml iohexol. Clearances of chromium- 51 labelled <b>edetic</b> <b>acid</b> (51 Cr-EDTA) were measured simultaneously. In the patients given 100 ml iohexol there was excellent correlation with 51 Cr-EDTA clearance (r = 0. 90). The correlation using 50 ml iohexol was also good (r = 0. 85). Correlation between creatinine clearance and clearance of 51 Cr-EDTA in 33 patients was less satisfactory (r = 0. 69). There were no adverse reactions to the contrast media. The equipment used for measuring contrast clearance was robust and simple to operate. Freezing plasma samples in 10 studies and re-examining them weekly for six weeks showed no significant variation in results; hence reproducibility was good. This new and accurate method {{for determining the}} glomerular filtration rate merits further study and might find a useful place in routine clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|Nephrotoxicity is an {{important}} adverse effect of chemotherapy in children. Renal function after treatment with either ifosfamide or cisplatinum in children aged 5 years or less ('younger children') was compared with that in those over 5 years ('older children'). Eighteen children (six younger, 12 older) given ifosfamide were studied after completion of chemotherapy, and 28 patients (16 younger, 12 older) were evaluated after cisplatinum. Glomerular filtration rate was measured from the plasma clearance of 51 chromium-labelled <b>edetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Proximal tubular function was assessed by determination of plasma and urine calcium, phosphate, magnesium and glucose concentration; calculations of their fractional excretions, and of the renal threshold for phosphate; and measurement of urinary excretion of beta 2 -microglobulin.

Younger children had more severe proximal tubular toxicity than older children treated with ifosfamide, with significantly lower plasma phosphate concentrations and higher fractional excretions of glucose. However, {{there was no evidence}} of any such difference in glomerular or distal tubular damage after ifosfamide, and no difference in any aspect of renal function between younger and older children treated with cisplatinum. Increased proximal tubular toxicity after ifosfamide in younger children may have serious implications for future growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out with {{fibrinogen}} and with purified degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin which demonstrate that the structure of D fragments obtained after prolonged plasmin digestion is influenced by several factors in the media. The previously described protective effect of calcium ions on the ??-chain carboxy-terminals of fibrinogen against attack has been confirmed by working at high plasmin concentrations and/or in the presence of 2 M urea. Several compounds such as EDTA, EGTA, citrate and iminodiacetic acid appear to have a separate effect. In the absence of calcium ions these compounds appear to make the ??-chain carboxy-terminal ends of the D and D-dimer fragments more susceptible to plasmin digestion. Finally, as demonstrated by experiments with purified D-E complexes from fibrinogen and with whole fibrinogen digests, the E moiety of the D-E complexes appears to be capable of protecting the D moiety against low plasmin concentrations also in the absence of calcium ions.

Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were measured by primed constant isotope infusions of iodine- 125 iodohippurate and chromium- 51 <b>edetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Urinary volume, renal plasma flow, and glomerular filtration rate were measured during 20 minute clearance periods.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether inhibition of {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} can reduce the rate of decline in kidney function more than reducing blood pressure with other antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN [...] Prospective, open randomised study lasting a mean of 2. 2 years in patients with diabetic nephropathy. SETTING [...] Three outpatient nephrology clinics. PATIENTS [...] 40 patients with insulin dependent diabetes and diabetic nephropathy with reduced renal function. INTERVENTION [...] Antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or metoprolol, usually combined with frusemide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate measured as chromium- 51 <b>edetic</b> <b>acid</b> clearance. RESULTS [...] Glomerular filtration rate declined a mean of 2. 0 (SD 3. 2) ml/min/year in the group given enalapril and 5. 6 (5. 9) ml/min/year in the control group. The mean arterial blood pressure during the study was 102 (5) mm Hg in the patients given enalapril and 103 (5) mm Hg in the patients given metoprolol. Urinary albumin excretion during treatment with enalapril was 60 % lower than during treatment with metoprolol. CONCLUSIONS [...] Enalapril has an antiproteinuric effect independent of the effect on systemic blood pressure. Treatment with enalapril can reduce the rate of decline in kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy more than equally effective antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol.

40|$|Prazosin {{was used}} in {{combination}} with other antihypertensive drugs in the successful management of hypertension in seven patients with chronic renal failure and six renal transplant recipients, also with chronic renal failure. The addition of small doses of prazosin (mean 3 mg/day) to the antihypertensive regimen produced significant falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the lying and standing positions. The standing blood pressures were significantly lower than the lying blood pressures during prazosin treatment. Neither the mean blood urea concentrations nor the mean plasma creatinine concentrations changed significantly during prazosin administration. Chromium- 51 <b>edetic</b> <b>acid</b> clearances did not change significantly during prazosin treatment in the seven patients in whom it was measured. Severe symptomatic postural hypotension occurred in one patient a week after starting prazosin 3 mg/day. This hypotensive episode was associated with a transient and reversible deterioration in renal function. Another patient developed a rash while on prazosin but it was probably related to propranolol rather than prazosin. Prazosin is thus an effective antihypertensive drug in patients with chronic renal failure, and it may be used with a variety of other drugs. It should be used cautiously, however, since patients with chronic renal failure may respond to small doses, and significant postural falls in blood pressure may result. There was no evidence that the use of prazosin resulted in progressive deterioration in the residual renal function of the patients with chronic renal failure...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{labeling}} procedure was developed based on optimal conditions of anticoagulant, stannous ion concentration, incubation time, and incubation temperature. This procedure {{was used to}} investigate the effects of various agents on Tc- 99 m RBC labeling yields. These agents were inorganic ions, therapeutic agents, biochemicals, chelating agents, oxidizing agents, an enzyme poison, and methemoglobinemia agents.

For pretinning, the agent was added to blood after the addition of stannous ion. In addition, a limited in vivo study in rats was conducted. For this study, the following agents were investigated for their effect on RBC labeling yield: sodium chromate, selenious acid, ferrous sulfate, digoxin and dimercaptosuccinic acid. Agents that reduced the RBC labeling yields in post-tinning in vitro procedures were ferric, ferrous, cupric, and stannic ions. Agents that reduced the labeling yields in both post- and pretinning in vitro procedures were dimercaptosuccinic acid, dimercaprol, <b>edetic</b> <b>acid,</b> methylene blue, chromate amd selenite ions.

This study was done on these men of 25 healthy men, who referred to Shiraz Infertility Centerbetween 2012 and 2013. Normal samples were transferred to the ReproductivePhysiology Laboratory, Department of Physiology,Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz.

The percentages of motility, viability, and acrosome-reacted sperm were tested. The percentages of motility and viability in the FT sperm were lower than those in the fresh sperm. The progressive motility of the FT sperm was improved nonsignificantly with Trolox+EDTA. However, the effect of Trolox+EDTA on the progressive motility of the FT sperm was much more than that on the fresh sperm.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{prepare and}} assess the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of a latex agglutination test specific for the serotype of antigen in diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia in Gambian children. DESIGN [...] Comparison of agglutination test specific for serotype with culture of blood and lung aspirates, countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, and commercial latex agglutination tests in diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia. Cross reaction studies and investigation of 102 control children to determine specificity of agglutination test specific for serotype. SETTING [...] General medical ward of Medical Research Council laboratories, The Gambia. PATIENTS [...] 101 Gambian children aged between 2 months and 10 years admitted with severe pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS [...] Serum samples were boiled and treated with <b>edetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and urine samples were boiled and concentrated 25 times before testing. END POINT [...] A latex agglutination test specific for the serotype of pneumococcal antigen that is sensitive and highly specific for detecting pneumococcus in the urine of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Concentrated urine samples from 16 of the 21 children (76 %) with pneumococcal pneumonia established by results of culture of blood or lung aspirates gave a positive result with the agglutination test specific for serotype, whereas only four of the 102 urine samples obtained from control children without pneumonia gave positive results. The serotypes of antigens detected in the urine of children with pneumococcal pneumonia and the serotypes of pneumococci isolated from cultures of blood or lung aspirates were the same in all cases.
