40|$|Teachers cross {{a number}} of {{boundaries}} during their teaching careers. In this study crossing boundaries refers specifically to teachers transitioning between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels in primary schools. The study focuses on the benefits and challenges teachers face from this boundary crossing and how the practice of transitioning between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels is implemented in primary schools. A key principle that underpins {{this study is the}} importance of teachers becoming critical reflective practitioners to improve their teaching. A case study approach grounded in an interpretive methodology has been used for this study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with teachers who have transitioned between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels. Three broad themes emerged as being central to teachers transitioning: benefits of transitioning between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels; the impact of school culture and leadership on teachers transitioning; and the role of mentors in teachers’ transitions. The major findings from the study indicate that transitioning between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels in primary schools is a critical component of teachers’ ongoing personal and professional growth, learning and development. Transitioning between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels highlights a kind of horizontal development which requires a shift away from the singular vertical notion that tends to dominate in teachers’ development. The study indicates that in order for teachers to become extended professionals who have a broad understanding of the learning needs of all students, schools should support and actively encourage teachers to transition between <b>different</b> <b>class</b> levels...|$|R

5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a biological process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but {{with the ability to}} produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E
5|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> of units were disbanded entirely.

Instead, it was decreed that soldiers would join the legion as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.|$|E

Other singles released from <b>Different</b> <b>Class</b> were [...] "Disco 2000" [...] and [...] "Something Changed", which reached numbers seven and ten respectively in the UK.

During her training at Quantico, Alex learns that Liam and Ryan were indirectly responsible for an incident of gang violence that took the life of Drew's girlfriend and led him to join the FBI, a source of tension between Liam and Drew. Later, Drew and Alex become romantically involved. Alex and her remaining classmates (Shelby, Raina, Nimah, Caleb, Brandon, and Iris) graduate from Quantico with offers to work in field offices across the nation.|$|E

5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} of <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> together, {{each with}} a different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5|$|During {{character}} creation, {{the player}} chooses a class: fighter, ranger, paladin, thief, bard, mage, cleric, druid, barbarian, monk, or sorcerer; {{the last three}} of which are new for the sequel. <b>Different</b> <b>classes</b> have different special abilities and restrictions; a thief character, for instance, can find and remove traps, but thieves have limitations on which weapons and armor they may use, and cannot be of lawful good alignment. Most classes also have a subset of kits, or specializations within a class, from which to choose. Kits have special advantages and, usually, disadvantages; for example, one of the kits of the paladin class, the cavalier, specializes in fighting monsters such as dragons and demons, but cannot use missile weapons. At {{some point in the}} game, the player may join or take over a stronghold. The type of stronghold is determined by the protagonist's class.|$|E

5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E

The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described <b>different</b> <b>classes</b> of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing {{an image of the}} ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.|$|E
