In fact, the induction of adaptive immune responses against Tumor Associated Antigens (TAAs) as well as innate immunity are important factors for tumor stabilization/eradication. A variety of immunization technologies have been explored in last decades and are currently under active evaluation, such as cell-based, protein, peptide and heat-shock protein-based cancer <b>vaccines.</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> are emerging as promising methodologies to elicit immune responses against {{a wide variety of}} antigens, including TAAs.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of chronic liver disease worldwide. It is estimated that HCV affects approximately 170 million people around the world. One feature of HCV infection is the high rate of viral persistence. The mechanism of viral persistence is largely unknown, although the high genetic variability is thought to play a key role. Today, no vaccine is available to prevent or cure HCV infections, albeit antiviral therapy is used quite effectively. This study aimed at developing new vaccines and new model systems to study HCV. We studied the HCV NS 3 protein in detail since it performs key functions in the viral life cycle. These are unwinding and strand separation of the viral RNA and proteolytic processing of the precursor polyprotein. To obtain the complete protease we included the NS 4 A co-factor in our NS 3 -based vaccines. NS 4 A has been shown to enhance the stability of NS 3 and to target the NS 3 / 4 A complex to intracellular membranes. The latter is most likely of importance for the formation of the replication complex. Also, the NS 3 region has a limited genetic variability and several studies have now demonstrated that NS 3 -specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell responses are crucial for the resolution of HCV infections. Thus, several factors suggest that the NS 3 region should be well suited for vaccine development. We could show that HCV NS 3 -based <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> effectively primed both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. NS 3 / 4 A was shown to prime a Th 1 CD 4 + T-cell responses. The inclusion of NS 4 A in NS 3 -based vaccines primed antibody, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T-cell responses that were superior to those primed by NS 3 -gene alone. Thus, NS 4 A enhanced the immunogenicity of NS 3. We could show that enhancement of the immunogenicity was most probably a result of the higher expression levels of NS 3 generated by the inclusion of NS 4 A. We next tested if the overall immunogenicity of NS 3 / 4 A could be further enhanced by codon optimization or by mRNA amplification using the Semliki forest virus (SFV) replicon. The NS 3 protein expression levels were further improved by either codon optimization and mRNA amplification. Subsequently, both these modifications enhanced the NS 3 -specific immune responses. One concern in development of <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> is that the gene displays unwanted properties when expressed in vivo. We therefore, generated a new transgenic mouse expressing the HCV NS 3 / 4 Aprotein in the liver. The protein expression was restricted to the liver to mimic the in vivo situation during a HCV infection. Protein expression was localized to the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes and displayed a similar staining pattern as seen in hepatocytes from HCV infected individuals. The intrahepatic protein expression did not cause overt liver damage, except for a slight enlargement of the liver. However, the NS 3 / 4 A-transgenic mice displayed less spontaneously appearing intrahepatic inflammatory foci, which are commonly found in laboratory mice. Thus, expression of NS 3 / 4 A-protein may affect the distribution of immune cells within the liver. The present studies demonstrate that NS 3 -based <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> that contain NS 4 A more effectively prime humoral and cellular immune responses against NS 3. Intra-hepatic expression of NS 3 / 4 A did not cause any spontaneous liver disease or overt pathology suggesting that it safely can be used in <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Thus, the NS 3 / 4 A gene can safely activate immune responses that are similar to those found in humans who can clear HCV. The NS 3 / 4 A should therefore be a potential vaccine candidate against chronic HCV infections...|$|R

Thus, this protein could potentially act as a molecular adjuvant enhancing antigen-specific Type I immune responses. This study examined the hypothesis that Es could enhance Type I responses against a second antigen in mice when presented as a fusion with that antigen. This was tested using ESAT- 6 fusions with two Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae surface antigens, P 97 and P 71, in mice either as recombinant proteins or as <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Control groups received no ESAT- 6 sequences or no antigen or DNA. To accomplish this, gene sequences for the two proteins were identified and cloned with or without ESAT- 6 sequences into expression or DNA vaccine vectors. This required modification of three TGA codons in the P 71 gene sequence. Following immunization, serum IgG 1 and IgG 2 a antibody levels and splenic lymphocyte antigen-specific blastogenic responses, and levels of IFN-gamma and IL- 10 released were measured. The protein vaccination experiments revealed an elevated Th 1 response with the ESAT- 6 fusion vaccinates that was characterized by higher levels of IFN-gamma and suppression of IL- 10 secretion from the sensitized, antigen-stimulated splenocytes. The P 71 protein vaccinates with ESAT- 6 sequences had significantly higher levels of IgG 2 a compared to non-ESAT- 6 P 71 vaccinates. The DNA vectored vaccination experiments gave similar results. Splenic lymphocytes from P 71 vaccinates with ESAT- 6 sequences secreted higher levels of IFN-gamma and lower levels of IL- 10 when stimulated with P 71 antigen compared to the non-ESAT- 6 P 71 vaccinates. In addition, the experiments with genetic constructs for P 71 revealed that the IgG 2 a antibody levels were significantly higher with the P 71 vaccinates receiving ESAT- 6 sequences compared to the non-ESAT- 6 P 71 vaccinates. In conclusion, ESAT- 6 can act as a molecular adjuvant in mice to enhance antigen-specific Type I immune responses to both recombinant protein vaccines as well as <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R

To evaluate the potential of transient overexpression of BAFF to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, a replication-deficient adenovirus expressing full-length murine BAFF (AdBAFF) was tested in a mouse vaccine model against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When coadministered with heat-killed P. aeruginosa, AdBAFF mediated a significant increase in anti-P. aeruginosa-specific serum and lung mucosal antibodies and resulted in improved protection against a lethal respiratory challenge with P. aeruginosa. This effect was independent of the site of administration of AdBAFF and was observed both when AdBAFF was given simultaneously with heat-killed P. aeruginosa as well as when AdBAFF was administered 4 weeks after immunization with heat-killed P. aeruginosa.

Unlike traditional vaccines, this technology has tremendous potential for treating or preventing diseases such as HIV, malaria, and cancer. However, this potential is currently unrealized because of the safety concerns which plague viral vaccine carriers and the inefficiency of nonviral delivery systems when compared to their viral counterparts. A promising and versatile nonviral delivery method for <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> involves microencapsulation of antigen-encoding DNA, because such particles protect their payload and target it to phagocytic, antigen-presenting immune cells. However, the biomaterial conventionally used in these microparticle formulations, an FDA-approved polyester called poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), was not designed specifically to deliver DNA, takes too long to release encapsulated payload, and therefore fails to induce high levels of target gene expression. A new class of novel biomaterials have been synthesized called poly([beta]-amino ester) s which are biodegradable and can have similar physical properties to PLGA, but are pH-sensitive and have gene delivery functionalities. (cont.) Using these materials we can fabricate microparticle-based delivery systems which have relatively high DNA loadings and can significantly buffer the destructive acidic pH microenvironment created by ester bond degradation. These formulations generate an increase of up to 5 orders of magnitude in DNA delivery efficiency when compared to PLGA alone and can be potent stimulators of antigen presenting cells in vitro. We have also demonstrated that incorporating these new biomaterials into microparticulate <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> can lead to antigen-specific, immune-mediated rejection of a lethal tumor dosage in vivo, a significant advance over conventional formulations. Finally, with the synthesis of libraries containing thousands of structurally diverse PBAEs, it is warranted to develop new methods of fabrication which enable the high-throughput screening of such libraries. Herein, we describe, for the first time, such a rapid fabrication technique and demonstrate that plasmid encapsulated in these formulations is transcriptionally active. by Steven Little. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Virus-like {{particles}} (VLPs) {{are promising}} vaccine candidates because they represent viral antigens in the authentic conformation of the virion {{and are therefore}} readily recognized by the immune system. As VLPs do not contain genetic material they are safer than attenuated virus vaccines. In this study, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) amplicon vectors were constructed to coexpress the rotavirus (RV) structural genes VP 2, VP 6, and VP 7 and were used as platforms to launch the production of RV-like particles (RVLPs) in vector-infected mammalian cells. Despite the observed splicing of VP 6 RNA, full-length VP 6 protein and RVLPs were efficiently produced. Intramuscular injection of mice with the amplicon vectors as a two-dose regimen without adjuvants resulted in RV-specific humoral immune responses and, most importantly, immunized mice were partially protected at the mucosal level from challenge with live wild-type (wt) RV. This work provides proof of principle {{for the application of}} HSV- 1 amplicon vectors that mediate the efficient production of heterologous VLPs as <b>genetic</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
