40|$|Purpose To {{develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework of inclusive Islamic <b>Financial</b> <b>Planning</b> (IFP) by combining the traditional Islamic institutions of zakat and awqaf with contemporary notions of <b>financial</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>financial</b> inclusion and financial literacy that caters to the short-term and long-term financial goals of the poor. Design/methodology/approach Being a conceptual article, an inclusive Islamic <b>Financial</b> <b>Planning</b> framework is described, analyzed and developed by integrating modern notions of <b>financial</b> inclusion, <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>financial</b> literacy with the concepts of zakat and awqaf. Findings Using {{the notion of a}} hierarchy of needs and a <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> model, an inclusive IFP framework that can be used by the poor is outlined. The complementary role of the non-poor households who provide funds for zakat and awqaf is also identified. Research limitations/implications The applicability of an inclusive IFP would require Islamic financial instruments and products, institutional development and existence of a social planner who can integrate zakat, awqaf and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> to serve the financial needs of the poor. Originality/value Discussion of <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> in <b>financial</b> inclusion literature is scant.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of research to discover if and how computerized <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> is conducted in United States school districts. The aim of the project was to assist school board members and administrators with <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and decision making. The methodology included a literature survey of long range business and academic <b>planning,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>financial</b> models and modeling. It was concluded that long range <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> has been successfully implemented in business and tertiary educational institutions and would be effective for school districts. An integrated academic and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> model for school districts was normatively derived based on the literature. Primary planning variables reflecting academic policy decisions were identified, and tentative sub models for enrollments, staffing, and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> were described. Empirical work was conducted to fill "gaps" in the literature and gather descriptive evidence concerning the current state of <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>financial</b> model design. As part of the empirical work, questionnaires were sent to all school district treasurers (616) in the State of Ohio. More than forty percent (43. 3 %) replied. It was found {{that more than half of}} the respondents (54. 5 %) have long range <b>financial</b> <b>plans,</b> but few school districts (20. 5 %) conduct <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> on computers. Of the districts operating computerized financial models, 68. 5 % use micro computers in preference to mainframes or minis. School district treasurers and superintendents take part in almost all <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and/or budgeting whereas school board members participate only occasionally. Most school districts (96. 5 %) recognize the need for long range <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> and would consider using computerized <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> models designed specifically for school districts. The research suggests that important barriers to computerized <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> are lack of money and expertise to design models appropriate for school districts. The integrated academic and <b>financial</b> <b>planning</b> model was computerized and tested by practitioners in the United States for completeness and usefulness. Changes were made to the model based on empirical work and field testing. The model is inexpensive, easy to use, and considered to be generic.
