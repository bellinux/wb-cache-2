Making use of a discontinuity in the Swedish grant system, we estimate causal effects of intergovernmental grants on different types of personnel employed by the local governments. On the margin, we find a large, positive effect of grants on the number of bureaucrats employed by the local government, but no effects on the number of personnel in other important sectors run by the local government (child care, schools and elderly care).

The temper of the Muslims became suicidal as the real danger of their position became evident and they fought ferociously to avoid encirclement, which {{appeared to be the}} Roman design.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip the war <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favor.</b> However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were {{not consistent with}} an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
50|$|Diatonically strung single-key {{instruments}} {{from modern}} luthiers {{are known for}} their lush sound. This is achieved by doubling the strings for individual notes. Since the strings for notes not in the diatonic scale need not appear in the string bed, the resulting extra space is used for the doubled strings, resulting in fewer damped strings. Two- and three-key diatonics compromise the number of doubled strings to gain the ability to play in two or three keys, and to permit tunes containing accidentals, which could not otherwise be rendered on a single key harp.

5|$|After the kickoff, the Hokie offense {{continued}} the lethargy that had characterized its {{play in the}} first half, as Mike Imoh was stopped for no or little gain on consecutive plays before the Hokies were called for a five-yard illegal procedure penalty. On the next play, Florida State capitalized on the momentum it had gained with Reid's punt-return touchdown as defender Pat Watkins intercepted Marcus Vick's pass, returning it to the FSU 44-yard line. Drew Weatherford and the Seminole offense, with the game's momentum firmly <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favor,</b> wasted no time expanding their lead. Weatherford completed a 6-yard pass, then a 21-yard one, and was aided by a 15-yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech. Deep inside Virginia Tech territory, the third play of the drive was a 14-yard touchdown rush by Leon Washington. The speed of the drive, after a nearly scoreless first half, frustrated the Virginia Tech defense, which committed a 15-yard personal foul after the touchdown. The scoring drive had taken just three plays and 54seconds, and gave Florida State a 173 lead with 10:23 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they poured down grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} battles {{during the first}} two weeks of September, the South Korean troops, {{demoralized}} though they were, did most of the ground fighting.

Nevertheless, the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.|$|E

30|$|All {{trees in}} our census {{were at least}} 1  cm in diameter, well after the {{seedling}} stage. In the 50 -ha plot at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, 1 -cm saplings were estimated to be > 10  years old (Hubbell [1998]), so habitat filtering prior to recruitment into the 50 -ha census is plausible. If so, tree distribution patterns are set prior to 1 -cm diameter, while larger trees show no demographic benefit <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favored</b> habitat. A second alternative mechanism that we would miss in one five-year study is habitat filtering during unusual climatic events, such as droughts, when slope and ridge soils become exceptionally dry. Drought intensity certainly fluctuates from year-to-year and unusual droughts can have large impacts in many tropical forests (Condit [1998 a]; Potts [2003]). Experimental work at other sites, including Ghana in Africa, demonstrates that species distributions are due to demographic differences in performance under drought (Veenendaal and Swaine [1998]; Engelbrecht et al.

The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance).

40|$|The U. S. {{motion picture}} {{industry}} {{has become increasingly}} reliant on posttheatrical channel profits. Two often-cited drivers of these profits are cross-channel substitution among posttheatrical channels and seasonality in consumer preferences for any movie. The authors use a differentiated products version of the multiplicative competitive interaction model to investigate these two phenomena. They estimate the model using data from 2000 and 2001 on two posttheatrical channels in the U. S. market: purchase and rental home viewing channels. Contrary to expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28 -day window of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when faced with older movies <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favored</b> channel rather than to switch to the alternative channel with newer movies...|$|R

The kick traveled 62yards and was recovered at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line. Virginia Tech's offense, despite the poor field position, moved quickly, {{partly due to}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Kansas. Sean Glennon completed a controversial 37-yard pass to tight end Greg Boone to drive the Hokies deep into Kansas territory. Initially, the pass {{appeared to have been}} intercepted by a Kansas defender, but subsequent replays revealed that Boone had wrested possession of the ball away from the defender. Three rushes deep inside the Kansas red zone netted the Hokies just nine more yards, setting up a fourth-and-one scenario for the Virginia Tech offense. Rather than risk a failed fourth-down conversion, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in kicker Jud Dunlevy to attempt a 25-yard field goal. During the kick, however, Kansas defender Joe Mortensen rushed through the Virginia Tech line and blocked the kick, denying the Hokies three points and preserving a 1714 Kansas lead with 6:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
