40|$|The {{following}} paper {{proposes a}} methodology {{to devise a}} taxonomy that can enable researchers to identify specialised <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> according to their research interests. The paper elaborates on two general issues to devise such as taxonomy. First the structure of R&D output measured by patent portfolios of organisations chairing <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> is analysed {{in conjunction with the}} thematic focus of those <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees.</b> Second, the structure of the output of <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> is analysed as the standards portfolio using data from the bibliographic database PERINORM. The developed taxonomy then links ICS classes on second level to the <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> that are specialised in these fields. The paper focuses on <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> at ETSI, CEN and CENELEC covering 351 ICS classes and 483 <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees.</b> Still, the method proposed can be used with any kind of SDO as long as data is available on the output of <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> in this body.
