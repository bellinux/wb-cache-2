25|$|The first {{cathode ray}} tube to use a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> was {{developed}} by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} source. The {{design of}} the source depends on the particle that is being moved. Electrons are generated by a cold cathode, a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode,</b> a photocathode, or radio frequency (RF) ion sources. Protons are generated in an ion source, which can have many different designs. If heavier particles are to be accelerated, (e.g., uranium ions), a specialized ion source is needed.|$|E
25|$|X-rays can be {{generated}} by an X-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays. In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.|$|E
50|$|Cerium hexaboride (CeB6, {{also called}} cerium boride, CeBix, CEBIX, and (incorrectly) CeB) is an {{inorganic}} chemical, a boride of cerium. It is a refractory ceramic material. It has low work function {{and one of}} the highest electron emissivity known, and is stable in vacuum. The principal use of cerium hexaboride is a coating of <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes,</b> or <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> made of cerium hexaboride crystals. It usually operates at temperature of 1450 °C.|$|R
25|$|Electrical {{filaments}} {{are also}} used in <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> of fluorescent lamps and vacuum tubes {{as a source of}} electrons or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode.|$|R
50|$|LaB6 is an inert {{refractory}} compound, used in <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> {{because of}} its low work function which gives it {{a high rate of}} thermionic emission of electrons; YB66 crystals, grown by an indirect-heating floating zone method, are used as monochromators for low-energy synchrotron X-rays.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
500|$|Lanthanum oxide and the boride {{are used}} in {{electronic}} vacuum tubes as <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> materials with strong emissivity of electrons. Crystals of [...] {{are used in}} high-brightness, extended-life, thermionic electron emission sources for electron microscopes and Hall-effect thrusters.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, John Ambrose Fleming {{invented the}} {{thermionic}} diode, the first kind of vacuum tube. This used a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> that caused an electric current to flow in a vacuum. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called [...] "Coolidge tubes", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.|$|E
5000|$|Zinc, {{problematic}} for high vacuum and higher temperatures, present in some construction alloys, e.g. brass and some brazing alloys. Tends to poison <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> and form conductive deposits on surfaces. [...] Any materials {{that have been}} zinc-coated by galvanization should be avoided, or the have the coating removed first.|$|R
40|$|Ba(Ta 1 -xZrx) OεNδ {{compounds}} for x = 0 ～ 1 {{were produced}} by carbothermal reduction and nitridation process. In this process, Ba(Ta 1 -xZrx) OεNδ and TaC {{as a second}} phase were observed by X-ray powder diffractionpatterns. Work functions and barium vaporization temperatures of the obtained powders were estimated. Work functions of the Ba(Ta 1 -xZrx) OεNδ compounds increased with increasing zirconium content, {{and the value of}} 1. 7 eV for x = 0. 1 was less than that of 2 eV with alkaline earth oxide. Barium in the Ba(Ta 1 -xZrx) OεNδ compound was volatileat higher temperature than that of authentic <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> coated with alkalineearth oxide. In the 4. 1 mm of outside diameter, 3. 3 mm of inside diameter, and 100 mm length of glasses with 9. 3 kPa of argon gas and mercury, some fluorescentlamps with <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> coated with Ba(Ta 0. 8 Zr 0. 2) O 0. 2 N 0. 6 compound worked excellently and those has been litfor 61. 2 Ms, so far...|$|R
50|$|Barium oxide {{is used as}} a coating for <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes,</b> for example, {{those in}} cathode ray tubes. It {{replaced}} lead(II) oxide in the production of certain kinds of glass such as optical crown glass. While lead oxide raised the refractive index, it also raised the dispersive power, which barium oxide does not alter. Barium oxide also has use as an ethoxylation catalyst in the reaction of ethylene oxide and alcohols, which takes place between 150 and 200 °C.|$|R
2500|$|At {{one end of}} {{the tube}} is the <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> heated by a {{filament}} which produces electrons. [...] The electrons are attracted to and pass through an anode cylinder at a high positive potential; the cathode and anode act as an electron gun to produce a high velocity stream of electrons. [...] An external electromagnet winding creates a longitudinal magnetic field along the beam axis which prevents the beam from spreading.|$|E
2500|$|For decades, electron-tube {{designers}} {{tried to}} augment amplifying tubes with electron multipliers {{in order to}} increase gain, but these suffered from short life because the material used for the dynodes [...] "poisoned" [...] the tube's <b>hot</b> <b>cathode.</b> (For instance, the interesting RCA 1630 secondary-emission tube was marketed, but did not last.) However, eventually, Philips of the Netherlands developed the EFP60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime, and was used in at least one product, a laboratory pulse generator. By that time, however, transistors were rapidly improving, making such developments superfluous.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{special-purpose}} {{tubes are}} constructed with particular {{gases in the}} envelope. For instance, voltage-regulator tubes contain various inert gases such as argon, helium or neon, which will ionize at predictable voltages. The thyratron is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube [...] "latches" [...] into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its non-conductive state.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that {{thermionic}} current flow through a plasma {{is limited by}} a "space-charge limited" (SCL) cathode sheath that consumes the <b>hot</b> <b>cathode's</b> negative bias and accelerates upstream ions into the cathode. Here, we formulate a fundamentally different current-limited mode. In the "inverse" mode, the sheath potentials at both electrodes are positive, trapping the ions in the plasma. The bias is consumed by the anode sheath. There is no potential gradient in the neutral plasma region from resistivity or presheath. The inverse cathode sheath potential phi_inv pulls some thermoelectrons back to the cathode, attenuating the current by a factor exp(qe*phi_inv/Temit). Thermoelectrons entering the zero-field region that undergo collisions may also {{be sent back to}} the cathode. In planar geometry, the plasma density linearly decreases across the gap and the current attenuation factor from collisions is emfp/(Lp+emfp) in terms of the mean free path and plasma length. A continuum kinetic planar plasma diode simulation model is set up to compare the properties of current modes with classical, conventional SCL, and inverse cathode sheaths. SCL modes can exist only if charge-exchange collisions are turned off in the virtual cathode region to prevent ion trapping. With the collisions, the current-limited equilibrium is inverse. Inverse operating modes should therefore be present or possible in many plasma devices that rely on <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes.</b> Evidence from past experiments is discussed. The inverse mode may offer opportunities to minimize sputtering and power consumption that were not previously explored due to the common assumption of SCL sheaths.

40|$|The {{electron}} field-emission {{properties of}} carbon nanotubes enable the fabrication of cold cathodes {{for a variety}} of vacuum device applications. The utilization of these cathodes is an attractive alternative for the replacement of thermionic or <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> for generating X-rays. Miniature X-ray tubes have been fabricated using triode-style carbon nanotubebased cathodes. In this paper we report the results of characterization studies, such as beam current dependence on the control gate voltage. Also, results on focal spot measurements and electron-beam modeling allow the possibility of reducing focused spot sizes. Driving gate voltages below 1000 volts for easy pulsing has been achieved, and the extended lifetime data suggests that a regulated power supply would be ideal for a constant AC operation mode. The 1 mm focal spot size achieved so far is suitable for most XRF applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of plasma atomization for laser fluorescence trace analysis are discussed.

Detection limits were improved by means of temporal background selection...|$|R
2500|$|Franck and Hertz's {{original}} experiment used {{a heated}} vacuum tube containing {{a drop of}} mercury; they reported a tube temperature of 115°C, at which the vapor pressure of mercury is about 100 pascals (and far below atmospheric pressure). A contemporary Franck–Hertz tube {{is shown in the}} photograph. It is fitted with three electrodes: an electron-emitting, hot cathode; a metal mesh grid; and an anode. [...] The grid's voltage is positive relative to the cathode, so that electrons emitted from the <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> are drawn to it. The electric current measured in the experiment is due to electrons that pass through the grid and reach the anode. The anode's electric potential is slightly negative relative to the grid, so that electrons that reach the anode have at least a corresponding amount of kinetic energy after passing the grid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, J. J. Thomson, an English physicist, in {{his three}} famous {{experiments}} {{was able to}} deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). [...] The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and {{is also known as}} the Braun tube. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen.A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal Scientific American in 1909. In 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal Nature in which he described how [...] "distant electric vision" [...] could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube (or [...] "Braun" [...] tube) as both a transmitting and receiving device. He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in The Times and the Journal of the Röntgen Society. In a letter to Nature published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some [...] "not very successful experiments" [...] he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died. They were later repeated in 1937 by two different teams, H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting [...] "very faint" [...] images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. The first cathode ray tube to use a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.|$|E

Cerium boride cathodes have one and half the lifetime of lanthanum boride, due to its higher resistance to carbon contamination. Boride cathodes are about ten times as [...] "bright" [...] than the tungsten ones and have 10-15 times longer lifetime. In some laboratory tests, CeB6 {{has proven to be}} more resistant to the negative impact of carbon contamination than LaB6.

40|$|Arc and glow {{discharges}} {{are defined}} {{based on their}} cathode processes. Arcs are characterized by collective electron emission, which can be stationary with <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes</b> (thermionic arcs), or non-stationary with cold cathodes (cathodic arcs). A brief review on cathodic arc properties serves {{as the starting point}} to better understand arcing phenomena in sputtering. Although arcing occurs in both metal and reactive sputtering, it is more of an issue in the reactive case. Arcing occurs if sufficiently high field strength leads to thermal runaway of an electron emission site. The role of insulating layers and surface potential adjustment through current leakage is highlighted. In the situation of magnetron sputtering with ''racetrack'', the need for a model with two spatial dimensions is shown. In many cases, arcing is initiated by breakdown of dielectric layers and inclusions. It is most efficiently prevented if formation and excessive charge-up of dielectric layers and inclusions can be avoided...|$|R

Devices and techniques in which hexaboride cathodes are used include electron microscopes, microwave tubes, electron lithography, electron beam welding, X-ray tubes, and free electron lasers. Lanthanum hexaboride slowly evaporates from the heated cathodes and forms deposits on the Wehnelt cylinders and apertures. LaB6 is also used as a size/strain standard in X-ray powder diffraction to calibrate instrumental broadening of diffraction peaks.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the micro-structured vacuum sensor {{presented}} in this article is the measurement of the electrical conductivity of thinned gases in order to develop a small, economical and quite a simple type of vacuum sensor. There are already some approaches for small vacuum sensors. Most of them are based on conservative measurement principles similar to those used in macroscopic vacuum gauges. Ionization gauges use additional sources of energy, like <b>hot</b> <b>cathodes,</b> ultraviolet radiation or high voltage for example, for ionizing gas molecules and thereby increasing the number of charge carriers for measuring low pressures. In contrast, the concept discussed here cannot be found in macroscopic sensor systems because it depends on the microscopic dimension of a gas volume defined by two electrodes. Here we present the concept and the production of a micro-structured vacuum sensor chip, followed by the electrical characterization. Reference measurements with electrodes at a distance of about 1  mm showed currents in the size of picoampere and a conductivity depending on ambient pressure. In comparison with these preliminary measurements, fundamental differences regarding pressure dependence of the conductivity are monitored in the electrical characterization of the micro-structured sensor chip. Finally the future perspectives of this sensor concept are discussed...|$|R
