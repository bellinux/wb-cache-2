25|$|World Economic Forum 2012–2013 {{competitiveness}} index ranks Sweden 4th most competitive. The Index of Economic Freedom 2012 ranks Sweden the 21st most <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of 179 countries, or 10th out of 43 European countries. Sweden ranked 9th in the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook 2008, scoring high {{in private}} sector efficiency. According to the book, The Flight of the Creative Class, by the U.S. urban studies, Professor Richard Florida of University of Toronto, Sweden is ranked {{as having the}} best creativity in Europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers. The book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most useful to business – talent, technology and tolerance. Sweden's investment into research and development stood, in 2007, at over 3.5% of GDP. This is considerably {{higher than that of}} a number of MEDCs, including the United States, and is the largest among the OECD members.|$|E
500|$|Doctor 'Doc' Doccerson (instead of Reubens in the PSP version), is infuriated {{that all}} of his inventions failed, but today he 'shall surpass them all' with his latest invention, C.R.U.S.H. He uses a tape {{recorder}} for his scientific narrative on the experiment. With {{the help of his}} best friend and protégé, Danny (a running gag consists of him correcting Doc throughout the game), he enters his mind as his subject to C.R.U.S.H., but after a few tests, Danny is trapped inside C.R.U.S.H., where he can collect his lost marbles (which will unlock new dressing gowns/robe designs) and facing his fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, slugs). At one point, Doc tells Danny that C.R.U.S.H. will not let Danny out due to [...] "unresolved feelings." [...] The two question that reasoning as they progress. Towards the end, C.R.U.S.H. interrupts contact between Danny and Doc, overly infatuated with Danny. Danny slowly admits to C.R.U.S.H. that she is simply a machine and compares it to [...] "flirting with a parking meter." [...] C.R.U.S.H., infuriated, sends Danny back to his childhood as a result. When Doc comes back into contact with Danny, Danny lashes out at Doc for building a machine [...] "with the heart of a teenage girl" [...] who [...] "LOLd" [...] at him. Doc, calming Danny down, explains how this [...] "subconscious" [...] is not really his, but old data, and suddenly Danny becomes shocked when he realizes he took the place of someone who underwent treatment with C.R.U.S.H. (being the PSP Danny), but [...] "she knows [...] not the same." [...] C.R.U.S.H. really wanted Danny to clear her head. In the ending, Danny finally escapes and is <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of C.R.U.S.H's mind. He and Doc discuss C.R.U.S.H's future, while Doc says that he'll fix her. In a sudden plot twist, it turns out that they were not in the real world at all, but all the levels throughout the game are outside Doc's lab. C.R.U.S.H. smiles and laughs into the camera, she winks and the screen cuts to black.|$|E

60|$|I confess, we find {{among the}} Jews, {{as well as}} other nations, that men did sell themselves; but, it is plain, this was only to drudgery, not to slavery: for, it is evident, the person sold was not under an absolute, {{arbitrary}}, despotical power: for the master could not have power to kill him, at any time, whom, at a certain time, he was obliged to let go <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of his service; and the master of such a servant was so far from having an arbitrary power over his life, that he could not, at pleasure, so much as maim him, but the loss of an eye, or tooth, set him free, Exod. xxi.|$|E
60|$|It was, however, warm at last, and a {{wonderful}} fresh breeze which had the quality of an elixir in it rippled the whitened grass. Alison felt her heart grow lighter. The vast plain was certainly desolate, but it had lost its forbidding grimness. It had no limit or boundary; one felt <b>free</b> <b>out</b> there and cares and apprehensions melted in the sunshine that flooded it. She began to understand why she had seen no pinched and pallid faces in this new land. Its inhabitants laughed whole-heartedly, looked one in the eyes, and walked with a quick, jaunty swing.

60|$|Let us {{see what}} these two first lessons are about. The morning one {{was from the}} twelfth chapter of Exodus, and told us what the Passover was, and what it meant. The first lesson for this {{afternoon}} was the fourteenth chapter of Exodus. Surely you must remember it. Surely the most careless of you must have listened to that glorious story, how the Jews went through the Red Sea {{as if it had}} been dry land, while Pharaoh and the Egyptian army, trying to follow them, were overwhelmed in the water. Surely you cannot have heard how the poor Jews looked back from the farther shore, and hardly believed their own eyes for joy and wonder, when they saw their proud masters swept away for ever, and themselves safe and <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of the hateful land where they had been slaves for hundreds of years. You cannot surely, my friends, have heard that glorious story, and forgotten it again already. I hope not; for God knows, that tale of the Jews coming safe through the Red Sea has a deep and blessed meaning enough for you, if you could but see it.|$|E
6000|$|They had slavish {{hearts in}} them, {{and as long}} as they had, God could not make them into a nation. The Jews had slaves' hearts in them. They were glad enough to get <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of Egypt, to escape from their heavy labour in brick and mortar, from being oppressed, beaten, killed at the will and fancy of the Egyptians, from having their male {{children}} thrown into the river {{as soon as they were}} born, to keep them from becoming too numerous. They were glad enough, poor wretches, to escape from all their misery and oppression of which we read in the first three chapters of Exodus. But if they could do that, that was all they cared for. They did not want to be made wise, righteous, strong, free-hearted--they did not care about being made into a nation. We read that when by the Red Sea shore (Exodus xiv.), they saw themselves in great danger, the army of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, following close upon them to attack them, they lost heart at once, and were sore afraid, and cried unto Moses, [...] "Is not this the word which we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I must hustle with my story.... They was havin' a trial {{down at the}} big hall, an' thet {{place was}} sure packed. No diggin' gold to-day!... Think of what thet means for Alder Creek. I got inside where I could stand on a barrel an' see. Dartt an' Singleton an' Frenchy an' Texas was bein' tried by a masked court. A man near me said {{two of them had}} been proved guilty. It didn't take long to make out a case against Texas an' Frenchy. Miners there {{recognized}} them an' identified them. They was convicted an' sentenced to be hung!.. Then the offer was made to let them go <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of the border if they'd turn state's evidence an' give away the leader an' men of the Border Legion. Thet was put up to each prisoner. Dartt he never answered at all. An' Singleton told them to go to hell. An' Texas he swore he was only a common an' honest road-agent, an' never heard of the Legion. But the Frenchman showed a yellow streak. He might have taken the offer. But Texas cussed him tumble, an' made him ashamed to talk. But if they git Frenchy away from Texas they'll make him blab. He's like a greaser. Then there was a delay. The big crowd of miners yelled for ropes. But the vigilantes are waitin', an' it's my hunch they're waitin' for Pearce." ...|$|E

60|$|Joan got {{both arms}} round {{his neck and}} with her head against him she held him tightly, trying, praying to think how to meet this long-dreaded moment. After all, what was the use to try? This was the hour of Gold! Sacrifice, hope, courage, nobility, fidelity--these had no place here now. Men were the {{embodiment}} of passion--ferocity. They breathed only possession, and the thing in the balance was death. Women were creatures to hunger and fight for, but womanhood was nothing. Joan knew all this with a desperate hardening certainty, and almost she gave in. Strangely, thought of Gulden flashed up to make her again strong! Then she raised her face and began the old pleading with Jim, but different this time, when it seemed that absolutely all was at stake. She begged him, she importuned him, to listen to reason, to be guided by her, to fight the wildness that had obsessed him, {{to make sure that}} she would not be left alone. All in vain! He swore he would kill Kells and any other bandit who stood {{in the way of his}} leading her <b>free</b> <b>out</b> of that cabin. He was wild to fight. He might never have felt fear of these robbers. He would not listen to any possibility of defeat for himself, or the possibility that in the event of Kells's death she would be worse off. He laughed at her strange, morbid fears of Gulden. He was immovable.|$|E
