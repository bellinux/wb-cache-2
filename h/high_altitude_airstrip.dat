The sample included: (1) 37 <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives (all male), (2) 125 <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives (69 male, 58 female), (3) 85 Bolivians of foreign ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth (40 male, 45 female), (4) 63 Bolivians of foreign ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth (30 male, 33 female), and (5) 47 non-Bolivians of either European or North American ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood (24 male, 23 female). Results indicate that (1) all samples studied, irrespective of origin or acclimatization status, have larger lung volumes than those predicted from sea level norms; (2) the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives have significantly greater lung volumes (vital {{capacity and}} residual lung volume) than the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives {{and all the}} non-native <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> samples; (3) males acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth attain similar lung volumes as <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives and higher residual lung volumes than subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood but lower than the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives; (4) females acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth attain similar lung volumes as subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood; (5) age at arrival to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is inversely related to residual lung volume but not vital capacity; (6) among subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth, approximately 20 – 25 % of the variability in residual lung volume {{can be explained by}} developmental factors; (7) among <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural and urban natives, it appears that approximately 20 – 25 % of the variability in residual lung volume at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> can be explained by genetic traits associated with skin reflectance and genetic traits shared by siblings; and (8) vital capacity, but not the residual lung volume, is inversely related to occupational activity level. Together these data suggest that the attainment of vital capacity at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is influenced more by environmental factors, such as occupational activity level, and body composition than developmental acclimatization. On the other hand, the attainment of an enlarged residual volume is related to both developmental acclimatization and genetic factors. Am. J. Hum.

40|$|The altitudinal {{gradient}} involves {{changes of}} the partial pressures of atmospheric gases such as CO 2. This omnipresent phenomenon likely represents an evolutionary selective agent. We asked whether <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> plant species had evolved specific response strategies to cope with <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pressure conditions. Plants of the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> species Arabis alpina and the low altitude species Arabidopsis thaliana were cultivated in growth chambers with <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pressure conditions (corresponding to 3000 m a. s. l.) and low altitude conditions (560 m). In both species, <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> conditions resulted in the narrowing of stomatal aperture {{as well as a}} decrease in leaf area and weight. A. alpina produced significantly more stomata under <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> conditions compared to low altitude conditions, while A. thaliana did not. Under low altitude conditions, however, stomatal density of A. alpina was smaller compared to A. thaliana. The increase in stomatal density of A. alpina was strongly related to the decrease in the partial pressure of CO 2 under <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> conditions. Thus, the adaptation of the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> plant A. alpina to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pressure conditions does not consist in a genetically fixed elevated stomatal density but in a different response strategy of stomatal development to environmental factors compared to the lowland plant A. thaliana.

This work is related to the Tübingen <b>High</b> <b>Altitude</b> Ophthalmology (THAO) study. METHODS: Parameters of pupil dynamics (initial diameter, amplitude, relative amplitude, latency, constriction velocity) were quantified in 14 healthy volunteers at baseline (341 m) and <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> (4559 m) over several days using the CIP. Scores of AMS, peripheral oxygen saturation and heart rate were assessed for respective correlations with pupil dynamics. For statistical analysis JMP was used and data are shown in terms of intra-individual normalized values (value during exposure/value at baseline) and the 95 % confidence interval for each time point. RESULTS: During <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> exposure the initial diameter size was significantly reduced (p< 0. 05). In contrast, the amplitude, the relative amplitude and the contraction velocity of the light reaction were significantly increased (p< 0. 05) on all days measured at <b>high</b> <b>altitude.</b> The latency did not show any significant differences at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> compared to baseline recordings.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Subjects with {{previous}} <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pulmonary oedema may have stronger than normal hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Susceptibility to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pulmonary oedema may be detectable by echo Doppler {{assessment of the}} pulmonary vascular reactivity to breathing a hypoxic gas mixture at sea level. METHODS [...] The study included 20 healthy controls, seven subjects with a previous episode of <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pulmonary oedema, and nine who had successfully climbed to altitudes of 6000 - 8842 m during the 40 th anniversary British expedition to Mount Everest. Echo Doppler measurements of pulmonary blood flow acceleration time (AT) and ejection time (ET), and of the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet (TR), were obtained under normobaric conditions of normoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen, FIO 2, 0. 21), of hyperoxia (FIO 2 1. 0), and of hypoxia (FIO 2 0. 125). RESULTS [...] Hypoxia decreased AT/ET by mean (SE) 0. 06 (0. 01) in the control subjects, by 0. 11 (0. 01) in those susceptible to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> pulmonary oedema, and by 0. 02 (0. 02) in the successful <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> climbers. Hypoxia increased TR in the three groups by 0. 22 (0. 06) (n = 14), 0. 56 (0. 13) (n = 5), and 0. 18 (0. 1) (n = 7) m/s, respectively.
