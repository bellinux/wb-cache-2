Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller {{served as a}} soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{plans to}} begin {{construction}} of a lunar base soon {{after the turn of}} the century. During the Apollo missions, lunar dust proved to be a problem because the dust adhered to all exposed material surfaces. Since lunar dust will be a problem during the establishment and operation of this base, the need exists for a device to remove the dust from space suits before the astronauts enter clean environments. The physical properties of lunar dust were characterized and energy methods for removing the dust were identified. Eight alternate designs were developed to remove the dust. The final design uses a brush and gas jet to remove the <b>dust.</b> The <b>brush</b> bristles are made from Kevlar fibers and the gas jet uses pressurized carbon dioxide from a portable tank. A throttling valve allows variable gas flow. Also, the tank is insulated with Kapton and electrically heated to prevent condensation of the carbon dioxide when the tank is exposed to the cold (- 240 F) lunar night...|$|R

They vary in size ranging {{from that of}} a toothbrush, to the standard household version accompanied by a dustpan, to 36" [...] deck brushes. There are brushes for cleaning tiny cracks and crevices and brushes for cleaning enormous warehouse floors. Brushes perform a multitude of cleaning tasks. For example, <b>brushes</b> lightly <b>dust</b> the tiniest figurine, they help scrub stains out of clothing and shoes, they remove grime from tires, and they remove the dirt and debris found on floors {{with the help of a}} <b>dust</b> pan. Specific <b>brushes</b> are used for diverse activities from cleaning vegetables, as a toilet brush, washing glass, cleaning tiles, and as a mild abrasive for sanding.|$|R
50|$|The {{aromatic}} {{oils and}} soluble monoterpenes of such herbs leached into garrigue soils from leaf litter have been connected with plant allelopathy, which asserts {{the dominance of}} a plant over its neighbors, especially annuals, and contributes to the characteristic open spacing and restricted flora in a garrigue. The fines (charred wood and smoke residues, or charcoal <b>dust)</b> of periodic <b>brush</b> fires also have {{had an effect on}} the patterning and composition of the garrigues. Clear summer skies and intense solar radiation have induced the evolution of protective physiologies: the familiar glaucous, grayish-green of garrigue landscapes is produced by the protective white hairs and light-diffusing, pebbled surfaces of many leaves typical of garrigue plants.|$|R

He must be above her, then, and she turned to gaze across the grassy bluff, up the long, yellow slope, to where the gleaming aspens half hid a red bluff of mountain, towering aloft. Then from far to her left, high up a scrubby ridge of the slope, rang down a voice that thrilled her: [...] "Go--aloong--you-ooooo."

40|$|OVERVIEW: Dermatophytosis, usually {{caused by}} Microsporum canis, {{is the most}} common fungal {{infection}} in cats worldwide, {{and one of the most}} important infectious skin diseases in this species. Many adult cats are asymptomatic carriers. Severe clinical signs are seen mostly in kittens or immunosuppressed adults. Poor hygiene is a predisposing factor, and the disease may be endemic in shelters or catteries. Humans may be easily infected and develop a similar skin disease. INFECTION: Infectious arthrospores produced by dermatophytes may survive in the environment for about a year. They are transmitted through contact with sick cats or healthy carriers, but also on <b>dust</b> particles, <b>brushes,</b> clothes and other fomites. DISEASE SIGNS: Circular alopecia, desquamation and sometimes an erythematous margin around central healing ('ringworm') are typical. In many cats this is a self-limiting disease with hair loss and scaling only. In immunosuppressed animals, the outcome may be a multifocal or generalised skin disease. DIAGNOSIS: Wood's lamp examination and microscopic detection of arthrospores on hairs are simple methods to confirm M canis infection, but their sensitivity is relatively low. The gold standard for detection is culture on Sabouraud agar of hairs and scales collected from new lesions. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: In shelters and catteries eradication is difficult. Essential is a combination of systemic and topical treatments, maintained for several weeks. For systemic therapy itraconazole is the drug of choice, terbinafine an alternative. Recommended topical treatment is repeated body rinse with an enilconazole solution or miconazole with or without chlorhexidine. In catteries/shelters medication must be accompanied by intensive decontamination of the environment. VACCINATION: Few efficacy studies on anti-M canis vaccines (prophylactic or therapeutic) for cats have been published, and a safe and efficient vaccine is not available...|$|R
40|$|Mycotoxins {{are highly}} toxic {{compounds}} produced by molds that commonly occur in cereal grains. These toxins can have {{adverse effects on}} human and animal health. Mycotoxin decontamination procedures {{can be divided into}} three different groups: chemical, biological and physical. Procedures from the first two groups are often regarded as unacceptable for lowering the mycotoxin level. A laboratory brush was developed for the purpose of physical cleaning of corn kernel. Three samples of commercially available corn kernels were subjected to the brushing procedure in order for the experimental study to be conducted. The mass of 100 g of corn kernels was placed on motionless screen of the brush. A rotating part of the experimental device, the polypropylene bristle brush was set to high­er speed (higher than 800 rpm). During the corn <b>brushing,</b> <b>dust</b> and broken kernels were brushed out through the motionless screen. Corn samples were taken before and after the brushing procedure and they were analyzed for aflatoxin concentration by HPLC-UV RED. By comparing the control and brushed samples, it can be noticed that removal of fines caused the reduction in the level of mycotoxins in all three brushed samples...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{forensic}} identification, {{the mouth}} {{allows for a}} myriad of possibilities. The use of lip prints is not so popular but exists as a methodology in forensic science. Hence Dental surgeon has to actively play his role in personal identification and criminal investigation, as his evidence would be very much useful in law and justice. Objective: The objective of {{present study was to}} evaluate in depth the lip print patterns in relation to gender, its consistency for a period of time, to ascertain whether there is any hereditary pattern in lip prints among families with siblings and twins, and thereby, to investigate whether the lip prints are unique to any blood group in the population under investigation. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 100 students and 10 family with children and twins respectively. The lip-print of each subject was obtained on a microscopic glass slide without applying anything and developed with carbon powder <b>dusting</b> with ostrich <b>brush.</b> Blood group information was noted. Results: Our study showed, in boys, the Type I (complete vertical), in girls, Type II (branched) and among both, type II (branched) lip print pattern to be most prominent pattern.

6000|$|Our {{drive to}} Augusta, {{six or seven}} miles, was very pleasant, a heavy rain having fallen during the night, and laid the oppressive dust of the day before. The road lay {{parallel}} with the Kennebec, of which we occasionally had near glimpses. The country swells back from the river in hills and ridges, without any interval of level ground; and there were frequent woods, filling up the valleys or crowning the summits. The land is good, the farms look neat, and the houses comfortable. The latter are generally but of one story, but with large barns; {{and it was a}} good sign, that, while we saw no houses unfinished nor out of repair, one man at least had found it expedient to make an addition to his dwelling. At the distance of more than two miles, we had a view of white Augusta, with its steeples, and the State-House, at the farther end of the town. Observable matters along the road were the stage,--all the <b>dust</b> of yesterday <b>brushed</b> off, and no new dust contracted,--full of passengers, inside and out; among them some gentlemanly people and pretty girls, all looking fresh and unsullied, rosy, cheerful, and curious as to the face of the country, the faces of passing travellers, and the incidents of their journey; not yet damped, in the morning sunshine, by long miles of jolting over rough and hilly roads,--to compare this with their appearance at midday, and as they drive into Bangor at dusk;--two women dashing along in a wagon, and with a child, rattling pretty speedily down hill;--people looking at us from the open doors and windows;--the children staring from the wayside;--the mowers stopping, for a moment, the sway of their scythes;--the matron of a family, indistinctly seen at some distance within the house, her head and shoulders appearing through the window, drawing her handkerchief over her bosom, which had been uncovered to give the baby its breakfast,--the said baby, or its immediate predecessor, sitting at the door, turning round to creep away on all fours;--a man building a flat-bottomed boat by the roadside: he talked with B------ about the Boundary question, and swore fervently in favor of driving the British [...] "into hell's kitchen" [...] by main force.|$|R
