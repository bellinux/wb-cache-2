5|$|<b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{parliamentary}} reform plummeted {{after the}} launch of the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.|$|E
