500|$|In {{her last}} race of 2015, {{she won the}} Zenyatta Stakes for the third time, {{stalking}} the pace until taking {{the lead in the}} homestretch, winning in a field of eight by [...] lengths. [...] As she prepared for her next race, the 2015 Breeders' Cup Classic, the biggest challenge was anticipated to be her reaction to travel; she had only raced twice outside of California, losing both times, and was known to be a poor shipper. [...] With the 2015 Breeders' Cup races held at Keeneland, and weather causing difficulties for shipping horses by air, Mandella nonetheless declared, [...] "We plan to run in the big one." [...] She shipped to Keeneland on October 19 and developed a slight fever shortly after arrival, thought due to shipping stress, but the fever dropped following treatment and she continued to prep for the race. [...] But on the morning of 29 October, Beholder was sent out for a gallop at the Keeneland training track, and examination after the race revealed that she had bled. [...] She was scratched from the Classic. Mandella explained, [...] "there's obviously some irritated lung tissue there. She will be fine, but if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> under the pressure of a race situation, it could cause some real damage. This was obviously due to the fever she had when she arrived".|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was caused}} when Cole {{chose not to}} send popular {{contestant}} Gamu Nhengu through to the live shows. Nhengu was an early favourite to win and many viewers were angry that Waissel and Cher Lloyd were put through despite failing to complete their performances at judges' houses. Around 1,000 people complained to ITV and by 7 October 220,000 had joined a Facebook page called [...] "Gamu Should Have Got Through". Cole reportedly became the target of death threats, and took extra security precautions in her home {{as well as at}} The X Factor. Bookmaker Paddy Power were forced to give odds on Nhengu winning the show after a large number of bets were placed, and made her the favourite to win, but all punters had their losing bets refunded when Nhengu was not chosen as Cole's wildcard. There was speculation that Cole was pressured by producers to axe Nhengu over issues with her visa, but Cheryl denied those claims, saying it was entirely down to her [...] "gut instinct" [...] and that she believed Lloyd, Waissel and Rebecca Ferguson were the best singers in her category. Later in her 2012 autobiography Cheryl: My Story, Cheryl confessed that she had chosen Waissel for the live shows because she was more entertaining, claiming ..." [...] had spent the past two years drumming into me that we needed acts who would be 'good TV.'...she had the character and drive it took to withstand the pressure of the show, and so <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> through, even though she messed up when she sang in front of Will.i.am." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{turned his}} {{basement}} into [...] practice {{space for a}} band he formed with high-school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high-school shows or other events, he decided {{to drop out of}} high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated when he told her, and he still feels that he owes her for the disappointments in her life. [...] "All the shit <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> through," [...] he says, [...] "on top {{of the fact that she}} just lost her husband. I felt like I had to make sure that it was worth it. I wanted to show her that I was a professional, that I was working hard, and wasn't just a fuckin' lunatic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, Bob, that a {{good while}} ago our Matty disappeared. I saw that the dear child was dyin' for want o' food an' warmth an' fresh air, so I thinks to myself, `why shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>'er</b> out to board wi' rich people for nothink?'" ...|$|R
60|$|If Miss Sparhawk {{cared to}} listen to me for five minutes, I feel <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> <b>her</b> right on this point.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you wish}} that <b>I</b> should <b>put</b> <b>her</b> off,--or <b>put</b> Oswald off,--or both? My brother never yet has seen me in your house." ...|$|R
2500|$|Singer-songwriter Courtney Marie Andrews {{provided}} backing vocals {{for five}} of the album's tracks. Adkins, who met Andrews through mutual friends in Phoenix, Arizona, described her as [...] "extremely talented", and stated that she is [...] "very versatile; she can sing really high. [...] There’s a few spots on the record that I knew I wanted a female vocal. [...] She came down and cut those and it worked out so well. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> to work on some other things that I thought might be interesting to get more voices in there." [...] Andrews subsequently joined the band on tour, with Adkins stating, [...] "there's female vocals on most of our records, so it's nice to have that represented live. [...] It's nice having her around to cover the higher stuff that I don’t normally do live." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> from me. I {{knelt and}} kissed {{the hem of her}} {{mourning}} gown.|$|E
60|$|With those words, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> hand in Oscar's hand--and stood close, {{watching}} her face.|$|E
6000|$|Henchard {{thought it}} over. [...] "Lucetta {{is related to}} her, I suppose," [...] he said to himself. [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> must <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in her proper position, undoubtedly." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> only <b>put</b> <b>her</b> {{hand away}} from me, and advised her {{to return to her}} chair. This {{perfectly}} harmless proceeding seemed absolutely to frighten her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{as an old}} friend"--and for {{a moment}} I felt it awkwardly possible. But <b>I</b> <b>put</b> to <b>her</b> seriously: [...] "Do you see Jasper caught like that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> {{through the}} {{following}} catechism: {{for a girl}} of twenty-two it was not injudicious.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are, James. Pengarvan {{puts her}} here, {{opposite}} these three little islands. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> here some sixty miles away." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame met no answer: I did not {{check my}} walk; {{when she came}} in my way, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, my lady," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> {{into the}} carriage, {{and trying to}} cheer her; [...] "good-bye, for the present only; good-bye, with my best and kindest wishes for happier times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thorne, on one {{condition}} <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> <b>her</b> name into it. I will alter {{it all on}} {{one condition}}. Let the two cousins be man and wife--let Louis marry poor Mary's child." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> this to <b>her,</b> and she {{was forced}} to admit the justice of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I heard Judy callin' me, but I hild {{straight}} {{on to the}} Shadds' quarthers, an' Dinah wud ha' kissed me but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Howsomever, 'twas <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> up to it! 'Nothing venture nothing have,' I said. If I hadn't she'd no {{more have}} been his mis'ess than I." ...|$|E
60|$|I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> letter after I {{read it in}} the bath? He {{patted his}} waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my {{patience}} are exhausted.|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. You let her alone, mother. Let her {{speak for}} herself. You will jolly soon see whether {{she has an}} idea that <b>I</b> haven't <b>put</b> into <b>her</b> head or a word that <b>I</b> haven't <b>put</b> into <b>her</b> mouth. <b>I</b> tell you I have created this thing out of the {{squashed}} cabbage leaves of Covent Garden; and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Intombi is here, baas, where <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>her</b> to {{keep her}} cool, so that she may not go off before it is wanted," [...] and {{he pointed to a}} little grave-like heap of {{gathered}} grass at his side.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{hundred and}} ten." [...] McCoy {{shook his head}} doubtfully. [...] "It might be done, {{but it is very}} difficult. I might beach her, and then again <b>I</b> might <b>put</b> <b>her</b> on the reef. A bad place, a very bad place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Dodo, you've done pretty well, this time," [...] {{said his}} young master, {{with a more}} gracious air. [...] "Come, now, and hold Miss Eva's horse while <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> on to the saddle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her,</b> Major?" [...] asked Jeekie of Alan. [...] "In box in library {{where she}} used to live, or in plate-safe with spoons? Or under your bed where she always keep eye on you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I know he's a {{sensible}} young skeesicks. That's how. See here, Betty, you've gotten hold of wrong ideas about this place. You don't understand {{the position of}} affairs. Your aunt didn't till <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> wise." ...|$|E
60|$|PEW. Ah, and why, says you? Because <b>I</b> up and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in her place, {{when she}} forgot herself to you, Commander.|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy laughed, {{though his}} face grew {{slightly}} flushed. [...] "I'm afraid <b>I</b> also <b>put</b> <b>her</b> ashore. One can't get over that." [...] Then {{he looked at}} Jordan. [...] "In fact, I scarcely think I'm out of the wood yet. There will be an inquiry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And the old gentleman too,' said Mrs Jarley; 'for I {{want to have}} a {{word with}} him. Do you want a good {{situation}} for your grand-daughter, master? If you do, <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in the way of getting one. What do you say?' ...|$|R
60|$|Any man, not an inbred and inborn villain, {{would have}} {{respected}} her at that moment. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> {{hand on my}} arm and led her away gently past the ruined chapel, and down {{the slope of the}} hill.|$|E
6000|$|... "She didn't give me her confidence," [...] Lister said, and smiled. [...] "She {{wanted to}} get away and I helped. That's all. It's obvious I wasn't out for a romantic adventure, because <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> off the train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It stopped soon afterwards," [...] Lister replied. [...] "She {{wanted to}} get off and go East; the train was bound West, but we were held up at a side-track, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> on board a gravel train locomotive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cousin Rotherwood {{assumes that}} I did; but I {{did not really}} accept. I told him I could not tell, for you know your Grandmamma Merrifield talked of coming here, and <b>I</b> cannot <b>put</b> <b>her</b> off. And now I see {{that it must be}} given up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your soul, lad, <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>her</b> almost {{anywhere}} on this 'ere shore, though I don't {{claim to be}} {{what you might call}} a sailor, nor even a good imitation of one: but it's a mighty poor stick that can't work a pair of oars." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> rose, she <b>put</b> <b>her</b> arm round my waist--then {{instantly}} drew it away again, {{and shook}} her fingers impatiently, as if something had hurt them.|$|R
