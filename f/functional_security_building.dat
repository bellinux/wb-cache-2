40|$|This paper {{describes}} an ongoing {{project on the}} specification and automatic implementation of <b>functional</b> <b>security</b> policies. We advocate a clear separation between functional behavior and <b>functional</b> <b>security</b> requirements. We propose a formal language to specify <b>functional</b> <b>security</b> policies. We are developing techniques by which a formal <b>functional</b> <b>security</b> policy can be automatically implemented. Hence, our approach is highly inspired from model-driven engineering. Furthermore, our formal language will enabled us to use model checking techniques to verify that a security policy satisfies desired properties. ...|$|R

5000|$|Security Building: 510 S. Spring Street - Built in 1906, the 11-story steel-frame <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> was {{designed}} in an Italianate style by Parkinson and Bergstrom. When it was built, {{it was the}} tallest building in Los Angeles, surpassing the Continental Building. It remained the city's tallest building until 1911. The <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> has been converted to lofts operated under the name [...] "The Lofts at the Security Building." [...] The <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #741) in 2003.|$|R
40|$|In today's {{software}} development process, security related design decisions are rarely made {{early in the}} overall process. Even if security is considered early, this means that in most cases a more-or-less encompassing security requirement analyses is made, Based on this analysis best-practices, ad-hocdesign decisions or individual expertise is used to integrate security during the development process or after weaknesses are found after the deployment. This paper introduces <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> Block Models which are used to build security related components, namely <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> Blocks. These <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> Blocks represent concrete security solutions, so called Security Properties, introduced in other publications of the Sec Futur project. The goal {{of this approach is}} to provide already defined and tested security related software components, which can be used early in the overall development process, to support security-design-decision already while modeling the software-system. The paper shortly describes this new Security Engineering Process with its requirement analysis and definition of Security Properties and how the <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> Block Model fits into this approach. Additionally the <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> Block Model is presented in detail. All artifacts and relationships of the model are described. Short examples finish up the paper to show the creation of the <b>Security</b> <b>Building</b> Blocks and their interactions with other software components...|$|R

The maximum <b>security</b> <b>building</b> {{is the first in}} Ontario to be constructed from prefabricated concrete cells that can be stacked with a minimal support structure.

40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>functional</b> {{testing is}} a costly {{activity}} typically performed by security evaluation laboratories. These laboratories {{have struggled to}} keep pace with increasing demand to test numerous product variations. This paper summarizes the results of applying a model-based approach to automate <b>functional</b> <b>security</b> testing. The approach involves developing models of security requirements as the basis for automatic test vector and test driver generation. In the application, security properties were modeled and the resulting tests were executed against Oracle and Interbase database engines through a fully automated process. The findings indicate the approach, proven successful in a variety of other application domains, provides a cost-effective solution to <b>functional</b> <b>security</b> testing. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} security-critical {{pervasive}} systems is challenging {{due to that}} security constraints are often highly dependent on dynamically changing contexts. To increase the trustworthiness of pervasive systems, a dependable approach to system development must be followed, which enables seamless integration of the <b>functional,</b> <b>security</b> and context-awareness requirements. This paper proposes a paradigm which enables the specification of the <b>functional,</b> <b>security</b> and context-awareness requirements of a system in a single formalism, called Context-Aware Secure Action System (CASAS). Its syntax, formal semantics and pragmatics are presented, as well as algorithms and techniques for analysing the behaviour of a pervasive computing system...|$|R
