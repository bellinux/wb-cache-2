5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{regarded}} as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. Bayern and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the rudders <b>hard</b> <b>over,</b> the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7degrees. With a metacentric height of , larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, with a slight roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder <b>hard</b> <b>over.</b> The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder <b>hard</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Königsberg-class cruisers had a {{standard}} crew of 21officers and 493enlisted men. This later increased to 23officers and 588591enlisted men, and during World War II, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried {{a number of}} smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, one cutter, and one dinghy. The ships were moderately good sea boats, but {{had the potential to}} capsize if internal stores were improperly loaded, and suffered from a slight lee helm. They heeled up to twenty degrees with the rudder <b>hard</b> <b>over.</b> They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a head sea. In a hard turn, they lost up to 20percent speed.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The hulls {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At low speed, however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. The ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% speed with the rudder <b>hard</b> <b>over</b> at high speed. The ships had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men. Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51officers and 1,548sailors. The ships carried several smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E

50|$|Anaglypta is a {{range of}} {{paintable}} textured wallcoverings made from paper or vinyl. It is produced on traditional paper and paste-the-wall substrates. Anaglypta is similar to Lincrusta, except it is made of cheaper materials (Lincrusta is made from a gelled paste of linseed oil and wood flour). Because of this, Anaglypta is considerably lighter and more flexible than Lincrusta. However, it is less durable, especially since Lincrusta gets <b>harder</b> <b>over</b> time.|$|R

25|$|The air battles {{opened on}} 13 August. The 88 IAP fought <b>hard</b> <b>over</b> the bridgehead, and their {{fighting}} spirit was evident to the German fighter pilots of JG 3, which were concentrated there {{to ensure the}} Ju 87s were {{able to carry out}} their assignments unhindered. Through a skilfully handled withdrawal, the 26th Army was able to escape. Luftflotte 4 failed in its operations to isolate the Soviets, and the defenders themselves blew the bridge once their move was complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{restriction}} on weight meant the torpedo {{could not be}} fired from a torpedo tube, but instead was carried in a rear-facing trough. On firing it was pushed backwards by a cordite firing pistol and a long steel ram, entering the water tail-first. A trip-wire between the torpedo and the ram head would start the torpedo motors once pulled taut during release. The CMB would then turn <b>hard</b> <b>over</b> {{and get out of}} its path. There is no record of a CMB ever being hit by its own torpedo, but in one instance the firing pistol was triggered prematurely and the crew had a tense 20 minutes close to the enemy whilst reloading it.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel <b>hard</b> <b>over</b> to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E

25|$|Despite an {{impressive}} debut season, Bartel struggled {{to maintain his}} spot within the team during the 2003 AFL season, featuring in only 13 senior games. Averaging just 12 disposals a game, Bartel was unable to help the Cats qualify for the finals series for the third successive season. After just two senior appearances to begin the 2004 AFL season, Bartel was again dropped back to the VFL and instructed by coaching staff to work on particular aspects of his game. Despite compiling a series of impressive games in the VFL, Bartel was deliberately made to work <b>hard</b> <b>over</b> a two-month period before earning a Round 10 recall into the senior side. Bartel's re-introduction to the senior team coincided with Geelong winning ten out of their final twelve games and securing a top four spot ahead of the finals series. Although Geelong were eliminated in the preliminary final by reigning premiers Brisbane, Bartel's averages of 22 disposals and 5 tackles a game {{over the course of}} the season had seen him secure his position within the team's midfield rotation. His performances during the second half of the season, during which he averaged 29 disposals and 5 tackles a game, also saw him recognised as the highest-polling Geelong player—with 13 votes in total—during the 2004 Brownlow Medal count.|$|E
25|$|In April 1940, {{seven months}} after the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, MacMillan was appointed as GSO1 in HQ 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division, a first line Territorial Army (TA) formation commanded by Major General Vivian Majendie, then serving in Northern Command (soon moving to Eastern Command), as a lieutenant colonel. The division was a motorised infantry formation composed of only two, rather than three, brigades, and was amongst several responsible for coastal defence and for engaging any possible enemy airborne landings {{in the event of a}} German invasion. In late June, after the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated from Dunkirk and the fall of France, the division – composed initially of the 164th and 165th Infantry Brigades with supporting divisional troops – was reorganised as a standard infantry division with the addition of the 199th Infantry Brigade from the disbanded 66th Infantry Division. In May the following year, with the division, now under Major General William Morgan and serving in East Anglia under Lieutenant General Hugh Massy's XI Corps, being still concerned mainly with home defence, MacMillan took up command of the 199th Brigade and was promoted to the rank of brigadier. He trained the brigade very <b>hard</b> <b>over</b> the next few months in numerous large-scale exercises until, in late December 1941, he was chosen to be Brigadier General Staff (BGS) in the HQ of IX Corps District. Initially the corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Francis Nosworthy, was involved in coastal defences, supporting Eastern Command, but was soon to become engaged in preparing itself for the Allied invasion of French North Africa, codenamed Operation Torch.|$|E
500|$|The Kaiser-class {{ships were}} {{excellent}} sea boats, but were very stiff, suffering a slight loss of speed in heavy swells.
