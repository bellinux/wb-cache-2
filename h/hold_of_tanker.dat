50|$|Stigwood {{was born}} in 1934 in Port Pirie, South Australia, the son of Gwendolyn (Burrows) and Gordon Stigwood, an {{electrical}} engineer. He was educated at Sacred Heart College in Adelaide. He began his working life as a copywriter for a local advertising agency, before emigrating to England in 1955. It proved an eventful trip: in one incident, recounted by Simon Napier-Bell, Stigwood bravely climbed fifty feet down a rope ladder into the <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a <b>tanker</b> to administer morphine to a seaman who had fallen through a hatch. In Turkey he spent several months living with {{the family of a}} young friend in a hut in a small village and working with them in the fields.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{inventory}} routing {{problem in}} crude oil transportation is studied, in which crude oil is transported from a supply center to multiple customer harbors {{to satisfy their}} demands over multiple periods. In the problem, a heterogeneous fleet <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> owned by a distributor and tankers rented from a third party, a pipeline, and multiple types of routes are considered; both inventory level and shortage level at each customer harbor are limited. The objective is to determine for each period over a given time horizon the number <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> <b>of</b> each type to be rented/returned at the supply center, the number <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> <b>of</b> each type to be dispatched on each route, and the quantity of crude oil flowing through the pipeline that minimizes the total logistics cost. After formulating the problem as a mixed integer programming problem, a Lagrangian relaxation approach is developed for finding a near optimal solution of the problem. The approach is also applied to {{a variant of the}} problem in which both fully and partially loaded tankers are allowed in the transportation of crude oil. Numerical experiments show that this approach outperforms an existing meta-heuristic algorithm, especially for the instances of large sizes...|$|R

40|$|The United States Transportation Command (USTC) {{must ensure}} that {{sufficient}} assets are available to transport the war-time requirements of Petroleum, Oil and Lubrication (POL) for the military. To be confident that sufficient assets exist to transport POL, USTC must know the number <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> required. The Mobility Division of the Logistics Directorate of the Joint Staff (J 4 -MOB) uses a simulation model, the Model for Intertheater Deployment by Air and Sea (MIDAS), to determine the required number <b>of</b> <b>tankers.</b> MIDAS' use is problematic since many runs may be needed, each run is manpower-intensive, and results do not necessarily define the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>tankers.</b> This thesis couples a schedule generator and an integer linear programming (ILP) model to determine the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> to satisfy war-time POL requirements. Solving a realistic scenario provided by J 4 -MOB (spanning 75 days with 92 available tankers), the ILP selects 19 tankers, one-third the number initially chosen by MIDAS. Using the ILP's recommended schedules, MIDAS confirms the ILP's solution. These {{results show that the}} schedule generator and the ILP can assist J 4 -MOB. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|Periodical dry-docking and {{close-up}} inspection <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> {{have long}} been an established regulatory requirement to monitor the health <b>of</b> the <b>tanker's</b> hull structure. While simple tool of extrapolation based on historical measured thickness data {{has been used by}} many to predict future corrosion and to assist in hull maintenance, pooling <b>of</b> data across <b>tanker</b> fleets has not been widely attempted. Also, hull girder section modulus (HGSM) has long been regarded as a more realistic representation of hull girder strength than mere thickness readings. This paper describes such an attempt by ABS using gauging records <b>of</b> several hundred <b>tankers.</b> The as-measured structural member thicknesses are used to calculate the HGSM loss. Statistically, the pooled data suggest that HGSM loss may best follow a Weibull distribution. Weighted regression analysis is used to obtain the mean values and standard deviations of the HGSM loss and the then the corresponding Weibull parameters are calculated. The result of this study could be used to investigate time-variant reliability <b>of</b> <b>tanker</b> hull structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{transportation}} {{of crude oil}} fromproduction fields to refineries {{is a very important}} operation in the oil industry. In this paper, an inventory routing problem for crude oil transportation is studied, where the crude oil is transported froma central depot to a set of customerswithdynamic demand usingmultiple transportationmodes. Oil can be transported throughmarine routes, pipelines or {{a combination of the two}} modes. The marine {{transportation of}} crude oil is performed by a heterogeneous fleet <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> with limited capacity owned by an oil distributor itself and/or the <b>tankers</b> <b>of</b> different types rented from a third party. Each transportation operation has a lead time and the storage capacity of oil at each customer is limited. Theproblem is to determine over a given planning horizon an optimal oil transportation plan that minimizes the total transportation and inventory costs subject to various constraints. The plan defines the number <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> <b>of</b> each type to rent and the number <b>of</b> <b>tankers</b> <b>of</b> each type to dispatch on each route in each period. A mixed-integer programming model is established for the problem. Because of the high complexity and large sizeof theproblem, themodel is toocomplicated tobesolvedexactly. Ametaheuristicmethod, the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) enhanced by an intensification strategy based on Path Relinking is developed to find its near-optimal solutions.
