25|$|A {{liquid ring}} pump is a {{rotating}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that is powered by an induction motor and is typically used as a vacuum pump or as a gas compressor. The {{liquid ring pump}} was invented in 1905 by Lewis H. Nash. Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company. Nash filed U.S. patent #1,091,529 on February 24, 1910 and was issued to him on March 31, 1914.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E

50|$|Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> unlike {{centrifugal}} or roto-dynamic pumps, theoretically {{can produce}} the same flow at a given speed (RPM) {{no matter what the}} discharge pressure. Thus, positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are constant flow machines. However, a slight increase in internal leakage as the pressure increases prevents a truly constant flow rate.|$|R
50|$|A {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> {{must not}} operate against a closed valve on the discharge {{side of the}} pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal pumps. A positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> operating against a closed discharge valve continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts, the pump is severely damaged, or both.|$|E

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump).</b> Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump)</b> backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E
50|$|A {{piston pump}} {{is a type}} of {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> where the high-pressure seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or compress gases.|$|E
50|$|The Powerplus is {{a design}} of {{supercharger}} {{that was used}} to boost the performance of car engines in the 1930s. It is a mechanically driven positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> operating on the sliding-vane principle.|$|E
50|$|Truck and trailer-mounted sewer jetters used by {{municipalities}} {{and larger}} service companies {{benefit from the}} high hydraulic horsepower delivered by powerful <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> and so can remove tree roots and other solid obstructions.|$|R
50|$|As with {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> the base pressure will be reached when leakage, outgassing, and backstreaming equal the pump speed, but now minimizing leakage and outgassing {{to a level}} comparable to backstreaming becomes much more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Endless-piston {{principle}} is a dispensing variation of rotating positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Their operating principle {{can be compared}} with an endless piston that conveys the product from the suction side to the discharge side, building up a differential pressure in the process.|$|R
50|$|The flow is pulsed, {{particularly}} at low rotational speeds. Therefore, these pumps are less suitable where a smooth consistent flow is required. An alternative type of positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> should then be considered.|$|E
50|$|A {{variable}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> is {{a device}} that converts mechanical energy to hydraulic (fluid) energy. The displacement, or amount of fluid pumped per revolution of the pump's input shaft can be varied while the pump is running.|$|E
5000|$|An {{axial piston}} pump is a {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that {{has a number of}} pistons in a circular array within a cylinder block. It {{can be used as a}} stand-alone pump, a hydraulic motor or an automotive air conditioning compressor.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{metering}} pumps are piston-driven. Piston <b>pumps</b> are positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{which can be}} designed to pump at practically constant flow rates (averaged over time) against {{a wide range of}} discharge pressure, including high discharge pressures of thousands of psi.|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal pump {{impellers}} have specific speed values ranging from 500 to 10,000 (English units), with {{radial flow pumps}} at 500-4000, mixed flow at 2000-8000 and axial flow pumps at 7000-20,000. Values of specific speed less than 500 are associated with positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic <b>pumps</b> are positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law. It states that the increase in pressure at one point of the enclosed liquid in equilibrium of rest is transmitted equally to all other points of the liquid, unless the effect of gravity is neglected.(in case of statics) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked pulleys, wheels or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|E
50|$|A {{plunger pump}} {{is a type}} of {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> where the high-pressure seal is stationary and a smooth cylindrical plunger slides through the seal. This makes them different from piston pumps and allows them to be used at higher pressures. This type of pump is often used to transfer municipal and industrial sewage.|$|E
50|$|A {{diaphragm}} pump (also {{known as a}} Membrane pump) is a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that uses {{a combination of the}} reciprocating action of a rubber, thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves {{on either side of the}} diaphragm(check valve, butterfly valves, flap valves, or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the variable <b>displacement</b> vane <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pumps can be {{classified}} by their method of displacement into positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps. There are two basic types of pumps: positive displacement and centrifugal. Although axial-flow pumps are frequently classified as a separate type, they have essentially the same operating principles as centrifugal pumps.|$|R
50|$|These {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> have {{an expanding}} cavity on the suction {{side and a}} decreasing cavity on the discharge side. Liquid flows into the pumps as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses. The volume is constant given each cycle of operation.|$|R
