Numerous connections with many countries point {{to the strength of}} individual centres and to some extent, they refl ect their competitive position. This article is devoted to the analysis of the position of regional centres in Slovakia (Bratislava, Košice, Prešov, Nitra, Žilina, Banská Bystrica, Trnava and Trenčín) on the basis of <b>direct</b> <b>international</b> public transport <b>connections.</b> Type of connections (train, bus, air and boat connections), intensity (number of connections a week) and the directions of connections (coun-tries, cities) are analysed. Key words: public transport, <b>direct</b> <b>international</b> transport <b>connections,</b> train con-nections, bus connections, air connections, boat connections, regional centres, com-petitive position, Slovaki...|$|R

Recent years, however, haveseen a decline in <b>direct</b> <b>international</b> <b>connections.</b> This is not somuch due to political developments (the Iron Curtain ceased toexist during the period in question), but rather technical advancesthat have resulted in the development of high-speed networksspecific to various countries. Problems associated withthe use of different gauges, and also electrical and sophisticatedelectronic systems in individual European countries have resultedin high-speed trains being confined mainly to individualstates. During the next years, it is highly desirable to re-establishan international European train or Transrapid network to avoidroad and air-traffic chaos as European integration proceedswith the planned eastwards expansion of the European Union...|$|R
