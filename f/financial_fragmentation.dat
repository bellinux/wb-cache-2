40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the cross-country heterogeneity {{in retail}} bank lending {{rates in the}} euro area and presents newly developed pass-through models that account for the riskiness of borrowers, the balance sheet constraints of lenders and sovereign debt tensions affecting interest rate-setting behaviour. Country evidence for the four largest euro area countries shows that downward adjustments in policy rates and market reference rates have translated into a concomitant reduction in bank lending rates. In the case of Spain and Italy, however, sovereign bond market tensions and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment have put upward pressure on composite lending rates to non-financial corporations and households. At the same time, model simulations suggest that higher lending rates have propagated to the broader economy by depressing economic activity and inflation. As a response to increasing <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> the ECB has introduced several standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. These measures have {{gone a long way}} towards alleviating financial market tensions in the euro area. However, in order to ensure the adequate transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets is reduced further and the resilience of banks strengthened where needed.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} <b>financial</b> market <b>fragmentation</b> in China after 1978 -reform.

40|$|The {{sovereign}} bond crisis {{which started in}} 2010 caused a major disruption in euro area financial markets.

Using Indonesia and Vietnam as case studies, we identify challenges at the national level but opportunities at the local level.

The main challenges identified are lack of knowledge, lack of political will, lack of <b>financial</b> incentives, and <b>fragmentation</b> of mandates and tasks of different government agencies. In contrast, at the local level, integration of mitigation and adaptation is facilitated by subnational autonomy, where mitigation projects might have adaptation co-benefits, and vice versa.

Successful integration of mitigation and adaptation policies would not only remove contradictions between policies, but also encourage governments that are designing domestic policies to exploit the potential for positive spillovers and realize the benefits of both approaches.

Since the Crisis the regulatory pendulum has swung to the other extreme. Post-Crisis regulation, plus rapid technological change, have spurred the development of financial technology companies (FinTechs). FinTechs and data-driven financial services providers profoundly challenge the current regulatory paradigm. Financial regulators are increasingly seeking to balance the traditional regulatory objectives of financial stability and consumer protection with promoting growth and innovation. The resulting regulatory innovations include technology (RegTech), regulatory sandboxes and special charters. This paper analyses possible new regulatory approaches, ranging from doing nothing (which spans being permissive to highly restrictive, depending on context), cautious permissiveness (on a case-by-case basis, or through special charters), structured experimentalism (such as sandboxes or piloting), and development of specific new regulatory frameworks. Building on this framework, we argue for a new regulatory approach, which incorporates these rebalanced objectives, and which we term ‘smart regulation’. Our new automated and proportionate regime builds on shared principles {{from a range of}} jurisdictions and supports innovation in <b>financial</b> markets. The <b>fragmentation</b> of market participants and the increased use of technology requires regulators to adopt a sequential reform process, starting with digitization, before building digitally-smart regulation.

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{of the financial crisis}} back in 2007 exposed a series of deficiencies in the way the European mechanisms functioned, highlighting the incomplete policy design of the EMU (Economic and Monetary Union). Thus, it became evident that financial integration, financial stability and national responsibility for crisis prevention and management could not be all simultaneously fulfilled. Several factors have been responsible for the deepening of the financial crisis effects in the EU (European Union) /EZ (Euro Zone), namely the one-size fits all monetary policy and the absence of a fiscal institution counterpart to the ECB (European Central Bank), the EZ governance focused on rules-based prevention with limited scope for crisis management, lax banking supervisory standards, the absence of cross-border risk sharing mechanisms and bank nationalism, and the lack of political leadership. Given these flaws, the aims of the EBU (European Banking Union) would largely be twofold: * To strengthen the single market for financial services by ensuring a level playing field for banks. This would require a competitively neutral financial supervision across the EZ (and ideally across the EU). * To break the vicious circle between sovereigns and banks, thus reversing the process of <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|A salient {{feature of}} the East Asian region is the {{persistent}} discrepancy between the progress in de facto and de jure economic integration. East Asia has long been {{said to be the}} champion of loose regional economic integration, with deepening intra-regional trade and investment linkages {{in the absence of any}} formal cooperative scheme. However, an oft-heard claim is that East Asia has been shifting recently towards an institution-based form of regional economic cooperation, primarily as a result of the 1997 – 98 financial crisis. Next to post-crisis financial cooperative schemes under the ASEAN+ 3, the surge of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) involving East Asian countries is thought by some to further substantiate this claim. The objective of the paper is twofold; first, to assess the validity of the aforementioned claim; and second, to examine the links between de facto and de jure economic integration in East Asia compared to other regions of the world. In the process, the sequencing between trade and monetary cooperation is also addressed. The paper starts by providing a candid assessment of the current state of play of economic cooperation in East Asia (de jure integration), both from the trade and the financial/monetary perspective, and highlights the limitations of the formal regional integration movement in East Asia to date. As a next step, it explores the changing nature of intra-regional trade and investment linkages, contrasts it to the situation in other parts of the world such as Europe and examines to what extent this new form of interdependence may be instrumental in making formal regional economic schemes more attractive. A major conclusion is that de facto trade integration may not automatically lead to deeper regional trade cooperation de jure and that its impact is likely to be stronger on monetary cooperation projects.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades most stock and {{derivatives}} exchanges in the world transitioned to electronic trading in limit order books, creating a need for a new set of quantitative models to describe these order-driven markets. This dissertation offers a collection of models that provide insight into the structure of modern financial markets, and can help to optimize trading decisions in practical applications. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we study the dynamics of prices, order flows and liquidity in limit order markets over short timescales. We propose a stylized order book model that predicts a particularly simple linear relation between price changes and order flow imbalance, defined as a difference between net changes in supply and demand. The slope in this linear relation, called a price impact coefficient, is inversely proportional in our model to market depth - a measure of liquidity. Our empirical results confirm both of these predictions. The linear relation between order flow imbalance and price changes holds for time intervals between 50 milliseconds and 5 minutes. The inverse relation between the price impact coefficient and market depth holds on longer timescales. These findings shed a new light on intraday variations in market volatility. According to our model volatility fluctuates due to changes in market depth or in order flow variance. Previous studies also found a positive correlation between volatility and trading volume, but in order-driven markets prices are determined by the limit order book activity, so the association between trading volume and volatility is unclear. We show how a spurious correlation between these variables can indeed emerge in our linear model due to time aggregation of high-frequency data. Finally, we observe short-term positive autocorrelation in order flow imbalance and discuss an application of this variable as a measure of adverse selection in limit order executions. Our results suggest that monitoring recent order flow can improve the quality of order executions in practice. In the second part of the thesis we study the problem of optimal order placement in a fragmented limit order market. To execute a trade, market participants can submit limit orders or market orders across various exchanges where a stock is traded. In practice these decisions are influenced by sizes of order queues and by statistical properties of order flows in each limit order book, and also by rebates that exchanges pay for limit order submissions. We present a realistic model of limit order executions and formalize the search for an optimal order placement policy as a convex optimization problem. Based on this formulation we study how various factors determine investor's order placement decisions. In a case when a single exchange is used for order execution, we derive an explicit formula for the optimal limit and market order quantities. Our solution shows that the optimal split between market and limit orders largely depends on one's tolerance to execution risk. Market orders help to alleviate this risk because they execute with certainty. Correspondingly, we find that an optimal order allocation shifts to these more expensive orders when the execution risk is of primary concern, for example when the intended trade quantity is large or when it is costly to catch up on the quantity after limit order execution fails. We also characterize the optimal solution in the general case of simultaneous order placement on multiple exchanges, and show that it sets execution shortfall probabilities to specific threshold values computed with model parameters. Finally, we propose a non-parametric stochastic algorithm that computes an optimal solution by resampling historical data and does not require specifying order flow distributions. A numerical implementation of this algorithm is used to study the sensitivity of an optimal solution to changes in model parameters. Our numerical results show that order placement optimization can bring a substantial reduction in trading costs, especially for small orders and in cases when order flows are relatively uncorrelated across trading venues. The order placement optimization framework developed in this thesis can also be used to quantify the costs and benefits of <b>financial</b> market <b>fragmentation</b> from the point of view of an individual investor. For instance, we find that a positive correlation between order flows, which is empirically observed in a fragmented U. S. equity market, increases the costs of trading. As the correlation increases it may become more expensive to trade in a fragmented market than it is in a consolidated market. In the third part of the thesis we analyze the dynamics of limit order queues at the best bid or ask of an exchange. These queues consist of orders submitted by a variety of market participants, yet existing order book models commonly assume that all orders have similar dynamics. In practice, some orders are submitted by trade execution algorithms in an attempt to buy or sell a certain quantity of assets under time constraints, and these orders are canceled if their realized waiting time exceeds a patience threshold. In contrast, high-frequency traders submit and cancel orders depending on the order book state and their orders are not driven by patience. The interaction between these two order types within a single FIFO queue leads bursts of order cancelations for small queues and anomalously long waiting times in large queues. We analyze a fluid model that describes the evolution of large order queues in liquid markets, taking into account the heterogeneity between order submission and cancelation strategies of different traders. Our results show that after a finite initial time interval, the queue reaches a specific structure where all orders from high-frequency traders stay in the queue until execution but most orders from execution algorithms exceed their patience thresholds and are canceled. This "order crowding" effect has been previously noted by participants in highly liquid stock and futures markets and was attributed to a large participation of high-frequency traders. In our model, their presence creates an additional workload, which increases queue waiting times for new orders. Our analysis of the fluid model leads to waiting time estimates that take into account the distribution of order types in a queue. These estimates are tested against a large dataset of realized limit order waiting times collected by a U. S. equity brokerage firm. The queue composition at a moment of order submission noticeably affects its waiting time and we find that assuming a single order type for all orders in the queue leads to unrealistic results. Estimates that assume instead a mix of heterogeneous orders in the queue are closer to empirical data. Our model for a limit order queue with heterogeneous order types also appears to be interesting from a methodological point of view. It introduces a new type of behavior in a queueing system where one class of jobs has state-dependent dynamics, while others are driven by patience. Although this model is motivated by the analysis of limit order books, it may find applications in studying other service systems with state-dependent abandonments...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. In {{the long}} {{shadow of the}} euro-area crisis, the {{relationship}} between governments and their banks has {{been brought to the}} the centre of the policy debate in Europe by the implementation of regulatory reforms, the risks associated with <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> and the fight to sustain the flow of credit to governments and corporates. The attempt to interpret the patterns of pressure and influence running between governments and their financial system has led commentators to rediscover and give new life to concepts originating from academic debates of the 1970 s such as “regulatory capture” and “financial repression”. Government agencies have been frequently described as being {{at the mercy of the}} financial sector, often allowing financial interests to hijack political, regulatory and supervisory processes in order to favouring their own private interests over the public good 1. An opposite view has instead pointed the finger at governments, which have often been portrayed as subverting markets and abusing the financial system to their benefit, either in order to secure better financing conditions to overcome their own financial difficulties, or with the objective of directing credit to certain sectors of the economy, “repressing” the free functioning of financial markets and potentially the private interests of some of its participants...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{shed light}} on the role of credit supply shocks in euro area {{countries}} during the recent pre-crisis, bust, and post-crisis periods. A time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) with stochastic volatility 0 la Primiceri (2005) is estimated for each country, and the structural shocks are identified by imposing sign restrictions on impulse response functions based on the theoretical model by Gerali et al. (2010). The results suggest that credit supply shocks have been an important driver of business cycle fluctuations in euro area countries, and that their effects on the economy have generally increased since the recent crisis. Moreover, we report evidence that credit supply shocks contributed positively to output growth during the pre-crisis period and negatively during the downturn in economic activity in 2008 - 2009 in all the countries considered. In the post-crisis period, by contrast, we observe a strong rise in cross-country heterogeneity, reflecting <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation</b> in the euro area. Although this heterogeneity across euro area countries seems to have declined since around 2012, the contribution of credit supply shocks to GDP growth and credit growth remains negative in most euro area countries, suggesting that constraints in the supply of credit continue to weaken economic activity...|$|E
40|$|In {{universal}} banking, large banks operate extensive {{networks of}} branches, provide many different services, hold several claims on firms (including equity and debt), and participate {{directly in the}} corporate governance of firms that rely on the banks for funding or as insurance underwriters. In this paper, the author contrasts the cost of financing industrialization in the United States and in Germany during the second industrial revolution. He explains that large production is typical of modern industrial practice, so the lessons from that period apply broadly to contemporary developing countries. The second industrial revolution involved many new products and technologies. Firms were producing new goods in new ways on an unprecedented scale. Therefore, they needed quick access to heavy financing. Finance costs for industry were lower in Germany than in the United States, because U. S. regulations prevented the universal banking from which Germany benefited. High finance costs retarded U. S. realization of its full industrial potential. The potential to expand quickly and reap economies of scale was greater in German industrialization. The cost of industrial financing began to decline when institutional changes came about that increased the concentration of financial market transactions. In recent decades, a combination of macroeconomic distress, international competitive pressure, and the creative invention of new financial intermediaries has helped the U. S. financial system overcome the regulatory mandate of <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> Financial Intermediation,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Banks&Banking Reform,Labor Policies,Decentralization,Banks&Banking Reform,Financial Intermediation,Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,Housing Finance...|$|E

As of 2010, the euro area was confronted with a severe sovereign debt and banking crisis. Despite these troublesome developments, the euro area has proven to have a considerable degree of resilience. In each phase, governance weaknesses were revealed – and national governments together with the EU institutions have designed an impressive series of policy responses in crisis management and institutional innovation. The euro area today is completed by a banking union with a Single Supervisory and a Single Resolution Mechanism. National budgetary and economic policies are more closely overseen and coordinated. With the European Stability Mechanism, the euro area now has a permanent tool in place to manage sovereign liquidity crises and instabilities in the banking sector. Most importantly, the euro area's only true federal institution, the European Central Bank (ECB), has become its most effective crisis manager: with the announcement of its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme, the ECB finally managed to calm the self fulfilling crisis in 2012. Meanwhile, the announcement of credit easing and quasi-quantitative easing in September 2014 is a move towards reducing <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation</b> and countering deflation. The euro area in 2014 is hence a lot different from the one in 2007. And yet, further challenges need to be overcome. Prevailing stagnation, fragmentation and problems of legitimacy require a rethink of policies and further governance reform...|$|E
40|$|German {{long-term}} care insurance, implemented in 1995, significantly extends {{the coverage of}} care-related risks. Given the similarities of German and U. S. institutional features, the German social insurance approach has been put forward as a possible model for {{long-term care}} in the United States. Using a political economy framework, the authors conducted a policy analysis that compares the main shortfalls of long-term care (LTC) provision in the United States and Germany, examines the responses provided by LTC insurance in Germany, and relates them to broader trends and proposals for change in welfare policy in both countries. German LTC insurance includes {{a high degree of}} consumer direction and compensation and protection for informal caregivers; it supports the extension of community-based services. Its short-falls include the continued split between health and LTC insurance. In both countries, decentralization and institutional and <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation</b> are some of the characteristics responsible for the failure to promote egalitarian social policy and substantially expand social protection to family- and care-related risks. The German LTC program is a good model for the United States. With a social insurance approach to LTC, costs are spread across the largest possible risk pool. Major goals that can be reached with such a program include establishment of universal entitlements to LTC benefits, consumer choice, and equitability and uniformity. How comparable are the United States and Germany in the aging of their popu-lations? Germany is demographically older: 15. 8 percent of its population is over 65, compared with 12. 6 percent in the United States. Much lower fertility rates in Germany are slowing population growth, which is expected to become negative by 2010. Projections of demographic aging in Germany predict a rapid increase in the number and proportion of people over 65 (to 20. 5 percent) over the next ten years...|$|E
40|$|Completing {{the banking}} union is an urgent project facing the EU, given the eurozone’s {{continued}} vulnerability to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks to national banking systems. The proposed {{changes to the}} European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) under consideration by the European Commission could open {{the way to a}} satisfactory compromise between the twin needs to reduce legacy risks in banks’ balance sheets and to provide greater risk-sharing and a fiscal backstop for both the Resolution and the EDIS Funds – while continuing to exclude any sharing of past losses. With such a compromise, <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation</b> would likely recede rapidly, leading to a larger role by private capital in cushioning real and financial idiosyncratic shocks. EDIS could move forward immediately by providing in its early phase that the European Stability Mechanism would provide a liquidity line to national deposit guarantee schemes that had exhausted their funds, with no sharing of losses. Meanwhile, risk-reduction would accelerate through the stronger policies already established by the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the reduction of non-performing loans and a fresh approach to the reduction of banks’ sovereign exposures, based on {{a modified version of the}} large exposure prudential policy. Direct risk-weighting of national sovereigns would be excluded. The ultimate anchor of a stable banking union would be credible policies to reduce excessive sovereign debt-to-GDP ratios. This paper argues that a combination of a strengthened debt rule in the Stability and Growth Pact and a market discipline mechanism entailing the obligation to issue junior bonds, subject to restructuring, for the countries violating the common budgetary rules, could offer a suitable way forward to restore the credibility of the Pact. It also argues that effective policy coordination within the eurozone also requires greater symmetry of policy obligations by the member states, which may be built into the European Semester through an appropriate revision of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{overhaul of}} the global OTC derivatives markets, originating from the G 20, is transforming {{what used to be}} a relatively harmonised private and transnational legal regime into a public regulatory space fragmented by diverse territorial jurisdictions. In this regulatory space jurisdictional borders are elusive. Especially the United States and the European Union are applying what seems to be a novel type of regulatory strategy designed to protect their market share and curb regulatory arbitrage. The strategy, dubbed here the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, builds on unilateralist application of extraterritoriality, forms of direct and indirect protectionism, and conditional deference. Deference strategies such as the US substituted compliance and the EU equivalence regime should be regarded as carrots, applied together with the sticks of extraterritoriality and protectionism to drive regulatory convergence towards the strongest. However, the EU and US have failed to fill the leadership void in the global financial governance system, which remains soft at its core, and instead locked themselves in a regulatory turf war which has prevented them from recognising each other’s regulatory frameworks or finalising their own. Meanwhile, looming risks of costly regulatory retaliation are increasing market fragmentation and deglobalisation. The emerging "titanic model" of systemic risk management, where risk is concentrated in presumably watertight national compartments rather than mutualised globally, is not the way towards a more stable global financial system. In the short term, a successful completion of the transatlantic partnership is needed in order to reach the derivative reform's ultimate goals and to counter <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> But acknowledging the many practical and political problems involved in the exportation of rules through the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, which can also be manifested in a bilateral form, this paper joins the increasing number of scholars calling for more global and multilateral forms of financial governance...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a Capital Markets Union (CMU) is a high-priority project of the European Commission. CMU should foster additional non-bank sources of finance, mobilize private savings more efficiently and enhance capital market integration. Although more integration is needed, the Commission's proposal misses the role of systemic functions in a CMU. First, banks are important intermediaries specialized in credit relationships and {{small and medium-sized companies}} gain from long-term relationships with banks. Second, overcoming <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation</b> needs sound sovereign debt markets with stable sovereign finances. In a CMU sovereign risks have to be treated adequately in bank regulation. Third, it should be assessed in advance which sources of non-bank finance will be demanded by companies and will become systemic. We recommend an integrated financial supervision for the CMU. Therefore, the European Banking Union should cover all European Union members' systemic relevant banks. In order to mobilize private savings while coping with the CMU's complexity, the EU should foster financial literacy. Nachdem die europ 4 ische Bankenunion 2014 beschlossen wurde, hat Kommissionspr 4 sident Jean-Claude Juncker nun ein neues Projekt vorgeschlagen, das die Finanzmarktintegration in Europa weiter vorantreiben soll: die Kapitalmarktunion. W 4 hrend sich die Bankenunion auf die Schaffung eines einheitlichen Regelwerks sowie einer zentralen Bankenaufsicht und -abwicklung f den Bankensektor in der Eurozone beschr 4 nkt, soll die Kapitalmarktunion Barrieren aus dem Weg r 4 umen, die den Kapitalfluss in der gesamten Europ 4 ischen Union bremsen. Im internationalen Vergleich sind Banken in der EU h 6 chst relevant f die Unternehmensfinanzierung. Im Gegensatz dazu finanzieren sich Unternehmen in den USA st 4 rker direkt Kapitalm 4 rkte und weniger Banken. Auch wenn die USA kein explizites Vorbild f die Kapitalmarktunion ist, so zeigt sich doch deutlich, dass eine st 4 rkere Rolle der Kapitalm 4 rkte von der Politik favorisiert wird. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|A {{flurry of}} new {{regulation}} {{was passed in}} the wake of the financial crisis of 2007. Much remains however unknown about policies designed to prevent a repeat. In this dissertation I investigate two such regulatory approaches in financial and banking markets. In Chapter 2 I present an analysis of a revision of proxy access rules as it was mandated by Congress in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and subsequently implemented by the SEC in August 2010. Proxy access - the right for shareholders to nominate directors to a firm's board - lies at the heart of shareholder control and the monitoring process of management. I use the repeal of a new proxy access regime by the U. S. Court of Appeals as a natural experiment to quantify the costs and benefits associated with proxy access. The findings indicate that proxy access resulted in an increase of shareholder wealth for firms with agency issues, smaller firms, and firms where more investors qualified to make use of it. There are no valuation changes for large firms, firms without any agency issues and firms with special-interest investors. The results indicate that the market valued the empowerment of shareholders positively and calls for renewed regulatory attention to proxy access. Chapter 3 analyzes the effects from portfolio diversification and banking competition on the stability of U. S. banks during the 2008 - 2011 banking crisis in which more than 10 % of U. S. banks ceased to exist. To do so, the analysis makes use of exogenous cross-sectional and time-series variation in states' branching restrictions, the degree of county business cycle integration, and topographic variation due to oceans and international borders that limited the potential to diversify. I find that both banking competition and portfolio diversification significantly reduced the failure probability of banks thereby providing a policy rationale to reduce the <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of U. S. banking markets, to promote banking competition and an overall greater degree of diversification...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 22 May 2015 Examining Board: Professor Fabio Canova, EUI, Supervisor; Professor Luca Benati, University of Bern; Professor Luca Gambetti, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona; Professor Evi Pappa, EUI. This thesis {{studies the}} {{importance}} of non-fundamental factors in economic and financial fluctuations. In particular, it studies how the economy responds to changes in expectations about economic fundamentals, independently of actual changes in those fundamentals, {{and to what extent}} financial fluctuations in one country spillover to other countries. The first chapter investigates how the economy reacts to the arrival of news about future technological progress. I find that the economy expands following a so-called news shock, but the bulk of the effect is delayed until technology starts to actually improve. News shocks explain around 30 percent of business cycle fluctuations, while their role is more important for explaining variations in forward-looking variables, such as stock prices and the term spread. In the second chapter, jointly written with Stephane Dées, studies {{the importance of}} animal spirits - defined as changes in expectations not supported by changes in fundamentals - for producing business cycles. We find that animal spirits are more important for business cycle fluctuations than permanent shocks. We use a novel identification scheme in a vector-autoregressive framework that exploits the fact that the econometrician has a richer data-set than consumers. In the third chapter, jointly written with Roberto De Santis, studies the extent and direction of spillovers, contagion and connectedness in European and US sovereign debt markets from 2005 to 2014. We use a new method that allows us to identify orthogonal country specific shocks in a panel of countries, employing restrictions on the relative size of the contemporaneous impact effect. We find that connectedness declined steadily between 2009 and 2012, indicating increased <b>financial</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> We find that Greece was a key source of systemic risk in 2010, explaining 20 - 30 % of the variance of sovereign yields in stressed countries, while in 2011 - 2012 Italy, not Spain, was a key source of systemic risk...|$|E
