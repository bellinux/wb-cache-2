5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> The saga then continues.|$|E
5|$|Older trees {{sometimes}} grow epicormic shoots {{directly from}} their trunks after storm or ﬁre damage. Aerial rhizomes {{can also be}} produced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down into the soil to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.|$|E

5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis is one {{of several}} species of Persoonia that {{regenerate}} by resprouting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> after bushfire, an adaptation to the fire-prone habitat in which it grows. Its thick papery bark shields the underlying epicormic buds from the flames. Plants also regenerate by seedlings that arise from a seedbank in the soil after fire, although they may take up to 12months to germinate. One study of sclerophyll forest unburnt for thirty years showed P.levis had declined over time. P.levis plants can live for over 60years, and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6years.|$|E
5|$|Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) comforts her upset co-worker, Yelina (Monique Curnen), and {{learns that}} Yelina's fiancé, who was immigrating from Cuba {{illegally}} {{with the help}} of a coyote, is missing. Rita asks Dexter to look into the problem using his police connections, and he finds a list of subjects from a past police case. He investigates Jorge Castillo, a salvage yard owner, and after Yelina's fiancé washes up dead on a beach, he discovers that Castillo is murdering the smuggled immigrants who cannot pay for their freedom. Dexter leads Castillo into a trailer in his salvage yard, but as he prepares to kill him, Castillo's wife Valerie (Valerie Dillman) arrives. Dexter realizes that the couple are working together, and decides to kill both Jorge and Valerie in the trailer. After killing them, he dumps their bodies in the ocean and frees their Cuban prisoners, not noticing the person watching him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a car in the yard.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{brings his}} {{findings}} {{on the death of}} Cyrus to Sheriff Lamb and provides an alternate explanation; that the Dean had discovered his wife was having an affair. Lamb agrees with him that it was a murder. Lamb calls Mindy O'Dell, the dean's wife and a main suspect, to his office. Logan, Veronica's on-again, off-again boyfriend, visits Veronica in her cell and they are civil to each other. After being released from jail, Veronica is stopped on the street by Josh, who has Mason (Robert Ri'chard) in the trunk of his car, frantically telling Veronica that Mason is the culprit. When Veronica disproves this claim, she tells Josh to call her using a disposable phone within 24 hours. Veronica releases Mason <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|E
25|$|NSB made four {{proposals}} {{for a new}} railway to Gardermoen. The simplest devised constructing a branch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Line at a location north of Jessheim Station which would run to the airport. Alternatively, and ultimately selected, was construction of a tunnel eastwards from Oslo to Lillestrøm and an upgrade of the Trunk Line and a new route from a point at Asper to the airport. Two more direct routes were proposed; the one branching off from north of Grefsen Station on the Gjøvik Line, the other diverting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Line close to Grorud Station. All four routes called for the railway to continue north from Gardermoen and meet up with the Trunk Line at Bøn Station.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} or supplemental proposals {{has been}} to use the Alna Line as a cross-town services of the Oslo Commuter Rail.

25|$|Leaves grow {{directly}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> {{and typically}} fall when older, leaving {{a crown of}} leaves at the top. The leaves grow in a rosette form, with new foliage emerging from the top and center of the crown. The trunk may be buried, so the leaves appear to be emerging from the ground, so the plant {{appears to be a}} basal rosette. The leaves are generally large in proportion to the trunk size, and sometimes even larger than the trunk.|$|E

25|$|A shari is {{deadwood}} on {{the main}} trunk of the bonsai. A small shari usually runs vertically {{on or near the}} front of the trunk - shari have little aesthetic value {{at the rear of the}} trunk, where they are rarely viewed and are obscured by branch growth. The shallow wound exposes a non-living portion of the trunk, which will be surrounded by living bark. The natural causes of shari include a falling branch that has ripped bark <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> below it, lightning damage, or trunk damage from another external source. Shari may occur naturally on a bonsai, or may be created by carving the bark.|$|E
25|$|Bat-pollinated flowers tend to {{be large}} and showy, white or light coloured, open at night and have strong musty odours. They are often large and {{bell-shaped}} or a ball of stamens. Flowers are typically borne away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> or other obstructions. Bats drink the nectar, and these plants typically offer nectar for extended periods of time. Sight, smell, and echo-location are used to initially find the flowers, and excellent spatial memory is used to visit them repeatedly. In fact, bats can identify nectar-producing flowers using echolocation. In the New World, bat pollinated flowers often have sulfur-scented compounds, {{but this does not}} carry {{to other parts of the}} world. Bat-pollinated plants have bigger pollen than their relatives.|$|E
25|$|Meripilus giganteus is a polypore fungus in {{the family}} Meripilaceae. It causes a white rot in various types of broadleaved trees, {{particularly}} beech (Fagus), but also Abies, Picea, Pinus, Quercus and Ulmus species. This bracket fungus, {{commonly known as the}} giant polypore or black-staining polypore, is often found in large clumps at the base of trees, although fruiting bodies are sometimes found some distance away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> parasitizing the roots. M. giganteus has a circumboreal distribution in the northern Hemisphere, and is widely distributed in Europe. In the field, it is recognizable by the large, multi-capped fruiting body, as well as its pore surface that quickly darkens black when bruised or injured.|$|E
