5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The <b>grant</b> <b>is</b> then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs.

5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the <b>grant</b> <b>is</b> approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>grants</b> <b>were</b> {{given to}} the Mobile and Ohio and Illinois Central Railroads in 1850. Additional <b>grants</b> <b>were</b> made under the Pacific Railway Acts between 1862 and 1871, when they were stopped due to public opposition. In total, 79 <b>grants</b> <b>were</b> made, totaling 200000000 acre, later reduced to 131000000 acre.|$|R

5|$|Paul and Amanda Kirby, a {{seemingly}} wealthy couple, offer Grant funding for his research {{if he will}} give them an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Although initially suspicious of their true intentions, <b>Grant</b> <b>is</b> desperate for research support and thus reluctantly agrees. He flies there along with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. On the plane, Grant learns that the Kirbys actually plan {{to land on the}} island. When Grant opposes, he is knocked out by Cooper and wakes to the sound of Amanda using a megaphone. This attracts a Spinosaurus, which devours Cooper and Nash. The creature's obstructing of the runway causes the plane to crash into the forest. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the Spinosaurus, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus. The Spinosaurus returns, but the group escapes while the two predators fight each other. The Spinosaurus bites the T. rexs neck and kills it.|$|E
5|$|The long-time {{informal}} {{emblem of}} the Tortoise Club (1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid crews), was formalized in a grant to the College by Letters Patent dated 20 April 2009 of Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. The Badge is blazoned A Tortoise displayed the shell circular Azure charged with two concentric annulets Argent. The <b>grant</b> <b>is</b> formulated to provide the College, the Boat Club, and the Oriel Society (Oriel's Alumni society) use of the badge in relation to Tortoise Club alumni activities; the Tortoise Club is not itself an incorporated entity and does not bear Arms in its own right; therefore {{it could not be}} granted such a heraldic Badge directly.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the film}} industry, <b>Grant</b> <b>is</b> cited as an anti-star who {{approaches}} his roles like a character actor, {{and attempts to}} make his acting appear spontaneous. Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms, {{as well as his}} precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. Grant has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity and hostility towards the media. In a career spanning 30years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling, but rather a career that developed by happenstance.|$|E
50|$|Further <b>grants</b> <b>were</b> {{issued in}} 1794 and 1795, {{gradually}} occupying {{most of the}} foreshores between Meadowbank and Gladesville.Some of the <b>grants</b> <b>were</b> at the North Brush, north of the Field of Mars settlement, {{in the area of}} Brush Farm and Eastwood. Most of the <b>Grants</b> <b>were</b> small, from 30 to 100 acre.|$|R

[...] In 2009 a further <b>grant</b> <b>was</b> awarded to provide education materials to school and college A-Level classes, and to the community. Also in 2009 a <b>grant</b> <b>was</b> awarded {{with the aim of}} providing free heritage and research events.|$|R
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the <b>grant</b> <b>is</b> uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E

2500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{disagreement}} about whether <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> handcuffed {{before he was}} shot. Court filings by the district attorney's office say that <b>Grant's</b> hands <b>were</b> {{behind his back and}} that he was [...] "restrained and unarmed" [...] but do not say he was handcuffed. Mehserle voiced his fear that <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> [...] "going for his waistband." [...] The day after the shooting, BART spokesman Jim Allison said that <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> not restrained when he was shot, and multiple witnesses testified that Grant refused to give up his hands for handcuffing prior to the shooting. [...] The family's claim against BART stated that <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> handcuffed only after he was shot.|$|R
