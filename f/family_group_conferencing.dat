50|$|Some {{restorative}} justice systems, especially victim-offender mediation and <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing,</b> require participants {{to sign a}} confidentiality agreement. These agreements usually state that conference discussions will not be disclosed to nonparticipants. The rationale for confidentiality is that it promotes open and honest communication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three types}} of {{restorative}} justice practices specific to social work are victim-offender mediation (VOM), <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> (FGC), and peacemaking circles. [...] Van Wormer and Bednar (2002) offer a bridge between restorative justice and the strengths perspective, which is a widely used social work approach that takes into consideration client capabilities and positive characteristics {{as a vehicle for}} change and coping. For example, an integrated theoretical understanding applied to battering males is termed “the restorative-strengths approach” and offers a new application for social work practice utilizing restorative justice practices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> (FGC) has a wider {{circle of}} {{participants}} than VOM, adding people {{connected to the}} primary parties, such as family, friends and professionals. FGC is often the most appropriate system for juvenile cases, due to {{the important role of}} the family in a juvenile offender's life. Examples can be found in New South Wales (Australia) under the 1997 Young Offenders Act, and in New Zealand under the 1989 Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act. The New South Wales scheme has been favorably evaluated by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{number of}} {{compulsory}} admissions in Dutch psychiatry {{has increased in}} the past 25 years. The reduction of coercion with <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferences</b> in youth care has been successful. How, when and under what conditions can <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferences</b> reduce coercion in adult psychiatry, is subject of an extensive inquiry. This paper, however, focusses on the reverse question, namely, in what circumstances can <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferences</b> not be deployed? An {{answer to this question}} provides insights regarding situations in which <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferences</b> may (not) be useful. Barriers in 17 cases were examined using multiple case studies. Findings: The following barriers emerged: (1) the acute danger in coercion situations, the limited time available, the fear of liability and the culture of control and risk aversion in mental health care; (2) the severity of the mental state of clients leading to difficulties in decision-making and communication; (3) considering an <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conference</b> and involving familial networks as an added value in crisis situation {{is not part of the}} thinking and acting of professionals in mental health care; (4) clients and their network (who) are not open to an <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conference.</b> Applications: Awareness of the barriers for <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferences</b> can help to keep an open mind for its capacity to strengthen the partnership between clients, familial networks and professionals. The application of <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferences</b> can help to effectuate professional and ethical values of social workers in their quest for the least coercive care...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This study {{examined}} the impact of <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> on coercive treatment in adult psychiatry. Background: Coercive treatment in psychiatry infringes the fundamental rights of clients, {{including the right to}} control their lives. A promising intervention is the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences,</b> which has the potential to prevent crises through the integration of the expertise of informal and professional networks. Design: A responsive evaluation, including qualitative and quantitative methods, was deployed to study the process leading up to the FGC, the proceedings and the impact of the conference. Method: From 2013 – 2015, 41 <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> were studied in three regions in the Netherlands. The impact of every conference was examined with scales (ranging from 0 – 10) during interviews with attendees (clients, family members, friends, mental health professionals and <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> coordinators) who reflected on three outcome measures: belongingness, ownership and coercion. Results: After the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences,</b> respondents indicated a slight reduction in their experience of coercive treatment. They also mentioned an increase in ownership and belongingness. Conclusion: <b>Family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> seems a promising intervention to reduce coercion in psychiatry. It helps to regain ownership and restores belongingness. If mental health professionals take {{a more active role in}} the pursuit of a <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> and reinforce the plans with their expertise, they can strengthen the impact even further...|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{criminal}} justice, restorative circles and restorative conferences allow victims, offenders {{and their respective}} {{family members and friends}} to come together to explore how everyone has been affected by an offense and, when possible, to decide how to repair the harm and meet their own needs. In social work, family group decision-making (FGDM) or <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> (FGC) processes empower extended families to meet privately, without professionals in the room, to make a plan to protect children in their own families from further violence and neglect or to avoid residential placement outside their own homes.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> {{to act as a}} liberating intervention for families traditionally controlled by the state welfare system. <b>Family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> are interventions designed to remove control of decision making from professionals and allow <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> to make decisions about the welfare of one or more of their members. Using data from a qualitative evaluation of <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferences</b> in Wales, this article examines ‘imposed empowerment’ and social control, and the feasibility of treating ‘the family’ as a unit for state intervention. The authors propose that the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conference</b> approach not only has the potential to shift the balance of power between the state and client families, but that it may have the potential to democratise decision making within families. However, it is also noted that such interventions can be seen to be maintaining social control through subtle and possibly unintentional means.

40|$|This chapter explores <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> {{with youth}} sex {{offenders}} within a residential diversion framework, and {{draws on the}} findings of a broader study which the author conducted in this area of restorative justice practice in South Africa. The chapter starts by looking at the literature on <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> from the international to the South African context. In exploring the prospects of <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> with youth sex offenders, the author focuses on some of the major concerns which have been raised in the literature regarding the applicability of this approach to dealing with youth sex offenders, namely: the perceptions that family group conferences are a soft option for dealing with youth sex offenders; family group conferences are inappropriate where the victim is too young and unable or unwilling to participate in the conference, and that coercion when ensuring victims’ participation in the family group conferences is antithetical to restorative justice. The chapter also focuses on closure and reconciliation between the youth sex offenders and their victims {{as one of the most}} important long-term goals of <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing.</b> The achievement of the long-term goals of <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> will require a paradigm shift from interventions that only focus on the treatment of the "offender" to those which prioritise the restoration of relationships which have been harmed by an offence through the facilitation of dialogue between parties in conflict.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{experiences}} and evaluations of young male offenders who were diverted to <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> in order to improve current services. An exploratory research design was chosen to obtain an understanding of what these young male offenders experienced during their conferencing and also to seek out their recommendations for future improvement of the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> diversion programme. This study comprised two samples which were purposively selected. The first sample was made up of ten young male offenders and the second sample comprised of the parents and /or guardians of the young male offenders. The data was collected using structured interview schedules. The data was collected on separate occasions for the two samples. Each interview lasted about 30 - 40 minutes each. The findings of this study showed that there is still a need to train probation officers on appropriate implementation of <b>family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> and that families also have a role to play towards succefull implementation of diversion programmes. It is evident from the findings that young offenders need their families to support and care for them during difficult situations, as purported by the systems theory whereby society is regarded as a system with different parts and families are an important part of this system. Young offenders belong to families and families are part of communities and society. It is also important to note that victims are part of families, thus also part of society and the system. <b>Family</b> <b>group</b> <b>conferencing</b> provide an opportunity for all these parts to meet in a mediated environment to address the harm caused and make amends.

Background: Ensuring the social integration of psychiatric clients is a key aspect of community mental health nursing. <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferencing</b> has potency to create conditions for clients' social embedding and subsequently can prevent coercive measures. Design: A naturalistic qualitative case study {{on the process of}} one conference that was part of 41 conferences that had been organized and studied from January 2011 -September 2013 in a public mental health care setting in the north of the Netherlands. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (N = 20) were conducted with four stakeholder groups (N = 13) involved in a conference on liveability problems in a local neighbourhood wherein a man with schizophrenia resides. Findings: To prevent an involuntary admission to a psychiatric ward of a man with schizophrenia, neighbourhood residents requested a family group conference between themselves, the sister of the man and the mental health organization. As a possible conference aggravated psychotic problems, it was decided to organize it without the client. Nine months after the conference, liveability problems in the neighbourhood had been reduced and coercive measures adverted. The conference strengthened the community and resulted in a plan countering liveability problems. Conclusion: The case indicates that social embedding of clients with severe psychiatric problems can be strengthened by <b>Family</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Conferencing</b> and that hence coercive measures can be prevented.
