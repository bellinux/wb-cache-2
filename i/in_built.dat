5|$|The {{ruins of}} the city’s walls are even now discerned in the road between Siri to Qutub Minar and also in {{isolated}} patches behind the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), in Begumpur, Khirki Masjid near Khirki village, Satpula and many other nearby locations; at some sections, as seen at Satpula, the fort walls were large enough to have few <b>in</b> <b>built</b> store rooms to stack provisions and armory. The mystery of the city’s precincts (complex) has unfolded over the years with later day excavations revealing {{a large number of}} monuments in the villages and colonies of South Delhi. Due to compulsions of urban expansion of the Capital City of Delhi, Jahanpanah is now part of the upscale urban development of South Delhi. The village and the wealth of ruins scattered all around are now enclosed by South Delhi suburbs of Panchshil Park South, Malviya Nagar, Adchini, the Aurobindo Ashram, Delhi branch and other smaller housing colony developments. It is hemmed in the NorthSouth direction between the Outer Ring Road and the Qutb Complex and on the eastwest direction by the Mehrauli road and the Chirag Delhi road, with Indian Institute of Technology located {{on the other side of}} the Mehrauli road as an important landmark.|$|E

25|$|Vulcan Buildings, 1928. Holman, Moses & Watkins architects. This elegant {{building}} stands prominently on {{the southern}} corner of Vulcan Lane and Queen Street, and has design influences principally from Neoclassical architecture, but also the English Arts and Crafts movement. A defining feature is the cupola {{on the top of}} the building. The building also marks a significant change <b>in</b> <b>built</b> form of Central Auckland, as the city was being transformed from the low-rise buildings of the 19th century to the high-rise buildings of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>built</b> up {{cities around}} the world, urban {{planning}} uses cycling infrastructure like bikeways to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. A number of {{cities around the}} world have implemented schemes known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.|$|E
500|$|The redback {{is one of}} the few spider {{species that}} can be seriously harmful to humans, and its liking for {{habitats}} <b>in</b> <b>built</b> structures has led it to being responsible for a large number of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates, the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site, which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalised symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation may also occur and indicate severe envenomation. An antivenom has been available since 1956. There have been no deaths directly due to redback bites since its introduction, however Isbister et al. have suggested patients for whom antivenom is considered should be fully informed [...] "there is considerable weight of evidence to suggest it is no better than placebo", [...] and in light of a risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness, [...] "routine use of the antivenom is therefore not recommended". As of the 2013 (updated 2014) edition of the Snakebite & Spiderbite Clinical Management Guidelines from NSW HEALTH (latest available in 2017), Red-back spider bites were considered not life-threatening but capable of causing severe pain and systemic symptoms that could continue for hours to days.|$|E

2500|$|Like Peters and Waterman {{a decade}} earlier, James Collins and Jerry Porras spent years {{conducting}} empirical research on what makes great companies. Six {{years of research}} uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a core ideology that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. <b>In</b> <b>Built</b> To Last (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure. In 2000 Collins coined the term [...] "built to flip" [...] to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized {{the concept of the}} BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).|$|E
