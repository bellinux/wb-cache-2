I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't <b>just</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E

Universal Creative's Thierry Coup was the Creative Director of the ride, having worked on previous Universal attractions including Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, and Shrek 4-D. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers film franchise, collaborated with Universal Creative on the ride, despite an earlier blog post that suggested otherwise: [...] "I don't support it yet – I'm not involved and [...] not sure the story of the ride works, and I know Optimus is not going to <b>just</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> to be directed by some new people that have never worked with him," [...] he wrote. Bay's involvement in the attraction's development was revealed by Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, in an NBC documentary on Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

5000|$|I don’t know {{anything}} in life. I <b>just</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> {{and go with}} the flow. I’m not a religious person but I'm a very spiritual person.

Every motorcycle is always a spiritual experience. Choppers specifically are a very integral part to my spirituality. When I {{go out for a}} ride or something I’m exactly in the moment. It’s like meditation. I’m in the flow.|$|E

When the hundred is there, I'm like, 'There's {{one or two people}} who really need us to be here,' and it should be focused on them and I shouldn't care if there's a big crowd or not, but I struggle with it.

5000|$|... "The Peoria Symphony Orchestra’s {{evolution}} {{under the}} baton of music director David Commanday has been fascinating to watch.

And the repertoire {{is getting more}} varied and more playful with every season. The concerts - dare I say it? - actually are fun to attend” (Gary Panetta, Peoria Journal Star, 3/31/03).|$|R

5000|$|Asked if the {{strength}} of the argument was more important than the size of the protest, team owner Larry Dolan agreed that it was, and said that [...] "you can whip a group of non-thoughtful people to come up and protest anything". Later, in the same interview, Dolan described the protests in greater detail: [...] "It frankly bothers me when I see protestors out there, every opening day. Invariably in the last few days, they {{want to go to the}} court to say they ought to be able to protest closer to where the folks are. Now, people who are serious about what they're about don't do it that way. It's difficult for me to give them a whole lot of credence when they <b>just</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> television cameras are there, they do their thing, and they're gone. I'm not encouraging them to come back, you understand, but if we're going to have a possible dialogue, they need to understand where we're coming from." ...|$|E

On December 14, 1983, ten days before Christmas, Enrico opened the store {{accompanied}} by his bodyguards. A few minutes later he glanced out and saw Testa, Phil Leonetti and Lawrence (Yogi) Merlino walk slowly by. Testa paused, tapped on the glass and smiled at him. After the months of murders and weeks of fear, the sight of the three men was too much for Enrico. He had lost several of his uncles (Robert Riccobene) and his own father (Mario Riccobene) in the power struggle. He went {{into the back of the}} shop and shot himself in the head.

5000|$|In a 1991 interview, Garcia said, [...] "So {{they used}} to have this Monday night jam session, but Howard {{gradually}} sort of took it over. Howard's this amazing organ player — difficult person, but wonderful musician. And for some reason he liked our playing, John Kahn and mine. We didn't know each other, John and I. In fact we played with Howard for almost a year before we even actually started talking to each other. Really. We would <b>just</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> plug in, and play. About half the set I'd be whispering to John, I'd be saying, 'Hey, man, what key are we in?' Howard didn't have tunings or anything, he just played. Sometimes he would do these things that were so outside that you just couldn't — unless you knew where it was going, you had no idea where to start. Sometimes they'd turn out to be just these things like four-bar blues turnarounds, relatively simple musical things, but they were so extended the way he'd play them — 'God, what is this?'" ...|$|E
