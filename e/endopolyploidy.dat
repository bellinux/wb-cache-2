Forty moss species and six liverwort species were analyzed for the degree of <b>endopolyploidy</b> using flow cytometry. Nuclei were extracted in LB 01 buffer and stained with propidium iodide.

40|$|Endoreduplication is an {{alternative}} cell cycle that omits cell division such that cellular ploidy increases, generating “endopolyploidy”. Endoreduplication is common among eukaryotes and {{is thought to be}} important in generalized cell differentiation. Previous research on ants suggests that they endoreduplicate in body segment-dependent manners. In this study, we measured <b>endopolyploidy</b> of specific organs within ant body segments to determine which organs are driving these segment-specific patterns and whether <b>endopolyploidy</b> is related to organ function. We dissected fourteen organs from each of five individuals of Dinoponera australis and measured <b>endopolyploidy</b> of each organ via flow cytometry. Abdominal organs had higher levels of <b>endopolyploidy</b> than organs from the head and thorax, driven by particularly high ploidy levels for organs with digestive or exocrine function. In contrast, organs of the reproductive, muscular, and neural systems had relatively low <b>endopolyploidy.</b> These results provide insight into the segment-specific patterns of <b>endopolyploidy</b> previously reported and into the specific organs that employ endoreduplication in their functional development. Future work aimed at quantifying the metabolic and gene expression effects of endoreduplication will clarify how this often overlooked genomic event contributes to the development and function of specialized organs across the breadth of taxa that are known to endoreduplicate...|$|E
30|$|Endopolyploid {{cells were}} {{detected}} {{in almost all}} of the investigated organs of T. pratense (Kocová and Mártonfi 2011). In this paper we confirmed <b>endopolyploidy</b> in floral organs and uncovered slight differences in overall <b>endopolyploidy</b> levels during flower development. The typical C-level profile of individual floral organs of T. pratense cultivars was found rather similar to the previously analyzed wild type T. pratense (2 C– 8 C) (Kocová and Mártonfi 2011). This could be accounted for by genetic predisposition in species, and the slight difference recorded between each cultivar and the wild type could result from minor genetic differences or the impact of other external factors (e.g. growing conditions). The <b>endopolyploidy</b> in flowers occurs in many plant groups (Kudo and Kimura 2001 a; Fukai et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2004), but in some, even endopolyploid species, e.g. Spathoglottis plicata, <b>endopolyploidy</b> in flowers was not confirmed (Yang and Loh 2004).|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} endocycles in cells is genetically {{predetermined}} {{and the degree}} of <b>endopolyploidy</b> is subject to the systematic position of the given species (Barow and Meister 2003; Bainard et al. 2012). Only certain families comprise more genera and species with polysomatic organs and tissues (Barow 2006). The presence of <b>endopolyploidy</b> is predominantly found in the family Fabaceae and its genus Trifolium.|$|E
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>endopolyploidy</b> has commonly {{been studied in}} vegetative organs (Barow and Meister 2003; Yang and Loh 2004; Sliwinska and Lukaszewska 2005; Kolano et al. 2008; Bainard et al. 2012; Straková et al. 2014), but quite rarely in floral organs of seed plants (Barow and Meister 2003), {{except for a few}} detailed studies of orchid flowers (Kudo and Kimura 2001 a; Lee et al. 2004; Jean et al. 2011; Trávníček et al. 2015), carnations (Agulló-Antón et al. 2013) and clovers (Kocová et al. 2014). All these studies showed that <b>endopolyploidy</b> is organ- and tissue- specific. Generally, cotyledons, petioles and lower leaves are characterized by higher degrees of <b>endopolyploidy,</b> while roots, upper leaves and floral organs usually show much lower degrees (Barow 2006).|$|E
30|$|Samples for the <b>endopolyploidy</b> {{analysis}} were prepared from the floral organs of two Trifolium pratense cultivars in three ontogenetic stages (I–III). 15 flowers {{were removed from}} each inflorescence.

Recent studies (Kocová and Mártonfi 2011; Straková et al. 2014; this study) provide a comprehensive insight into the endoreduplication pattern of T. pratense, thus proving permanent presence of endoreduplication {{in the life of}} plants, starting with seedlings throughout the aging of flowers.|$|E
40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibit age polyethism, whereby female workers assume {{increasingly}} complex colony tasks as they age. While changes in DNA methylation accompany age polyethism, other DNA modifications accompanying age polyethism are less known. Changes in <b>endopolyploidy</b> (DNA amplification {{in the absence}} of cell division) with increased larval age are typical in many insect cells and are essential in adults for creating larger cells, more copies of essential loci, or greater storage capacity in secretory cells. However, changes in <b>endopolyploidy</b> with increased adult worker age and polyethism are unstudied. In this study, we examined <b>endopolyploidy</b> in honey bee workers ranging in age from newly emerged up to 55 days old. We found a nonsignificant increase in ploidy levels with age (P < 0. 1) in the most highly endopolyploid secretory cells, the Malpighian tubules. All other cell types decreased ploidy levels with age. <b>Endopolyploidy</b> decreased the least amount (nonsignificant) in neural (brain) cells and the stinger (P < 0. 1). There was a significant reduction of <b>endopolyploidy</b> with age in leg (P < 0. 05) and thoracic (P < 0. 001) muscles. Ploidy in thoracic muscle dropped from an average of 0. 5 rounds of replication in newly emerged workers to essentially no rounds of replication (0. 125) in the oldest workers. Ploidy reduction in flight muscle cells is likely due to the production of G 1 (2 C) nuclei by amitotic division in the multinucleate striated flight muscles that are essential to foragers, the oldest workers. We suggest that ploidy is constrained by the shape, size and makeup of the multinucleate striated muscle cells. Furthermore, the presence of multiple 2 C nuclei might be optimal for cell function, while higher ploidy levels might be a dead-end strategy of some aging adult tissues, likely used to increase cell size and storage capacity in secretory cells.

30|$|Although {{the main}} {{aim of this}} study was to {{determine}} the changes in <b>endopolyploidy</b> levels in organs during flower ontogeny, other valuable points can be made based on our data. The floral organs in this study showed <b>endopolyploidy</b> patterns similar to the wild type T. pratense and other species of the genus, T. repens and T. montanum (Kocová et al. 2014) (similar mean EI of organs, except that of stamens of natural T. pratense, which was 0.41). In conclusion, common characteristics of the Trifolium species (Kocová and Mártonfi 2011; Kocová et al. 2014) and T. pratense cultivars are (i) EI of petals is always higher than EI of sepals and (ii) the highest EI is found in carpels in comparison with the remaining floral organs. Hence, these seem to be common features in the genus Trifolium. However, this rule should not be applied to species of other families (Barow and Meister 2003; Chen et al. 2011). In addition, <b>endopolyploidy</b> patterns differ in comparison with other Fabaceae species belonging to different genera such as Pisum sativum and Vicia faba, although the higher EI of petals over sepals corresponds to cases in Trifolium, carpels of the mentioned species were the ones with the lowest EI (Barow and Meister 2003). Putative inconsistency in endopolyploid patterns of the floral organs of different species does not result from coincidence, but is most probably determined by interplay between intrinsic (genetic, cytological, life form) and extrinsic (environmental) factors. It is well known that the <b>endopolyploidy</b> level of organs/tissues is mostly correlated with the phylogenetic placement of the species which is strongly associated with many phenotypic traits (Bainard et al. 2012).|$|E

Significant differences between ‘Manuela’ and ‘Dajana’ cultivars were found only in sepals of I. stage, and in petals and carpels of III. stage. Cultivars showed a similar pattern of <b>endopolyploidy.</b> However, a considerable decrease in EI ‘Manuela’ petals and carpels at III. stage was detected as opposed to ‘Dajana’. Overall, a higher endoreduplication index is distinctive for organs of the ‘Dajana’ cultivar.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Because of <b>endopolyploidy,</b> cell {{kinetics}} in decidual growth are best studied by cytophotometric methods. This technique {{was applied to}} smears of nuclei isolated from decidualizing endometrial stroma at various moments after uterine scratching in hormonally pre-pared rats. After a 48 -hr lag period, the production of polyploid nuclei was accelerated. At its maximal development (96 hr), the decidual tissue contained few cells other than polyploid cells, the highest level attained being 32 c. During decidualization, there was a progressive increase in labelling with [3 H]thymidine and in mitotic indices up to the 3 rd day. It is suggested that <b>endopolyploidy</b> results in this case from by-passing mitosis by cells lacking some rate-limiting metabolic factor indispensable to the mitotic phase...|$|E
40|$|A {{great many}} cell types are {{necessary}} for the myriad capabilities of complex, multicellular organisms. One interesting aspect of this diversity of cell type is that many cells in diploid organisms are polyploid. This is called <b>endopolyploidy</b> and arises from cell cycles that are often characterized as “variant,” but in fact are widespread throughout nature. <b>Endopolyploidy</b> is essential for normal development and physiology in many different organisms. Here we review how both plants and animals use variations of the cell cycle, termed collectively as endoreplication, resulting in polyploid cells that support specific aspects of development. In addition, we discuss briefly how endoreplication occurs in response to certain physiological stresses, and how it {{may contribute to the}} development of cancer.

30|$|Very {{little is}} known about the <b>endopolyploidy</b> level during the {{development}} of floral organs and its purpose so far. An increasing proportion of endoreduplicated nuclei was detected in the orchid flower development (Lee et al. 2004) as well as in the development of cabbage (Kudo and Kimura 2002 b) and carnation petals (Agulló-Antón et al. 2013). We observed a similar situation, although, it seems that the C-values are notably more conserved in the floral organs of T. pratense in comparison with the previous studies. This difference is probably rooted in the species specific features of the genus and a unique developmental pathway of floral organs. We found only subtle (tough still detectable) differences in <b>endopolyploidy</b> levels (EI) of the floral organs between specified stages of the flower development. In general, an increasing tendency in <b>endopolyploidy</b> expression paired with development was detected in the floral organs of T. pratense (Fig.  5). Such trend is also related to other types of organs and tissues of plants, e.g. seedlings (Sliwinska and Lukaszewska 2005; Kolano et al. 2008), endosperm (Kladnik et al. 2006), and pericarp (Bergervoet et al. 1996; Ogawa et al. 2012). Endoreduplication is involved in the growth of cells and the development of organs as documented by Kladnik et al. (2006), who stated that cell size and endoreduplication are correlated in Sorghum endosperm. Lee et al. (2004) reported that flower fresh weight is positively correlated with average C-value.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEndopolyploidy, i. e. {{amplification}} of {{the genome}} {{in the absence of}} mitosis, occurs in many plant species and happens along with organ and cell differentiation. Deciphering the functional roles of <b>endopolyploidy</b> is hampered by the fact that polyploid tissues generally comprise cells with various ploidy levels. In some fleshy fruits (amongst them tomato fruit) the ploidy levels present at the end of development range from 2 C to 256 C in the same tissue. To investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of <b>endopolyploidy</b> it is necessary to address the DNA content of individual nuclei in situ. Conventional methods such as fluorometry or densitometry can be used for some tissues displaying favorable characteristics, e. g. small cells, small nuclei, organization in a monolayer, but high levels of varying polyploidy are usually associated with large sizes of nuclei and cells, in a complex three dimensional (3 -D) organization of the tissues. The conventional methods are inadequate for such tissue, becoming semi-quantitative and imprecise. We report here {{the development of a new}} method based on fluorescent in situ bacterial artificial chromosome hybridizations that allows the in situ determination of the DNA ploidy level of individual nuclei. This method relies on the counting of hybridization signals and not on intensity measurements and is expected to provide an alternative method for mapping <b>endopolyploidy</b> patterns in mature, 3 -D organized plant tissues as illustrated by the analysis of ploidy level and cell size in pericarp from mature green tomato fruit...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEndopolyploidy is a {{widespread}} process that corresponds to the amplification of the genome {{in the absence of}} mitosis. In tomato, very high ploidy levels (up to 256 C) are reached during fruit development, concomitant with very large cell sizes. Using cellular approaches (fluorescence and electron microscopy) we provide a structural analysis of endoreduplicated nuclei at the level of chromatin and nucleolar organisation, nuclear shape and relationship with other cellular organelles such as mitochondria. We demonstrate that <b>endopolyploidy</b> in pericarp leads to the formation of polytene chromosomes and markedly affects nuclear structure. Nuclei manifest a complex shape, with numerous deep grooves that are filled with mitochondria, affording a fairly constant ratio between nuclear surface and nuclear volume.

30|$|It {{seems that}} the <b>endopolyploidy</b> level of the floral organs in T. pratense (Fig.  4) might {{stabilize}} close to maturation as seen in orchids (Lee et al. 2004) but the overall EI change in relation to ontogeny was not wholly distinct in our case. However, in contrast to our study, where a continuing change in the <b>endopolyploidy</b> level was recorded even after the maturation of flowers, Lee et al. (2004) found {{out that in the}} fully developed flowers of orchids endopolyploidization stops and its ploidy level stabilizes with no further change in the nuclei proportions. Considering this, a difference in the floral life cycle between the two mentioned cases must be noted. Orchid flowers have increased longevity compared to Trifolium, which usually turns to wilting quite rapidly. Changes in EI of petals and carpels could thus be explained by continuous flower development (petals, opening of corolla in the II. stage and senescent wilting in the III. stage; carpels, its likely onset of change to pericarp wall or presence of developed seeds). It is not yet fully understood how <b>endopolyploidy</b> affects developmental processes in sepals, stamens and carpels. Kudo and Kimura (2002 b) propose, that the obvious importance of changes in the nuclei size from 2 C– 8 C up to 4 C– 32 C in the proximal epidermal cells of petals in comparison with the distal part of petals (a slight increase of 4 C nuclei), inevitably results in bud opening. This can be the main reason for the ploidy level increase in petal cells.|$|E
40|$|Herbivory imposes {{substantial}} {{selection pressure}} on plants, {{with the ability}} to regrow and maintain reproductive success a challenging but often necessary response by the plant. Despite the commonness of herbivore-induced damage, vast variation in tolerance ability exists among plants. Recent studies have suggested the role of endoreduplication (increasing ploidy within an individual) and the pentose phosphate pathway (a metabolic pathway that supports both primary and secondary metabolism) in contributing to the variation in tolerance ability among genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana. We measured natural variation in apical meristem damage frequency, endoreduplication, and the sequence of G 6 PD 1, an important gene in the pentose phosphate pathway, and related them to variation in tolerance of natural populations of A. thaliana over a portion of its native European range. Variation among populations in tolerance was significantly positively related to damage frequency, suggesting the potential for directional selection for tolerance ability as a product of damage frequency. We also discovered likely loss-of-function G 6 PD 1 alleles in two populations, both of which displayed among the lowest levels of tolerance of all populations assessed. In addition, populations with the greatest increase in <b>endopolyploidy</b> also had the greatest ability to tolerate damage while populations with the greatest reduction in <b>endopolyploidy</b> had the lowest ability to tolerate damage. This study provides an assessment of variation in tolerance, damage frequency, G 6 PD 1 sequence, and <b>endopolyploidy</b> in natural populations of A. thaliana, and also contributes to the growing body of research on the contributions of these specific molecular mechanisms to the tolerance response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Endopolyploidy</b> is developmentally regulated. Presence of <b>endopolyploidy</b> as {{a result}} of {{endoreduplication}} has been characterized in insects, mammals and plants. The family Orchidaceae is the largest among the flowering plants. Many {{of the members of the}} orchid family are commercially micropropagated. Very little has been done to characterize the ploidy variation in different tissues of the orchid plants during development. Results The DNA contents and ploidy level of nuclei extracted from various tissues of a tropical terrestrial orchid Spathoglottis plicata were examined by flow cytometry. Sepals, petals and ovary tissues were found to have only a 2 C (C, DNA content of the unreplicated haploid chromosome complement) peak. Columns, floral pedicels of newly open flowers and growing flower stems were observed to have an endopolyploid 8 C peak in addition to 2 C and 4 C peaks. In developing floral pedicels, four peaks were observed for 2 C, 4 C, 8 C and 16 C. In root tips, there were 2 C, 4 C and 8 C peaks. But in the root tissues at the region with root hairs, only a 2 C peak was observed. Nuclei extracted from young leaves shown three peaks for 2 C, 4 C and 8 C. A similar pattern was found in the vegetative tissues of both greenhouse-grown plants and tissue-cultured plantlets. In mature leaves, a different pattern of ploidy level was found at different parts of the leaves. In the leaf tips and middle parts, there were 2 C and 4 C peaks. Only at the basal part of the leaves, there were three peaks for 2 C, 4 C and 8 C. Conclusions Systemic variation of cellular <b>endopolyploidy</b> in different tissues during growth and development of Spathoglottis plicata from field-grown plants and in vitro cultures was identified. The implication of the findings was discussed. </p...|$|E
30|$|Endoreduplication {{appears in}} {{numerous}} plant species and plays {{a vital role}} during ontogeny. The presence of polyploid cells in an otherwise diploid organism is tied specifically to the taxonomy, ecology and physiology of the studied specimen. Little {{is known about the}} changes in <b>endopolyploidy</b> levels of floral organs during their development. In order to uncover the workings of endoreduplication in polysomatic species, our study examines flowers of T. pratense in three ontogenetic stages by means of flow cytometry.|$|E
40|$|Polyploid {{cells are}} found in diverse taxa (Fox and Duronio, 2013; Edgar et al., 2014), and in fact entire organisms can be {{polyploid}}, or polyploid cells can exist in otherwise diploid or-ganisms (<b>endopolyploidy).</b> In humans, polyploid cells {{are found in}} critical tissues, such as liver and placenta. A general term often {{used to describe the}} generation of polyploid cells is endoreplication, which refers to multiple genome duplications without intervening division/cytokinesis.

30|$|The {{level of}} <b>endopolyploidy</b> varies during the {{individual}} organ development, e.g. in seedlings (Brassica oleracea, Kudo and Kimura 2001 b; Allium fistulosum, Kudo et al. 2003; Beta vulgaris, Sliwinska and Lukaszewska 2005; Chenopodium quinoa, Kolano et al. 2008; and Trifolium pratense, Straková et al. 2014), young leaves and root parts (Spathoglottis plicata, Yang and Loh 2004), or storage organs and nutrient tissues (Lycopersicon esculentum, Bergervoet et al. 1996; Capsicum annum, Ogawa et al. 2012 and Sorghum bicolor, Kladnik et al. 2006), which implies a role of endoreduplication in the developmental process.|$|E
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>endopolyploidy</b> {{is very common}} in eukaryotic organisms and is distributed across the whole plant kingdom (Barow 2006). It results from endoreduplication. Under certain conditions this process causes a cell to switch from the mitotic to the endoreduplication cycle (Carvalheira 2000; Joubés and Chevalier 2000; Barow and Meister 2003; Leitch et al. 2013). Endoreduplication {{is characterized by the}} lack of M-phase of the cell cycle leading to several repeated rounds of DNA synthesis. Thus, the DNA content of a cell multiplies (Barow 2006; Barow and Jovtchev 2007).|$|E
