5|$|Boycott {{was also}} the first player to score 99 not out, and the first to score 99 and then a century in a Test match. The forty-eight century {{partnerships}} he was involved was a record for any England player, but <b>has</b> <b>again</b> been surpassed by Alastair Cook. In 1977 against Australia, Boycott became the first England player to bat on all five days of a Test match. He spent the 629 minutes at the crease for 191 runs in 1977.|$|E
5|$|De Oude Wolden is {{a member}} of Museumhuis Groningen (Groningen Museum House), which is an {{umbrella}} organization for museums and heritage institutions in the province of Groningen. From 2004 to 2009, the museum was registered in the Museumregister Nederland (Netherlands Museum Register), a quality mark for museums in the Netherlands, but the registration was not renewed for several years. The museum <b>has</b> <b>again</b> been registered since 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, an {{agreement}} was made where Røkke's company Aker became the stadium name sponsor, with the stadium being renamed Aker stadion. The same season, {{the club was}} relegated to the First Division, where the team played in 2007. Despite the relegation, average attendance increased, and Molde won the league. Since 2008, the team <b>has</b> <b>again</b> played in the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick <b>has</b> <b>again</b> been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago) of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. It {{contains}} a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, {{on the basis of a}} single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates <b>has</b> <b>again</b> received support. A closely related animal, Trapalcotherium, was described in 2009 on the basis of a single tooth.|$|E
5|$|Since then, under Strache's leadership, {{the party}} <b>has</b> <b>again</b> {{attracted}} {{an increase in}} its popular support. In the 2013 legislative election the FPÖ won 20.5% of the vote and, more recently, it came ahead either of the SPÖ or the ÖVP in some state elections, entered in a SPÖ-led government in Burgenland and gained more than 30% {{of the vote in}} Vienna. Finally, in the 2016 presidential election, FPÖ member Norbert Hofer won the first round, receiving 35.1%, but was defeated by The Greens' candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, 53.8% against 46.2%, in the final run-off (an earlier run-off was invalidated).|$|E

5|$|The {{area around}} Wijdefjorden {{was first used}} by Russian, and later Norwegian, trappers. The cabin at Krosspynten was erected in 1910, {{and two years later}} the cabin at Purpurdalen was built. Trappers {{considered}} the area to have few polar bears but much fox; they could also supplement the catch with common eider. In 1928, a season of trapping gave about 50 Arctic foxes. In 1932, the area's special vegetation was protected, which was assimilated into the national park when it was created. Since the 1980s, trapping <b>has</b> <b>again</b> been taken up, and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at Austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of trapping. Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II and the Paris Peace Treaties, Rijeka {{became a}} part of Croatia and Yugoslavia. This {{provided}} the Port of Rijeka with a new market and sparked further development. A bulk cargo terminal was completed in 1967, followed by warehouses in Škrljevo in 1978. In 1979, a container terminal in Sušak, a phosphate terminal in Rijeka and a timber terminal in Bršica were added. Joining them were a livestock terminal in Bršica and a general cargo terminal with a roll-on/roll-off ramp in the Bakar area in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The greatest volume of cargo was recorded in 1980, when 20.2million tonnes, including 13.1million tonnes of liquid cargo, were transported. The port suffered another period of stagnation in the 1990s due to the Croatian War of Independence, when a portion of the port's shipping switched to Trieste and Koper. Since 1996, the volume of operations of the Port of Rijeka <b>has</b> <b>again</b> been gradually growing.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason <b>has</b> <b>again</b> been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he ruptures the tank and freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

When Colonel George Washington tells them that Warwick is a renegade and has been hunted by the British as well, John agrees to track him down for the British. John leads his mercenaries and Washington's forces and destroys Warwick's base in the Great Lakes region. The {{presence}} of the Circle of Ossus' Boneguard prove to John {{the existence of the}} Circle and that Warwick is the current Circle's leader. In the ruins of the Circle's base John finds the decapitated body of his uncle Stuart. John then demands that Nonahkee be kept at home while they pursue Warwick, who <b>has</b> <b>again</b> escaped and fled to the Rocky Mountains. Kanyenke agrees and reveals that he knows about John's relationship with Nonahkee. He tells him that he would not have chosen John as her husband, but he accepts it because he knows that she decides who she loves.|$|E
