5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and <b>guanfacine</b> (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including <b>guanfacine</b> (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|Unlike α2 {{adrenoceptor}} agonists such as <b>guanfacine</b> and clonidine, atomoxetine's use can be abruptly stopped {{without significant}} discontinuation effects being seen.|$|E
25|$|Stimulants are {{the most}} {{effective}} medications available {{for the treatment of}} ADHD. Seven different formulations of stimulants have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD: four amphetamine-based formulations, two methylphenidate-based formulations, and dextromethamphetamine hydrochloride. Atomoxetine, <b>guanfacine</b> and clonidine are the only non-controlled, non-stimulant FDA approved drugs for the treatment of ADHD.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of {{neurotoxicity}} from NMDA receptor antagonists. Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine and <b>guanfacine</b> are thought to most directly target the etiology of NMDA neurotoxicity. Other drugs acting on various neurotransmitter systems known to inhibit NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity include: anticholinergics, diazepam, barbiturates, ethanol, 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonists, and muscimol.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{stimulant}} and non-stimulant medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), <b>guanfacine</b> (Intuniv), and clonidine (Kapvay). Other medicines which may be prescribed off-label include bupropion (Wellbutrin), tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, or MAOIs. The presence of comorbid (co-occurring) disorders can make finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more complicated, costly, and time-consuming. So it is recommended to assess and simultaneously treat any comorbid disorders.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and <b>guanfacine),</b> tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E

2500|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that stimulants do not {{exacerbate}} tics any more than placebo does, and suggest that stimulants may even reduce tic severity. A 2011 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded that most major ADHD medications were effective in children with tics, and that stimulants did not generally worsen tics outside of individual cases. Methylphenidate, <b>guanfacine,</b> clonidine, and desipramine were associated with improvement of tic symptoms. Controversy remains, and the PDR continues to carry a warning that stimulants should not be used in the presence of tic disorders, so physicians may be reluctant to use them. Others are comfortable using them and even advocate for a stimulant trial when ADHD co-occurs with tics, because the symptoms of ADHD can be more impairing than tics.|$|E
2500|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has {{approved}} clonidine {{for the treatment}} of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), under the trade name of Kapvay alone or with stimulants in 2010, for pediatric patients aged 6–17 years. It was later approved for adults. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA. Clonidine along with methylphenidate has been studied for treatment of [...] According to the clinical trials submitted to FDA its effectiveness is comparable to stimulants commonly used for ADHD. [...] While not as effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, Clonidine does offer some benefit; it can also be useful in combination with stimulant medications. Some studies show clonidine more sedating than <b>guanfacine,</b> which may be better at bed time along with an arousing stimulant at morning. Clonidine can be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (specifically for tics).|$|E
50|$|<b>Guanfacine</b> {{availability}} {{is significantly}} {{affected by the}} CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, and drugs that inhibit or induce those enzymes change the amount of <b>guanfacine</b> in circulation and thus its efficacy and adverse effects, and likewise <b>guanfacine</b> affects those drugs. Because of its affects on the heart, {{it needs to be}} used with caution with other drugs that may affect heart; likewise other drugs that may cause sedation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guanfacine</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} for treatment of withdrawal for opioids, ethanol, and nicotine. <b>Guanfacine</b> {{has been shown to}} help reduce stress-induced craving of nicotine in smokers trying to quit, which may involve strengthening of prefrontal cortical self-control.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} <b>guanfacine</b> are dose-dependent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guanfacine</b> {{works by}} {{activating}} α2A adrenoceptors {{in the central}} nervous system. This results in reduced peripheral sympathetic outflow and thus a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone, which lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In ADHD, <b>guanfacine</b> works by strengthening regulation of attention and behavior by the prefrontal cortex. These enhancing effects on prefrontal cortical functions {{are thought to be}} due to inhibition of cAMP-mediated signaling, which is effected by the Gi proteins that are generally coupled to the post-synaptic α2A adrenoceptors that <b>guanfacine</b> stimulates through binding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guanfacine</b> has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 80%. There is {{no clear}} evidence of any first-pass metabolism. Elimination half-life is 17 hours with the major elimination route being renal. The principal metabolite is the 3-hydroxy-derivative, with evidence of moderate biotransformation, and the key intermediate being an epoxide. It is also shown that elimination in patients with impaired renal function does not differ significantly from those with normal renal function. As such, metabolism by liver is the assumption for those with impaired renal function, as supported by increased frequency of known side effects of orthostatic hypotension and sedation.|$|E
50|$|Alpha2 {{adrenergic}} agonist {{can also}} be used to treat anxiety and panic, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder or PTSD. Alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonists, such as clonidine and <b>guanfacine,</b> act at noradrenergic autoreceptors to inhibit the firing of cells in the locus ceruleus, effectively reducing the release of brain norepinephrine. Clonidine has shown promise among patients with Anxiety, Panic and PTSD in clinical trials and was used to treat severely and chronically abused and neglected preschool children. It improved disturbed behavior by reducing aggression, impulsivity, emotional outbursts, and oppositionality. Insomnia and nightmares were also reported to be reduced.|$|E

50|$|There is much current {{research}} devoted {{to understanding the}} role of the prefrontal cortex in neurological disorders. Many disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, have been related to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, and thus this area of the brain offers the potential for new treatments of these conditions. Clinical trials have begun on certain drugs that have been shown to improve prefrontal cortex function, including <b>guanfacine,</b> which acts through the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor. A downstream target of this drug, the HCN channel, {{is one of the most}} recent areas of exploration in prefrontal cortex pharmacology.|$|E
