5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{is found}} across North America, Europe and Asia. Although widespread, {{it is not}} common {{anywhere}} in Europe, and it is listed as endangered in the British Isles.

5|$|In 1816, a tooth said to {{have belonged}} to Newton was sold for £730 ($3,633) in London to an aristocrat who had it set in a ring.

5|$|In 1974, a {{wilderness}} study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% {{of the area}} of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation. Unlike a few other parks, Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as wilderness, but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision. Ninety-three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as wilderness, even though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> officially designated.|$|E
5|$|In Europe it is {{more common}} in {{northern}} than south Europe, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> reported from south and west Europe. In addition to being common in Scandinavian countries, it has been collected in Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, and Korea. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska, where it is usually found above the tree line.|$|E
5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted {{treatment of}} sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically {{attract the attention of}} the public or major scrutiny; therefore, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E

Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> {{shown that}} long term {{exposure}} to electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health, {{but it is}} recommended to avoid subjects who are pregnant or who utilize pacemakers.

The field and frequencies output by electromagnetic articulographs are comparable to those put out by computer terminals with the maximum measured being about 10μT.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example).

5|$|M-105 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan.
