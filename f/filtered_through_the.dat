5|$|The sagging {{popularity}} of the Republic did not escape {{the attention of the}} British intelligence services. However, because this intelligence was <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of Orangist agents in the Republic and émigrés in England, it was erroneously interpreted as possible support for an Orangist restoration. This caused the miscalculation that led to the ill-fated Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in the peninsula of North Holland in 1799.|$|E

Aided by the deeply introspective state attained by the patient, the therapist assists him/her in developing a new life framework or personal philosophy that recognizes individual responsibility for change.|$|E
25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for {{both public and private}} expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also have found in it an interesting and pleasurable field of study, in its exemplification of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and on its own terms.|$|E
25|$|Outside the stadium, a {{bottleneck}} {{developed with}} more fans arriving {{than could be}} safely <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> turnstiles before 3:00pm. People presenting tickets at the wrong turnstiles {{and those who had}} been refused entry could not leave because of the crowd behind them but remained as an obstruction. Fans outside could hear cheering as the teams came on the pitch ten minutes before the match started, and as the match kicked off, but could not gain entrance. A police constable radioed control requesting that the game be delayed, as it had been two years before, to ensure the safe passage of supporters into the ground. The request to delay the start of the match by 20 minutes was declined.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Roman governance and Roman technology on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion {{led to the}} adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by Historia Naturalis, an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by Pliny the Elder. Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen, established that today's medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Latin. Roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and swallowed. The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ordeal}} of 2nd Shock Army continued, the {{remnants}} of the division, along with 92nd Rifle Division and two rifle brigades, reached and occupied the main defensive line from Ruchi along the Ravan River to Vditsko, Rogavka Station, to Lake Tigoda on May 28, while the army's remaining forces prepared to launch an attack to link up with 59th Army; this attack was set to begin on June 5. This movement was detected by the German forces. On May 30, I Corps and XXXVIII Corps began a joint attack which severed the final link to 2nd Shock late that day, although at considerable cost. A desperate final lunge eastwards by 2nd Shock on June 5 gained little ground. During the following weeks, individual men and small groups of the 327th <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> porous German lines, enough that the division could be rebuilt. On July 15 the 87th Cavalry Division, which had also been trapped in the pocket, was officially disbanded, and its remnants were incorporated into the rebuilding 327th.|$|E

25|$|For Shakespeare as {{he began}} to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the {{popularity}} of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionised theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies, creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements {{of what it means to}} be human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.|$|E
500|$|A second Goffin–King composition, [...] "Wasn't Born to Follow", also {{displays}} {{country and}} western influences, albeit <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> band's psychedelic and garage rock tendencies. The song's country leanings are underscored by the criss-crossing musical dialogue between the electric guitar and pedal steel. The rural ambiance is further heightened by the striking imagery of the lyrics which outline the need for escape and independence: a subject perfectly {{in keeping with the}} hippie ethos of the day.|$|E

500|$|Renal {{handling}} of potassium is closely connected to sodium handling. Potassium {{is the major}} cation (positive ion) inside animal cells , while sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid [...] In the kidneys, about 180liters of plasma is <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glomeruli and into the renal tubules per day. This filtering involves about 600g of sodium and 33g of potassium. Since only 1–10g of sodium and 1–4g of potassium {{are likely to be}} replaced by diet, renal filtering must efficiently reabsorb the remainder from the plasma.|$|E

Foucault viewed the painting without regard to the subject matter, nor to the artist's biography, technical ability, sources and influences, social context, or relationship with his patrons.

500|$|His {{travels through}} Brazil became {{more than just}} {{research}} trips; in 1927, he started writing a travelogue called [...] "The apprentice tourist" [...] for the newspaper O Diario Nacional. [...] The column served as an introduction for cosmopolites to indigenous Brazil. [...] At the same time, it served as an advertisement for Andrade's own work. [...] A number of Andrade's photographs were published alongside the column, showing the landscape and people. [...] Occasionally, Andrade himself would appear in them, usually <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> landscape, as in the self-portrait-as-shadow on this page. His photographs thus served to further his modernist project and his own work {{at the same time}} as their function in recording folklore.|$|E
500|$|Another song on {{the album}} that deals {{with the need to}} escape the {{confines}} of society is David Crosby's [...] "Dolphin's Smile". The song was an early example of Crosby's penchant for using nautical imagery in his songs, a thematic trait he would utilize in future compositions, including [...] "Wooden Ships" [...] and [...] "The Lee Shore". The theme of unfettered idyllic bliss is further explored in the Hillman-penned [...] "Natural Harmony". Like [...] "Goin' Back", [...] "Natural Harmony" [...] conveys a sense of longing for the innocence of youth, albeit <b>filtered</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> awareness-raising properties of psychedelic drugs. It has been suggested by some commentators that the song exhibits the strong influence of Crosby's writing style, with its laid-back, jazzy feel and dreamy, high tenor vocal part.|$|E
