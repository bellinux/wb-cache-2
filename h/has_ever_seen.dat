5|$|I am solidly {{confident}} no European <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> this rail alive, {{for that}} requires {{such a degree}} of toughening and such demands on oneself as I cannot so easily attribute to others. Habroptila is shielded by the awful thorns of the sago swamps... In this thorn wilderness, I walked barefoot and half-naked for weeks.|$|E

5000|$|That was the {{greatest}} performance I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in my life!… You surpassed all expectations tonight with this performance. This was just … stunning…. This was incredible…. T.J., {{this is one of}} the finest performances I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> The best performance — I’ll say it right now — this is the most spectacular performance I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> against a guy in Barão who is easily one of the best pound-for-pound fighters on the planet. Congratulations on just a masterful work tonight. It was an honor calling this fight. Thank you very much, brother.|$|R
25|$|An axlotl tank is {{essentially}} a brain-dead woman whose womb {{is used as a}} tank to create gholas. The Bene Tleilax's use of their women in this capacity explains why no one <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> a Tleilaxu female.|$|E
25|$|Lionpaw becomes {{friends with}} Heatherpaw, a {{beautiful}} WindClan apprentice, and begins meeting her at night. Heatherpaw and Lionpaw begin meeting in hidden tunnels that no Clan cat <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> before (the same tunnels that Fallen Leaves drowned in).|$|E
25|$|Gooch played {{first-class}} cricket regularly between 1973 and 1997. Famous for his upright stance, a high bat-lift {{and heavy}} bat {{he became one}} of the most prolific run scorers top-class cricket <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> On 8 November 2011, he received an honorary award from University of East London.|$|E

"Everything in America {{seemed to}} me on such a monumental scale that it dwarfed every bit of European scenery I <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> before, or <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> since. What were the Norwegian fjords, or even the Alps, after the Rocky Mountains? What are the largest {{buildings}} of other towns after those in San Francisco and New York?" ...|$|R

25|$|Fakhreddine is {{regarded}} by the Lebanese {{as the best}} leader and prince the country <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> The Druze prince treated all the religions equally and {{was the one who}} formed Lebanon. Lebanon has achieved during Fakhreddine's reign enormous heights that the country had and would never witness again.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} arguably the first megacorporation the world <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> {{possessing}} quasi-governmental powers, including {{the ability to}} wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, coin money and establish colonies. Many economic and political historians consider the VOC as the most valuable, powerful and influential corporation in world history.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{would call}} the 1972 USC Trojans {{football}} team the greatest team he ever saw. Jackson, who was {{in his first year}} in ABC football broadcasting narrating the taped highlights of the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game, declared it many years later to be the greatest game he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This [...] "torpedo-shaped" [...] beam {{of light}} was quite unlike any other {{celestial}} object that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> The quality of its light, and its occurrence while a great magnetic storm and a bright aurora were in progress, seem to establish its auroral origin. But it differed very widely in appearance from any other aurora that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R
25|$|People of Inca civilization were {{masters of}} the {{polished}} 'dry-stone walls', called ashlar, where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any mortar. The Incas were among the best stonemasons the world <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not fit between the stones.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{challenge}} to study the echidna in their natural habitat and they show no interest in mating while in captivity. Therefore, no one <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> an echidna ejaculate. There have been previous attempts, trying to force the echidna to ejaculate through the use of electrically stimulated ejaculation in order to obtain semen samples but has only resulted in the penis swelling.|$|E
25|$|Keith Jackson, {{who was in}} {{his second}} year of ABC {{football}} broadcasting, narrating the taped highlights of the game, declared it many years later to be the greatest game he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> So did Giles Pellerin, a USC graduate who attended every game USC played from 1926 until his death at the 1998 USC-UCLA game at the Rose Bowl (797 straight games over 72 years).|$|E

25|$|Despite an injury-prone career, Sharapova has {{achieved}} a rare level of longevity in the women's game. She won at least one singles title a year from 2003 until 2015, a streak only bested by Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert. Several tennis pundits and former players have called Sharapova one of tennis's best competitors, with John McEnroe calling her {{one of the best}} the sport <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tasked with {{securing}} Pyrrhus {{against the}} fierce {{resistance of the}} Helghan Second Army, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are well prepared for an invasion. Using Helghan's harsh environment to their advantage, they have developed new weapons and equipment, none of which the ISA <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> before. Furthermore, the planet's fog-like atmosphere, gritty deserts, and constant storms pose almost {{as much of a}} threat to the invaders as the enemy themselves.|$|E
25|$|Tommy Taylor {{stood in}} the City of Christchurch {{electorate}} at the general election in December 1896 and out of 11 candidates, he came third in the three-member electorate, and began a colourful and successful political career. Taylor was extremely popular and elected Mayor of Christchurch in April 1911. When he suddenly died only three months later aged 49, 50,000 people lined the streets for his funeral procession; the largest funeral that the city <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{the room}} was not quite dark. There was a ghastly light {{trembling}} over it; like nothing that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> by day; like nothing that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> by night. I dimly discerned Selina's bed, and {{the frame of the}} window, and the curtains on either side of it--but not the starlight, and not the shadowy tops of the trees in the garden.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the first}} time I <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> Wright come into Hoden's. He called for tobacco.|$|R

25|$|In theory, no {{one from}} the general public <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> Don Eleuterio. Whenever a {{television}} comedy sketch was featured where Eleuterio would be a part of, he would speak hidden inside his house, from behind a window. Reportedly this occurs because Eleuterio is ashamed of his kinky hair and dark skin. He blames the local tap water for his hair's coarseness; as for his skin color, he considers himself white, along with 84% of the Puerto Rican population.|$|E
25|$|One {{night after}} Cupid falls asleep, Psyche carries out the plan her sisters devised: she brings out a dagger and a lamp she had {{hidden in the}} room, {{in order to see}} and kill the monster. But when the light instead reveals the most {{beautiful}} creature she <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> she is so startled that she wounds herself on one of the arrows in Cupid's cast-aside quiver. Struck with a feverish passion, she spills hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He flees, and though she tries to pursue, he flies away and leaves her on the bank of a river.|$|E
25|$|Penelope Ann Miller as Gail. Carlito's {{girlfriend and}} one of the few people he truly trusts, she is the only person who <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> Carlito's goodness. She is a dancer dreaming of the big time, but is reduced to working in a strip club to make ends meet. Although the story is a suspenseful crime thriller, their doomed romance is at the heart of the film. At the time, Miller was 29 years old to Pacino's 53. Casting for Gail proved {{difficult}} because of the character's striptease scenes. The character needed someone who was both a talented dancer and actor.|$|E
60|$|Therefore strange {{towns and}} {{communities}} were born, like to nothing {{that the world}} <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> before.|$|R
