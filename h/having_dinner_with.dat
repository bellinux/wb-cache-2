5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E
5|$|Claire goes on {{a miserable}} double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan (Travis Schuldt), and his ill-mannered friend Benny (Bailey Chase). With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear {{as if she had}} {{requested}} this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's EpiPen. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E

After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was part}} of Muzorewa's {{delegation}} at Lancaster House. Several aspects of the Internal Settlement constitution, such as a declaration {{of human rights and}} a guarantee that land redistributed by the government would be paid for, were retained; it was also agreed to have 20 reserved white seats out of 100 for at least seven years. Fresh elections would be held during a brief period under a British Governor invested with full executive and legislative powers. The new constitution was agreed on 18 October, and on 12 December 1979 the House of Assembly voted to dissolve itself, ending UDI. Lord Soames arrived in Salisbury later the same day to become Southern Rhodesia's last Governor; among other things he announced that Smith would be granted amnesty for declaring independence. The final Lancaster House Agreement was signed on 21 December. Smith was the only member of any delegation to openly oppose the accords; he refused to attend the signing ceremony and boycotted the post-agreement party, instead <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> former RAF comrades and Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader.|$|E

25|$|While Lytle's brigade {{was being}} beaten back, the left flank of Phil Sheridan's {{division}} {{was only a}} few hundred yards to the south on Peters Hill. One of the lingering controversies of the battle has been why he did not choose to join the fight. Earlier in the day he had been ordered by Gilbert not to bring on a general engagement. At around 2 p.m., the sound of artillery fire reached army headquarters where Buell was <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> Gilbert; the two generals assumed that it was Union artillery practicing and sent word to Sheridan not to waste gunpowder. Sheridan did project some artillery fire into the Confederate assault, but when Gilbert finally arrived from the rear, he feared that Sheridan would be attacked and ordered him back to his entrenchments.|$|E

500|$|Blair {{is noted}} for an over-achieving nature, which often appears in humorous scenes. In a review for New York magazine, Emily Nussbaum lauded one of Blair's fantasies, which {{involves}} [...] "joining the Peace Corps, getting a killer tan, winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> the president, 'who would then write her a recommendation to Yale, and then Yale would fall all over themselves to accept her.' [...] " [...] The New Yorker Janet Malcolm remarked that {{unlike some of}} her forerunners in film and literature, [...] "Blair already has all the money and position anyone could want. She is pure naked striving, restlessly seeking an object, any object, and never knowing when enough is enough." ...|$|E

500|$|The German {{plans of}} {{annexation}} were more advanced for the Low Countries {{than for the}} Nordic states, {{due in part to}} their geographical proximity as well as cultural, historical and ethnic ties to Germany. Luxembourg and Belgium were both formally annexed into the German Reich during World War II, in 1942 and 1944 respectively, the latter as the new Reichsgaue of Flandern and Wallonien (the proposed third one, Brabant, was not implemented in this arrangement) and a Brussels District. On April 5, 1942, while <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> an entourage including Heinrich Himmler, Hitler declared his intention that the Low Countries would be included whole into the Reich, at which point the Greater German Reich would be reformed into the Germanic Reich (simply [...] "the Reich" [...] in common parlance) to signify this change.|$|E
500|$|... "Return to Sender" [...] was {{generally}} praised by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode's [...] "most interesting facet" [...] was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though {{he felt that the}} young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was [...] "a slightly cheesy moment". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar [...] "was okay, but [...] fell a little flat". TV Guides Paula Paige [...] "love" [...] the episode, saying that [...] "It just keeps getting better and better", but was unsure [...] "what Deb <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> the Doakes' family has to do with anything". Writing for TV Squad, Jonathan Toomey opened his review of [...] "Return to Sender" [...] by saying, [...] "Dexter did it again. Wowed me. Amazed me. Edge of my seat for the whole hour." [...] He was amused that Debra's profile of Valerie's murderer matched Dexter, but was uninterested in Rita's storyline with her husband.|$|E
500|$|Despite these problems, {{from late}} October 1974 his {{demeanour}} appeared {{to change for}} the better. His best man, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6November he met his uncle John Bevan, apparently in good spirits. Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that [...] "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, {{and there was nothing}} to suggest that he was worried or depressed". He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver Graham Hill. At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00pm and 4:00am, so Lucan often gambled into {{the early hours of the}} morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00pm lunch appointment with artist Dominic Elwes and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.|$|E

500|$|Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, {{he became}} a Baptist {{minister}} and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture {{was published in the}} Confederate Veteran as the [...] "True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth." [...] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased {{with the collapse of the}} Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt had failed to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, [...] "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him." [...] Garrett was present at the time and was more likely to know the facts than later biographers.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the Holland Society of New York renewed {{its efforts}} to install a {{monument}} in a prominent location in New York City's Central Park. The proposal was initially accepted by city Parks Commissioner Francis Dawson Gallatin (1870-1933), but opposed by the city's Art Commission. [...] The Art Commission's assistant secretary H. R. Marshall recommended that the statue be donated to Rutgers College as they recently installed a new college president, John Martin Thomas, adding {{that it would be}} a [...] "nice new and very visible gift, tying the university to its Dutch legacy at the height of the fashion for colonial revivals". While Turck was <b>having</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>with</b> his close friend, railroad executive Leonor Fresnel Loree (1858–1940) discussed the Dutch roots of Rutgers University, his alma mater, and convinced Turck to donate the statue to the university. At the time, Loree was serving on the college's board of trustees. [...] Rutgers, chartered in 1766 as Queen's College was the eighth of nine colleges established before the American Revolution and had been founded by Dutch Reformed clergymen from New York and New Jersey. After its founding, the college was affiliated with the church through the early nineteenth century, and graduated many students of Dutch ancestry. Turck desired to donate the statue anonymously, and with Loree's assistance, arranged for the Holland Society to transfer the statue to Rutgers. Bergen, now a Rutgers trustee in addition to continuing his efforts as chairman of the Holland Society's statue committee, said that it was [...] "particularly fitting that the statue should stand on the grounds of the educational institution founded by descendants of the Netherlands." [...] The statue was delivered and installed at Rutgers at the western end of the Voorhees Mall. It was dedicated during a ceremony held on June 9, 1928.|$|E
