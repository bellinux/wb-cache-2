5000|$|Josiah_Willard_Gibbs's {{theoretical}} work on thermodynamic concepts had at {{that time}} not gained wide acceptance and conversely the idea that an equilibrium phase diagram would become a meaningful concept in physical theory. Published over the period from 1876 to 1878, Gibbs' treatise was delayed in its acceptance for two reasons: first, The Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Science Scientific_Papers_of_Josiah_Willard_Gibbs,_Volume_1 was hardly ever read by scientists outside the United States. Second, Gibbs' mathematical treatment was abstruse and thus beyond comprehension for many people--including some of the better scientific minds of the time. However, one who did appreciate the importance of what Gibbs had done was James_Clerk_Maxwell, to whom Gibbs had written on occasion. Unfortunately, Maxwell died in 1879, soon after the appearance of Gibbs' papers and could neither publicize them as they deserved nor show how brilliantly Gibbs had unified so much of physical chemistry under the broad umbrella of classical thermodynamics. However, before his death, Maxwell did discuss Gibbs' work with Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals, who {{passed it on to}} Roozeboom. This explains how Roozeboom got such an early start on using Gibbs' phase rule to convert T-x diagrams into bona fide phase diagrams. Roozeboom soon logged a number of remarkable successes in this endeavor while Roberts-Austen continued improving his First Diagram. When the improved version of Roberts-Austen was published in the 1899 and Roberts-Austen invited Roozeboom to modify it in accordance with Gibbsian thermodynamical considerations. The image is considered by authors to be the first binary <b>equilibrium</b> <b>diagram</b> for the Fe-C system because it conforms to the Gibbs' phase rule.|$|E

Here, a recently proposed nov-el {{mechanism for the}} high-temperature oxidation of ZrB 2 –SiC composites is further investigated and verified. This mechanism involves the formation of convection cells in the oxide surface layer during high-temperature oxidation of the composite.

A eutectic point was found at approximately 15 % KHF 2 which remains completely liquid down to a temperature of - 9. 0 C.
