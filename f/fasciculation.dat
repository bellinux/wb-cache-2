25|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) affects {{upper and}} lower motor systems, with symptoms ranging from muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia, and fasciculations, all of which suggest increased axonal excitability. Many studies have concluded that abnormally decreased K+ conductance results in axonal depolarization, leading to axonal hyperexcitability and the generation of <b>fasciculation.</b> ALS patients in these studies demonstrated longer strength-duration time constants and lower values for rheobase than in control subjects.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{embryonic}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (eCSF), SCO-spondin is of the uttermost importance {{in the development of}} the neuronal system, being a key protein in the balancing of differentiation and proliferation of the neuroepithelium. It starts being secreted by the diencephalic floor plate in the first embryonic stages playing an important part in the development and differentiation of structures such as the pineal gland. In particular, the SCO-spondin appears to have a major role on the growth of the posterior commissure (PC), which was proved when mutants lacking SCO, and hence had no SCO-spondin, where unable to form a functional PC. On early stages of development the axonal growth is stimulated, being inhibited afterwards. A steep gradient of spondin expression in the neuroepithelium signals the need for different processes to take place, favoring the <b>fasciculation</b> on the cephalic region and the incorporation of new neurons on the caudal region. As such, the lower concentrations of SCO-spondin in the caudal region favor the axonal outgrowth and incorporation of new axons on the posterior commissure and the higher concentrations in the cephalic region promotes the interactions between the neighboring axons. In conjugation with the secretion of SCO-spondin, the midline positioning of the SCO assumes a great importance on the axon guidance process. This positioning facilitates the signaling of the turning points for the axons, through the spreading of spondin.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fasciculation</b> [...] These twitches of [...] "at rest" [...] {{skeletal}} muscle are {{too weak to}} cause any joint movements, and fall short {{of the definition of}} a tremor. Usually benign, but also a symptom of some very serious neurological disorders such as ALS.|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} prevalence and distribution of <b>fasciculations</b> in healthy adults and to assess the effect of age, caffeine and exercise. <b>Fasciculations</b> were studied with ultrasonography in 58 healthy adults in various age categories. Questionnaires were used to determine effect of caffeine and regular exercise on the presence of <b>fasciculations.</b> Finally, we tested the effect of strenuous exercise on <b>fasciculations</b> in 10 healthy adults. Twenty-five subjects (43 %) showed <b>fasciculations</b> on ultrasonography, mostly in the abductor hallucis longus muscle. <b>Fasciculations</b> were only sporadically encountered in muscle groups above the knee. Subjects with <b>fasciculations</b> were significantly older than those without. Caffeine and regular physical exercise did not influence the prevalence of <b>fasciculations.</b> However, strenuous physical exercise caused a temporary increase in <b>fasciculations,</b> but only in lower leg muscles. <b>Fasciculations</b> above the knee should raise suspicion and may warrant further investigation...|$|R

5000|$|Especially {{for younger}} {{persons who have}} only LMN sign <b>fasciculations,</b> [...] "In the absence of {{weakness}} or abnormalities of thyroid function or electrolytes, individuals under 40 years can be reassured without resorting to electromyography (EMG) to avoid the small but highly damaging possibility of false-positives". [...] "Equally, however, most subspecialists will recall {{a small number of}} cases, typically men in their 50s or 60s, in whom the latency from presentation with apparently benign <b>fasciculations</b> to weakness (and then clear MND) was several years. Our impression is that a clue may be that the <b>fasciculations</b> of MND are often abrupt and widespread at onset in an individual previously unaffected by <b>fasciculations</b> in youth. The site of the <b>fasciculations,</b> for example, those in the calves versus abdomen, has not been shown to be discriminatory for a benign disorder.

2500|$|Benign myoclonic {{movements}} are commonly seen during the induction of general anesthesia with intravenous medications such as etomidate and propofol.

50|$|Cramp <b>fasciculation</b> {{syndrome}} is diagnosed by clinical examination and electromyography (EMG). <b>Fasciculation</b> {{is the only}} abnormality (if any) seen with EMG.Cramp <b>fasciculation</b> {{syndrome is}} a chronic condition.

50|$|Cramp <b>fasciculation</b> {{syndrome}} (CFS) {{is a rare}} {{peripheral nerve}} hyperexcitability disorder. It is more severe than the related (and common) disorder known as benign <b>fasciculation</b> syndrome; it causes fasciculations, cramps, pain, fatigue, and muscle stiffness similar to those seen in neuromyotonia (another related condition). Patients with CFS, like those with neuromyotonia, may also experience paresthesias.Most cases of cramp <b>fasciculation</b> syndrome are idiopathic.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the absence}} of {{clinical}} and electromyographic findings of neurogenic disease, the diagnosis of benign <b>fasciculations</b> is made.

My approach to treating <b>fasciculations</b> that appear to be benign is to first reassure the patient that no ominous disease seems to be present.|$|R

40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study, {{we compared}} the initial presentation of patients who were eventually diagnosed with either benign <b>fasciculations</b> (BF) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found a significantly higher number of patients with BF reporting a past history of psychiatric symptoms, life stressors, and concurrent psychosomatic symptoms. There {{was no difference between}} the two groups in patient report of current anxiety or depression symptoms. These findings support our hypothesis that BF are a manifestation of psychological distress due to somatization and that reviewing psychosocial history is important when patients are being evaluated for <b>fasciculations.</b> Patients seeking medical attention for <b>fasciculations</b> and who do not report a history of underlying psychiatric or psychosomatic disorders should be followed closely as <b>fasciculations</b> have been reported to be a presenting feature of ALS...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fasciculations</b> are visible, {{fine and}} fast, {{sometimes}} vermicular contractions of fine muscle fibers that occur spontaneously and intermittently.

Undoubtedly, most <b>fasciculations</b> have a distal origin in the motor nerve both in normal subjects and in patients with motor neuron disease. Most of them spread to other dendritic spines often producing an antidromic impulse in the main axon. The clinical and neurophysiological diagnosis must be thorough.
