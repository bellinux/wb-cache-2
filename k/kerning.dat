25|$|Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, {{the program}} was unable to {{correctly}} handle ligatures defined in TrueType fonts. Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled: OpenType ligatures, <b>kerning,</b> and hyphenation. Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.|$|E

Common font formats include TrueType, OpenType and PostScript Type 1, while Metafont is still used by TeX and its variants. Applications using these font formats, including the rasterizers, appear in Microsoft and Apple Computer operating systems, Adobe Systems products {{and those of}} several other companies. Digital fonts are created with font editors such as FontForge, RoboFont, Glyphs, Fontlab's TypeTool, FontLab Studio, Fontographer, or AsiaFont Studio.|$|E
25|$|Herbert F. Lubalin (1918–1981), a post-modern design guru, was Ginzburg's {{collaborator}} on {{his four}} best-known magazines, including Avant Garde which {{gave birth to}} a well-known typeface of the same name. It was originally intended primarily for use in logos: the first version consisted solely of 26 capital letters. It was inspired by Ginzburg and his wife, designed by Lubalin, and realized by Lubalin's assistants and Tom Carnase, one of Lubalin's partners. It is characterized by geometrically perfect round strokes; short, straight lines; and an extremely large number of ligatures and negative <b>kerning.</b> The International Typeface Corporation (ITC) (of which Lubalin was a founder) released a full version in 1970.|$|E

25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as phototypesetting, utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs {{on a film}} strip (in {{the form of a}} film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine <b>kerning</b> between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|... {{which should}} now render {{correctly}} as ᨙᨀ (but note the possible larger left-side and/or right-side bearings around the vowel, {{which is now}} shown in isolation separately from the following letter ka, {{and in the middle}} of a non-breaking space which may itself be larger than the diacritic; this may be corrected in fonts, by including a single <b>kerning</b> pair for the vowel occurring after a whitespace). Although this solution is not ideal for the long term, text indexers may be adapted for compatibility of this encoding with the recommended encoding exposed in the previous paragraph, by considering this character triple as semantically equivalent as the previous character pair; and future fonts and text layout engines could also render this triple by implementing a non-discretionnary ligature between the two graphemes, so that it will render exactly like the standard character pair (which uses a single grapheme cluster).|$|E
2500|$|NSText and its related {{classes are}} used to display and edit strings. The {{collection}} of objects involved permit an application to implement anything from a simple single-line text entry field to a complete multi-page, multi-column text layout schema, with full professional typography features such as <b>kerning,</b> ligatures, running text around arbitrary shapes, rotation, full Unicode support and anti-aliased glyph rendering. Paragraph layout can be controlled automatically or by the user, using a built-in [...] "ruler" [...] object that can be attached to any text view. Spell checking is automatic, using a single dictionary used by all applications that uses the squiggly underlining convention introduced by Microsoft (actually a dashed red underline in Cocoa). Unlimited undo-redo support is built in. Using only the built-in features, one can write a text editor application in as few as 10 lines of code. With new controller objects, this may fall to zero.

50|$|Automatic <b>kerning</b> {{refers to}} the <b>kerning</b> applied {{automatically}} by a program, as opposed to no <b>kerning</b> at all, or the <b>kerning</b> applied manually by the user. There {{are two types of}} automatic kerning: metric and optical. With metric <b>kerning,</b> the program directly uses the values found in the <b>kerning</b> tables included in the font file. Most systems with typographic features today provide this type of <b>kerning.</b> Optical <b>kerning,</b> on the other hand, is available only in the more advanced systems. With optical <b>kerning,</b> the program uses an algorithm to calculate, from their outlines, the optimal spacing for each pair of consecutive characters. With both types of automatic <b>kerning,</b> the system usually permits the user to specify a minimum font size for applying <b>kerning,</b> if the user feels that <b>kerning</b> is unnecessary for smaller font sizes.|$|E
50|$|The table below {{contains}} a few exemplifying <b>kerning</b> pairs and their values. These values {{are based on}} 1000 units/em and the <b>kerning</b> pairs are ordered from the most negative to the most positive <b>kerning</b> value. The samples are taken from the <b>kerning</b> tables of the Minion Pro font. In other fonts the <b>kerning</b> may be very different.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{modifying the}} font file with a font editor or {{overriding}} it {{in a particular}} system, the user {{is limited to the}} existing <b>kerning</b> features. Thus, if one needs features like optical <b>kerning,</b> or contextual <b>kerning,</b> or <b>kerning</b> a pair of characters that belong to different fonts, and if the system lacks these features, other means must be employed.|$|E

50|$|With metric <b>kerning,</b> in a {{text that}} uses several fonts, the program must decide which <b>kerning</b> table to use when two {{consecutive}} characters belong to different fonts - the table from the font of the first character, or the second one - or to avoid <b>kerning</b> altogether. In this case, optical <b>kerning</b> is preferable. A common situation occurs when italic text ends with a roman symbol (right parenthesis or quotation mark, question mark, etc.) and the last letter's slant clashes with the symbol.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{composition}} algorithm created by Zapf and implemented in Hz-program; in the same essay, Zapf stated it is [...] "partly based on a typographically acceptable expansion or condensing of letters, called scaling.
