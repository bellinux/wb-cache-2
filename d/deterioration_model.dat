40|$|The {{deterministic}} bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> updating {{problem is}} well established in bridge management, while the traditional methods and approaches for this problem require manual intervention. An artificial-intelligence-based approach was presented to self-updated parameters of the bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> in this paper. When new information and data are collected, a posterior distribution was constructed to describe the integrated result of historical information and the new gained information according to Bayesian theorem, which was used to update model parameters.

40|$|An {{effective}} bridge {{management system}} that is equipped with reliable <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> enables agency engineers to carry out monitoring and long-term programming of bridge repair actions. At the project level, <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> help the agency to track the physical condition of bridge elements and to specify when bridge maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement can be expected. Also, with reliable <b>deterioration</b> <b>models,</b> the agency can customize bridge repair or replacement schedules that incorporate element condition, functional obsolescence, and pre-specified performance thresholds. At the network level, component-specific <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> are useful for system-wide needs assessment over a specified future time horizon, and to quantifying the system-wide consequences of funding shortfalls or funding increases in terms of specified performance measures including average values of bridge condition and remaining service life. The bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> that are currently in use in the Indiana Bridge Management System were developed over two decades ago. Since then, significant changes {{have taken place in}} inspection methods, technologies used, advanced statistical tools for data analysis. Also, {{because of the lack of}} reliable data, such items as the truck traffic and climate conditions were not included in past modeling efforts.

40|$|A <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> is {{the most}} {{critical}} component of a Bridge Management System (BMS). Artificial Intelligence (AI) -based bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> has recently been developed to minimise uncertainties in predicting long-term performance of bridge structural elements. This model contains two components: (1) using Neural Network-based Backward Prediction Model (BPM) to generate unavailable historical condition ratings; and (2) using Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) to perform long-term performance prediction of bridge structural elements. However new problems have emerged {{in the process of}} TDNN prediction. In this study, the BPM-generated condition ratings are used together with the actual overall condition ratings. The incompatibility between the two sets of data produces unreliable prediction outcomes during the TDNN process. This research therefore aims to introduce a new data processing procedure for BPM outcomes, by removing meaningless condition ratings that cause poor training outcomes for long-term prediction using TDNN. Consequently, the outcome of this study can improve accuracy of the current AI-based bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Successful bridge {{management}} system (BMS) development requires a reliable bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model,</b> {{which is the}} most crucial component in a BMS. Historical condition ratings obtained from biennial bridge inspections are a major source for predicting future bridge deterioration in BMSs. However, historical condition ratings are very limited in most bridge agencies, thus posing a major barrier for predicting reliable future bridge performance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a preliminary study as part of a long-term research on the development of a reliable bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Design/methodology/approach - This proposed study aims to develop a reliable <b>deterioration</b> <b>model.</b> The development work consists of two major Stages: stage 1 - generating unavailable bridge element condition rating records using the Backward Prediction Model (BPM). This helps to provide sufficient historical deterioration patterns for each element; and stage 2 - predicting long-term condition ratings based on the outcome of Stage 1 using time delay neural networks (TDNNs). Findings - Long-term prediction using proposed method can also be expressed in the same form of inspection records - element quantities of each bridge element can be predicted. The proposed AI-based <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> does not ignore critical failure risks in small number of bridge elements in low condition states (CSs). This implies that the risk in long-term predictions can be reduced. Originality/value - The proposed methodology aims to utilise limited bridge inspection records over a short period to predict large datasets spanning over a much longer time period for a reliable, accurate and efficient long-term bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>model.</b> Typical uncertainty, due to the limitation of overall condition rating (OCR) method, can be minimised in long-term predictions using limited inspection records.

40|$|<b>Deterioration</b> <b>models</b> {{for major}} roads, {{such as the}} World Bank model, are in use by many major road authorities. They are “data-hungry”. They rely upon the data being {{gathered}} over {{a substantial number of}} years {{for the establishment of a}} reliable model. Such a database is often unavailable for Low Volume Traffic (LVT) roads of lesser importance. This implies a limitation of the use of established <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> for the LVT road network. Available databases for LVT roads are often of the “snapshot” type where data on the network is gathered at one point in time rather than being recorded over a time span. The data is often captured by observation rather than measurement, although some scientific measurements of roughness are recorded. A need has thus arisen to provide a new approach for the development of <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> for LVT roads. This paper examines the application of Neural Network Analysis (NNA) to the LVT database to determine the development of <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> for LVT roads with the type of database currently available in Australia. The importance of the factors influencing deterioration is examined. Proposals are made for the most appropriate models for application to the LVT road network...|$|R
40|$|Bridge {{management}} systems (BMSs) are developed to assist decision-makers in optimizing {{the allocation of}} their limited budget on maintenance needs of bridge networks. Reliable <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> are essential constituents of BMSs {{that are used to}} predict the remaining service life of bridge components. The <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> incorporated in the recent BMSs have limitations that can be accepted for the analysis at the network level but not at the component level. Moreover, the current mechanistic <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> developed for the component level analysis are neither versatile nor adequately extensible to predict the service life {{of a large number of}} bridge components, or to incorporate additional deterioration parameters. Therefore, an artificial intelligence approach "Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) " is proposed to develop extensible, reliable, and generic <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> for the analysis at the component level. The CBR approach is utilized to predict the time to corrosion initiation of the reinforcing steel in concrete bridge decks. Data obtained from the Dickson Bridge in Montreal are used to generate the cases that populate the case library of the CBR model by applying the Monte Carlo Simulation techniques. Parameters that significantly affect the deterioration rate of concrete decks, such as the concrete cover thickness, apparent diffusion coefficient, and surface chloride concentration, are considered...|$|R
40|$|Bridge Management Systems (BMSs) {{have been}} {{developed}} to assist in the management of a large bridge network. Historical condition ratings obtained from bridge inspections are major resources for predicting future deteriorations via BMSs. Available historical condition ratings in most bridge agencies, however, are very limited, and thus posing a major barrier for predicting reliable future structural performance. To alleviate this problem, A Backward Prediction Model (BPM) technique has been developed to help generate missing historical condition ratings which is crucial for bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> to be able to predict more accurate solutions. Nevertheless, there are still considerable limitations in the existing bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>models.</b> In view of this, feasibility study of Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) using BPM-generated historical condition ratings is conducted as an alternative to existing bridge <b>deterioration</b> <b>models.</b> It is anticipated that the TDNN using BPM-generated data can lead to further improvement of the current BMS outcome.

The main objective is to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of two types of models, namely state-based and time-based models, which will guide decision makers in selecting the most appropriate model type according to management needs and data availability. Concrete bridge decks are selected for this application because they are {{considered one of the most}} deteriorating infrastructure components. Inventory and condition data required for developing the stochastic <b>deterioration</b> <b>models</b> are obtained from the database of the Ministére des Transports du Québec (MTQ).

40|$|A {{decrease}} in discharge capacity of storm-water drainage pipes {{is the result}} of the so-called hydraulic deterioration which reduces the cross sectional area of pipes and increases the pipe roughness. Hydraulic deterioration is caused by tree root intrusion, sediment accumulation, and encrustation, and is affected by many influential factors such as pipe size and pipe location. Predicting hydraulic deterioration is important for effective management of drainage pipes. An ordered probit <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> (OPDM) and a probabilistic neural network <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> (PNNDM) were developed in this study using the influential factors as model inputs and the hydraulic condition as model output. Their predictive performances were compared against each other using a case study from Melbourne, Australia with a sample of 417 storm-water drainage pipes subjected to closed circuit television inspection. The results show that the PNNDM is more suitable for predicting the hydraulic deterioration and outperforms the OPDM. Several input factors such as pipe size and pipe age are found significant to the hydraulic deterioration. ...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presented}} a <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> that integrates {{the effects of}} chloride-induced corrosion, climate change and cyclic loading for RC structures. The total corrosion-fatigue life was divided into three stages: (i) corrosion initiation and pit nucleation, (ii) corrosion initiation and pit nucleation, and (iii) crack growth. Since some of these stages are sensitive to climatic conditions, a simplified model of weather that includes global warming was also included. The whole <b>deterioration</b> <b>model</b> was introduced into a stochastic framework to take the inherent uncertainties into account. Finally, a numerical example illustrated {{the consequences of the}} deterioration process in the reliability of a RC bridge girder. It was found that for traffic frequencies between 500 and 2000 cycles/day, the combined effect of corrosion and fatigue leads to appreciable lifetime reductions. When no fatigue damage is considered, the climate change effect only induces lifetime reductions ranging between 1.4 and 2.3 %. Under cyclic loading, total lifetime could be reduced up to 7 % by global warming action. These results highlight the importance of including the combined effect of corrosion and fatigue for comprehensive lifetime assessment.|$|E
