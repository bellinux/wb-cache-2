There are, however, limited data on the relation between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and all-cause mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The Coronary REvascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto (CREDO-Kyoto) AMI registry was a cohort study of patients with AMI enrolled in 26 hospitals in Japan from 2005 through 2007. For the current analysis, we included those patients who underwent PCI within 24  hours of symptom onset, and we assessed their living status to determine <b>if</b> <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> would be an independent prognostic risk factor. Among 4, 109 patients eligible for the current analysis of 5, 429 patients enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto AMI registry, 515 patients (12. 5 %) were <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> at the time of hospital admission. The cumulative 5 -year incidence of all-cause death was 18. 3 % in the <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> group and 20. 1 % in the not <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> group (log-rank p = 0. 77).

Several of the elderly are <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and {{the main reason for}} <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> is <b>when</b> the spouse passes away. Loneliness is a factor that can affect quality of life, health and wellbeing. Loneliness is an {{individual}} experience, loneliness can be self-chosen but involuntary loneliness can lead to lifelong suffering and feelings of loneliness. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} highlight the factors affecting loneliness among elderly people within municipal care living in Sweden. Method: The method used is a literature review and the article results were analysed with inspiration of the content analysis. Results: The result is divided into four categories: Social networking, activity and assistance needs, communication difficulties and gender differences. The feeling of loneliness may be affected by <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> or <b>living</b> in special accommodations. People with different ethnic origin and people with incipient dementia development are two groups of patients who experience loneliness. There are gender differences in the experience of loneliness. The result shows that men do not experience loneliness to the same extent as women do. Discussion: The experience of loneliness can generate poor health.

40|$|Describes {{the trends}} in <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} people who live alone. Introduction Living alone is increasingly on the public radar. One in four Australian households is a lone-person household, and rates have increased sharply since the 1970 s. Throughout the Western world lone-person households have become increasingly common, and this trend is spreading to non-Western countries. In some quarters these developments have been interpreted as signifying a decline of commitment to family living, increasing social fragmentation and a rise in loneliness. For others, the growth in <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> has been celebrated as reflecting the greater choice that people have in their living arrangements and lifestyle. But to appreciate the meaning and significance of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> we must understand more about the make-up of those <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Who is <b>living</b> <b>alone?</b> Which social groups are driving this change? We also must understand more about the nature of <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> its duration, where it fits into the life course and its links with social connection and wellbeing. Do people tend to live alone for short periods, or is it a long-term arrangement? To what extent do people choose to live <b>alone</b> and like <b>living</b> <b>alone?</b> How lonely are those who live alone? Why do they commence <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and why do they stop? It is only when we can answer these questions that we can begin to understand its significance. This paper describes the trends in <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and describes the characteristics {{of people who live}} alone. It will show that within this single category of "living alone" there is tremendous diversity and that <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> has very different meanings within the various sub-groups. It will show that any characterisation of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> as "fragmentation" or as "freedom" is simplistic. To explore the nature of <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> a second paper will look at how long people live <b>alone,</b> <b>when</b> they live <b>alone,</b> and how moving into and out of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> arrangements affects the wellbeing and social connection of those <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b>  ...|$|R

40|$|This paper sheds further {{light on}} <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> by {{investigating}} {{the nature of}} <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> {{and what it means}} to the individuals involved. Summary In an earlier Australian Family Trends facts sheet (No. 6; de Vaus & Qu, 2015) we described those who live alone and how the rates of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> have changed both in Australia and internationally. We saw the way in which <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> is linked to gender, age, marital status, marital separation, widowhood and measures of advantage and disadvantage. These factors influence levels of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in that they create a pool of people available to live alone. This paper sheds further light on <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> by investigating the nature of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> {{and what it means to}} the individuals involved. In particular, we consider the duration for which people live alone; that is, whether <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> is a short-term transition between more enduring living arrangements or a long-term alternative to family living arrangements. Rather than simply mapping whether or not people live alone, we will put <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> within the context of a person 2 ̆ 7 s life course. By seeing where <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> "fits in", we should be in a better position to understand what it means. We also explore the more subjective side of <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> In particular, we describe some of the cultural values that underlie <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and the extent to which people like <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> What reasons do people offer for <b>living</b> <b>alone?</b> Do they live alone because they value the things it can promote - independence, privacy and a certain degree of freedom? Or do they live alone because of circumstances such as the requirements of their work or the lack of a partner? How do people experience <b>living</b> <b>alone?</b> Would they prefer to be living with someone? This paper draws on two large-scale national surveys. It draws on 12 years of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) longitudinal survey and tracks people as they move into and out of lone living arrangements. In so doing, it identifies types of living arrangements both before and after <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> and shows the duration of periods of <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> The paper also draws on the 2008 Living Alone in Australia Survey 2 to provide a window into the more subjective aspects of <b>living</b> <b>alone...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of individuals <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> has implications for nutrition and health outcomes. This review aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in food and nutrient intake between adults <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and those <b>living</b> with others. Eight electronic databases were searched, using terms related to <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> nutrition, food, and socioeconomic factors. Forty-one papers met the inclusion criteria, and data of interest were extracted. Results varied but suggested that, compared with persons who do not live alone, persons who live alone have a lower diversity of food intake, a lower consumption of some core foods groups (fruit, vegetables, and fish) and a higher likelihood of having an unhealthy dietary pattern. Associations between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and nutrient intake were unclear. Men <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> were more often observed to be at greater risk of undesirable intakes than women. The findings of this review suggest that <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> could negatively affect some aspects of food intake and contribute to the relationship between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and poor health outcomes, although associations could vary between socioeconomic groups.

40|$|Background : One of {{the major}} {{demographic}} changes in Korea is the rapid increase of one-personhouseholds, from 7 Š in 1985 to 24 Š in 2010. The increase of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> {{has important implications for}} the traditional family system. Objective : We investigate the long-term trend over half a century in the proportion of people <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> separately for different age and gender groups. Focusing on two groups, the widowed elderly aged 65 or over and never-married 25 to 34 -year-olds, we further examine the relationship between education and <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Methods : We use 1960 to 2010 Korean Census data to describe the trends in <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> by age and gender. We apply logit models to predict the odds of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> by education from 1980 to 2010. To facilitate interpretation, we present predicted probabilities of <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Results : There is a continuing increase in solo living among Koreans, albeit to different degrees, for both genders and all age groups. The rising trend in solo living among elderly widows and never-married men aged 25 to 34, in particular, reveals that the propensity for <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> has increased within specific marital status and age groups. We find that those with lower education were more likely to live alone than their counterparts with higher education.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the past}} decades a rising trend of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> can be {{observed}} in the population especially in urban areas. Living alone is considered a psychosocial risk factor. We studied the relationship between <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> cardiovascular risk factors and mortality. Methods We analysed data from the population-based MONICA/KORA cohort study including 3596 men and 3420 women of at least one of three surveys carried out between 1984 and 1995 in the region of Augsburg, Germany. They were between 45 and 74 years old and were followed-up until 31 December 2002. During follow-up 811 men and 388 women died. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the association between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and mortality. Results Altogether 260 men (7 %) and 620 women (18 %) were <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> at baseline. Men, who lived alone, were less well educated, had fewer children and friends, and they smoked significantly more than other men. Women, <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> were also significantly more often current smokers and had less children and friends, but they were more often better educated than cohabitating women. The latter group showed a higher proportion of obese and hypertensive women. Men <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> had a twofold risk to die after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio = 1. 96; p Conclusion Living alone is an independent risk factor for mortality in men.

Despite this, very little is known about <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> since until now very little comprehensive research has been undertaken into the lifestyle of those <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> There has rather been a tendency among social scientists particularly those working within the framework of social integration theory - to base their researches on the assumption that people <b>living.</b> <b>alone</b> necessarily expose themselves to social isolation, to their own detriment. Other researchers, however, stress the probability that those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> compensate for their relative isolation by maintaining more contacts outside the household and are thus not necessarily exposed to social isolation. The aim of this study was to use qualitative research in an exploratory way to collect in-depth information on the nature of the social integration of women <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and other related aspects of their lives. Although the findings are therefore limited by the type of research, a number of tendencies regarding the lifestyles and social integration of those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> can be identified [...] Probably one of the most significant conclusions is that, as far as their social integration is concerned, people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> cannot be treated as a homogeneous category: when, for instance, the regularity and quality of respondents' contact with the central figures in their lives is examined, it appears that their integration into these centrality networks ranges from very high to very low [...] ...|$|R

In this paper, we first argue that the partnership and parenthood trajectories of those living on their own in mid-life are diverse and discuss how these might differ by gender and between socio-economic groups. We then use data from the General Household Survey (GHS) to describe the trend in <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> for the period 1984 to 2009. Next, we use the first wave of Understanding Society (USoc) (2009 - 10) to analyse the partnership histories, kin availability and socio-economic characteristics of those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life. The findings indicate that the dissolution of a marriage with children is the dominant pathway into mid-life solo-living, but also that there is a substantial group of never-partnered men <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> with both low and high socio-economic status.

Methods and resultsA large-scale prospective, observational study in the Osaka region involved consecutive patients with AMI from January 2002 through December 2010. We evaluated the association between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and longitudinal risk of cardiovascular events following discharge after AMI. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to assess the association between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and the primary composite endpoint consisting of major adverse cardiovascular events and total deaths. During the study period, 5845 patients (4415 male patients, 1430 female patients) were registered. Living alone was found to be independently associated with a higher risk of composite endpoint consisting of major adverse cardiovascular events and total deaths [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1. 32; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 11 – 1. 58]. Multivariate-adjusted HRs of composite endpoint were 1. 34 (95 % CI: 1. 08 – 1. 68) among male patients and 1. 31 (95 % CI: 0. 95 – 1. 81) in the female patients.

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the lives of}} people <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> particularly their efforts to negotiate and create social boundaries to support a healthy work-life balance. The findings show that people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> are a diverse segment of the U.

People <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> are their own primary caregivers and must find time for self-care and household maintenance in the midst of working and developing meaningful relationships. Without traditional external obligations to structure their time, tensions develop between the desires to construct autonomous lives and establish connections with others. To develop a healthy balance between work and life, people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> must find ways to sustain their lives outside of work; limit the influence of work on their time; negotiate competing demands among family, relatives, friends, and personal needs; and develop supportive relationships. This project begins to address a gap in the study of work-life balance that neglects individuals <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> The number of people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in the United States continues to grow; yet they are an unstudied population in sociology. People in single person households have rich lives of multiple connections and provide much to our workforce and social networks. They are part of complex social networks that provide social, psychological and sometimes economic support, and sometimes struggle to integrate their social and family life with their work life. Utilizing the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and twenty-two in-depth interviews, this mixed method study examines how individuals <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> spend time differently than those living with partners and children, and how people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> understand and feel about their time.

In this paper, we examine whether the association between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and depression is independent of health status, social support and financial strain among Chinese older adults, and subsequently assess whether such association persists after adjusting these variables. Cross-sectional data drawn from the Hong Kong Population Census consisting of 2, 003 Chinese elderly people aged 60 or over were analyzed. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses revealed that <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> results in higher levels of depressive symptoms for older women but not for older men.

We can understand the following, 1) Living near a son has a good effect upon the old <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> 2) Their friendships have nothing to do with their neighbors. And they feel more friendly foward persons who have same hobbies than foward those who live in the same area. 3) The protection of their father 2 ̆ 7 s family and their graves is a factor that the old <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> live positively or not. 4) The older female is more positive than the older male about human relations. 5) The old <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> have lifestyles that seem to break loose from all restraints, but they do fundamental actions such is rising, eatting, sleeping, etc, at the same time. Their community has a great influence on the lives of old people <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Consequently, we must survey a larger area, and make more a thorough investigation into these problems. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{adopts a}} life course {{approach}} {{to investigate the}} pathways into <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life in Britain and how these vary by gender and socio-economic status. The rise {{in the proportion of}} people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> {{over the past three decades}} has been well documented. However, much of the focus of the existing literature has been on either people living solo in young adulthood or in later life. Mid-life has received surprising little scholarly attention, despite the fact that living arrangements in mid-life are changing rapidly, and that household composition and socio-economic circumstances in the period immediately prior to retirement are strongly associated with living arrangements and associated sources of support in later life. This paper therefore aims to fill this gap. We begin with a review of previous research on <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and present a conceptual framework of the pathways into <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life. Data from the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS) are used to analyse the partnership and parenthood histories and socio-economic characteristics of those currently <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life. The findings indicate that the dissolution of a marriage with children is the dominant pathway into mid-life solo-living, but that there is also a substantial group of never partnered men <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> These never partnered men are split between those with low and high socio-economic status. Distinguishing between different groups of individuals <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life is important for policy as these groups of men and women will have different social and financial resources as they enter later life. Mid-life men <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> who have not had children, have no educational qualifications, are not economically active and who live in rented housing are likely to be most at risk of needing a social and economic ‘safety net’ in old age...|$|R

40|$|Although {{skipping}} {{meals for}} a few days due to illness is thought to lead to poor physical condition among elderly individuals， the diet of elderly individuals <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> during illness has not been elucidated. Therefore， we conducted a questionnaire survey on the diet of elderly individuals <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> with the objective of establishing a system for meal support during illness for elderly community residents <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> The following results were obtained： 1 ） The majority of elderly community residents <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> were women and aged ≥ 75 years with ≥ 10 years of experience <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> 2 ） Rate of dependency on eating out and takeouts was significantly higher among men and community luncheon participants. 3 ） During illness， subjects primarily contacted relatives and depended on them for cooking meals. However， cooking assistance was not frequently provided. 4 ） Subjects who skip meals during illness were common among community luncheon participants， and commonly desired rice porridge. 5 ） Subjects were willing to pay approximately 500 yen for provision of meals during illness...|$|R

The subjects were 75 patients with chronic disease <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> The survey items were formulated based on the concept of family in patients with chronic disease <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> and the relationships between it and self-care ability, social support, and QOL as elements associated with treatment. We conducted questionnaire surveys, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis etc. As a result, we extracted two components of family concept in patients with chronic disease <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> The 1 st component of the family concept is “an existence that makes patients aware that they are undergoing treatment alone and feel distant from their families, ” and the 2 nd component of the family concept is “an existence of family that patients express thei...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a cross-sectional study on characteristics of health-related factors {{among the elderly}} <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in A town of Hokkaido, and we also examined risk of mortality or institutionalization among them, {{as compared with the}} elderly living with someone. A self-administrated questionnaire was returned with a written informed consent from 375 participants (66. 1 %) among 567 potential candidates aged 70 to 79 years old in 2013, and these participants were prospectively followed-up twice in 2014 and 2015. For the women <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> a proportion of experience in hospital attendance in the past year was significantly smaller (P= 0. 028), a proportion of lean body statue was significantly larger (P= 0. 028), and a proportion of having own residence was significantly smaller (P< 0. 001). For the men <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> a proportion of having a family doctor was significantly smaller (P= 0. 041). Risk of mortality or institutionalization was not different between the participants <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and <b>living</b> with someone.

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in older Korean widows and assessed the individual contributions of health, social ties, and socioeconomic factors to the development of depressive symptoms. The study was a secondary analysis using data from widows, 65 years of age and older, who participated in the Living Profiles of Older People Survey (LPOPS). A logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the contributions of health, social ties, and socioeconomic factors to the development of depressive symptoms. Working status and equivalent household income were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in both those living with others and those <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Adjustment for health status and social ties did not change the impact of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> on the prevalence of depressive symptoms. However, adjustment for equivalent household income eliminated the negative association between <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and depressive symptoms. Our findings indicate that economic resources are more important than health and social ties for alleviating the negative impact of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> on the development of depressive symptoms in older widows...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} the middle-aged population in the United Kingdom, discussing how their living arrangements have changed over time, the extent of diversity among those <b>living</b> <b>alone,</b> and how family pathways into <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life are related to psychological well-being. The middle-aged (35 - 64), {{many of whom were}} born in the post-war baby-booms of the late 1940 s and early 1960 s, represent a growing segment of the population. It is therefore important to understand their characteristics and resources both in their own right and to inform the design of future policy when they enter old age. Those currently in mid-life have married less, divorced more, had children later or not at all, compared to previous cohorts. These shifts in family life have several consequences for mid-life living arrangements, which will be described {{in the first part of}} the talk using data from the General Household Survey (GHS, 1984 - 2007). The rise in <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life over the past three decades is one of the major changes. Given this, the second part of the talk then {{focuses on the}} different life course trajectories into <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life. Data from the first wave of Understanding Society (UKHLS) are used to describe the partnership histories, kin availability and socio-economic characteristics of those currently <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in mid-life. Since <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> is known to be associated with poor health, the third and final part of the talk focuses on how partnership history and parenthood status of those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> are related to psychological health...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong’s {{population}} is ageing. The increase {{of older people}} <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and their <b>living</b> arrangement have raised much concern in recent years. More seriously, many of those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> are found and identified to be disengaged from the community and disadvantaged yet not helped by available services and support. The aim {{of this research is}} mainly to gain an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of the social lives of older people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> in Hong Kong through exploring their social life patterns and experiences. The areas of study include the understanding of what major factors contribute to or influence their social lives and the difference in social life before and after <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> A qualitative method is adopted by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews with thirty Chinese older people aged 65 or over and <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> for five years or above. For the purpose of triangulation for reliability and validity, three focus groups were also conducted after the completion of individual interviews. Research findings indicate that the reasons for <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> for most of the research participants seem to be involuntary and the choice of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> depends on some socioeconomic factors such as changes in family structure and life. The greatest change in lifestyle usually occurs because of the death of a spouse. Among those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> for longer periods, family relationships with their adult children have diminished and thus, they long for genuine concern and care from others. Social life, as perceived by older people, is important as it brings benefits for mental health. Emotional support that develops by expanding social relationships with peer groups is the most important in later life <b>when</b> <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Most of the females enjoy expanding their social circles from their domestic circles. Males prefer to continue working after retirement. They show passive in joining social activities but develop their own interests. Worsening health, having no companion, financial difficulties and lacking community resources are regarded as obstacles to expanding their social circles and joining social activities. The findings of the study are expected to provide reference for service providers in the field of social work with older people to explore whether there are community resources or welfare services that can help to improve the social lives of older people <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Aim. : This {{paper is}} a report of {{a study of the}} meaning of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> from the {{perspective}} of older people with dementia. Background. : Risks and problems experienced by older women <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> have been investigated mostly through quantitative research. Balancing their safety and autonomy is a serious international community care dilemma. Older people 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives have been muted in qualitative research on <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> with dementia. Method. : Using an interpretive phenomenological approach and van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s method, 14 interviews were conducted in Ontario, Canada from January 2004 to April 2005 with eight older women diagnosed with Alzheimer disease or a related dementia. Findings. : The theme holding back time expressed the temporal meaning of <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Pharmacological treatments represented stored time, offering the opportunity to hold back future dreaded time. Past experience with others with dementia was a context for holding on to now and facing some risks of <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> with memory loss. The women acknowledged the limited time remaining for, and identified endpoints to, <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Conclusion. : Insight into the impact of past experience with others with dementia could inform nursing assessment and advocacy for health/social services that are sensitive to the potential emotional impact of mixing people with varied levels of dementia in the same programme. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that elderly people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> are an at risk group {{with a high level}} of morbidity that makes high demands on health and social services. DESIGN [...] Secondary analysis of data from a community survey of 239 people aged 75 and over, identified from general practitioners' age-sex registers. SETTING [...] Nine practices in the London boroughs of Brent and Islington. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Scores on the mini-mental state examination; stated satisfaction with life; assessment of mobility; numbers of diagnoses of major physical problems; numbers of prescribed drugs taken; urinary incontinence; alcohol consumption; contacts with general practitioners and hospital outpatient and inpatient services; contact with community health and social services. RESULTS [...] There were significantly more women among those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> (93 / 120 (78 %) v 63 / 119 (53 %); p < 0. 0005) and the median age of elderly people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> was higher (81 v 80; p < 0. 04). Those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> and those <b>living</b> with others showed no significant differences in measures of cognitive impairment, numbers of major physical diagnoses, impaired mobility, or use of general practitioner or hospital services. Stated satisfaction with life was somewhat higher in those <b>living</b> <b>alone.</b> Elderly people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> were significantly more likely to have contact with chiropody, home help, and meals on wheels services and less likely to have someone they could contact in an emergency or at night. Living alone increased the likelihood of contact with one or more community health professionals (district nurses, health visitors, or chiropodists) considered as a group and also increased the likelihood of contact with social services as a whole. There was a tendency for more of those <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> than those <b>living</b> with others to have home visits from their general practitioners, but there were no significant differences in contact with hospital services between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Elderly people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> do not have an excess of morbidity compared with those living with others and do not seem to be an at risk group requiring specifically targeted assessments. More help is needed to provide elderly people <b>living</b> <b>alone</b> with a point of contact in case of emergency...|$|R
