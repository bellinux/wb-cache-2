The original kevlar Pro Staff model racket, known for its use by Pete Sampras, was heavy (more than 350g strung) and small-headed (85 sq. in.); Roger Federer also used the same racket model. As of 2015, he uses the Pro Staff RF97 Autograph model that is heavy (340 g/12 oz unstrung) and larger (97 sq. in.). Jim Courier and Stefan Edberg also used the Pro Staff Original, Edberg later switching to the Pro Staff Classic in 1991, which was the same racket (85 sq. in. with slightly rounded <b>frame</b> <b>edges)</b> but with different paint work. In late 2009, Wilson unveiled their latest line of rackets, codenamed 20x, which they would later rename BLX. This line directly replaces their previous K-Factor series with all new technologies. Also, many pros use custom-made rackets that perform differently from the mass-produced versions.|$|R

30|$|In the {{acoustic}} front-end, speech signal is blocked into 20 ms frames with 12 ms overlap if sampled with 22050 Hz sampling rate, and with 25 ms of speech signal and 15 ms of overlap {{in the case}} of 16 kHz sampling rate. A pre-emphasis filter with a factor of 0.97 is applied to each frame of speech. A Hamming window is also applied to the signal {{in order to reduce the}} effect of <b>frame</b> <b>edge</b> discontinuities. After performing fast Fourier transform (FFT), the magnitude spectrum is warped according to the signal's warping factor if the VTLN option is used. The obtained spectral magnitude spectrum values are weighted and summed up using the coefficients of 40 triangular filters arranged on the Mel-frequency scale. The filter output is the logarithm of sum of the weighted spectral magnitudes. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is then applied resulting in 13 cepstral coefficients. The first and the second derivatives of cepstral coefficients are calculated using linear regression method [23] over a window covering seven neighboring cepstrum vectors. This makes up vectors of 39 coefficients per speech frame. Finally, PCA and/or CMS are used in the cases these options are activated.|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} feature {{extraction}} approach, the features are extracted {{directly from the}} short time frames. Due to this, the frames are first Hamming- windowed to avoid sharp discontinuities at the <b>frame</b> <b>edges.</b> Because there are many frames already in a single audio clip, a specific key-frame extraction method, proposed in [36], is applied to reduce the most redundant frames. Such redundancy occurs because many audio classes, such as music or speech, contain similar and almost identical sounds (such as common vowels or same notes of an instrument). In short, the main idea in the frame reduction approach is to partition the extracted frame features into distinct clusters (based on their similarity/distance between each other) and to select only one or few key-frames from each cluster to represent its corresponding sound. For this, a minimum spanning tree clustering algorithm is applied, which is detailed in [36]. As an outcome of the procedure, the overall amount of frames is significantly decreased, whereas most of the feature description power is still maintained. The three frame-level FSs {{used in this study}} are listed on the right column of Table 2.|$|R

While these may subjectively enhance image quality, {{there is no}} uniformity in their use among laboratories and effects on quantitative coronary analysis may not be ideal. To determine which processing algorithms might help or hinder quantitative coronary arteriography, cine film images of precision drilled stenotic ylinders (0. 83 to]. 83 mm diameter) implanted indog coronary arteries were analyzed with and without such algorithms. Video flame averaging of I to 49 frames {{had no effect on}} measures of accuracy (mean differences) but precision (standard eviation of mean differences) was improved from 0. 23 to 0. 17 mm (p 25 <b>frames.</b> <b>Edge</b> enhancement filtering algorithms resulted in slight deterioration of accuracy and precision and smoothing filtering algorithms caused modest improvements in these parameters; however, these changes were not significantly different from unprocessed images.
