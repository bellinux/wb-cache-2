5|$|The Netherlands {{provided}} William Bruce {{with many}} of his influences. He was in the Low Countries {{at a time when}} Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange,</b> and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{place name}} Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange</b> on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange.</b> In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity in the shallow waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E
25|$|While {{his father}} Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, {{it also was}} not to be.

50|$|In {{the context}} of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Orangism is royalism that favors the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange's</b> rules as kings and queens. Orangism became a {{political}} force in the 1860s, when it was embraced by the dominant liberal tendency. Though presented as a national, a-political stance, to gather the support of monarchist Protestants and Catholics, liberal Orangism was in fact an attempt at achieving national unity at the expense of socialist and denominational politics.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the elder}} <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Orange-Nassau had become extinct {{with the death}} of William III of England in 1702, he left his estates in the Netherlands to his cousin Johan Willem Friso <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Nassau-Dietz in his Last Will. However, the King of Prussia claimed them, as he also descended from the <b>Oranges,</b> and the <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange</b> and <b>of</b> Prussia had, a few generations before, made an {{inheritance}} contract. Therefore, most of the properties, including Het Loo, were in fact taken over by the Hohenzollerns, who never lived there. Johan Willem Friso's son, William IV, Prince <b>of</b> <b>Orange,</b> finally received Het Loo Palace, as well as Huis ten Bosch palace in The Hague, from Frederick William I of Prussia in 1732.|$|R
25|$|The {{people of}} Neuchâtel chose Princess Marie's {{successor}} from among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince {{first and foremost}} to be a Protestant, and also to {{be strong enough to}} protect their territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices. Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but the Neuchâtelois people in the final decision in 1708 passed them over in favour of King Frederick I of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange</b> and Nassau, who were not even descended from Jeanne de Rothelin.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918-1919, Troelstra made a {{historic}} if ill-advised move. In November 1918, {{he used a}} speech in the traditional worker stronghold of Rotterdam {{to call for a}} socialist revolution in the Netherlands. However, it was not followed up by any revolutionary activity on the side of other SDAP activists, who were as surprised by Troelstra's declaration as most other people. The government, on the other hand, reacted quickly and sent troops to the major cities. In addition, a counter-campaign was set up to emphasise loyalty to the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, at the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813, the Wilhelmus had fallen out of favour. Having become monarchs with a claim to represent the entire nation and stand above factions, the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange</b> decided to break with the song which served them as heads of a faction, and the Wilhelmus was hence replaced by Hendrik Tollens' song Wien Neêrlands bloed door d'aderen vloeit, which was the official Dutch anthem from 1815 till 1932. However, the Wilhelmus remained popular and lost its identification as a factional song, and on 10 May 1932, it was decreed that on all official occasions requiring the performance of the national anthem, the Wilhelmus was to be played – thereby replacing Tollens' song.|$|E

25|$|The {{stalemate}} {{was broken}} {{in the summer}} of 1794 with dramatic French victories. They defeated the allied army at the Battle of Fleurus, leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands. They followed up by a campaign which swept the allies to the east bank of the Rhine and left the French, by the beginning of 1795, conquering the Dutch Republic itself. The <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange</b> was expelled and replaced by the Batavian Republic, a French satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the coalition against France. Prussia, having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794, made peace with revolutionary France at Basel in April 1795, and soon thereafter Spain, too, made peace with France. Of the major powers, only Britain and Austria remained at war with France.|$|E

25|$|The Netherlands gained {{independence}} from Spain {{as a result}} of the Eighty Years War, during which the Dutch Republic was founded. As the Netherlands was a republic, it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the regents, rather than by a king. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that sovereignty would be vested in the various provincial Estates, the governing bodies of the provinces. The Estates-General, with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the stadtholder of that province, a position held by a descendant of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange.</b> Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.|$|E
