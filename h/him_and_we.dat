25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice for}} Satan, {{provided}} by Parker, {{was inspired by}} the voice of the Pinhead character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, , when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, [...] "There's so many ways to go with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> couldn't figure out the right one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed {{from the fact that the}} script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.|$|E
500|$|Critics noted {{similarities}} {{among the}} structures of [...] "Rehab" [...] and some of Timberlake's songs, such as [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River". Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song has an [...] "R swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for Entertainment Weekly, Rihanna explained {{the meaning of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just means we have to get over the guy. So we talk about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E

500|$|The episode's premise {{was based}} on an extinct type of beetle, which caused trouble for guest actor Kirk Acevedo, as he had a fear of bugs. Pinkner commented in an {{interview}} that Acevedo [...] "has a primal fear of bugs and had to act with a bunch of live bugs and fake bugs, all of which equally terrified <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> didn't know. But he was game and heroic despite. He conquered his fears, which was awesome". Upon discovering her character Fauxlivia would be pregnant, Wyman described Anna Torv's reaction, [...] "She was up for it! All our cast has such a terrific attitude. They get as excited as we do. They really embrace the ideas. She's had a lot of challenges and she's met them with such aplomb. She's really terrific. She was happy!" ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Reed, {{a friend}} of the band, set up the drums and {{lighting}} when touring with the band. Reed's father, Lawrence R. Reed drew the Minotaur with a sword on the album's cover. Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E

[...] Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who {{they would like to}} see portray her love interest in the video. Minaj was interviewed on the set of [...] "Your Love" [...] by MTV News while wearing a pink and purple kimono as a geisha for the video. In the interview, Minaj said, [...] "We wanted to have geisha themes, samurai themes, stuff like that. I wanted to tell a love story. It's just kinda liking a guy, where he's not really for you to like — the forbidden fruit — and me and this other girl happen to like <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> go to war." [...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E

500|$|The play's [...] "greatest charm is the {{character}} of Imogen", writes Hazlitt. He observes how, in justifying her actions, [...] "she relies little on her personal charms" [...] or a prudish [...] "affected antipathy to vice" [...] but rather [...] "on her merit, and her merit is in the depth of her love, her truth and constancy." [...] Shakespeare's presentation is full and rounded. We see her beauty as observed by others (as by the villain Iachimo), but more often we see her from the inside, and are touched when, after endless nights of crying herself awake {{over the loss of}} Posthumus, she is outraged to learn (as she is falsely informed) that Some Jay of Italy [...] hath betrayed <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> witness a moment in the development of her character, as her resolve to disguise herself to seek out Posthumus grows firmer. [...] "Of all Shakespear's women she is perhaps the most tender and most artless." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> did 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
500|$|Franck's text shows {{elements}} of early Pietism: {{the expression of}} extreme feelings, for example [...] "O seligste Zeiten!" [...] (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a [...] "mystical demeanour", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to [...] "" [...] (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His [...] temple, more literally: [...] "God wants to prepare [...] souls to become his temples"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, [...] "" [...] (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>We</b> will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn [...] "", which is based on the Latin hymn [...] "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn [...] "". Nicolai's [...] "Geistlich Brautlied" [...] (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.|$|E

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E
500|$|He joined York's Conference Premier rivals Barrow on a one-month loan on 23 October 2008, {{having made}} 15 {{appearances}} and scored three goals for York {{up to that}} point in 2008–09. After Brodie scored two goals on his debut for Barrow in a 4–0 away victory Tamworth in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, Barrow's joint-manager Darren Sheridan said [...] "He did well and he gives us more options for the team. It was a great debut from <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> know there is still more to come in the next few games". This performance led to him being nominated as Player of the Round for the fourth qualifying round, which was eventually awarded to Sam Hatton of AFC Wimbledon. Barrow revealed that they were hoping to sign him permanently in January 2009 if his loan spell at the club proved successful. He made his league debut for Barrow in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green Rovers and he scored against Gateshead in the Conference League Cup third round for Barrow, the match finishing 3–1 after extra time. It was agreed for Brodie's loan at the club to be extended following the match, but York overturned this decision a day later. He made his final appearance for Barrow in a 1–0 home defeat to Weymouth on 22 November 2008, finishing the spell with seven appearances and four goals. He later ruled out the possibility of rejoining Barrow in January 2009, saying he was committed to York.|$|E

500|$|In December 1902, Dunlap died penniless {{and alone}} at age 43. According to the Sporting Life, the [...] "last {{two years of}} his life were spent in abject poverty and mental gloom" [...] in a Philadelphia {{boarding}} house. According to several accounts, a policeman at the morgue saw the body and believed it to be Dunlap. [...] Lave Cross was called to the morgue and confirmed that the body was Dunlap. [...] His funeral was poorly attended by his former baseball colleagues, and one former player who did attend observed, [...] "There were not enough friends of Dunlap at his funeral to bury <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to call on the hack drivers to make up the list of active pall-bearers." [...] Following Dunlap's death, William A. Phelon, Jr., editor of Sporting Life wrote:"So Fred Dunlap has passed into the great beyond, and the man whose salary figure marked the high-water limit of the long ago is gone! ... What a ball player this Dunlap was and what an artist in getting the fat salaries! ... Dunlap was a real infielder of the type so popular ten years ago -- [...] one of the solid, bulky style through whom no grounder seemed able to pass, but who could nevertheless wave the hot ones goodbye with graceful ease when occasion demanded. [...] With the gloves now in use to aid, Dunny would have been even a bigger wonder now than then." ...|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
