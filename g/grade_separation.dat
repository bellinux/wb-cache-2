5|$|The {{first two}} changes to US-60 in Oklahoma after its {{inception}} {{occurred in the}} northeastern part of the state. The highway's routing through Bartlesville was changed on September 15, 1936. On October 22, 1936, a section of US-60 and SH-48 (the precursor to SH-99 in that area) in Osage County north of Pawhuska was abandoned {{in favor of a}} new alignment that led to a new <b>grade</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reading {{is a major}} {{junction}} point of the National Rail system, and hence Reading station is a major transfer point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} Â£850m, with <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} {{continues the}} freeway section of Highway 4 further south, {{by removing the}} traffic light at this junction, and also added <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> with the railway. The other main road in the area is Highway 41 which served the city {{from the start of}} its modern history. This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main transport link to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones, and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange.|$|E
50|$|The route {{had several}} {{segments}} under consideration for grade-separations. The LRT Baseline (DEIR) included a minimal set of grade separations: the design options specified additional <b>grade</b> <b>separations.</b> The locally preferred alternative (LPA) {{adopted by the}} Metro Board included the LRT Baseline plus some additional <b>grade</b> <b>separations</b> (e.g. Design Options 1, 2 and 4).

5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less <b>grade</b> <b>separation.</b> In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E
5|$|Lynn {{has also}} been home to eight other {{stations}} on different sites - none of which lasted into the MBTA era - plus a ninth that opened in 1965. Besides its downtown stops, the Eastern Railroad also served East Lynn from 1880 until Marblehead Branch service ended in June 1959. Stairways from the Chatham Street to the station site still exist, although no station building remains. The 1896 depot was disassembled in 1912 {{in preparation for the}} downtown <b>grade</b> <b>separation.</b> It was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, where it now serves as the University of New Hampshire Dairy Bar and a station stop on Amtrak's Downeaster service. A West Lynn station was located at Commercial Street at the junction with the Saugus Branch Railroad, and Green Street was briefly located just east of Central Square. Neither the West Lynn nor Green Street buildings survive.|$|E
5|$|When the {{expressway}} spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) {{was built}} between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which {{became part of}} the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey. This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway {{on either side of the}} interchange in 1968. MD 170's <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982. The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent eastwest portion of MD 162 was built in 1988. MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995. MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus rolled back from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key {{objective}} of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect {{the southern end of the}} new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Lebanon, {{the line}} ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the {{highlands}} to Dodds. The never-used grade from Dodds to Waynesville descended into the Little Miami River valley via Newman Run before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone abutments for several never-built bridges remain {{on what is}} now farmland. The line as completed turned north at Dodds, and required several cuts and fills to traverse the rolling terrain. At Hempstead, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (now the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D, and ended at the Panhandle Route (now the Creekside Trail to the east) at Clement. Part of this line is still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for {{an extension of the}} Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the University of Dayton and alongside the Great Miami River. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL passed over on the first such <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> in Dayton. The first freight depot opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.|$|E
25|$|In addition, NCDOT is {{planning}} to convert the existing <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> at Weddington Road (located between exit 57 and exit 52) to an interchange. The proposed design is a folded-diamond style interchange with all four ramps located {{to one side of}} the existing <b>grade</b> <b>separation,</b> similar to the existing interchange of I-485 & NC24/NC27. The westbound (inner) ramps are proposed to intersect Weddington Road directly opposite Plantation Drive. The future interchange will likely be designated exit 54.|$|E

25|$|As the {{petition}} to consider elimination of all grade crossings {{in the city}} was under way, city engineer F. Herbert Snow prepared a preliminary plan. The proposal called for tracks to be raised and streets lowered through the city center, and the tracks lowered and streets raised in the Campello village to the south. Brockton station and Montello station to the north would be completely replaced and relocated, while Campello station would be replaced on its existing site. The railroad was initially opposed to {{the expense of the}} plan; however, city engineers made a convincing case that <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> would only be more expensive in the future, and the two parties reached an agreement in June 1893. The New Haven Railroad leased the Old Colony Railroad in 1893 and continued with the project. The Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners approved the <b>grade</b> <b>separation</b> project on April 21, 1894, allowing construction to proceed.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} sections, {{where there}} was no need to bypass the existing route, were not originally upgraded to motorway standard, but to dual carriageway without hard shoulders or full <b>grade</b> <b>separation.</b> The gradual construction of the M6 from Rugby (where it met the M1 to London) to Carlisle in 1970, where it terminated on the A74, meant that the route from Glasgow to London was entirely dual carriageway.|$|E
