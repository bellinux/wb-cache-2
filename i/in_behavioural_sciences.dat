40|$|A {{substantial}} literature <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>science</b> {{and psychology}} shows that emotions affect human choices and values. This paper investigates whether such emotional impacts are {{also present in}} stated choice experiments for environmental goods. If this were so, it would introduce an additional element of context dependence to the welfare measures derived from such methods, and would {{be at odds with}} the rational choice model underlying welfare economics. A laboratory experiment using three different emotion treatments was combined with a stated preference choice experiment concerned with changes in coastal water quality and fish populations in New Zealand. No statistically significant effects of changes in emotional state on estimated preference parameters, willingness to pay or the randomness of choices were found. The paper concludes by questioning, why such a contrast exists with empirical findings <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{ambiguity}} of the term ‘complex’ in studies of animal behaviour and cognition can lead to theoretical and methodological disputes, as {{there seems to be}} little common ground regarding the features thought to introduce complex- ity.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{construction}} of an instrument, Inventory of Supervisor Activities, which {{makes it possible to}} self-rate the supervisor behaviour during interaction with doctoral students. The instrument concentrates on supervisor interaction activities in three phases of doctoral studies: before enrolment of the student, during the study and after completion of the study. The core activities are those that are accomplished during the study. They are divided into 10 sections, which are further broken down into 100 specific activities. These activities cover guidance and support in the learning process, scientific socialisation, building self-confidence, advice in research, dissertation and academic publishing. The instrument uses low inference categories to ensure good reliability and was designed to cover supervising interaction <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences...</b>|$|E

40|$|Education of {{patients}} with arthritis began {{with an emphasis on}} conveying knowledge, grew to include behaviour change, compliance, and more general coping and management of disease and then progressed to consider physical and psychosocial health outcomes. Research continues in all these areas. Control, in many forms (locus of control, self perceived efficacy, learned helplessness), is now suggested to be a central mediating variable. Evaluation of programmes is moving away from programme v usual care towards comparison of alternative methods of delivery and matching of method to learner. The first generation of researchers in arthritis education tended to be care givers with little formal education <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> and evaluation methodology; the programmes they designed were often empirically based. The current generation, nurtured in large part by funds from the Arthritis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, is better trained in designing programmes grounded <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences</b> and educational theory. In the long run, collaborations with care givers and patients will considerably strengthen the effectiveness of education programmes for patients. A variety of educational strategies have been shown to change the knowledge, behaviour, and health {{of patients}} with arthritis for the better. Many methods seem to work, so long as the programme is planned, has a goal, and is accountable. There is much work still to be done to teach care givers to be better teachers, and patients to be better managers of their diseases, in concert with their doctors, and to focus on high risk groups. Although most work has been done with patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, many of these findings can and should be safely generalised to less studied rheumatic diseases. Finally, we need to consider the patient first as a person, and to provide education through all avenues, not just the medical care system...|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{preferences}} and values is an unresolved theoretical problem <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences.</b> The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis, {{derived from the}} Savanna Principle and a theory {{of the evolution of}} general intelligence, suggests that more intelligent individuals are more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel preferences and values than less intelligent individuals, but general intelligence has no effect on the acquisition and espousal of evolutionarily familiar preferences and values. Ethnographies of traditional societies suggest that exclusively homosexual behaviour was probably rare in the ancestral environment, so the Hypothesis would predict that more intelligent individuals are more likely to identify themselves as homosexual and engage in homosexual behaviour. Analyses of three large, nationally representative samples (two of which are prospectively longitudinal) from two different nations confirm the prediction...|$|E

40|$|Mirror neurons {{are special}} type of nerve {{cells in the}} brain that are seen to {{simulate}} observed behaviour. Research on mirror neurons in humans is still in a nascent stage, but shows promise as scientists are unraveling newer functions of these specialized cells. The present study aims to evaluate the hypothesized role of mirror neurons in subconscious imitation of observed behaviour. A group of 30 participants were monitored for their respiratory rate as they observed video clippings of the behaviour of models on the screen. It was seen that the respiration rate of the observers shifts towards that of the models, although the participants do not report this consciously. The results show that behaviour is subconsciously imitated, a finding {{that is consistent with}} earlier studies implicating mirror neurons. The present study discusses various functions and applications of mirror neurons <b>in</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>sciences...</b>|$|E
