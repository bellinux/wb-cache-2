40|$|This {{project set}} out to {{investigate}} the behaviour <b>of</b> a <b>pole</b> frame house subjected to a lateral wind load. The behaviour <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> embedded in the ground was examined. The existing theoretical methods for determining lateral load capacity <b>of</b> an embedded <b>pole</b> were reviewed, and three common methods <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> embedment were tested at different depths to gauge the response <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> and types <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> embedment to a lateral load. The most suitable embedment method {{was used in the}} foundation for a full-scale model pole house, which was constructed and tested at various stages during the construction to examine the response <b>of</b> a <b>pole</b> house to lateral wind load. The full scale testing was also used to monitor the effect of the various structural components on the overall stiffuess of the house. The results from the full scale tests were used to calibrate a computer model <b>of</b> a <b>pole</b> house which could then be used to predict the behaviour of different configurations <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> house construction without the need for further expensive full scale tests...|$|R

40|$|Systems whose {{dynamical}} representations involve multiple transportation lags {{are generally}} difficult to analyse.

A Nyquist stability analysis of a system with two delay terms reveals a central region of stability even though the system has an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> with positive real parts. An input-output stability criterion due to Zadeh is used to confirm the Nyquist analysis and show that systems with an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> are not necessarily {{subject to the same}} pole location restrictions as systems with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>poles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{accurate}} and efficient {{solution for the}} transient response {{at the far end}} of a transmission line is proposed in this paper.

Excellent match is observed between the proposed method and Spectre simulations. With two pairs <b>of</b> <b>poles,</b> the average error for the 50 % delay is 1 %. Higher accuracy can be obtained with additional pairs <b>of</b> <b>poles.</b> The computational complexity of the model is proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> pairs. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the problem <b>of</b> robust <b>pole</b> assignment in a circular region using novel global harmony search (NGHS) algorithm. Based on geometric principles, the position information <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> in the circular region is depicted and the rules of dynamic selection <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> from the circular region are determined. This ensures the algorithm select poles dynamically from the circular region. In order to get a set <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> and the state feedback controller which allow the system to have a maximum allowable perturbation or uncertainty, the upper bound of perturbation or uncertainty is optimized by the NGHS algorithm for the poles in the circular region. In contrast to most existing methods, an optimization method using NGHS algorithm for the dynamic selection <b>of</b> <b>poles,</b> makes the closed-loop system show better robustness. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{small amount}} of {{asymmetry}} of the magnetic flux in the air-gap of an electrical machine can create {{a considerable amount of}} force called unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP). This unbalanced magnetic pull is generated due to the presence of the magnetic fields <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> pair p and p± 1 in the air gap of the motor. A torque producing magnetic field <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> pair p is already present due to the main supply of the stator winding. To create a controllable UMP an additional magnetic field <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> pair p± 1 can be generated using an additional stator winding. This controllable UMP can be used for active vibration control. The present paper uses a special type of winding scheme called bridge configured winding (BCW) where a single set of winding can be used to generate magnetic field <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> pair p+ 1 and p- 1. An experimental setup has been developed to demonstrate the vibration control using isolated bridge supply of a BCW based induction motor by controlling the additional magnetic field <b>of</b> <b>pole</b> pair p+ 1 and p- 1...|$|R
