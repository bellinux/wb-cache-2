5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible <b>in</b> <b>opposing</b> aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and <b>in</b> <b>opposing</b> Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E

Simulation has been done in three modes of node’s mobility Speed in meter per second (M: 0, M: 5 and M; 10). In all situations, the efficiency of DNACK is better than NACK because in NACK nodes all packets (original and modified) are delivering to destination by contrast in DNACK just original packets are deliver to destination. However the Delivery percentage in NACK is Higher than DNACK which is around 2 % for 10 meters per second nodes’ movement. Nevertheless DNACK is more efficient than NACK. On M= 10 (m/s) DNACK shown 64 % verified messages on Destination <b>in</b> <b>opposed</b> by 60 % verified messages on NACK method.

Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions.
