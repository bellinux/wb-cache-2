5000|$|In 1848, the English {{zoologist}} Hugh Strickland {{wrote that}} a bird {{similar to the}} red rail (Aphanapteryx bonasia) of Mauritius was mentioned in the memoir of François Leguat, {{but was unable to}} classify it further {{because of a lack of}} remains. He wrote that it may have been a grouse or <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird.</b> In 1874, the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards connected Leguat's and Julien Tafforet's descriptions with some bones found in a cave on Rodrigues, and recognised their similarity to those of the red rail. Milne-Edwards coined the generic name Erthyromachus from the Greek words for [...] "red" [...] and [...] "battle", in reference to its behaviour towards red objects, and the specific name is in honour of Leguat. The junior synonym Miserythrus, from [...] "red" [...] and [...] "hatred", was coined by the English ornithologist Alfred Newton in 1893, also referring to this behaviour.

60|$|In {{the male}} of the Chamæpetes unicolor (a large <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> of America) the first primary wing-feather is arched towards the tip and {{is much more}} {{attenuated}} than in the female. In an allied bird, the Penelope nigra, Mr. Salvin observed a male, which, whilst it flew downwards “with outstretched wings, gave forth a kind of crashing, rushing noise,” like the falling of a tree.[111] The male alone {{of one of the}} Indian bustards (Sypheotides auritus) has its primary wing-feathers greatly acuminated; and the male of an allied species is known to make a humming noise whilst courting the female.[112] In a widely different group of birds, namely the Humming-birds, the males alone of certain kinds have either the shafts of their primary wing-feathers broadly dilated, or the webs abruptly excised towards the extremity. The male, for instance, of Selasphorus platycercus, when adult, has the first primary wing-feather (fig. 44), excised in this manner. Whilst flying from flower to flower he makes “a shrill, almost whistling, noise;”[113] but it did not appear to Mr. Salvin that the noise was intentionally made.|$|R
60|$|The spur, {{in those}} <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds</b> which are thus provided, is {{generally}} single; but Polyplectron (see fig. 51, p. 90) has {{two or more}} on each leg; {{and one of the}} Blood-pheasants (Ithaginis cruentus) has been seen with five spurs. The spurs are generally confined to the male, being represented by mere knobs or rudiments in the female; but the females of the Java peacock (Pavo muticus) and, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, of the small fire-backed pheasant (Euplocamus erythropthalmus) possess spurs. In Galloperdix it is usual for the males to have two spurs, and for the females to have only one on each leg.[73] Hence spurs may safely be considered as a masculine character, though occasionally transferred in a greater or less degree to the females. Like most other secondary sexual characters, the spurs are highly variable both in number and development in the same species.|$|E
60|$|The {{foregoing}} remarks {{relate to}} the secondary wing-feathers, but the primary wing-feathers, which in most <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds</b> are uniformly coloured, are in the Argus pheasant equally wonderful. They are of a soft brown tint with numerous dark spots, each of which consists {{of two or three}} black dots with a surrounding dark zone. But the chief ornament is a space parallel to the dark-blue shaft, which in outline forms a perfect second feather lying within the true feather. This inner part is coloured of a lighter chestnut, and is thickly dotted with minute white points. I have shewn this feather to several persons, and many have admired it even more than the ball and socket feathers, and have declared that {{it was more like a}} work of art than of nature. Now these feathers are quite hidden on all ordinary occasions, but are fully displayed, together with the long secondary feathers, when they are all expanded together so as to form the great fan or shield.|$|E
60|$|Several breeds of the fowl {{have either}} {{spangled}} or pencilled feathers; and these cannot {{be derived from}} the parent-species, the Gallus bankiva; though {{of course it is}} possible that one early progenitor of this species may have been spangled, and another pencilled. But, as many <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds</b> are either spangled or pencilled, it is a more probable view that the several domestic breeds of the fowl have acquired this kind of plumage from {{all the members of the}} family inheriting a tendency to vary in a like manner. The same principle may account for the ewes in certain breeds of sheep being hornless, like the females of some other hollow-horned ruminants; it may account for certain domestic cats having slightly-tufted ears, like those of the lynx; and for the skulls of domestic rabbits often differing from one another in the same characters by which the skulls of the various species of the genus Lepus differ.|$|E
60|$|As far, then, as {{gradation}} throws {{light on}} the steps by which the magnificent train of the peacock has been acquired, hardly anything more is needed. If we picture to ourselves a progenitor of the peacock in an almost exactly intermediate condition between the existing peacock, with his enormously elongated tail-coverts, ornamented with single ocelli, and an ordinary <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> with short tail-coverts, merely spotted with some colour, we shall see a bird allied to Polyplectron--that is, with tail-coverts, capable of erection and expansion, ornamented with two partially confluent ocelli, and long enough almost to conceal the tail- feathers, the latter having already partially lost their ocelli. The indentation of the central disc and of the surrounding zones of the ocellus, in both species of peacock, speaks plainly in favour of this view, and is otherwise inexplicable. The males of Polyplectron are no doubt beautiful birds, but their beauty, when viewed from a little distance, cannot be {{compared with that of}} the peacock. Many female progenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of descent, have appreciated this superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the continued preference for the most beautiful males, rendered the peacock the most splendid of living birds.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{animals are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable to predation. Hence, precocial young of many taxa develop predator escape performance that rivals that of adults. Ontogenetically unique among vertebrates, birds transition from hind limb to forelimb dependence for escape behaviours, so developmental investment for immediate gains in running performance may impair flight performance later. Here, in a three-dimensional kinematic study of developing birds performing pre-flight flapping locomotor behaviours, wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) and a newly described behaviour, controlled flapping descent (CFD), we define three stages of locomotor ontogeny in a model <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> (Alectoris chukar). In stage I (1 – 7 days post-hatching (dph)) birds crawl quadrupedally during ascents, and their flapping fails to reduce their acceleration during aerial descents. Stage II (8 – 19 dph) birds use symmetric wing beats during WAIR, and in CFD significantly reduce acceleration while controlling body pitch to land on their feet. In stage III (20 dph to adults), birds are capable of vertical WAIR and level-powered flight. In contrast to altricial species, which first fly when nearly at adult mass, we show that in a precocial bird the major requirements for flight (i. e. high power output, wing control and wing size) convene by around 8 dph (at ca 5 % of adult mass) and yield significant gains in escape performance: immature chukars can fly by 20 dph, at only about 12 per cent of adult mass...|$|R

The indentation of the central disc and surrounding zones of the ocellus in both species of peacock, {{seems to me to}} speak plainly in favour of this view; and this structure is otherwise inexplicable. The males of Polyplectron are no doubt very beautiful birds, but their beauty, when viewed from a little distance, cannot be compared, as I formerly saw in the Zoological Gardens, with that of the peacock.

60|$|The spur, {{in those}} <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds</b> which are thus provided, is {{generally}} single; but Polyplectron (Fig. 51) has {{two or more}} on each leg; {{and one of the}} Blood-pheasants (Ithaginis cruentus) has been seen with five spurs. The spurs are generally confined to the male, being represented by mere knobs or rudiments in the female; but the females of the Java peacock (Pavo muticus) and, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, of the small fire-backed pheasant (Euplocamus erythrophthalmus) possess spurs. In Galloperdix it is usual for the males to have two spurs, and for the females to have only one on each leg. (15. Jerdon, 'Birds of India': on Ithaginis, vol. iii. p. 523; on Galloperdix, p. 541.) Hence spurs may be considered as a masculine structure, which has been occasionally more or less transferred to the females. Like most other secondary sexual characters, the spurs are highly variable, both in number and development, in the same species.|$|E
60|$|There {{are other}} {{and much more}} {{remarkable}} differences between the sexes of certain lizards. The male of Ceratophora aspera bears on the extremity of his snout an appendage half {{as long as the}} head. It is cylindrical, covered with scales, flexible, and apparently capable of erection: in the female it is quite rudimental. In a second species of the same genus a terminal scale forms a minute horn on the summit of the flexible appendage; and in a third species (C. Stoddartii, fig. 34) the whole appendage is converted into a horn, which is usually of a white colour, but assumes a purplish tint when the animal is excited. In the adult male of this latter species the horn is half an inch in length, but is of quite minute size in the female and in the young. These appendages, as Dr. Günther has remarked to me, may be compared with the combs of <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds,</b> and apparently serve as ornaments.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, the {{feathers}} composing the crest in male Polish fowls resemble hackles, and differ greatly in shape {{from those in}} the crest of the female. The neck, wing-coverts, and loins in the male bird are properly covered with hackles, and it would appear that feathers of this shape have spread by correlation {{to the head of the}} male. This little fact is interesting; because, though both sexes of some wild <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds</b> have their heads similarly ornamented, yet there is often a difference in the size and shape of feathers forming their crests. Furthermore, there is in some cases, as in the male Gold and in the male Amherst pheasants (P. pictus and amherstiae), a close relation in colour, as well as in structure, between the plumes on the head and on the loins. It would therefore appear that the same law has regulated the state of {{the feathers}} on the head and body, both with species living under natural conditions, and with birds which have varied under domestication.|$|E
40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) is an {{emerging}} zoonotic pathogen whose geographic spread and incidence in humans, horses and birds has increased significantly in recent years. WNV {{has long been}} considered a mild pathogen causing self-limiting outbreaks. This notion has changed as WNV is causing large epidemics with a high impact on human and animal health. This has been particularly noteworthy since its introduction into North America in 1999. There, native bird species {{have been shown to}} be highly susceptible to WNV infection and disease with high mortalities. For this reason, the effect of WNV infection in North American bird species has been thoroughly studied by means of experimental inoculations in controlled trials. To a lesser extent, European wild birds {{have been shown to be}} affected clinically by WNV infection. Yet experimental studies on European wild bird species are lacking. The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is a <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> indigenous to the Iberian Peninsula, widely distributed in South Western Europe. It plays a key role in the Mediterranean ecosystem and constitutes an economically important game species. As such it is raised intensively in outdoor facilities. In this work, red-legged partridges were experimentally infected with two recent WNV isolates from the Western Mediterranean area: Morocco/ 2003 and Spain/ 2007. All inoculated birds became viremic and showed clinical disease, with mortality rates of 70 % and 30 %, respectively. These results show that Western Mediterranean WNV variants can be pathogenic for some European bird species, such as the red-legged partridge...|$|R
40|$|Recently, gaining {{knowledge}} about thermal refuges for vulnerable species {{has been a}} major focal point of ecological studies, and this focus has been heightened by predicted temperature increases associated with global climate change. To better understand how organisms respond to thermal landscapes and extremes, we investigated the thermal ecology of a <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> species (northern bobwhite; Colinus virginianus, hereafter bobwhite) during a key life history period. Specifically, our study focused on the brood-rearing period of precocial bobwhite chicks associated with brood-attending adults. We measured site-specific black bulb temperatures (Tbb) and vegetation characteristics across 38 brood tracking days and 68 random landscape sites to assess thermal patterns at scales relevant to broods. We observed that the landscape was thermally heterogeneous, exhibiting variation in Tbb up to 408 C during peak diurnal heating demonstrating a wide array of thermal choices available to broods. At 15 : 00 h, broods selected thermal refuges that moderated Tbb on average up to 10. 48 C more than landscape sites. Moreover, broods exhibited behavioral thermoregulation through reduced movement and by occupying more moderate microclimates that afforded taller vegetation structure during high heat. Modeled climate projections suggest that future Tbb in thermal refuges will approach those currently avoided on the landscape, emphasizing the need for future conservation plans that acknowledge fine scale thermal space in climate change scenarios. These findings underline that studying both abiotic and biotic factors at scales relevant to organisms can increase our understanding of how thermally heterogeneous landscapes provide thermal choices under extreme conditions...|$|R
40|$|Studies of <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> species {{stress the}} {{importance}} of high nest losses as a factor influencing life histories and populations. Accordingly knowledge of the mechanisms affecting nest losses is essential for understanding the population dynamics. The aim of this one year study was to estimate predation rates on artificial ground nests in ptarmigan habitats, along a landscape gradient which spans from subarctic birch forest to the low-alpine zone. We particularly wanted to investigate the importance of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a nest predator, and the study area was divided in three sub-areas according to the red fox density recorded during a winter snow track survey. Artificial nests (track boards) were placed in three different habitats (birch, edge and low-alpine). Vertical vegetation structure along the gradient from the birch forest to the low-alpine zone was surveyed and analyzed to assess how the forest structure could affect the predation rates. Predation rates resulting from different species were analysed using logistic regression models. Total predation rates over all habitats, locations and periods ranged from 47. 4 % to 77. 5 % and were remarkably constant over all variables. Predation by avian predators was consistently high over both trial periods (59. 1 %) and mammalian predation was consistently low (5. 6 %). The constant predation rate was mainly due to omnipresent corvids, especially the hooded crow (Corvus cornix), which dominated among the predators in all habitats and locations in the study. The high predation by avian relative to mammal predators may be due to differences in landscape use and searching effort. Differences between locations were insignificant for all species except for raven (Corvus corax) that showed significantly higher predation between two of the locations. Red fox played a minor role as nest predator and no relation between nest predation rates and red fox density was documented. From the perspective of nest predation risk on ground nesting birds like willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), they would not be expected to be selective with respect to nesting habitats...|$|R

60|$|I {{think it}} will be {{admitted}} by naturalists, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual characters are highly variable. It will also be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds,</b> in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between the females. The cause of the original variability of these characters is not manifest; but we can see why they should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as others, for they are accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in these than in other respects.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} facts, as showing how susceptible to changed conditions or to slight constitutional changes are the reproductive powers of animals, is the very general difficulty of getting those which are kept in confinement to breed; and this is frequently the only bar to domesticating wild species. Thus, elephants, bears, foxes, and numbers of species of rodents, very rarely breed in confinement; while other species do so more or less freely. Hawks, vultures, and owls hardly ever breed in confinement; neither did the falcons kept for hawking ever breed. Of the numerous small seed-eating birds kept in aviaries, hardly any breed, neither do parrots. <b>Gallinaceous</b> <b>birds</b> usually breed freely in confinement, but some do not; and even the guans and curassows, kept tame by the South American Indians, never breed. This shows that change of climate {{has nothing to do with}} the phenomenon; and, in fact, the same species that refuse to breed in Europe do so, in almost every case, when tamed or confined in their native countries. This inability to reproduce is not due to ill-health, since many of these creatures are perfectly vigorous and live very long.|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XII Congreso Nacional de Virología de la Sociedad Española de Virología (SEV), celebrado en Burgos del 9 al 12 de junio de 2013. [...] et al. West Nile virus (WNV), a neurovirulent Flavivirus, is {{maintained}} in nature in an enzootic transmission cycle between avian hosts and mosquito vectors, although the virus occasionally infects other vertebrates, including humans, {{in which it}} may result fatal. In Europe the virus has been present for decades but, recently, the number, frequency and severity of outbreaks have increased dramatically. To date, no licensed vaccines against WNV infection are available for bird usage. Although the cost-effectiveness of generalized vaccination programs is uncertain, the availability of WNV vaccines would certainly benefit specific populations, including birds grown for restocking, hunting activities, or alimentary purposes, and those confined to wildlife reservations, zoos, or other recreation installations. Here, we have tested the protective capability of WNV enveloped recombinant (rE) protein in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), a <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> widely distributed in South and Western Europe and intensively breed for hunting purposes. Partridges were intramuscularly immunized three times at 2 -weeks interval with 10 mg/bird of partially purified rE protein plus adjuvant. An additional control group was sham-immunized before challenge. Except for 5 birds that were non-challenged and housed as contact controls, all birds were subcutaneously infected with 107 PFU of the highly neurovirulent NY 99 WNV strain at our BSL- 3 facilities. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulp samples were collected daily up to 14 days post-infection, d. p. i. Birds were bled one week before the first immunization and at several time points during vaccination and after infection. While none of the sham-immunized birds showed anti-WNV Ab, all rE-vaccinated birds presented specific Ab after two immunizations, {{and most of them}} had nAb before challenge. Accordingly, none of the rE vaccinated partridges died, while 33. 3...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little is {{hitherto}} {{known about}} the breeding ecology of the Tibetan Partridge (Perdix hodgsoniae) which is endemic to the Tibetan plateau. Here we describe nest densities, inter-nest distances and general nest site characteristics in this <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> species and explore the possibilities that certain shrub and plant types are preferred as nest surroundings. Method: A total of 56 nests were found over three breeding seasons near Lhasa, Tibet. Nest site characteristics were compared with random control plots and the proportions of specific plant species covering nests were compared with their estimated general occurrence in the study area. Results: Nest density {{in the two years}} with highest search effort was estimated at 1. 43 /km 2 and 1. 04 /km 2 but was clearly higher in the part of the study area facing north (1. 86 – 2. 35 /km 2) than that facing south (0. 11 – 0. 34 / km 2). The average nearest neighbour distance of nests was about 300 m. Nests were situated in relatively lush vegetation and covered by a total of eight shrub species and three herbs. In contrast to previous reports, Caragana shrub did not constitute {{an important part of the}} nest habitat. The flowering, non-thorny bush Potentilla fruticosa was significantly over-represented as nest cover, while Rhododendron nivale was similarly under-represented. Nest bush foliage covered a larger area of ground, and the shrub surrounding nests was generally denser, than in control samples. Also, nests were placed closer to paths and in areas with lower densities of Yak (Bos grunniens) dung than in control samples. Except that soil temperatures were lower on nest sites than on control sites, micro-climate variables measured in this study did not differ between nest sites and control plots. Conclusions: Opportunity for nest concealment is probably an important quality of the nest habitat in Tibetan Partridges, yet it is unclear why the species should prefer P. fruticosa as nest cover. It is possible that nest sites are chosen to secure escape exits in the case of approaching predators and to reduce the risk of nest trampling. Tibetan Partridges may also select nest sites according to micro-climate, either directly or indirectly through climate-related differences in shrub vegetation...|$|R

The Hausa Moslems make the Guinea fowl cry, [...] "Kilkal! kilkal!" [...] (Grammar by the Rev. F. J. Schön, London, Salisbury Square, 1862).

60|$|Finally, we {{have not}} such good {{evidence}} with fowls as with pigeons, of all the breeds having descended from a single primitive stock. In both cases the argument of fertility must go for something; in both we have the improbability of man having succeeded in ancient times in thoroughly domesticating several supposed species,--most of these supposed species being extremely abnormal as compared with their natural allies,--all being now either unknown or extinct, though the parent-form of no other domesticated bird has been lost. But in searching for the supposed parent- stocks of the various breeds of the pigeon, we were enabled to confine our search to species having peculiar habits of life; whilst with fowls {{there is nothing in}} their habits in any marked manner distinct from those of other <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds.</b> In the case of pigeons, I have shown that purely- bred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races frequently resemble, or revert to, the wild rock-pigeon in general colour and in each characteristic mark.

60|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that the {{feathers}} of species belonging to very distinct groups have been modified in {{almost exactly the same}} peculiar manner. Thus the wing-feathers in one of the above-mentioned night-jars are bare along the shaft, and terminate in a disc; or are, as they are sometimes called, spoon or racket-shaped. Feathers of this kind occur in the tail of a motmot (Eumomota superciliaris), of a king-fisher, finch, humming-bird, parrot, several Indian drongos (Dicrurus and Edolius, in one of which the disc stands vertically), and in the tail of certain birds of paradise. In these latter birds, similar feathers, beautifully ocellated, ornament the head, as is likewise the case with some <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds.</b> In an Indian bustard (Sypheotides auritus) the feathers forming the ear- tufts, which are about four inches in length, also terminate in discs. (69. Jerdon, 'Birds of India,' vol. iii. p. 620.) It is a most singular fact that the motmots, as Mr. Salvin has clearly shewn (70. 'Proceedings, Zoological Society,' 1873, p. 429.), give to their tail feathers the racket-shape by biting off the barbs, and, further, that this continued mutilation has produced a certain amount of inherited effect.|$|E
60|$|I {{was thus}} led {{to make the}} experiments, {{recorded}} in the seventh chapter, on fowls. I selected long-established pure breeds, {{in which there was}} not a trace of red, yet in several of the mongrels feathers of this colour appeared; and one magnificent bird, the offspring of a black Spanish cock and white Silk hen, was coloured almost exactly like the wild Gallus bankiva. All who know anything of the breeding of poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure Spanish and of pure white Silk fowls might have been reared without the appearance of a red feather. The fact, given on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, of the frequent appearance, in mongrel fowls, of pencilled or transversely-barred feathers, like those common to many <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>birds,</b> is likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character formerly possessed by some ancient progenitor of the family. I owe to the kindness of this excellent observer the opportunity of inspecting some neck-hackles and tail-feathers from a hybrid between the common fowl and a very distinct species, the Gallus varius; and these feathers are transversely striped in a conspicuous manner with dark metallic blue and grey, a character which could not have been derived from either immediate parent.|$|E
40|$|Using eye {{samples of}} nine 9 -week-old {{experimentally}} West Nile virus (WNV) –infected red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), time course of lesions and WNV antigen appearance in ocular structures were examined. In addition, eye samples of 6 red-legged partridges and 3 common pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) naturally infected with Bagaza virus (BAGV) {{were used to}} study lesions and flavivirus antigen distribution in relation to apparent blindness in the former. The rapid onset of microscopic lesions and early presence of viral antigen {{in the eye of}} experimentally WNV-infected partridges, prior to the central nervous system involvement, suggested hematogenous spread of the virus into the eye. BAGV-infected partridges had a more pronunced inflammatory reaction and more widespread flavivirus antigen distribution in the retina compared with pheasants and experimentally fatally WNV-infected partridges. Our results suggest that flavivirus replication and development of lesions in ocular structures of <b>gallinaceous</b> game <b>birds</b> vary with the specific virus and host species involved.

6000|$|Not only do worms aid {{directly}} in the chemical disintegration of rocks, but {{there is good reason}} to believe that they likewise act in a direct and mechanical manner on the smaller particles. All the species which swallow earth are furnished with gizzards; and these are lined with so thick a chitinous membrane, that Perrier speaks of it, {69} as [...] "une veritable armature." [...] The gizzard is surrounded by powerful transverse muscles, which, according to Claparede, are about ten times as thick as the longitudinal ones; and Perrier saw them contracting energetically. Worms belonging to one genus, Digaster, have two distinct but quite similar gizzards; and in another genus, Moniligaster, the second gizzard consists of four pouches, one succeeding the other, so that it may almost be said to have five gizzards. {70} In the same manner as <b>gallinaceous</b> and struthious <b>birds</b> swallow stones to aid in the trituration of their food, so it appears to be with terricolous worms. The gizzards of thirty-eight of our common worms were opened, and in twenty-five of them small stones or grains of sand, sometimes together with the hard calcareous concretions formed within the anterior calciferous glands, were found, and in two others concretions alone. In the gizzards of the remaining worms there were no stones; but some of these were not real exceptions, as the gizzards were opened late in the autumn, when the worms had ceased to feed and their gizzards were quite empty. {71} ...|$|R
6000|$|The last {{species to}} be mentioned, namely, Gallus bankiva, {{has a much}} wider {{geographical}} range than the three previous species; it inhabits Northern India as far west as Sinde, and ascends the Himalaya to a height of 4000 ft.; it inhabits Burmah, the Malay peninsula, the Indo-Chinese countries, the Philippine Islands, and the Malayan archipelago as far eastward as Timor. This species varies considerably in the wild state. Mr. Blyth informs me that the specimens, both male and female, brought from near the Himalaya, are rather paler coloured than those {{from other parts of}} India; whilst those from the Malay peninsula and Java are brighter coloured than the Indian birds. I have seen specimens from these countries, and the difference of tint in the hackles was conspicuous. The Malayan hens were a shade redder on the breast and neck than the Indian hens. The Malayan males generally had a red ear-lappet, instead of a white one as in India; but Mr. Blyth has seen one Indian specimen without the white ear-lappet. The legs are leaden blue in the Indian, whereas they show some tendency to be yellowish in the Malayan and Javan specimens. In the former Mr. Blyth finds the tarsus remarkably variable in length. According to Temminck (7/20. 'Coup-d'oeil general sur l'Inde Archipelagique' tome 3 1849 page 177; see also Mr. Blyth in 'Indian Sporting Review' volume 2 page 5 1856.) the Timor specimens differ as a local race from that of Java. These several wild varieties have not as yet been ranked as distinct species; if they should, as is not unlikely, be hereafter thus ranked, the circumstance would be quite immaterial as far as the parentage and differences of our domestic breeds are concerned. The wild G. bankiva agrees most closely with the black-breasted red Game-breed, in colouring and in all other respects, except in being smaller, and in the tail being carried more horizontally. But {{the manner in which the}} tail is carried is highly variable in many of our breeds, for, as Mr. Brent informs me, the tail slopes much in the Malays, is erect in the Games and some other breeds, and is more than erect in Dorkings, Bantams, etc. There is one other difference namely, that in G. bankiva, according to Mr. Blyth, the neck-hackles when first moulted are replaced during two or three months not by other hackles, as with our domestic poultry, but by short blackish feathers. (7/21. Mr. Blyth 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 1 1848 page 455.) Mr. Brent, however, has remarked that these black feathers remain in the wild bird after the development of the lower hackles, and appear in the domestic bird at the same time with them: so that the only difference is that the lower hackles are replaced more slowly in the wild than in the tame bird; but as confinement is known sometimes to affect the masculine plumage, this slight difference cannot be considered of any importance. It is a significant fact that the voice of both the male and female G. bankiva closely resembles, as Mr. Blyth and others have noted, the voice of both sexes of the common domestic fowl; but the last note of the crow of the wild bird is rather less prolonged. Captain Hutton, well known for his researches into the natural history of India, informs me that he has seen several crossed fowls from the wild species and the Chinese bantam; these crossed fowls BRED FREELY with bantams, but unfortunately were not crossed inter se. Captain Hutton reared chickens from the eggs of the Gallus bankiva; and these, though at first very wild, afterwards became so tame that they would crowd round his feet. He did not succeed in rearing them to maturity; but as he remarks, [...] "no wild <b>gallinaceous</b> <b>bird</b> thrives well at first on hard grain." [...] Mr. Blyth also found much difficulty in keeping G. bankiva in confinement. In the Philippine Islands, however, the natives must succeed better, as they keep wild cocks to fight with their domestic game-birds. (7/22. Crawfurd 'Desc. Dict. of Indian Islands' 1856 page 112.) Sir Walter Elliot informs me that the hen of a native domestic breed of Pegu is undistinguishable from the hen of the wild G. bankiva; and the natives constantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to fight with them in the woods. (7/23. In Burmah, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, the wild and tame poultry constantly cross together, and irregular transitional forms may be seen.) Mr. Crawfurd remarks that from etymology it might be argued that the fowl was first domesticated by the Malays and Javanese. (7/24. Ibid page 113.) It is also a curious fact, of which I have been assured by Mr. Blyth, that wild specimens of the Gallus bankiva, brought from the countries east of the Bay of Bengal, are far more easily tamed than those of India; nor is this an unparalleled fact, for, as Humboldt long ago remarked, the same species sometimes evinces a more tameable disposition in one country than in another. If we suppose that the G. bankiva was first tamed in Malaya and afterwards imported into India, we can understand an observation made to me by Mr. Blyth, that the domestic fowls of India do not resemble the wild G. bankiva of India more closely than do those of Europe.] ...|$|R
