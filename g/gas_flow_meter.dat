The performed experiments used an ultra sonic, sing-around, <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> equipped with silicon based transducers. The center frequency of the transducers was 800 kHz. Speed of sound was measured in mono-, di- and triatomic gases: argon (Ar), oxygen (O 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), in either air or nitrogen (N 2) as a background gas. The gas under investigation was mixed with the background gas in a test chamber and the concentration of the gas under examination was varied between 0 % and 100 %. A gas chromatograph was used in order to accurately determine {{the composition of the}} gas mixture. The experiments show that measured {{speed of sound}}, as a function of gas composition, agrees with the speed of sound obtained from theory.

Likewise, change of the length of the ultrasonic transducers influences on the acoustic path lengths, and thus on the transit times.
