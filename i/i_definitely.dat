5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

500|$|Hayley Beck of CWG Magazine gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} EP, saying [...] "Honestly I could hear these songs being played in a nightclub, and <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> never would've imagined myself dancing around to a Lifehouse track!"

500|$|Jacques René Zammit of The Malta Independent {{reviewed}} {{one episode}} in which Fry {{talked about the}} problems within journalism. Zammit wrote positively on Fry's comments saying, [...] "I share Stephen's worries completely. Every time I sit down to type my excessively long column, I am burdened {{by the thought that}} after all this is just a collection of thoughts by someone who may very well be perceived as a pompous ass – and if Stephen Fry has these disquisitions, then <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> should be doing some worrying myself." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> don't go the {{straight}} and narrow path, and you know, <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{whole time}} <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> was thinking, 'Everyone knows, {{everyone}} can see.'...I {{just wanted to}} give everything I could... When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E

500|$|Timberlake {{said that}} the chorus was [...] "very James Brown-ish, call out and repeat, like 'Sex Machine'." [...] He wrote the track [...] "from top to bottom. 'I'm {{bringing}} sexy back, yeah! I'm bringing[...] [...]' It's a very physical song, meant to provoke... sexual dance. 'Sex Machine' is the closest reference." [...] Timberlake {{said that the}} lyric, [...] "bringing sexy back", {{was one of the}} first lines he came up with. In addition, he admitted that the song was not going to be titled [...] "SexyBack", saying, [...] "We weren't originally going to call it 'SexyBack'. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> didn't think it would become the most worn-out phrase of 2006. It just sounded like a nice opening to the song." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cornell {{revealed}} {{further information}} about the band's breakup; [...] "Personally {{a lot of it}} was me trying to land on my feet again. I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to being rife with continuity errors, the film has several plots, subplots and character details whose inconsistencies have been commented on by critics and audiences. The Portland Mercury has stated {{that a number of}} [...] "plot threads are introduced, then instantly abandoned." [...] In an early scene, halfway through a conversation about planning a birthday party for Johnny, Claudette off-handedly tells Lisa: [...] "I got the results of the test back. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> have breast cancer." [...] The issue is casually dismissed and never revisited {{during the rest of the}} film. In addition, the audience never learns the details surrounding Denny's drug-related debt to Chris-R or what led to their violent confrontation on the roof.|$|E

500|$|Metal Storm {{reviewed}} the DVD {{recording of the}} live performance and called it [...] "a perfect way to discover the music of Wednesday 13 that I could describe as a mix of Glam with Punk". Justin Donnelly {{reviewed the}} album for The Metal Forge and wrote favorably about the DVD portion: [...] "Shot with six cameras, Fuck It, We'll Do It Live is a raw and honest representation of Wednesday 13 live in concert". A review by Metal Rage was critical of the DVD, but praised the audio on the CD: [...] "All in all <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> recommend the CD, 'cause you get a nice representative image of what a good Wednesday 13 show sounds like." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2015, showrunners Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters {{confirmed}} that Agent Carter {{was not intended}} to be a miniseries, and that a possible second season would not necessarily be limited to eight episodes like the first. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, intended to debut in 2016 of the 2015–16 season during the midseason break of the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later in May, Hayley Atwell stated the season would consist of 10 episodes. Butters explained that this would probably not allow for any standalone episodes, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> think it allows for more character, because we can have more personal stories built into the framework of the overall arching mystery".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the {{greatest}} career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> had every single door shut in my face... there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E
500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
