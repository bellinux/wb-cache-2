5|$|Civilian deaths {{caused by}} allied {{operations}} had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban, who {{were allowed to}} move into the Quam. The residents may have been further <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the failure of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to address the concerns of a delegation of elders and maliks in Kabul two days previously.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E

5|$|The legions were <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> his {{behaviour}} {{and quickly}} came to regret having supported his accession. While Elagabalus {{was still on}} his way to Rome, brief revolts broke out by the Fourth Legion at the instigation of Gellius Maximus, and by the Third Legion, which itself had been responsible for the elevation of Elagabalus to the throne, under the command of Senator Verus. The rebellion was quickly put down, and the Third Legion disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|As an {{intoxicated}} Holly displays erratic {{behavior at}} Heidi and Spencer's rehearsal dinner, Stephanie is <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> {{her lack of}} irresponsibility. After Spencer explains that her behavior was inappropriate, Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation has been sent to a special guest. Charlie later tells Spencer that he invited Stacie, the bartender that Heidi clashed with for flirting with Spencer, to the wedding. Meanwhile, Brody and Stephanie make peace at Lauren and Lo's farewell party, while Lauren tells Stephanie that {{she will not be}} attending the ceremony.|$|E
50|$|The Kensington Vestry Hall {{was built}} by Thomas Corby in 1852. It was {{designed}} by architect James Broadbridge. Its construction was met with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> ratepayers, who complained about the outlandish railings. They were finally removed in 1880.|$|R

40|$|Bob Dylan's 1966 {{world tour}} {{was greeted with}} <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> many Folk purists who viewed Dylan's move to {{electrified}} backing as a 'sell-out' of Authentic Folk values.

5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route {{into the interior}} of Gaul. He {{had come to see}} this region as Alamanni territory by right of conquest after occupying it for several years. He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been surprised and <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio and the intelligence brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{director}} Martin Campbell {{confirmed the}} possibility of a Green Lantern trilogy. Warner Bros. originally planned on Green Lantern being the first entry of a new DC film franchise, and commissioned a script for a sequel from Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, and Marc Guggenheim while filming for the first film was underway. In August 2010, Michael Goldenberg was still attached to write the screenplay, based on the sequel treatment. The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by its dark power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E
2500|$|The PAP's {{victory was}} viewed with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> foreign and local {{business}} leaders. Although Lee {{and the other}} leaders of the PAP hailed from the [...] "moderate" [...] wing of the party, {{many of the other}} members were staunchly pro-communist. Many businesses promptly shifted their headquarters from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the meeting}} took place, French {{president}} Jacques Chirac declared on 10 March that France would veto any resolution which would automatically lead to war. This caused open displays of <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. and British governments. The drive by Britain for unanimity and a [...] "second resolution" [...] was effectively abandoned at that point.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Murat was {{released}} on parole, after having spent 15 years of his 19 years sentence, even though the justice minister of that time, Marc Verwilghen, had provided a negative advice for this. In 2004, he was jailed again for stealing CDs, but he {{was released}} the next day, under <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> justice minister Verwilghen.|$|R
5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of overarm bowling at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania {{preferred}} underarm bowling {{at a time when}} roundarm bowling was permitted {{in the rest of the}} world. The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the state of the pitch, which looked extremely difficult to bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Charles's reign, {{the issue}} of how far the English Reformation should {{progress}} was constantly brought to the forefront of political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its Calvinist opponents. Charles's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism, and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from Calvinism in a more traditional and sacramental direction, were perceived by Puritans as irreligious tendencies. In addition, Charles's Protestant subjects followed news of the European war closely and grew increasingly <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of Charles II without {{legitimate}} issue in February 1685, the Duke of York became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. Mary was playing cards when her husband informed her of her father's accession, {{and that she was}} heir presumptive. When Charles's illegitimate son Monmouth assembled an invasion force at Amsterdam, and sailed for Britain, William informed James of Monmouth's departure, and ordered English regiments in the Low Countries to return to Britain. To William's relief, Monmouth was defeated, captured and executed, but both he and Mary were <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> James's subsequent actions.|$|E
50|$|Teets's memo was {{forwarded}} to Congress over the Easter weekend, {{but despite the}} congressional recess was met with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> the office of Senator Wayne Allard, Republican Senator from Colorado and Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York who have led congressional inquiries into the scandal. Concern was also expressed by Kate Summers of the victims rights group Miles Foundation.|$|R
5000|$|Karel De Gucht was {{appointed}} Commissioner for Trade in 2010. De Gucht's {{statements to the}} European Parliament ahead of becoming Trade Commissioner were met with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> Trade Justice campaigners who claimed 'responses at his three-hour hearing revealed his corporate sympathies and gave little indication that the change of personnel at the European Trade Commission will lead to {{any change in the}} direction of European trade policy.' ...|$|R
25|$|Whilst a success, {{this result}} {{was greeted with}} <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> the corps commander, the Earl of Cavan; he was a believer in a more {{traditional}} strongly held static line of defence and felt that Fanshawe {{did not need to}} have given up any ground at all. Fanshawe was quickly relieved of his command and ordered home, leaving Italy four days {{after the end of the}} battle, on 20 June.|$|R
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Ensign Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) and Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) are {{returning}} to the Enterprise from the planet Marlonia, but a transporter accident results in them changing into 12-year-old children. Although the four still retain an adult mind, the crew have trouble taking them seriously, and Picard (David Tristan Birkin) is convinced by Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to temporarily relinquish command of the ship. After turning over command of the Enterprise to Commander William Riker, Picard ponders resigning his Starfleet commission, albeit temporarily, in order to pursue other interests. Meanwhile, Keiko (Caroline Junko King) is <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> her husband Miles's (Colm Meaney) reluctance {{to be with her}} and is further saddened her daughter (Hana Hatae) does not recognize her. While Ro (Megan Parlen) is at first upset after being reminded of her unpleasant childhood, once Guinan's (Isis Carmen Jones) enthusiasm causes her to soften, the duo begin jumping on a bed and other childish pursuits.|$|E
5|$|In Mogadishu, Hawiye {{residents}} {{resented the}} Islamic Courts Union's defeat. They distrusted the TFG, {{which was at}} the time dominated by individuals from the Darod clan, believing that it was dedicated to the advancement of Darod interests in lieu of the Hawiye. Additionally, they feared reprisals for massacres committed in 1991 in Mogadishu by Hawiye militants against Darod civilians, and were <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> Ethiopian involvement. Critics of the TFG likewise charged that its federalist platform was part of a plot by the Ethiopian government to keep Somalia weak and divided. During its first few months in the capital, the TFG was initially restricted to key strategic points, with the large northwestern and western suburbs controlled by Hawiye rebels. In March 2007, President Ahmed announced plans to forcibly disarm militias in the city. According to the ISA, a coalition of local insurgents led by Al-Shabaab subsequently launched a wave of attacks against the TFG and Ethiopian troops. The allied forces in return mounted a heavy-handed response.|$|E
50|$|The {{downturn}} in {{relations with the}} US during the 1990s was not totally related to the Tiananmen Square Massacre, but numerous other factors including {{the end of the}} Cold War which made Sino-US cooperation less important or useful. The transition to a de facto unipolar geopolitical landscape and US military actions around the globe, from the Persian Gulf to Haiti to the Balkans, were received with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> Beijing.|$|R

5000|$|These {{plans have}} been met with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> travel journalists, like Tyler Brûlé, who called the {{original}} [...] "a masterpiece" [...] and [...] "one of the most loved modernist hotels in the world".

5|$|The washed-out Test {{resulted}} in a late change to the schedule and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971. Trailing 0–1 in the series, Australia could retain The Ashes by winning this game. Australia's performances were hampered by playing slow, defensive cricket. In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team, the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead. <b>Dismayed</b> <b>by</b> the manner of Lawry's dismissal, Chappell responded with an attacking performance as captain, he won the toss, put England in and dismissed them for 184, and Australia led the first innings by 80 runs, but set 223 to win they folded for 160 and lost The Ashes after holding them for 12 years. Chappell gained some consolation {{at the end of}} a dramatic summer when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield, the team's first win for seven years.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. <b>Dismayed</b> <b>by</b> {{the contrast between}} the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E
5|$|Nelson was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> Spencer's decision, and {{declared}} that he would rather have received no title {{than that of a}} mere barony. He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of Naples, the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and the comforts he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite enjoying his lifestyle in Naples, Nelson began to think of returning to England, but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E
