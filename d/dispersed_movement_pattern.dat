40|$|Abstract. Collective {{phenomena}} and their associated <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> are ubiquitous in everyday life. However, {{even though we}} need to be able to reason about these phenomena, especially their <b>movement</b> <b>patterns,</b> research suggests that we do not currently possess the tools for doing so. Research has been carried out into the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> of particular types of collective but there appears to be no research into the range of different <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> exhibited by collective phenomena as a class. In order to provide such a tool it is crucial that we understand the relation between the different types of collectives and the various <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> that they may exhibit. By means of examples, this paper compares a classification of collectives and a classification of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns.</b> A number of possible links are suggested and the need for a more comprehensive classification of <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> sensitive to the different kinds of collective is highlighted. Such a system could be integrated with the current classification of collective phenomena to form a more comprehensive system that once formalised, may allow the representation of a wide range of collective phenomena within an ontology...|$|R

40|$|Searching moving object {{trajectories of}} video {{databases}} {{has been applied}} to many fields, such as video data analysis, content-based video retrieval, video scene classification. In this paper, we propose a novel representation of trajectories, called <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings, which convert the trajectories into symbolic representations. <b>Movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings encode both the movement direction and the movement distance information of the trajectories. The distances that are computed in a symbolic space are lower bounds of the distances of original trajectory data, which guarantees that no false dismissals will be introduced using <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings to retrieve trajectories. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency, we define a modified frequency distance for frequency vectors that are obtained from <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings to reduce the dimensionality and the computation cost. The experimental results show that using <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> strings is almost as effective as using raw trajectories. In addition, the cost of retrieving similar trajectories can greatly be reduced when the modified frequency distance is used as a filter...|$|R
40|$|Upper limb {{three-dimensional}} movement analysis (UL- 3 DMA) offers {{a reliable and}} valid tool to evaluate <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). However, it remains unknown {{to what extent the}} underlying motor impairments explain deviant <b>movement</b> <b>patterns.</b> Such understanding is key to develop efficient rehabilitation programs. Although UL- 3 DMA {{has been shown to be}} a useful tool to assess <b>movement</b> <b>patterns,</b> it results in a multitude of data, challenging the clinical interpretation and consequently its implementation. UL- 3 DMA reports are often reduced to summary metrics, such as average or peak values per joint. However, these metrics do not take into account the continuous nature of the data or the interdependency between UL joints, and do not provide phase-specific information of the <b>movement</b> <b>pattern.</b> Moreover, summary metrics may not be sensitive enough to estimate the impact of motor impairments. Recently, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was proposed to overcome these problems. We collected UL- 3 DMA of 60 children with uCP and 60 typically developing children during eight functional tasks and evaluated the impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on UL <b>movement</b> <b>patterns.</b> SPM vector field analysis was used to analyze <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> at the level of five joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder, scapula, and trunk). Children with uCP showed deviant <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in all joints during a large percentage of the movement cycle. Spasticity and muscle weakness negatively impacted on UL <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> during all tasks, which resulted in increased wrist flexion, elbow pronation and flexion, increased shoulder external rotation, decreased shoulder elevation with a preference for movement in the frontal plane and increased trunk internal rotation. Scapular position was altered during movement initiation, although scapular movements were not affected by muscle weakness or spasticity. In conclusion, we identified pathological <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in children with uCP and additionally mapped the negative impact of spasticity and muscle weakness on these <b>movement</b> <b>patterns,</b> providing useful insights that will contribute to treatment planning. Last, we also identified a subset of the most relevant tasks for studying UL movements in children with uCP, which will facilitate the interpretation of UL- 3 DMA data and undoubtedly contribute to its clinical implementation...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{determine}} the contributing factors of the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> toward the total distance covered by the football referees during the Malaysia Soccer Cup 2012. Seven (7) of referees who officiated the 2012 Malaysian Cup matches were been chosen into this study. All seven matches from the tournament were recorded using Astro beyond decoder and were coding with SportCode Elite Software on the selected performance indicators (P. I) as main <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> variables. This <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> were categorized as forward walking, forward jogging, forward running, standing, backward walking, backward running and sidestep running. The results analyze the frequency and the total time from the executed <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> for correlation and regression analysis by using the Pearson correlation and linear regression test respectively. The Pearson correlation test have shown that there is significant correlation between three <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> and the total distance covered by the referees which are sidestep(r= 0. 97, p= 0. 000, p< 0. 01), forward walking (r= 0. 930, p= 0. 002, p< 0. 01), and forward running (r= 0. 807, p= 0. 028, p< 0. 05). The linear regression test have shown a positive correlation between contributing factors of the <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> towards the total distance covered by the football referees where the total distance covered result is 132. 161 + 2. 012 (sidestep) – 4. 575 (forward walking) + 0. 570 (forward jogging) – 2. 940 (forward running) + 1. 404 (backward walking) + 3. 328 (backward running). Hence, this study found that <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> that performed by referees are contributed towards the total distance covered by football referees during a match.

Conventional techniques {{for the detection of}} <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> rely on centralized “omniscient ” computing systems that have global access to the trajectories of mobile entities. However, in decentralized spatial information processing systems, exemplified by wireless sensor networks, individual processing units may only have access to local information about other individuals in their immediate spatial vicinity. Where the individuals in such decentralized systems are mobile, {{there is a need to}} be able to detect <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> using collaboration between individuals, each of which possess only partial knowledge of the global system state. This paper presents an algorithm for decentralized detection of the <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> flock, with applications to mobile wireless sensor networks. The algorithm’s reliability is evaluated through testing on simulated trajectories emerging from unconstrained random movement and correlated random walk. ...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{targeting}} of actions {{to reduce the}} spread of invasive alien species relies on understanding the spatial, temporal, and individual variation of movement, in particular related to dispersal. Such patterns may differ between individuals at the invasion front compared to individuals in established and dense populations {{due to differences in}} environmental and ecological conditions such as abundance of conspecifics or sex-specific dispersal affecting the encounter rate of potential mates. We assessed seasonal and diurnal variation in <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> (step length and turning angle) of adult male and female raccoon dog at their invasion front in northern Sweden using data from Global Positioning System (GPS) -marked adult individuals and assessed whether male and female raccoon dog differed in their movement behavior. There were few consistent sex differences in movement. The rate of dispersal was rather similar over the months, suggesting that both male and female raccoon dog disperse during most of the year, but with higher speed during spring and summer. There were diurnal <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> in both sexes with more directional and faster movement during the dark hours. However, the short summer nights may limit such <b>movement</b> <b>patterns,</b> and long-distance displacement was best explained by fine-scale <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> from 18 : 00 to 05 : 00, rather than by <b>movement</b> <b>patterns</b> only from twilight and night. Simulation of dispersing raccoon dogs suggested a higher frequency of male-female encounters that were further away from the source population for the empirical data compared to a scenario with sex differences in <b>movement</b> <b>pattern.</b> The lack of sex differences in <b>movement</b> <b>pattern</b> at the invasion front results in an increased likelihood for reproductive events far from the source population.
