5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> at {{hand that}} something living {{in outer space}} has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into his flesh, then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of life in his body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover what is happening to her husband; Carroon flees and disappears into the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E
5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} {{utility knife}} {{at the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's prints on it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E

25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives.

Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E

It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

25|$|Shakespeare's final plays hark {{back to his}} Elizabethan comedies {{in their}} use of romantic {{situation}} and incident. In these plays, however, the sombre elements that are largely glossed over in the earlier plays are brought to the fore and often rendered dramatically vivid. This change is related to the success of tragicomedies such as Philaster, although the uncertainty of dates makes the nature and direction of the influence unclear. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of the title-page to The Two Noble Kinsmen and from textual analysis it is believed by some editors that Shakespeare ended his career in collaboration with Fletcher, who succeeded him as house playwright for the King's Men. These last plays resemble Fletcher's tragicomedies in their attempt to find a comedic mode capable of dramatising more serious events than had his earlier comedies.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the exact}} {{placement}} of Ornithischia within the dinosaur lineage is a contentious issue. Traditionally, {{the group is}} considered sister to Saurischia (which contains Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha). In the alternative evolutionary hypothesis for dinosaurs that was proposed by Baron, Norman & Barrett in the journal Nature in 2017, Ornithischia as well as Theropoda were grouped together in the clade Ornithoscelida. The work by Baron and colleagues was recently challenged by an international consortium of early dinosaur experts led by Max Langer. However, the data that supported the more traditional placement of Ornithischia, as sister-taxon of Saurischia, was found not to be statistically significant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> that supported the Ornithoscelida hypothesis, in both the study by Langer et al. and the reply to the study by Baron et al.. A further 2017 study found some support for the previously abandoned Phytodinosauria model, which classifies ornithischians together with sauropodomorphs.|$|E

25|$|Most {{countries}} {{provide a}} variety of services to assist homeless people. They often provide food, shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often {{with the help of}} volunteers) or by government departments. These programs may be supported by a government, charities, churches and individual donors. In 1998, a study by Koegel and Schoeni of a homeless population in Los Angeles, California, reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs, and the authors reported being puzzled as to why that was, with the only possible suggestion <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> being that transaction costs were perhaps too high. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans. The HUD-VASH program has shown success in housing many homeless veterans.|$|E
25|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that could}} be gathered, it {{appeared}} Waterhouse and Connolly became lost in a rainstorm and hugged the coast of Baja California southward, thinking they were headed north along the Pacific Coast. They landed safely on the beach about twenty miles north of Bahia de Los Angeles. Their sole chance for survival seemed to be staying with the plane until found. Tortured by heat, thirst, and hunger, they waited seventeen days, but the search never reached that far south. Finally two fishermen came along and took them in a canoe to Bahia de Los Angeles. There the Americans were murdered, apparently for the little money they had. Their bodies, buried in the sand, were discovered {{within a day or}} two by an American geological survey party and rediscovered a week later by an American mining engineer. The news, however, did not reach Rockwell Field until 13 October. Three days later, a Navy ship, USS Aaron Ward, sailed from San Diego with a group of Army officers to recover the bodies.|$|E
25|$|In Adams’ case, {{the court}} did not ignore the {{suggestion}} that he had hastened death and, as Devlin makes clear, he needed to clarify for the jury, and incidentally the medical profession, {{the extent to which the}} law allowed the orthodox doctor to go in easing the passing of the dying. Mahar regards Adam’s statements to Hannam on Mrs Morrell as less about his guilt or innocence than a disconnection between the medical and legal views on assisted dying: Adams never denied giving his patients large doses of opiates, but denied it was murder. This was not simply Adams' idiosyncratic view, as appears <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of Dr. Douthwaite for the prosecution, who accepted that a physician might knowingly give fatal doses of pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill patients, adding it was not his business to say whether it was murder. Devlin’s directions to the jury confirmed that it was a medical issue, not a legal or moral one, whether Adam’s treatment was designed to promote comfort. Devlin’s view was that Adams may have been guilty of mercy killing or even perhaps finishing off a troublesome patient, but was one who cared for his patients to the best of his ability. Adams eased the passing of Mrs Morrell, but his greed brought his motives into question. Mahar notes an editorial in a medical journal following the case suggested that the publicity it caused might hamper medical discretion, but claimed the use of opiates in terminal cases was essential. Adams may be seen as an extreme case in their use, but other doctors also used them to ease the passing.|$|E
