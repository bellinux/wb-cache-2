5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{was married}} to Hipparete, the {{daughter}} of Hipponicus, a wealthy Athenian. His bride brought with her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades' already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she attempted to divorce <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> consorted with courtesans but he dragged her away from her court appearance. She lived with him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son, Alcibiades the Younger. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical attractiveness, {{of which he was}} inordinately vain.|$|E

5|$|In early , Koufax asked Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to trade}} <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wasn't getting enough playing time. By {{the end of}} 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to somebody else if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E

Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will delete the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data blows out the candles seemingly unperturbed.|$|E

Brian is now a miserable, single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> gave her worms.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the {{international}} fantasy series , part of the Highlander franchise, consisted of 22 episodes produced between 1992 and 1993, and began airing on October 3, 1992 in broadcast syndication. Highlander: The Series follows the adventures of Duncan MacLeod, a 400-year-old Immortal who can only die if he is beheaded; conflict inevitably finds <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{is part of the}} Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals have to fight and behead each other until only one is left.

5|$|Although he had {{attained}} {{success as}} a producer, Kanye West aspired to be a rapper, but had struggled to attain a record deal. Record companies ignored <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After {{a series of meetings}} with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal. According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z, West's colleague, later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to}} be a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and held first place until he collided with a barrier after swerving to avoid José María López's crashed car on the 17th lap allowing Sam Bird to move into the lead. Some drivers elected to make pit stops to switch to their second cars with Bird choosing to remain on the circuit until his own stop eight laps later. He had technical problems with his second car and Buemi inherited the first position. Di Grassi was no more than two seconds behind Buemi but was unable to get close enough to challenge <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had to conserve electrical energy usage and Buemi remained the leader for the rest of the race to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E

5|$|Under John, {{the monks}} of Bath became {{known for their}} scholarship, {{although}} he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old. At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's canons of Wells disliked <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings {{as part of the}} movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office. John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} St. Ambrose Hospital {{chief of staff}} Charlotte King (KaDee Strickland) hiding in a supply closet after being raped in her office. Alternative-medicine {{specialist}} Dr. Pete Wilder (Tim Daly) finds and examines her, diagnosing a broken wrist, eye socket and nose and a deep arm laceration, and admits her to the hospital. King lies to Wilder, telling {{him that she was}} injured in a mugging. Wilder calls the police; King attempts to contact her boyfriend, Dr. Cooper Freedman (Paul Adelstein), but cannot reach <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is out drinking with Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) and Dr. Sam Bennett (Taye Diggs). At the police station psychiatrist Sheldon Wallace (Brian Benben) interrogates Lee McHenry (Nicholas Brendon), who was found with blood on his clothes. After nurses photograph King's injuries, Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) realizes that King was raped and offers her a rape kit. During her pelvic examination, King refuses the rape kit and tells Montgomery not to tell anyone else about the rape. Freedman arrives with Shepherd and Bennett, and is surprised at the extent of King's injuries. During the CT scan, King and Shepherd bond over their shared drug addiction when King refuses pain medication. Shepherd admits drinking alcohol again, and King offers to take her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Shepherd sutures King's wounds, which causes King great pain; Freedman feels powerless, unable to protect her.|$|E
