50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together plywood panels {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused plywood panels behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the <b>joining</b> <b>edges</b> and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass {{on the inside of the}} hull.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the determinant of the Laplacian defined on two dimensional regions of various shapes is an essential ingredient in calculating the scattering amplitudes of strings. In lightcone parameterization the regions are rectangular in shape with several slits of different length and location cut parallel to the τ axis of the rectangle.

40|$|Intuitively, many {{wireless}} and sensing applications {{benefit from}} knowledge of network boundaries. Many virtual coordinate constructions {{rely on the}} furthest set of nodes as beacons. Network edges may also bound routing holes in the network, regions of failure due to environmental effects, or indicate {{the need for additional}} deployment. In this paper we solve the edge detection problem locally using a geometric structure called the alpha-shape (αα-shape). For a disc of radius 1 /α 1 /α, the αα-shape consists of nodes (and <b>joining</b> <b>edges)</b> that sit on the boundary of the discs that contain no other nodes in the network. In the simplest terms a node decides it is on a network boundary by asking the following question: "Do I sit on the boundary of a disc of radius 1 /α 1 /α that contains no other nodes in the network?" We show that using only local communications our algorithm is provably correct. Boundary nodes may further participate to reduce unwanted detail. We show via simulation that our algorithm identifies meaningful boundaries even in networks of low-density and non-uniform distribution...|$|E

40|$|Introduction We {{consider}} a simple model of an agent (which {{we call a}} spider) moving between the nodes of a randomly growing web graph. It is presumed that the agent examines the page content of the node for some specific topic. In our model the spider makes a random walk on the existing set of vertices. We compare {{the success of the}} spider on web graphs of two distinct types. For a random graph web graph model, in which new vertices <b>join</b> <b>edges</b> to existing vertices uniformly at random, the expected proportion of unvisited vertices tends to 0. 57. For the comparable copy-based web graph model, in which new vertices <b>join</b> <b>edges</b> to existing vertices proportional to vertex degree, the expected proportion of unvisited vertices tends to 0. 59. A web graph is a sparse connected graph designed to capture some properties of the www. Studies of the graph structure of the www were made by [4] and [7] among others.

40|$|Lens neutral endopeptidase (EC 3. 4. 24. 5) was {{previously}} {{thought to be}} unique to the eye lens. We report here the finding of a neutral endopeptidase, {{in a variety of}} bovine and human tissues, which is very similar both biochemically and immunologically to the lens endopeptidase. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of partially purified enzyme fractions from various bovine tissues shows the characteristic pattern of at least eight bands with Mr values ranging from 24, 000 to 32, 000 which was described for the bovine-lens neutral endopeptidase. The relative activity of the enzyme varies from tissue to tissue with lung having the highest activity. Partially purified enzyme fractions from these tissues cross-react with antiserum raised in rabbit against bovine lens endopeptidase showing apparent identity when examined side by side in Ouchterlony double-diffusion tests. The human enzyme also cross-reacts with the antiserum but when tested by double-diffusion against the bovine enzyme the precipitin lines show spurring at the <b>joining</b> <b>edges</b> indicating a structural difference between the human and the bovine enzymes. It was also found by Western blot experiments, after denaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the enzyme, that the polypeptide components of the human and bovine enzymes show somewhat different banding patterns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Besides {{weldable}} component geometries for the {{high-frequency welding}} process also possible process and system induced activated material reactions during discontinuous high-frequency welding {{are presented in}} this paper. Among others such material reactions can be a locally limited thermal influence on the base metal, defined plastic derformations during the upsetting process as well as grain refinement in the weld seam, comparable to thermomechanical treatment during rolling for increasing strength or ductility. The process versions of discontinuous high-frequency welding Discontinuous high-frequency welding is a pressure-welding process. The process sequence consists of two steps. First, the edges to be joined are simultaneously heated over their entire length to a temperature just below the liquidus temperature by Ohmic resistance heating. After completion of the heating process, the <b>joining</b> <b>edges</b> are mutually upset {{in order to ensure}} positive material bonding. The excellent tolerance compatibility of this welding method results from the mechanical pressure-welding process. Moreover, under some circumstances, oxides which are present in the seam are pinched out into the upset metal which is formed during the upsetting operation. This excess metal must then be removed from the resulting component in an additional operational step...|$|E
