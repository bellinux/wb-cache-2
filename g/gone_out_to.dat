500|$|As the {{fighting}} {{continued into the}} Makthar Valley, Juskalian {{was assigned to the}} 26th Infantry Regiment's headquarters. When attempting {{to save the life of}} a fellow soldier following heavy fighting, he was captured by German troops at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia on January 28. Juskalian described his capture as follows: [...] "One of our intelligence officers had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> check on the situation, and word came back that he'd been wounded and was out there somewhere. So another officer and I went out in a Jeep and found him, but he was dead. Then we came under fire, so we couldn't drag him out of there." [...] After telling the driver to return to the command post, Juskalian investigated the conditions of the other U.S. soldiers. [...] "I thought they were all right because we hadn't heard anything from them, but they'd been overrun by the Germans." [...] Having lost his glasses, Juskalian could not distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50feet (15m) away. The soldiers were Germans and took him prisoner. Juskalian said about his capture, [...] "I was irritated with myself for being so foolhardy, I shouldn't have been there." [...] Juskalian later learned, while still a prisoner of war (POW), that he had been awarded the Silver Star for his rescue attempt. After his first two days of being a POW, he was promoted to major.|$|E
500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because he was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E

2500|$|One such trapper is Pasquinel (Robert Conrad), a French Canadian fur trader who has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Rocky Mountains {{to trade}} for beaver pelts. Pasquinel and Lame Beaver (Michael Ansara) end up confronting {{each other in the}} dead of night, with knives ready. But Pasquinel puts down his blade in an act of trust, and the two become good friends. Lame Beaver comes to see great courage and honor within this white man, and so trades pelts with him for French trinkets. However, the beaver pelts that Pasquinel {{acquired}} from the Arapaho, as well as his remaining trade goods, are stolen by members of the Pawnee tribe. The French trader had felt himself safe after meeting with their chief. He is saved by Cheyenne warriors, and manages to track down the rogue Pawnee just as they are about to trade his pelts. The traders on their keelboat kill the treacherous Pawnee, but also turn on the plucky Pasquinel. [...] He is left for dead on the riverbank.|$|E
