40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{observational}} {{evidence for the}} trans-polar propagation of large-scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) from their nightside source region to the dayside. On 13 February 2001, the 32 m dish of EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) was directing toward the geomagnetic pole at low elevation (30 °) during the interval 06 : 00 – 12 : 00 UT (MLT ≈ UT + 3 h), providing an excellent opportunity to monitor the <b>ionosphere</b> <b>F-region</b> over the polar cap. The TIDs were first detected by the ESR over the dayside north polar cap, propagating equatorward, and were subsequently seen by the mainland UHF radar at auroral latitudes around geomagnetic local noon. The propagation properties of the observed ionization waves suggest {{the presence of a}} moderately large-scale TIDs, propagating across the northern polar cap from the night-time auroral source during substorm conditions. Our results agree with the theoretical simulations by Balthazor and Moffett (1999) in which poleward-propagating large-scale traveling atmospheric disturbances were found to be self-consistently driven by enhancements in auroral heating...|$|E

30|$|Recent {{observations}} of the low-latitude <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> at times near equinox have shown that it varies with a predominant zonal wavenumber-four pattern in a fixed local-time frame. It {{has been shown that}} this pattern corresponds well to the non-migrating diurnal eastward wavenumber-three atmospheric tide (DE 3) at E-region altitudes simulated by the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM). Here we present details of the morphology of the <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> from TIMED GUVI with simultaneous {{observations of}} the non-migrating diurnal tides at E-region altitudes from TIMED SABER. For the case of equinox (March 2002), the correspondence of the SABER and GUVI observations confirms the relationship previously established using the GSWM simulations. There is also a wavenumber-one signature that is present which {{may be related to the}} semi-diurnal westward wavenumber-three, possibly in conjunction with changes in the magnetic field with longitude. During July 2002, when the amplitude of the DE 3 maximizes, the amplitude of the wavenumber-four pattern in the <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> intensifies. There is also evidence of a strong wavenumber-three pattern in the <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere,</b> which can be attributed to the strong diurnal eastward wavenumber-two tide during this period. During January 2003, the amplitude of all non-migrating components observed by SABER are either small or asymmetric and the ionosphere does not display either a wavenumber-three or -four pattern. During both solstice periods, a strong wavenumber-one is seen that is attributed to the offset of the subsolar point and the geomagnetic equator that maximizes at solstice, possibly in conjunction with other geomagnetic effects. During all seasons, significant hemispheric asymmetries in the airglow wavenumber spectra are seen. The combined GUVI and SABER observations presented here demonstrate that the large-scale periodic longitudinal structure of the <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> responds significantly to changes in the forcing by non-migrating diurnal tides at E-region altitudes.|$|R

Observational data from the mesosphere, E-region <b>ionosphere</b> and <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> have been combined with stratospheric data from the ECMWF assimilative operational analysis. Fourier and wavelet techniques have shown that the relationship between planetary wave {{activity at}} different altitudes is complex and during the winter eastward wind regime does not conform to a simple combination of vertical planetary wave propagation and critical filtering. Strong planetary wave activity in the stratosphere can coincide with a complete lack of wave activity at higher altitudes; conversely, there are also times when planetary wave activity in the mesosphere, E-region or F-region has no apparent link to activity in the stratosphere. The latitudinal activity pattern of stratospheric data tentatively suggests that when the stratospheric signatures are intense over a wide range of latitudes, propagation of planetary waves into the mesosphere is less likely than when the stratospheric activity is more latitudinally restricted. It is possible that, on at least one occasion, 16 -day planetary wave activity in the mesosphere may have been ducted to high latitudes from the lower latitude stratosphere. The most consistent feature is that planetary wave activity in the mesosphere is almost always anti-correlated to planetary wave activity in the E-region even though the two are in close physical proximity. The oscillatory critical filtering of vertical gravity wave propagation by planetary waves and the re-generation of the planetary wave component at higher altitudes through subsequent critical filtering or breaking of the gravity waves may provide an explanation for some of these characteristics. Alternatively the nonlinear interaction between planetary waves and tides, indicated in the E-region data, may play a role...|$|R

The results are applied to the <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> with an outer-scale wavenumber of 2 per km (approximately equal to the Fresnel wavenumber) for the power-law variation, and 0. 2 per km for the Gaussian spectral variation.

The only other low-latitude incoherent scatter radar, located at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in Peru, does not have steering capability and therefore cannot provide unambiguous observations of the bottomside electron density disturbances. Recent observational efforts have focused on obtaining information about these waves from their signatures in the total electron content (TEC) measurements (Thampi et al. 2009; Tulasi Ram et al. 2014).

40|$|One of the {{intriguing}} {{features of the}} <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere</b> are anomalous evening enhancements of the electron density over certain mid-latitude sites. The most prominent example of this enhancement is the Weddell Sea Anomaly. Although the evening anomalies have been known for several decades, their generation mechanisms are still under debate and their accurate modeling remains a challenge. In this dissertation, the role of thermospheric neutral winds in the generation of these anomalies is investigated. Thermospheric winds {{play an important role}} in the dynamics of the <b>F-region</b> <b>ionosphere,</b> and, as it will be shown, in the generation of the evening anomalies. However, to date, their reliable estimation remains a challenge. To mitigate this shortcoming, data assimilation models were employed. First, seasonal global maps of F-region peak parameters (NmF 2 and hmF 2) from COSMIC radio occultation measurements were assimilated into the Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements Full Physics (GAIM-FP) model. The model estimates magnetic meridional winds at low and mid-latitudes. GAIM-FP estimated winds were shown to be in good agreement with independent ground-based wind observations. Next, in order to address the role of neutral wind components in the generation of anomalies, a separate, 3 -D physics-based Thermosphere Wind Assimilation Model (TWAM) was developed. TWAM is based on an implicit Kalman filter technique, and combines GAIM-FP magnetic meridional wind data with the equation of motion of the neutral gas to provide the climatology of the thermospheric wind components. The neutral wind components estimated by TWAM were also found to be in close quantitative agreement with independent ground-based wind observations, and were shown to accurately reproduce NmF 2 and hmF 2 over the anomalies. To understand the physical mechanism behind the anomalies, the plasma production, loss, and transport processes were analyzed. It was found that, due to the action of the equatorward wind, the evening density maximum forms at altitudes where the recombination rate is relatively small. It was revealed that at this time and altitude, plasma loss due to transport also weakens. As a consequence, the relative role of solar production increases over the net loss process and the electron density enhancement occurs...|$|R

Evidence is presented for post-midnight uplifts during which the low latitude iono-sphere is lifted by tens of kilometers in mild events and by over a hundred kilometers in severe events.

These maps have been subdivided according to different seasonal and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The variations in the morphology of the vorticity maps with IMF direction match very closely those seen in maps of average FAC intensity (determined using different methods and instrumentation), suggesting that vorticity is a good proxy for FAC in an averaged sense.

The structure functions can also be compared to values predicted by different turbulence models. We find that the limited range of velocity that can be measured by the Halley SuperDARN radar restricts our ability to calculate structure functions.

The third period is included to illustrate the fact that non—thermal plasma frequently exists in the auroral ionosphere: the data, also from the POLAR experiment, cover a three—hour period of typical auroral zone flow and analysis reveals that the ion distribution varies from Maxwellian to the threshold of a toroidal form. I NTRODUCTION The existence of non—thermal plasma in the auroral F—region was predicted theoreticaly by It— Maurice and Schunk, in a remarkable series of papers culminating in their 1979 review pape...|$|R
