500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{used his}} press conference before the match to look ahead to the new season. He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic." [...] He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand.|$|E
60|$|Fanny, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} we'd bitten off {{as big a}} piece of cake as we can chew with any comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know; <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if <b>it</b> was a {{reflection}} of light {{from one of the}} windows at the back there. There it is again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was that a infernal machine?" [...] {{whispered the}} bewildered Jem to the mate. [...] "Why, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> just like one o' them tins o' corned beef." ...|$|R
60|$|The way Tobin put it, it {{did seem}} to corroborate the art of prediction, though <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that these {{accidents}} could happen to any one at Coney without the implication of palmistry.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the jolliest thing that's {{happened}} since we left England. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if the}} sun were breaking through the clouds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if {{you wanted}} making a head shorter. You're a darned sight too fresh. Who {{do you think you}} are, anyway?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{the same}} name, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if this}} Uncle Barney, as they call him, might be some {{relative}} of Ruth's family," [...] said Fred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't kids allowed sardines?" [...] said Steve anxiously. [...] "The guy at {{the store}} {{told me they were}} {{wholesome}} and nourishing. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if that ought to hit young Fitzsimmons about right. What's the matter with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I met the mater and his lordship {{on their}} way to the library, and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very much as if the mater must have got hold of an evening paper on her journey from town. When did she arrive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I want to know," [...] Van Teyl {{continued}} confidentially, [...] "is how you {{get that}} long run on your cleek shots? I saw you play the sixteenth hole, and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as though the ball {{were never going to}} stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say {{for certain}} yet, sir, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if she}} is French. I don't think that the sails are English cut anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the way <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> too," [...] whispered Fred. [...] "They {{must have}} got wind {{in some way}} of our being up around their place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} this," [...] he said. [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I'll {{have to hold}} these Rover {{brothers}} until they can clear themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{he come to}} the grave," [...] {{said our}} conductor, [...] "he showed his cloak beautiful. But, judging from the wing, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that when he see the ghost in the queen's apartment, he might have made more of his stockings." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} at the balcony. There was a face hanging over the red plush rail. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if <b>it</b> had some hidden sorrow. I'd noticed it before, when we were dancing around, and I had {{wondered}} what the trouble was. Now I began to see.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had heard}} {{about some of these}} things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, fellows, {{and see if}} you {{can tell}} what Joe is doing. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if there was a big lot of smoke from the galley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon they're goin' {{to bring}} their siege-guns with 'em this time. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> much as if a big crowd was gatherin' {{in the rear of}} the line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir--it's funny," [...] Ransome {{was evidently}} puzzled. [...] "He hasn't spoken a word, {{and his eyes}} are shut. But <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more like sound sleep than {{anything}} else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely, {{and perhaps}} {{spends more than}} he makes. A good deal of <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like make-believe. There's {{no doubt about the}} claret, but the {{champagne}} was execrable. A man is a criminal to have such stuff handed round to his guests. And there isn't the ring of real gold about the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sank back}} in the chair in fair bewilderment, for I didna ken at that time, as we a' ken now, that she was {{thinking}} o' the earl when I was thinking o' her son. Dominie, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if the Lord had opened a door <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and syne shut it in my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it seemed}} the only job that was going at the moment. I've always done a goodish bit of boxing and I was very fit and so on, and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> rather an opening. Gave <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> get along with. You get paid quite fairly decently, you know, and it's rather a jolly life..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{all these}} fancy dogs ever have {{the matter with}} them. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I might do {{business}} with this man. I'll get his address from Mitchell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, sir; but I {{have come}} to think {{differently}} since then, and now I'm going for a soldier, because <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if the colonists would speedily worst the king." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} our best {{plan would be}} to shoot young Bingo in on him after dinner one night. Melting mood, I mean to say, and all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{a notion}} Gorse'd be mad," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if they}} had it on us, Paret. I didn't see how we could do {{anything}} else but affirm without being too rank. Of course, if he feels that way, and {{you want to make a}} motion for a rehearing, I'll see what can be done." ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not believe}} that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, it lacks force of character, it lacks bitterness. These things all show in the meekness and {{resignation}} of its expression. It would not attack an elephant, I am sure of it. It might not run if it saw one coming, but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a dog that would sit down and pray.|$|R
60|$|After that we fell silent, {{and walked}} slowly back toward Cless's corral. Dick's lips were closed tight, {{and he did not}} look at me. Evidently he did not intend <b>to</b> {{actually}} put <b>me</b> aboard a train, and the time for parting had come. He watered his horses at the trough, and fussed over his pack and fumbled with his saddle-girths. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as though he had not the courage to say goodby.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{goodness}} me!" [...] cried Monica, the smaller, the drier, and {{the more}} wizened of the pair. [...] "What do you call that, Bertha? <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like four batter puddings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither do I; but that's the way <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Must {{be nice to}} {{be where}} there's grass, so's you can {{get up in the}} mornin' an' run 'round in the fields." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Dick, I don't {{take much}} stock in those fellows," [...] was Tom's comment. [...] "They {{are good at}} talking, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if they didn't {{know where they were}} at." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the further}} {{side of the}} {{curtains}} was a room of no great size illumined with lamps of which the light fell upon sculptured walls. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as though <b>it</b> might once have been the inmost court or a sanctuary of some temple, for at its head was a dais upon which once perhaps had stood the shrine or statue of a god. On this dais there was now a couch and on the couch--a goddess! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Luke,' says I, 'as office deputy {{and from}} a law standpoint, <b>it</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like this place is {{properly}} and legally in the jurisdiction of Mojada County, Texas.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Axl Rose {{wrote the}} lyrics while visiting {{a friend in}} Seattle. [...] "It's a big city, {{but at the same}} time, it's still a small city {{compared}} to L.A. and the things that you're gonna learn. It seemed a lot more rural up there. I just wrote how <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> If someone comes to town and they want to find something, they can find whatever they want." [...] Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin summarises the song as [...] "about Hollywood streets; true to life." ...|$|R
