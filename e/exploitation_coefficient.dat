40|$|About 3600 {{specimens}} {{were collected}} by bottom trawl at 15 sampling stations. 24 biometric characters were measured for each specimens at the laboratory [...] Microscopic cross – sections of statolith were used for age determination. Sex determination and fecundity were determined. Population dynamics parameters as well as stock as stock assessment including cohort analysis were estimated using FISAT software. The findings showed that Dorsal Mantle Length (DML) and Body weight (BW) of the Indian squid were 133. 9 ± 0. 78 mm and 99. 61 ± 0. 95 g respectively. Strong correlation was found between these 2 variables (R 2 = 0. 90). The maximum age was 5 years. Relationship between DML and age was highly significantly of p ≤ 0. 05. Overall sex ratio (M: F = 0. 52) was {{significantly different from the}} expected 1 : 1 ratio (p ≤ 0. 05). The ovary weight and nidamental glands weight were 7. 72 ± 0. 0006 g and 3. 07 ± 0. 0003 g respectively. Absolute and relative fecundity of the Indian squid were found to be 122733 ± 30. 87 and 2348 ± 0. 4 respectively. GSI were 14. 35 in April and 8. 63 in July. This squid is therefore a spring spawner. The infinite dorsal mantle length were 258. 62 mm for females, 194. 72 mm for males and 252. 02 for both sexes respectively. For population growth and mortality parameters; K (0. 65 per year for both sexes, 0. 85 per year for males, 0. 65 per year for females); t 0 (0. 24 year for both sexes, 0. 22 year in females, 0. 26 year in male); φ` (2. 30 in both sexes, 2. 47 for males, 2. 37 for females); Z (1. 17 per year for both sexes, 1. 10 per year in females, 1. 39 per year, in males); M (0. 70 per year for both sexes, 0. 90 for males, 0. 67 for females); F(0. 27 per year for both sexes, 0. 27 per year in males, 0. 195 per year in females). <b>Exploitation</b> <b>coefficient</b> were 0. 51 per year for both sexes, 0. 57 per year males and 0. 51 per year females respectively. The results indicates that since the Indian squid is a short live aquatic organism, therefore, the <b>exploitation</b> <b>coefficient</b> could be raised to 0. 7 per year. The analysis showed that total biomass and MSY were 10103. 5 ton and 2576. 4 ton respectively. These findings are the first study of its sort about the Indian squid in the coastal waters of Oman Sea as well as North-West of Indian Ocean...|$|E
3000|$|In 2015, {{the returns}} on assets (ROA) and the returns on equity (ROE) of Tunisian banks were {{respectively}} 1.06 % and 11.07 %. Recently, {{the quality of}} assets of the Tunisian banking sector has been enormously deteriorated. Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans are steadily increasing from 11.3 % in 2011 to 14.5 % in 2015.6 This deterioration is mainly {{due to the lack}} of effective supervisory instruments and rigorous prudential regulation. The majority of all Tunisian banks are small, even compared to banks in African countries. Total assets of all banks is TND 74589.359 million. 7 Total equity is TND 6484.61 million Tunisian dinars 8 showing their low capitalization, as their capital adequacy ratio is 8.69 %. Furthermore, the structure of net banking income 9 shows the significant weight of the interest margin (which represented 54.7 % of net banking income in 2015) compared to the commission margin (which represented 22.5 %). Tunisian banks continue to rely on traditional balance sheet intermediation activities, despite reforms to encourage banks to develop market activities and provide more personalized services to customers. The Tunisian banking sector is also characterized by the deterioration of its <b>exploitation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> 10 In 2015, operating expenses accounted for 49.1 % 11 of net banking income. This high level of expenses is explained by the increase of staff costs, which rose from TND 811.4 million in 2011 to TND 1155.1 million in 2015.12 [...]...|$|E
40|$|The Alto Rio Lerma Irrigation District (ARLID), {{located in}} the state of Guanajuato in Mexico, is an {{agricultural}} area whose sustainability depends partially upon groundwater withdrawal for crop irrigation. Because of high pumping demands and current land-management practices, water levels in the regional groundwater aquifers have declined severely, resulting in aquifer overdraft. The potential adverse consequences of this overdraft cannot be overstated, as the long-term economic viability and environmental integrity of the region is threatened. In order to analyze this economic, environmental, and water use problems in this region, simulation of the agricultural system was performed and associated water use impacts quantified under different management scenarios. Linear programming identified the 12 optimal cropping patterns, and then multi-criteria decision-making methodologies were applied to rank and identify the best cropping pattern (satisficing solution). The GLEAMS model was used to simulate the amounts of water, nitrate, and pesticides in both runoff and percolation for each cropping pattern. In order to quantify the economic and environmental impacts of aquifer overdraft, two attributes were used; pumping costs and an aquifer <b>exploitation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Three multiple criteria methods: Q-analysis, ELECTRE II, and the Range of Value Method, were evaluated and the latter method was selected to analyze the payoff matrix for the ARLID, where 12 alternatives, each with 13 attributes, were considered. The results show the best alternative for effectively balancing environmental with economic considerations was the farming practice, consisting of land leveling, growing vegetables such as red tomato, and controlled groundwater withdrawals to preserve aquifer sustainability. Low water availability does not necessarily reduce farmer's profits, if new water saving alternatives are applied, combined with more profitable crops. Given that ROV method only considers full compensation between objectives, this research contemplate an extension for the nonlinear case in order to assess the whole range of values of the objective function. The final findings suggest that the best methodology was to apply L 1 in the lower levels and then L 2 for the highest level in the hierarchy. In this manner, the partial compensation between objectives is considered and also the decrease in the uncertainty of alternatives selection...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{populations of}} Flagellaria guineensis (Flagellariaceae) from the Eastern Cape (South Africa) {{are subject to}} {{different}} rates of exploitation, as the stems are used for making baskets. The population genetic structure was determined by obtaining, compiling and analyzing isozyme electrophoretic data. Seven populations showed no remarkable difference between heavy and light <b>exploitation.</b> The <b>coefficient</b> of gene differentiation indicated that the among population component of genetic diversity represents 58 % {{of the total population}} component. This indicated restricted gene flow, possibly resulting from a high rate of asexual reproduction...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} environmental–geological {{problems}} {{have been caused by}} over-exploitation of deep groundwater (i. e., confined aquifer water) in the North China Plain. In order to better understand the status of deep groundwater over-exploitation and the resultant environmental–geological problems on a regional scale, the over-exploitation of groundwater has been assessed by way of the groundwater <b>exploitation</b> potential <b>coefficient</b> (i. e., the ratio of exploitable amount of deep groundwater to current exploitation), cumulative land subsidence, and long-term average lowering rate of the groundwater table. There is a good correlation among the results calculated by the different methods. On a regional scale, deep groundwater has been over-exploited and there is no further exploitation potential under the current conditions. The groundwater exploitation degree index takes the exploitation in 2003 as the reference for the calculations, so the results mainly reflect the degree of current groundwater exploitation. The results of over-exploitation of deep groundwater obtained by land subsidence data and long-term average rate of depression of the water table mainly reflect environmental–geological problems caused by exploitation of deep groundwater...|$|R
40|$|From northeastern Eurasia to the Americas, a three-stage {{spread of}} modern humans is {{considered}} through large-scale intermittence (exploitation/ relocation). Conceptually, this work supports intermittence {{as a real}} strategy for colonization of new habitats. For the first stage, northeastern Eurasia travel, we adapt our model to archaeological dates determining the diffusion <b>coefficient</b> (<b>exploitation</b> phase) as D = 299. 44 km 2 /yr and the velocity parameter (relocation phase) as vo = 4. 8944 km/yr. The relative phase weight (≈ 0. 46) between both kinds of motions {{is consistent with a}} moderate biological population rate (r ́ ≈ 0. 0046 /yr). The second stage is related to population fragmentation. The last stage, reaching Alaska, corresponds essentially to relocation (vo ≈ 0. 75 km/yr) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulated}} {{impacts of}} hydroelectric cascade exploitation (HCE) {{on the landscape}} are greater than the simple sum of the impacts from a single dam. The spatial–temporal landscape characteristics resulting from the accumulated impacts of HCE from 1977 to 2006 in Longliu Watershed, {{a part of the}} Yellow River basin, were investigated. In this innovative approach, the FRAGSTATS model was employed to calculate landscape indices, which characterized landscape in term of its fragmentation, shape and diversity. Three fragmentation indicators and four shape indicators were analyzed at patch scale for each land use type in period of 1977 – 2006. The diversity simulators were calculated also at landscape scale. Furthermore, two hydroelectric cascade exploitation indicators, summed dam heights and hydroelectric generator capacities, were used to explore the correlated impact with landscape pattern. The analysis revealed that landscape fragmentation variations are strongly dependent on the magnitude of <b>exploitation.</b> The correlation <b>coefficients</b> ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 95. Except for PAFRAC value of water area, all other shape metric variations were closely linked to the level of HCE and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 5267 to 0. 9514. This study also demonstrated that landscape diversity changes were exponentially related to hydro-exploitation parameters, with correlation coefficients arranging from 0. 7487 to 0. 9856. The correlation analysis also demonstrated that HCE a critical factor determining regional landscape variation. It is concluded that these correlation analysis assist in predicting landscape variation about future HCE. The findings will also be helpful for regional environmental management and for the understanding expected landscape transformations...|$|R
