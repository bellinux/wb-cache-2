There are many areas dedicated to outdoor recreation such as a large soccer area, softball diamond, outdoor basketball court, and a state-of-the art challenge course, with high and low elements. JCC–St. Anthony provides a highly structured, staff-secure program using a [...] model for the custody and treatment of male and female offenders who have a history of various crimes, and have failed in less secure community-based programs and facilities. The JCC–St. Anthony program focuses juveniles on victim and community restoration related to their crimes. The program also offers cognitive skills building to alter their criminal patterns of thought and requires the juveniles to be accountable daily for their behavior and progress through the program. Employees at JCC–St. Anthony are dedicated to helping each of the juveniles that come to the facility. All staff, including all of those who occasionally interact with the juveniles, are trained in the treatment philosophy of the facility and can help the juveniles with their issues. There are many employees who have been employed at the facility for 10 to 25 years, and their experience working with juveniles is invaluable. Staff and juveniles continually work together to create a safe and secure environment that is conducive to making the changes necessary for juveniles to be able to return to their communities with the skills and values that will give them the opportunity to be successful citizens.|$|E
60|$|I {{had started}} a teacher-factory {{and a lot of}} Sunday-schools the first thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded schools in full blast in those places, and also a {{complete}} variety of Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition. Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted to; there was perfect freedom in that matter. But I confined public religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting nothing of it in my other <b>educational</b> <b>buildings.</b> I could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion, angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and, besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power, the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought.|$|E
