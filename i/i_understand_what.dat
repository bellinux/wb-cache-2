500|$|The siege was {{captured}} by Pathé News cameras—one of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film—and it included footage of Churchill in attendance. When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of [...] "shoot him" [...] from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, [...] "He [...] was, I understand, in military phrase, in {{what is known as}} the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now." [...] Jenkins suggests that he went simply because [...] "he could not resist going to see the fun himself".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. And <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E

500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: [...] "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E
500|$|Protests were {{scheduled}} for the film's Italian premiere in Viareggio, Italy, by unspecified organizations. The protesters objected to the plotline of a Partisan collaborating with the Nazis. This runs directly counter to the accepted historical version of events, ruled by an Italian military court in 2005, that the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre was entirely premeditated by the Germans with no reason except the aim to frighten the population.

However, Lee, unrepentant, stated [...] "I am not apologizing." [...] He told Italians there was [...] "a lot about your history you have yet {{to come to grips}} with. This film is our interpretation, and I stand behind it." [...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> it's like for someone to tell your history... unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy is ours as well, and this was the best I could do... it is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill made a {{controversial}} {{visit to the}} Siege of Sidney Street in London. There is some uncertainty {{as to whether he}} attempted to give operational commands, and his presence attracted much criticism. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "he [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the photographer was doing, but what was the right honourable gentleman doing?" [...] Biographer Roy Jenkins suggests that he went simply because [...] "he could not resist going to see the fun himself" [...] and that he did not issue commands. A Metropolitan police history of the event, however, states that it was [...] "a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Artest was to be traded to the Houston Rockets along with Patrick Ewing, Jr. and Sean Singletary for Bobby Jackson, recently drafted forward Donté Greene, a 2009 first-round draft pick, and cash considerations. The deal was made official on August 14, due to Greene's rookie contract signing on July 14. In response to the trade, Yao Ming was generally positive, but jokingly said that [...] "hopefully he's not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands." [...] In response, Artest said, [...] "This is Tracy (McGrady) and Yao's team, you know. I'm {{not going to take it}} personal. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> Yao said, but I'm still ghetto. That's not going to change. I'm never going to change my culture. Yao has played with a lot of black players, but I don't think he's ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as I represent my culture." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill {{arrived at}} the [...] "Siege of Sidney Street" [...] in London. He gave his own account of the {{incident}} in his book Thoughts and Adventures. There is some uncertainty as to whether Churchill attempted to give operational commands. Biographer Roy Jenkins comments that the reason he went was because [...] "he could not resist {{going to see the}} fun himself" [...] and that he did not issue commands. A famous photograph from the time shows Churchill at the scene, peering around a corner to view the gun battle between cornered anarchists and Scots Guards. His role and presence attracted much criticism. The building under siege caught fire, and Churchill supported the decision to deny the fire brigade access, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "He [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the photographer was doing but what was the Right Honourable gentleman doing?" [...] The significance was that the whole highly publicised affair increased Churchill's already incipient reputation for being a frenetic and far-from-calm Home Secretary.|$|E
