40|$|The {{effect of}} a 2 -week period of oral immuno-stimulation {{from the age of}} 2 or 6 weeks post-fertilisation (wpf; before and after {{reaching}} the ability to produce antibodies) onwards was investigated on various immune functions of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio. The <b>immuno-stimulants</b> Aeromonas salmonicida lipopolysaccharide, Yeast DNA (containing unmethylated CpG motifs) or high-M alginate (an extract of algae containing poly-mannuronic acid) were used. The effect of this treatment was studied on the kinetics of B cells in head kidney and peripheral blood leucocytes using flow cytometry, on the total plasma IgM level using ELISA, on cytokine and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in the intestine, and acute phase protein expression in the liver, using real time quantitative PCR, and on exposure to Vibrio anguillarum. Oral administration of <b>immuno-stimulants</b> from 6 wpf resulted in decreased WCI 12 (+) (B) cell percentages in PBL (only after administration of LPS) and head kidney (all test groups), and a decreased total IgM level in plasma, suggesting that suppressive effects are strongly indicative of oral or juvenile tolerance. After administration from 2 wpf, the effects on WCI 12 (+) (B) cell percentages were less pronounced: the group fed with Yeast DNA showed higher percentages compared to the control group at 6 wpf, but lower percentages at 8 wpf. No changes were observed in the cytokine or iNOS expression levels in the intestine or acute phase protein expression in the liver. A challenge with V. anguillarum resulted in an initially higher cumulative mortality in the group fed with LPS, but lower mortality in the groups fed with Yeast DNA or high-M alginate compared to the control group, providing a provisional warning especially for the use of pathogen-derived <b>immuno-stimulants,</b> such as A. salmonicida LPS, in larval and juvenile fish...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of farmed fish has increased considerably {{over the past}} years, and is now providing {{a significant contribution to}} the food market. Mortality however, can be high especially in young fish. The administration of <b>immuno-stimulants</b> via the food can be a sustainable approach especially in young animals because of its uncomplicated use, fast delivery, less stressful entry route and broad-spectrum effect. Extensive knowledge on the ontogeny of the fish immune system is required to facilitate the rational design and selection of <b>immuno-stimulants.</b> In carp ontogeny, innate immune factors are the first components of the immune system to appear. Some mRNA's and proteins were transferred from mother to egg. Moreover, these mRNA's were also produced by the embryo long before hatching (which is at 2 days post fertilisation; dpf), indicating either involvement of these factors in development itself or can be seen more probably as a preparation of the immune system for the post-hatching period. In addition, complement factor 3 (C 3) mRNA production was situated in the yolk syncytial layer in embryos, followed by the liver in larvae, providing a new series of C 3 producing tissues in teleost development. The second group of immune components appearing are the cells and myelopoietic tissues of the innate immune system. The development of myelopoietic tissues is described from the embryonic stage up to the adult situation. In addition, the first appearance of myeloid cells was associated with an immune response at the molecular level: 2 dpf embryos responded to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection with upregulation of a panel of immunological factors and down-regulation of others, implying a functional embryonic innate defence system.    The generation of lymphoid cells during carp development was studied by analysing expression of the recombination activating (rag) genes. Rag was first expressed in the thymus at 4 dpf, while a cortex/medulla differentiation was observed from 7 dpf. Also from 1 week post fertilisation (wpf), rag was also expressed in kidney (together with immunoglobulin heavy chain expression), suggesting B cell recombination in kidney but not in spleen. Rag expression was detected in thymi of animals over 1 year old, but in kidney only at low levels, indicating life-long new formation of putative T cells but severely reduced formation of B cells in older fish. The ontogeny of immune cells was also studied in mucosal organs (intestine, gills, and skin). In addition, rag expression was examined in the intestine to investigate extrathymic generation of lymphocytes. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (putative T cells) appeared in the intestine at 3 dpf, which is shortly after hatching but before feeding, implying an important function at early age. Together with the appearance of these cells before the thymus and rag expression in the intestine, this suggests that alike mammals at least part of these cells were generated in the intestine. Monocytes/macrophages appeared in the lamina propria of the intestine at 7 dpf, while B cells appeared in intestine and gills at 6 - 7 weeks, suggesting a functional mucosal immune system from this age onwards. The effect of a two-week period of oral immuno-stimulation from the age of 2 or 6 weeks (before and after the first ability to produce antibodies) with LPS, yeast DNA or high-M alginate, was studied. Oral administration of <b>immuno-stimulants</b> from 6 wpf suggested suppressive effects consistent with oral or juvenile tolerance. After administration from 2 wpf, the effects were less pronounced. A challenge with Vibrio anguillarum (after oral immuno-stimulation) resulted in an initially higher cumulative mortality in the group fed with LPS, but lower mortality in the groups fed with yeast DNA or high-M alginate compared to the controls, providing a provisional warning for the use of pathogen-derived <b>immuno-stimulants</b> in larval and juvenile fish. In conclusion, this thesis describes the appearance of the main components of the immune system in carp ontogeny, and adds to the knowledge of developmental immunology in teleost fish in general. Moreover, tools and data obtained in this thesis were applied for evaluation of oral immuno-stimulation, paving the way for more efficient {{production of}} this extensively cultured fish species...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of dietary}} supplementation of chitosan-oligosaccharides (COS) {{on the growth}} performance, immune response, stress {{resistance}}, and disease resistance of juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were studied. Four experimental diets containing 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg COS (COS 0, COS 20, COS 40, and COS 60, respectively) were fed to juvenile rainbow trout (initial weight = 5. 2 ± 0. 3 g) for 8 weeks. By {{the end of the}} feeding trial, representative groups of fish from each dietary treatment were challenged with stressor (30 sec air exposure) and pathogen exposure (intraperitoneal injection with Aeromonas hydrophila). Results showed that supplementation of COS in diets did not affect production performance and body composition of rainbow trout. However, fish fed the COS 40 diet demonstrated improved phagocytic activities, respiratory burst activities and decreased serum cortisol level. Additionally, survival following A. hydrophila challenge was significant higher among fish fed the COS-supplemented feeds, although there was no difference based on the level of supplementation. The present study suggests that COS can be used as an <b>immuno-stimulant</b> in rainbow trout feeds [Current Zoology 55 (6) : 416 – 422, 2009]...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract: The health value of honey is universally acknowledged from time immemorial. Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) is a tree, indigenous to New Zealand and South East Australia, {{and from the}} myrtle family, Myrtaceae. The honey produced from its flowers is a uni-floral honey largely produced in New Zealand. It is becoming increasingly popular as a functional food, seen in the aisles of health stores as its displays superior nutritional and phytochemistry profile over other varieties of honey. Examining existing research databases revealed its biological properties ranging from anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-biotic and wound healing to immune-stimulatory properties. Methylglyoxal is the unique compound in the honey responsible for some of its potent anti-microbial properties. Further, propolis another component of honey contains chiefly flavonoids (i. e. galangin, pinocembrin), phenolic acids and their esters that may also contribute to its <b>immuno-stimulant</b> properties. Recent findings of the biological roles have been discussed with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms. The hurdles associated in its development as a functional food and also nutraceutical with future scopes have also been mentioned.

40|$|To further {{investigate}} the potential role of α-tocopherol in maintaining immuno-homeostasis in bovine cells (Madin-Darby bovine kidney epithelial cell line), we undertook in vitro experiments using recombinant TNF-α as an <b>immuno-stimulant</b> to simulate inflammation response in cells {{with or without}} α-tocopherol pre-treatment. Using microarray global-profiling and IPA (Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, Ingenuity® Systems, [URL] data analysis on TNF-α-induced gene perturbation in those cells, we focused on determining whether α-tocopherol treatment of normal bovine cells in a standard cell culture condition can modify cell’s immune response induced by TNF-α challenge. When three datasets were filtered and compared using IPA, there were a total of 1750 genes in all three datasets for comparison, 97 genes were common in all three sets; 615 genes were common {{in at least two}} datasets; there were 261 genes unique in TNF-α challenge, 399 genes were unique in α-tocopherol treatment, and 378 genes were unique in the α-tocopherol plus TNF-α treatment. TNF-α challenge induced significant change in gene expression. Many of those genes induced by TNF-α are related to the cells immune and inflammatory responses. The results of IPA data analysis showed that α-tocopherol-pretreatment of cells modulated cell’s response to TNF-α challenge. In most of the canonical pathways, α-tocopherol pretreatment showed the antagonistic effect against the TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory responses. We concluded that α-tocopherol pre-treatment has a significant antagonistic effect that modulates the cell’s response to the TNF-α challenge by altering the gene expression activities of some important signaling molecules...|$|E

40|$|Abstract As {{some species}} of marine yeasts can colo-nize {{intestine}} of marine animals, {{they can be}} used as probiotics. It has been reported that β-glucans from marine yeast cells can be utilized as <b>immuno-stimulants</b> in marine animals. Some siderophores or killer toxins produced by marine yeasts have ability to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria or kill pathogenic yeasts in marine animals. The virulent factors from marine pathogens can be genetically displayed on marine yeast cells, and the yeast cells displaying the virulent factors can stimulate marine animals to produce specific antibody against the pathogens. Some marine yeast cells are rich in proteins and essential amino acids and can be used in nutrition for marine animals. The marine yeast cells rich in lipid can be used for biodiesel production. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} some strains of Yarrowia lipolytica isolated from marine environments can produce nanoparticles.

40|$|Various mitogenic {{substances}} (concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, polyI : polyC and a phorbol diester), {{as well as}} lipopolysaccharides (LPS or endotoxins), produced hypoglycaemia {{after being}} injected into mice. However, non-mitogenic <b>immuno-stimulants</b> (zymosan, carrageenan, an adjuvant peptide and interferon) did not induce hypoglycaemia. All of the mitogenic substances also induced an increase in 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in liver, but the non-mitogenic substances did not have this effect. The time course {{of the development of}} hypoglycaemia was {{similar to that of the}} increase in liver 5 -HT. The dose-dependence of the hypoglycaemia induced by LPS was similar to that of the increase in liver 5 -HT. In C 3 H/HeJ mice, the macrophages and/or lymphocytes of the mice are known to be less responsive to LPS, and both the LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and increase in 5 -HT were less in these mice than in control mice (C 3 H/He and ddI mice). These results suggest that macrophages and/or lymphocytes may participate in the induction of hypoglycaemia and the increase in 5 -HT induced by mitogenic substances and LPS. A possible correlation between hypoglycaemia and the increase in hepatic 5 -HT is discussed, although the relationship is not substantiated...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Leishmaniasis is {{a disease}} caused by {{intracellular}} protozoa parasites of the genus Leishmania and is endemic {{in some areas of}} Iran. Echinacea purpurea is a native plant from North America {{which is one of the}} most important medical herbs known with <b>immuno-stimulant</b> properties. This study was performed to determine the effect of alcoholic extract of Echinacea purpurea on prophylaxis and treatment of Leishmania cutaneous lesions. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study which was conducted at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in 2009, eighteen mice were divided into 3 groups. Group one received Echinacea purpurea extract (200 mg/ml) in their water, for 2 weeks before parasite injection, while group two were first injected with parasite amastigotes, followed by administration of Echinacea purpurea extract for 2 weeks. Group three was the control group, which received parasites, but not the extract. The size of Leishmania lesions in the tail base, right and left foot were measured with vernier caliper. The lesion areas were calculated and the collected data were analyzed with SPSS software. Results: The mean of lesion size in each group of mice were compared and analyzed. No significant differences in the lesions size were found between the three mice groups. Therefore, Echinacea purpurea extract was not effective against Leishmania major based on the findings of this study. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Echinacea extract is not effective in treatment or prophylaxis of leishmaniasis in mice.

40|$|Three {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of dietary <b>immuno-stimulant</b> supplementation on various physiological, haematological and immunological parameters of ornamental fish following stress and vaccination. The first series of experiments investigated the mucosal stress response of mirror carp, (Cyprinus carpio), using urinalysis strips and established stress indicators within peripheral blood. A netting stressor, which combined aerial exposure and confinement, of 6 minutes duration was applied and the response of fish was measured 1. 5, 3, 5, 24 and 168 hours post-stress. Mucosal haemoglobin and protein were established as consistent indicators of stress and strong relationships could be drawn between them and plasma glucose concentration and peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes counts, firmly establishing them as secondary stress indicators. Visual assessment of the strips was found to overestimate mucosal parameters compared to results obtained using instrument based analysis, but the underlying changes were similar. Further experiments conducted on goldfish, (Carassius auratus), and tilapia, (Oreochromis niloticus x. 0. mossambicus), showed that the mucosal response to stress was conserved between fish species. The second trial investigated the potential of dietary immuno-stimulants to modify the immune status of fish and their response to stress. Fish were fed either a control, beta-glucan (0. 2 % w/w), nucleotide (0. 2 % w/w) or combined supplement (0. 2 % beta-glucan + 0. 2 % nucleotide) diet for 3 weeks at 1 % BW. dˉ¹ {{and then to the}} same stressors as used in Trial 1. Significant stress-induced changes in mucosal protein (p = 0. 006), plasma glucose (p = < 0. 004) and protein concentration (p = < 0. 003), peripheral lymphocytes (p = 0. 001) and monocytes (p = < 0. 001) and blood NBT reduction (p = < 0. 001) were observed. Fish fed diets containing immuno-stimulants shower a quicker recovery from the stress-induced hyperglycaemic response than those fed the control diet. Fish that received the beta-glucan diets showed lower blood NBT reduction immediately post-stress than all other diets. The final trial investigated the effects of the control, beta-glucan and combined-supplement diet on the response of fish to vaccination. Fish were fed the diets for 2 weeks prior to and 1 week following IP vaccination against Aeromonas salmonicida at 1. 0 % BW. dˉ¹. The immune response was measured every 2 weeks for 12 weeks following vaccination. Vaccination induced a significant stress response as seen by a large hyperglycaemic response (p = < 0. 05). Significant reductions in peripheral monocyte count were seen following vaccination (p = < 0. 04). All groups showed elevated NBT reduction at 4 weeks post-vaccination. Serum lysozyme activity showed evidence of long term immuno-suppression following vaccination. No clear effect of the immuno-stimulating diets could be found on any of the physiological or immune parameters tested. The trials conducted found that ornamental fish have a well developed mucosal stress response and this {{can be used to make}} inferences about the stress state of fish. The effects of beta-glucans and nucleotides on either the response to stress and immune status were subtle. The nucleotide supplement appeared most effective at reducing the effects of stress, whilst beta-glucans may exert more influence on the immune parameters tested. However, no evidence of synergy between the two types of <b>immuno-stimulant</b> was found in fish fed both immuno-stimulants together. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidant enzymes play {{important}} roles in antioxidant responses caused by metabolic process or pathogen invasion. In many organisms, {{it has been reported}} that antioxidant enzymes participate in their innate immune defense against <b>immuno-stimulant</b> challenges such as β-glucan and sulfated polysaccharide, LPS or viruses. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1) is one of these key enzymes, highly conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, involved in scavenging superoxide radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. However, little is known about the responses of antioxidant enzymes like Cu,Zn SOD in tunicates after exposure to environmental changes in heavy metal concentrations. The present research focuses on structural and functional studies of the Cu,Zn SOD gene in the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis. The gene sequence has been identified in GenBank and the amino acid sequence of the codified protein has been compared with those deduced from orthologous genes in other metazoans, both vertebrates and invertebrates, to determine if the amino acids important for catalytic activity were conserved and whether the enzyme of C. intestinalis acquired special features, relatively to the primary sequence, during its evolution. The in silico analysis was extended to the promoter regions for the presence of regulatory sequences such as antioxidant response elements (ARE), metal response elements (MRE) and xenobiotic response elements (XRE). The available sequences were used for cladistic studies, providing some interesting inference on the molecular evolution of the C. intestinalis protein. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique, Cu,Zn SOD gene expression have been evaluated as a function of exposure to three different metals (Cd, Zn and Cu). For this purpose, specimens of C. intestinalis were divided into three experimental groups, which were exposed for 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h at equimolar concentrations (10 μM) of single metal. Untreated specimens were used as controls. Cu,Zn SOD is mainly induced by Cu and Zn, metals that are components of the active site. Besides, it was provided an initial estimation on the localization of expression by in situ hybridization.

40|$|Encapsulation of {{cytotoxic}} or labile drugs enables targeted {{delivery and}} sustained release kinetics {{that are not}} available with intravenous injection. A new liquid-liquid diffusion process has been developed for forming unique microcapsules that contain both aqueous and hydrocarbon soluble drugs. Microgravity experiments, on sounding rockets (1989 - 92) and Shuttle missions STS- 52 (1992) and STS- 56 (1993) using an automated Materials Dispersion Apparatus, produced multi-lamellar microcapsules containing both Cis-platinum (anti-tumor drug) and iodinated poppy seed oil (a radiocontrast medium), surrounded by a polyglyceride skin. Microcapsules formed with amoxicillin (antibiotic) or urokinase (a clot dissolving enzyme), co-encapsulated with IPO, are still intact after two years. Microcapsules were formed with the drug so concentrated that crystals formed inside. Multi-layered microspheres, with both hydrophobic drug compartments, can enable diffusion of complementary drugs from the same microcapsule, e. g. antibiotics and <b>immuno-stimulants</b> to treat resistant infections or multiple fibrinolytic drugs to dissolve emboli. Co-encapsulation of enough radio-contrast medium enables oncologists to monitor the delivery of anti-tumor microcapsules to target tumors using computerized tomography and radiography that would track the distribution of microcapsules after release from the intra-arterial catheter. These microcapsules could have important applications in chemotheraphy of certain liver, kidney, brain and other tumors...|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{ornaments}} might reliably {{indicate the}} {{ability to cope with}} parasites and diseases, and a better ability to mount a primary inflammatory response to a novel challenge. Carotenoid-based ornaments are amongst the commonest sexual signals of birds and often influence mate choice. Because carotenoids are <b>immuno-stimulants,</b> signallers may trade-off allocating these to ornamental colouration or using them for immune responses, so carotenoid-based ornaments might be particularly useful as honest indicators of immuno-compentence. Tetraonid birds, such as the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, exhibit supra-orbital yellow–red combs, a conspicuous ornament which functions in intra- and inter-sexual selection. The colour of combs is due to epidermal pigmentation by carotenoids, while their size is testosterone-dependent. In this study, I investigated whether comb characteristics, and in particular, comb colour, indicated immuno-competence in free-living male red grouse. I assessed T-cell-mediated immunity using a standardised challenge with phytohaemagglutinin. Red grouse combs reflect in the red and in the ultraviolet spectrum of light, which is not visible to humans but that grouse most likely see, so I measured comb colour across the whole bird visible spectrum (300 – 700 nm) using a reflectance spectrometer. I found that males with bigger and redder combs, but with less ultraviolet reflectance, had greater T-cell-mediated immune response. Comb colour predicted T-cell-mediated immune response better than comb size, indicating that the carotenoid-based colouration of this ornament might reliably signal this aspect of male quality...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} global healthcare problem infecting 180 million people worldwide. Infection persists in 80 % of patients and is thought to result from a failure to sustain an immune response to HCV. Current treatment with ribavirn and PEG-IFN? leads to a sustained viral clearance in 40 - 80 % of patients. Despite its use for many years, the exact mechanisms of actions of ribavirin are poorly understood. These current treatments are poorly tolerated by many and therefore newer and more effective treatments are being investigated. This thesis investigated how current and novel treatments were able to modulate the immune response looking at effects on the innate immune response including dendritic cells and NK cells {{and their ability to}} stimulate T cells and the adaptive immune response. The aim of the work described in chapter 3 was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of ribavirin on dendritic cell (DC) function. The results obtained suggest that ribavirin is able to modulate cytokine production from dendritic cells in response to maturation stimuli, in particular suppressing the production of IFN? from pDCS from both CHC and NHD patients but also TNF?, IL 8 and IL 10. In MoDCs from NHDs, ribavirin decreased CD 40 L-induced TNF? production but had no effect on other cytokines tested or on DC phenotype. These findings explain possible reasons behind the failure of monotherapy and dependence on co-administration of IFN? in treatment regimens. The aim of the work in chapters 4 and 5 was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of two novel treatments, a novel helminth protein, rOv-ASP- 1 and a TLR 7 agonist, SM- 360320. rOv-ASP- 1 showed evidence of DC phenotypic maturation, based on up-regulation of phenotypic markers (CD 40, HLA-DR, CD 83 and CD 86) and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF?). It was also shown to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic CD 4 + T cells suggesting that the protein is able to enhance the accessory/antigen presentation by DCs. These findings suggest that this novel protein may be used as an effective <b>immuno-stimulant</b> to boost antigen specific responses or as a vaccine adjuvant. SM- 360320 was shown to enhance viral clearance and immune modulation with induction of 2 ’ 5 ’OAS gene expression, inhibition of replication of HCV replicons in Huh 7 cells, enhanced secretion of anti-viral and pro-inflammatory cytokines, up-regulation of NK cell activation. These findings suggest that SM- 360320 might provide complementary and additional mechanisms of action to current HCV therapies making it a promising novel treatment. Further investigation of these compounds is therefore warranted due to their potential widespread application in treating infectious diseases and immune mediated condition...|$|E

Studies {{focused on the}} refinement of broodstock and seed production techniques to improve egg and larval production {{as well as to}} eliminate morphological deformities in hatchery-bred fry. A verification study with former shrimp hatchery operators demonstrated the technical and economic viability of the AQD-generated milkfish hatchery technology. Production and efficiency of semi-intensive grow-out in ponds were enhanced by the use of formulated feeds and appropriate feeding scheme. Milkfish farming in the Philippines was critically reviewed and recommendations to sustain milkfish culture production were made. Tobacco dust and metaldehyde formulation were proposed as alternatives to organotin-based pesticides in controlling the population of pond snail. The growth hormone of milkfish has been isolated and purified. Addition of highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) -rich oils in the diet did not improve the quality of spawned eggs of grouper Epinephelus coioides. A protocol for the intensive larval rearing of grouper was developed {{based on the results of}} several studies. A semi-intensive seed production method using copepod nauplii during the early feeding stages was also developed as an alternative to intensive method. Metamorphosis of larvae was significantly accelerated by exogenous thyroid hormones. Nutritional studies to reduce the amount of fish meal in grouper diets are in progress. Groupers grown in ponds or cages harbor a variety of parasites. Biochemical criteria to assess the quality of spawned Asian sea bass Lates calcarifer eggs was characterized. Diaphanosoma or other copepods may be an alternative or supplemental live prey to Artemia during sea bass larviculture. A practical diet for sea bass culture was developed.

These negative impacts on cod, particularly juveniles, by L. branchialis {{have the potential to}} adversely affect cod aquaculture in the future, and already vulnerable wild cod stocks. This PhD project therefore, investigated the immune response of wild haddock and cultured-cod post-infection by L. branchialis, and the possible mechanisms by which the parasite modulates / evades the host’s immune response. The systemic immune response of both wild haddock and cultured-cod post-infection by L. branchialis depended on the maturation stage of the parasite, and in the former host species, upon the infection intensity. Wild haddock harbouring fully metamorphosed females showed an increase in circulating thrombocytes and a decrease in serum protein levels however; if multiple mature L. branchialis were present the haddock possessed reduced circulating monocytes, and increased circulating thrombocytes and serum anti-trypsin activity. Infection by L. branchialis was also associated with a suppressive effect on haddock serum spontaneous haemolytic activity. These responses were thought to be due to the host trying to counteract the increased damage caused by the massive increase in size and the feeding of the mature parasite, which is more pronounced when multiple parasites are present, resulting in the increase in some parameters and the ‘consumption’ of others. However, the effect of parasite-derived secretions and other pathogens due to observations on wild fish could not be discounted. The laboratory-infection of cultured-cod from two different sources was also performed in order to study the immune response over time. The two groups of cod showed differences in their immune response to L. branchialis. The first group showed suppressed respiratory burst activity of phagocytes, as the parasite reached the early penella sub-stage, whilst no suppression in phagocyte respiratory burst activity was found in the second group. The parasite was found to migrate along the afferent branchial artery of the cod where a thrombus formed and was present throughout its migration into the ventral aorta. At 14 d post-infection, leukocytes expressing Interleukin 8 mRNA were observed within the free-flowing blood at the periphery of the organising thrombus within the lumen of the ventral aorta. This was speculated to aid the recruitment and activation of leukocytes to the site, and the maturation and neovascularisation of granulation tissue. The infection of the second group subsided with the death of the parasite, and none of the parasites metamorphosed past the early penella sub-stage. The live parasites infecting the first group of cod did not possess IgM or complement component C 3 binding on their cuticle, however, both IgM and C 3 binding occurred on the dead parasites in the second infection trial. This may highlight the importance of these opsonins and the cytotoxic effect of phagocytes in the elimination of L. branchialis by some cod. However, the first infection was terminated as the parasite reached the early penella sub-stage due to a loss of stock cod prior to the study, so the long-term success of the infection can not be concluded. Therefore, the immune response to infection needs to be determined over the entire metamorphosis of L. branchialis to determine whether the infection was successful or not, and preferably in populations with varying susceptibility to L. branchialis. This will not be possible without further studies into the resistance of different stocks of cultured-cod. Many arthropod parasites, such as ticks and salmon lice, have been previously documented to produce pharmacologically active secretions, aiding host invasion and parasite feeding, preventing the host immune response from working effectively against the parasite, all aimed at improving survival of the parasite. Therefore, the effects of the secretory/excretory products (SEPs) produced during the initial infective stage and by the mature, fully metamorphosed female on the immune response of cultured-cod in vitro, and the location of exocrine glands associated with the oral region of the parasite were investigated. The SEPs from the infective stage of the parasite were found not to affect the intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) production of phagocytes. The practical difficulties in collecting large quantities of the SEPs from the infective stage meant that their effects could not be tested on the other host immune parameters studied. The SEPs from fully metamorphosed female L. branchialis, however, had a number of suppressive effects on the host immune response in vitro including: 1) suppression of the intracellular production of cytotoxic H 2 O 2 during the respiratory burst of phagocytic leukocytes post-PMA stimulation, 2) suppression of the production of macrophage activating factor by leukocytes with a priming effect on naïve phagocyte function, and 3) suppression of the chemo-attraction ‘power’ of zymosan activated cod serum, i. e. anaphylatoxin activity, on head kidney-derived leukocytes. These effects were dose-dependent, and highlight the capacity of L. branchialis to suppress its host’s innate immune response at the local feeding area. Further work is required to establish the mechanisms by which the parasite-derived SEPs suppress these host immune parameters, and to identify which molecules produced by the parasite are responsible. The correlation between these in vitro results, and systemic immune parameters measured from laboratory-infected Atlantic cod and wild infected haddock are discussed. Host immuno-modulation by other arthropod parasites is mediated by pharmacologically active secretions produced by exocrine glands. Therefore, the exocrine glands of the infective and fully metamorphosed female L. branchialis were also investigated in order to identify those that might be responsible for the secretion of host-modifying products. Adult female exocrine glands were mapped using diaminobenzidine (DAB), most commonly known to stain peroxidases and catalases. These compounds are known {{to be involved in the}} neutralisation of harmful free radicals which are released during the respiratory burst and tissue damage. Such products may therefore be important protective secretory components at the site of feeding / infection. Exocrine glands were located in the infective stage associated with the oral region, one pair termed the anterior gland complex (AGC), and the other pair extending either side of the oral cone termed the circum-oral glands (CG). These were further investigated using light microscopy and transmission electron microcopy. The AGC and CGs possessed multi-component secretions and they possessed secretory vesicles, abundant and highly active rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus suggesting that protein is an important component of the secretory products. These glands were also observed in the fully metamorphosed females where they had increased in size within the cephalothorax post-metamorphosis. It is hoped that the identification of these glandular structures, which are thought to secrete within the local vicinity of the oral cone, will aid future studies regarding the identification and secretion kinetics of parasite-derived molecules during the infection and feeding process. These studies together with the investigation of the immune response to infection in this thesis have shed more light on the interactions between this host and parasite, which will lay the foundation for further research which could eventually lead to the development of targeted control measures. This could include research into vaccine development against parasite-derived compounds involved in the modulation of the host’s immune response and important for parasite survival, or the investigation of the use of <b>immuno-stimulants</b> to counteract the host immunosuppression experienced during infection by L. branchialis...|$|R
