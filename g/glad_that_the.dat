Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ball went between his legs and that his hands were not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E

Famitsu praised the game's graphics, while Edge admired the art style and monster design, and was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hardware limitations faced by The 4 Heroes of Light were {{not present in}} Bravely Default. Marchiafava called the graphics [...] "beautiful" [...] and praised the soundtrack, though called the English voice acting [...] "hit or miss". Fuller was less impressed by the visuals, but found the music to be excellent [...] Halestorm, while {{he did not think}} the graphics were the best to be found on the 3DS, praised their stylized appearance and the well-executed 3D effect, and called the soundtrack [...] "downright hypnotizing". Nair praised the game's audio despite little variety in the musical score, and called its visuals [...] "gorgeous". Evens praised the character art for its [...] "simple and striking" [...] appearance, and its stylized background artwork. Riendeau commented that the game's aesthetic kept her invested when the story failed to do so. Parkin referred to the background artwork as [...] "like nothing else".

However, many of the workers are dismayed to learn {{just how much of}} their activities have been recorded; for instance, Dwight and Angela's affair that occurred a year ago was captured. Several excuse themselves and go to the warehouse to talk, turning off their microphones in an unsuccessful effort to keep the discussion private. [...] Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) suggests that Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) talk to dismissed crew member Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) to learn more. At Brian's house, Pam tells him that upon seeing the old footage she thinks Jim's feelings for her have largely faded, and Brian agrees. When she asks about what the crew filmed, he tells her that every important moment was captured even when not wearing their microphones. Realizing the extent to which their privacy has been violated, Pam storms out of Brian's house. On re-watching the promo, Pam decides she is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> history of her relationship with Jim has been captured.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} invoked {{responses from}} some {{cast and crew}} members from the series. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the BBC was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> episode provoked debate, and the producers would adequately defend the episode from their research into making the story. That said Neame was also surprised {{by some of the}} responses, rationalising that those responders did not understand the context, and that it was not intended to offend anybody. Stephen Garrett, the director of Kudos Film and Television, the producer of Spooks agreed, further stating that the episode [...] "deals with very real stuff that's happening in the world. It touches nerves on a regular basis, and deals with uncomfortable truths." [...] Brenton meanwhile stated that [...] "people are free to make what they want of drama," [...] and believed the audience did not like the villains as they portrayed something disturbing in their culture, religion, world or profession. Oyelowo had said that the episode did not say that all Muslims are terrorists, only that some fanatics can give [...] "millions of good people a bad name." [...] The actor also believed that the Muslims who were [...] "up in arms" [...] about the story did not see the episode, but merely heard the basis of the plot and did not consider the Muslims in the episode who tried to stop the antagonists.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. De Ferran stated that: [...] "I think first of all, I'd {{like to say that}} we're still running under {{a little bit of a}} cloud with all of the things that happened in the U.S. last week and what happened to (Alex) Zanardi is still in all of our minds." [...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event.

500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E
500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the harder it is for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E
500|$|The Terrible Towel is {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} first [...] "rally towel"; its popularity has spawned similar traditions for other teams. Fans of the Minnesota Twins cheer {{the team with the}} [...] "Homer Hanky" [...] during the playoffs. The Philadelphia Phillies have distributed white towels to fans during home games. During a 2006 playoff game against the Steelers, the Indianapolis Colts handed out blue towels to rally fans, however, Pittsburgh {{went on to win the}} game. In a 2000 preseason game, played in Mexico City, many fans that filled the 100,000 seat Aztec Stadium waved towels. Cope, <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allegheny Valley School would receive a sizable donation from the proceeds, was later disappointed to learn the towels waved by the fans were [...] "knockoffs" [...] made by local artists, and therefore no proceeds would go to the school. In 2008, the NFL approved a white towel entitled the Trophy Towel, which will be sold to fans and given to the winning team of Super Bowl XLIII. Members of the Steelers criticized the idea, broadcaster Bill Hillgrove—who worked with Cope—called the idea [...] "a cheap imitation." [...] Steelers player Aaron Smith stated, [...] "It started here, so why would anyone else want to have a towel? Why not kazoos?" [...] During the 2010 Memorial Cup the host committee made up 8,000 yellow towels to represent the host team, the Brandon Wheat Kings, who played the Moncton Wildcats. Many fans brought the towels back for games after that. [...] Waving white rally towels has the unfortunate distinction of resembling surrender by waving a white flag (citation needed).|$|E

500|$|... "The Purple Piano Project" [...] {{was given}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews by critics. Jenna Mullins of E! Online called it [...] "a perfect season-starter of an episode". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon appreciated that it tackled {{some of the}} show's biggest problems, such as the surfeit of central characters and their previously un-addressed ages. He was particularly pleased that the episode focussed on typical high school life, rather than the adult characters or more serious issues. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle approved of the [...] "clear trajectory" [...] {{set out for the}} characters, and noted that he looked forward to seeing their various storylines develop. Though AOLTV Crystal Bell worried that clarfiying the teenagers' ages could result in the younger characters being overlooked in future episodes, she was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> premiere saw the show return to its roots: [...] "underdogs, show tunes and Sue Sylvester". A similar sentiment was expressed by Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times, who was hopeful that renewed focus on the core characters would lead to [...] "a great year". The Huffington Post Amy Lee observed that [...] "Glee has a tendency to oscillate between sappy and nasty, sometimes without any warning", and then noted that [...] "The Purple Piano Project" [...] was more tonally balanced than the majority of the second season. Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times deemed the episode [...] "admirably straightforward", unmarred by the sentimentality and inconsistencies which plagued previous episodes. His praised was tempered, however, and he wrote, [...] "I wouldn't {{go so far as to}} call the episode good, it was oddly lifeless and the stakes seemed almost nonexistent at times. It has the feel of a show rediscovering itself, but, all things considered, Ryan Murphy and Co. handled the task relatively well." ...|$|E
500|$|After Gilly {{eventually}} {{starts a}} relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E
