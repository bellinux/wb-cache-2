Data are taken from the Minorities at Risk Organizational Behavior (MAROB) project, covering 118 organizations in 13 countries of the Middle East and North Africa over the 1980 - 2004 period. The multinomial logit models combine group- and country-specific information and show that ethno-political groups are more likely to resort to rebellion rather than using non-violent means or becoming terrorists when representing regions rich in oil. This effect is enhanced for groups already enjoying regional autonomy or being supported by a foreign state but can be mitigated by power sharing arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Endpoint detection, which <b>means</b> <b>distinguishing</b> {{speech and}} non-speech segments, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} key preprocessing operations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Usually the energy of speech signal and Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), are used to locate the beginning and ending for an utterance. Both of these methods {{have been shown to be}} effective for endpoint detection. However, especially in a high noise environment they fail. In this paper, we integrate the modified Teager approach with the Energy-Entropy Features. In our new algorithm, the Teager Energy is used to determine crude endpoints, and the Energy-Entropy Features are used to make the final decision. The advantage of this method is that there is no need to estimate the background noise. Therefore, it is very helpful for environments when the beginning or ending noise is very strong or there is not enough “silence” at the beginning or at the end of the utterance. Experimental results on Farsi speech show that the accuracy of this algorithm is quite satisfactory and acceptable for speech endpoints detection...|$|R

One faction defied the usual tradition of male leaders and acknowledged the female, Mmakau, as their kgosi. Those who supported Kgafela then broke away. Further offshoot from the Bakgatla are the Bakgatla ba Mmanaana, Bakgatla ba Mmakau and Bakgatla ba Motsha who all have the kgabo as their totem. The Bakgatla ba Mmakau would later give rise to Bapedi, Makgolokwe, Batlokwa, Baphuti and Basia clans [...] If a dispute was to arise between any of the offshoot clans like the Basia and Baphiti then the Mmakau chief would be tasked with resolving it as their senior ...|$|R

The model formalizes the hypothesis development of the main paper and helps to clarify the more subtle predictions such as {{the conditions under which}} the preference of overconfident CEOs for debt over equity are reversed. We define overconfidence as the overestimation of mean future cash flows. The emphasis on the <b>mean</b> <b>distinguishes</b> our approach from previous theoretical literature on overconfidence. Hackbarth (forthcoming) models the underestimation of variance to generate different capital structure implications. Heaton (2002) models an upward shift in the probability of the good (high cash flow) state, which does not disentangle which theoretcial results are generated by the implied bias in means and which by the implied bias in variance. Relatedly, one theoretical contribution of our paper lies in showing that the overestimation of cash flows in non-default states (i. e. overvaluation of the residual claim) generates a preference between risky debt and equity. The modeling approach of Heaton (shift in probabilities) does not allow for this mechanism. We abstrac...|$|R
