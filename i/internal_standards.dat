25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority.

25|$|Experiments using iTRAQ {{labeling}} and LC-MS/MS with STEP and PSP peptide <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> {{have successfully}} quantified total and active protease levels in biological samples. One major drawback {{for this approach}} is the inability to account for inhibitor bound enzymes. It is also difficult to ensure standard peptides can be generated for this method for each and every protease for study. However, PSPs hold large potential for translating degradomics into clinical applications, as once a PSP is established it could aid in quantifying proteolytic signature biomarkers in Single Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) type clinical assays.|$|E
50|$|In {{experiments}} comprising several gels, {{a common}} technique is {{to include an}} <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> in each gel. The <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> is prepared by mixing together several {{or all of the}} samples in the experiment. This allows the measurement of the abundance of a protein in each sample relative to the <b>internal</b> <b>standard.</b> Since the amounts of each protein in the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> is known to be the same in every gel, this method reduces inter-gel variation.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{is added}} at a known {{concentration}} directly to an analytical sample {{to aid in}} quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> as a calibrant. An ideal <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> is isotopically-enriched analyte which {{gives rise to the}} method of isotope dilution.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{system has}} been {{developed}} for a mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source. The {{system has been}} used to overcome sensitivity drift problems that are commonly encountered when the spectrometer is used for long-term environmental monitoring. Additionally, the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{has been used to}} correct sensitivity changes induced by the matrix being analyzed. Principal components of the system are a low concentration <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> source and a flow-delivery system for introducing the standard to the reagent gas delivery stream of the spectrometer. Following an experiment, real-time data are downloaded to a personal computer where <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> correction and data analysis are performed. Application of the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> to the measurement of nicotine and pyridine is demonstrated...|$|R
25|$|PSPs do {{not depend}} on {{targeting}} active proteases with tagged compounds but rather on quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeled standard peptides. Standard peptides synthesized from amino acids labeled with stable isotope atoms serve as <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> for serial dilutions of a sample. These allow for later absolute quantification of a proteins and post-translational modifications by mass spectrometry. This technique has been adapted to absolute quantification of proteases, deciphering both activity states and total amounts in biological samples. This is thanks to trypsin treatment for mass spectrometry generating peptides specific to inactive zymogen precursors, active proteases, or common to both forms. PSPs is one form of standard peptide for absolute quantification and Standard of the Expressed Protease (STEP) is the other. The major {{difference between the two}} is PSP sequences are designed to mimic tryptic peptides that contain sequences spanning the zymogen’s pro-domain and the protease’s final form, whereas STEP sequences match tryptic peptide sequences found in both forms of the protease. This capitalizes on protease activation, where the zymogen’s pro-domain is cleaved off and the final form lacks that domain. Experiments using iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS with STEP and PSP peptide <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> have successfully quantified total and active protease levels in biological samples. One major drawback for this approach is the inability to account for inhibitor bound enzymes. It is also difficult to ensure standard peptides can be generated for this method for each and every protease for study.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} {{because of the}} complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E
2500|$|Upper middle-class manners tend {{to require}} {{individuals}} {{to engage in}} conversational discourse with rather distant associates and to abstain from sharing excessive personal information. This contradicts working-class speech patterns, which often include frequent mentions of one's personal life. Further research also suggests that working-class parents emphasize conformity, traditional gender roles, and the adherence to external standards in their children, such as being neat and clean and [...] " [...] in strict leadership". This contrasted with professional-class households, where gender roles were more egalitarian and loosely defined. Upper middle class children were largely taught to adhere to <b>internal</b> <b>standards,</b> with curiosity, individuality, self-direction, and openness to new ideas being emphasized.|$|E
30|$|The plasma {{calibration}} curve was constructed using a blank sample (matrix sample processed without analyte or <b>internal</b> <b>standard),</b> a zero sample (matrix sample processed without analyte but with <b>internal</b> <b>standard),</b> and six non-zero samples (matrix samples processed with analyte and <b>internal</b> <b>standard)</b> covering the expected range including lower {{limit of quantification}} (LLOQ), 20 – 7500  ng/mL with 2000  ng/mL of IS concentration.|$|R
30|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{solution}} was prepared by weighing 1  mg of the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> (cyanocobalamine) and dissolving in distilled water to form 100  mL of solution, with concentration of 10  µg/mL of cyanocobalamin.|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} that the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> displays very similar (ideally identical) properties, with respect to detector response (i.e. ionisation), as the analyte of interest. To simplify the selection of <b>internal</b> <b>standard,</b> most laboratories use an analogous stable isotope in an isotope dilution type analysis. The stable isotope is almost guaranteed to be chemically and physically {{as close as possible to}} the analyte of interest, hence producing an almost identical detector response in addition to behaving identically during sample preparation and chromatographic resolution. To this end, the ion suppression experienced by both the analyte and the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> should be identical. It {{is important}} to note that an excessively high concentration of stable isotope <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> may cause ion suppression itself, since it will co-elute with the analyte of interest. Hence, the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> should be added at an appropriate concentration.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising <b>internal</b> <b>standards.</b> In terms of coordination, an inquiry into the mutiny at Yen Bai showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that this was partly responsible for the failure to prevent the uprising. Although the relationship between the civilian authorities in Tonkin and the military were traditionally marked by rivalry, Yen Bai stood out in the total lack of military–civilian cooperation. Further VNQDD conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kien An, were detected and scotched at late notice. Although the performance of the intelligence service was regarded as being substandard at Yen Bai, the army command in Vietnam realised, under criticism from civil authorities who claimed they had not been sufficiently cooperative in the past, that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bai style rebellions. For such reasons, Patrice Morlat wrote that the mutiny at Yen Bai allowed the Sûreté to [...] "penetrate indirectly into the military sector which had till then been inaccessible".|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the quantitation of {{specific}} mRNA species by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) has been developed by using a synthetic RNA as an <b>internal</b> <b>standard.</b> The specific target mRNA and the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> are coamplified in one reaction in which the same primers are used. The amount of mRNA is then quantitated by extrapolating against the standard curve generated with the <b>internal</b> <b>standard.</b> The synthetic <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> RNA consists of a linear array of the sequences of upstream primers of multiple target genes followed by the complementary sequences to their downstream primers in the same order. This quantitative PCR method provides a rapid and reliable way to quantify the amount of a specific mRNA {{in a sample of}} less than 0. 1 ng of total RNA. In addition, the same <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> RNA is used, with appropriate primer pairs, to quantitate multiple different mRNA species...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{reproducibility}} of a combined method of axiallyviewed ICP-AES and electrothermal vaporization, the application of an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> method was investigated. Profiles of emission intensities for various elements were compared. While the signal profiles for some elements such as Be and Co resembled each other, those for some elements such as Sn and Pd were different. In {{the case of the}} profiles with similar shapes, relative standard deviations (RSD) of emission intensities were reduced from more than 20 % to ca. 6 % by applying the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> method. In the case of the profiles with dissimilar shapes, however, the application of the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> method deteriorated the RSDs. When the intensity ratios of analyte and <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> elements were within 2 to 5 times, the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> method was found to be most effective for the improvement in reproducibility...|$|R

5000|$|Motivation - The {{decision}} to reproduce (or refrain from reproducing) an observed behavior {{is dependent on}} the motivations and expectations of the observer, including anticipated consequences and <b>internal</b> <b>standards.</b> Bandura's description of motivation is also fundamentally based on environmental and thus social factors, since motivational factors are driven by the functional value of different behaviors in a given environment.|$|E
50|$|This {{ratio for}} the samples is {{then used to}} obtain their analyte {{concentrations}} from a calibration curve. The <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> used needs to provide a signal {{that is similar to}} the analyte signal in most ways but sufficiently different so that the two signals are readily distinguishable by the instrument. For example, deuterated chlorobenzene (C6D5Cl) is an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> used in the analysis of volatiles on GC-MS because it is similar to Chlorobenzene but does not occur naturally. Norleucine is also a popular <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> for the analysis of amino acids via GC-MS.|$|R
30|$|Having {{developed}} and validated the method using external standards, the authors {{decided to go}} further to find an appropriate <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{that could be used}} for the analysis of the three APIs. Even though external standard method is effective, <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> method tends to yield the most accurate and precise results (Kupiec 2004). Cyanocobalamin was chosen as the best <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> as its peak was very well resolved from that of all three APIs with its retention time falling in between those of paracetamol and caffeine. This is illustrated in Fig.  2. Calibration graphs of MPAR against concentration of each API were linear in the concentration ranges of 1 – 50, 1 – 500, and 1 – 150  μg/mL respectively for chlorpheniramine maleate, paracetamol and caffeine respectively. The regression coefficients, R 2, were 0.9985, 0.9998 and 0.9988 respectively for CPM, PARA and CAF. Recovery values obtained (98 – 100  %) showed that the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> of cyanocobalamin is an excellent <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> for determining the concentration of the APIs.|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{dried blood}} spot (DBS) pre-impregnation procedures (prior to blood spotting) were investigated.

Finally, the immersing procedure was used for the analysis of morphine in dried blood spots and the results were compared to the conventional procedure in which the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> morphine-d 3 was added to the extraction solvent. The new pre-impregnated cards couple simplicity of operation and convenient use in the field to results equivalent to the conventional procedure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
