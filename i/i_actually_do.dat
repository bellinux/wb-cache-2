5000|$|Frisch's dramas {{up until}} the early 1960s are divided by the {{literary}} commentator Manfred Jurgensen into three groups: (1) the early wartime pieces, (2) the poetical plays such as Don Juan or the Love of Geometry (Don Juan oder Die Liebe zur Geometrie) and (3) the dialectical pieces. It is above all with this third group, notably the parable The Fire Raisers (1953), identified by Frisch as a [...] "lesson without teaching", and with Andorra (1961) that Frisch enjoyed the most success. Indeed, these two {{are among the most}} successful German language plays. [...] The writer nevertheless remained dissatisfied because he believed they had been widely misunderstood. In an interview with Heinz Ludwig Arnold Frisch vigorously rejected their allegorical approach: [...] "I have established only that when I apply the parable format, I am obliged to deliver a message that <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> not have". After the 1960s Frisch moved away from the theatre. His late biographical plays Biography: A game (Biografie: Ein Spiel) and Triptychon were apolitical but they failed to match the public success of his earlier dramas.

5000|$|The {{grounding}} objection is {{at present}} the most debated objection to Molinism, and often considered the strongest. The argument claims {{that there are}} no metaphysical grounds for the truthfulness of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. As Hugh J.

Knowledge, as we have seen, is not merely a matter of conceiving a proposition and correctly believing it to be true. It requires justification: one must have good reasons for believing. But what justification could God have for believing the propositions that are supposed to constitute middle knowledge? The truth of subjunctives of freedom cannot be discerned a priori, for they are contingent. It is not a necessary truth that if placed in circumstances C, I will decide to attend the concert tonight. Nor can we allow that God might learn the truth of C from my actual behavior — that is, by observing that <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do,</b> in circumstances C, decide to attend the concert. For God could not make observations like this without also finding out what creative decisions he is actually going to make, which would destroy the whole purpose of middle knowledge.” [...] Thus, there are no [...] "truth makers" [...] that ground counterfactuals. Opponents to middle knowledge claim that the historical antecedent of any possible world does not determine the truthfulness of a counterfactual for a creature, if that creature is free in the libertarian sense. (Molinists naturally accept this, but deny that this entails that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom lack truth values.) ...|$|E
