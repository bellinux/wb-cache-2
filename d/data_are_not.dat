5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
25|$|When <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> labeled, {{supervised}} learning is not possible, and an un{{supervised learning}} approach is required, which {{attempts to find}} natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The clustering algorithm which provides an improvement to the support vector machines is called support vector clustering and is often used in industrial applications either when <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> labeled or when only some data are labeled as a preprocessing for a classification pass.|$|E

25|$|Reliable {{projections}} of CNS risks for space missions cannot {{be made from}} the available data. Animal behavior studies indicate that high-HZE radiation has a high RBE, but the <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> consistent. Other uncertainties include: age at exposure, radiation quality, and dose-rate effects, as well as issues regarding genetic susceptibility to CNS risk from space radiation exposure. More research is required before CNS risk can be estimated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} regarding human genome research in developing countries.

25|$|Molecular mass or {{molecular}} weight is {{the mass of}} a molecule. It is calculated as {{the sum of the}} atomic weights of each constituent element multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula. The molecular mass of small to medium size molecules, measured by mass spectrometry, determines stoichiometry. For large molecules such as proteins, methods based on viscosity and light-scattering can be used to determine molecular mass when crystallographic <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available.|$|E

Note that although we are looking at success/failure, the <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> accurately modeled by the binomial distribution, because the probability of success on each trial is not the same, as the size of the remaining population changes as we remove each marble.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} an {{interesting}} evolution in the gender balance among PhD students. Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38–39% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% {{but there was also}} a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16% of PhD students). Although <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> readily available on the number of PhD graduates choosing to stay on as faculty, the relatively modest level of domestic research spending would suggest that academic research suffers from inadequate funding.|$|E
25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 household budget survey shows that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians spends more than 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 percent of their income. Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 percent of their income. One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who have no access to free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} {{treatment was}} given to a Northern Irish teenager, Jonathan Simms, beginning in January 2003. The medication, called pentosan polysulphate (PPS) and used to treat interstitial cystitis, is infused into the patient's lateral ventricle within the brain. PPS {{does not seem to}} stop the disease from progressing, and both brain function and tissue continue to be lost. However, the treatment is alleged to slow the progression of the otherwise untreatable disease, and {{may have contributed to the}} longer than expected survival of the seven patients studied. Simms died in 2011. The CJD Therapy Advisory Group to the UK Health Departments advises that <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sufficient to support claims that pentosan polysulphate is an effective treatment and suggests that further research in animal models is appropriate. A 2007 review of the treatment of 26 patients with PPS finds no proof of efficacy because of the lack of accepted objective criteria.|$|E

25|$|Yellowtail scad {{are a major}} species {{targeted}} by fisheries throughout the species range. Worldwide catch <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available, although the FAO has catch data from Saudi Arabia showing 933 tonnes of the species was taken in 2001; an increase from 2000's catch of 875 tonnes. In Malaysia and presumably other South East Asian countries, the species makes up {{a high percentage of}} the pelagic catch. The fishery appears to be seasonal in some areas, with demersal species such as serranids and lutjanids making up the bulk of the catch most of the year while pelagics such as A. mate and scombrids make up the bulk of the catch between January and April. In other areas such as the Gulf of Thailand, it is taken year round. The species is taken by a variety of fishing methods including beach seines, gill netting, as well as hook and line methods involving jigging with lures. In parts of South East Asia, the yellowtail scad is a highly valued seafood prepared by boiling, steaming and frying. It may also by dried and salted to preserve the flesh.|$|E
500|$|With a {{worldwide}} box-office gross of over $2.7 billion, Avatar is often proclaimed {{to be the}} [...] "highest-grossing" [...] film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do {{not take into account}} home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box-office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.|$|E
