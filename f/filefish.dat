5|$|Thread-sail <b>filefish</b> feed on fish, amphipods, isopods, cirripeds, polychaetes, pelecypods, {{seaweeds}} such {{as those}} of the genus Sargassum; and gelatinous plankton, such as the moon jellyfish Aurelia sp. and the giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai.|$|E
5|$|The thread-sail <b>filefish</b> is an omnivore, and {{can feed}} on plant or animal matter. Its diet {{includes}} kelp, but consists mainly of amphipods such as gammarids and skeleton shrimp, {{as well as}} the seagrass species Zostera marina. The fish also feeds upon smaller organisms, including bryozoans and some species of serpulid tube worms.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do <b>filefish</b> in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E

5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{is an active}} predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and <b>filefish,</b> comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, {{pelagic stingray}}s hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} is a benthopelagic predator, taking its prey both in {{midwater}} {{and along the}} seafloor. The diet consists mostly of fish, up to 90% of the fishes intake in some studies, with planktonic crustaceans and small cephalopods taken in minor volumes. There is significant change in diet with age in fish studied off Cuba, which may reduce intraspecific competition in the species. Young fish prefer planktonic organisms, predominantly decapod and fish larvae; fish reaching sexual maturity prey on shrimp and small fish, while mature fish feed almost exclusively on small fish. The fish species preferred by bar jack appear to be mostly small sand dwellers such as blennies and gobies or small reef dwellers including wrasses, butterflyfish and <b>filefish,</b> with the diet of the latter leading to the accumulation of coral derived ciguatera toxin in the jack's flesh. Other lesser taken prey items include gastropods, nematodes and benthic algae {{as well as a}} range of crustaceans.|$|E
500|$|Juveniles of {{the species}} usually seek shelter and safety from predators within {{clusters}} of drifting seaweed. The adult thread-sail <b>filefish</b> usually reside near the seabed, where the depth is around [...] The fish migrate wholly in ocean waters (...) between their feeding and spawning grounds, which can cover a range of over [...] The spawning season lasts from May to August. Juveniles under [...] inhabit shallow water and feed on small crustaceans, mollusks and algae. Adult fish are mostly solitary and live among the coral and seaweeds.|$|E

500|$|The thread-sail <b>filefish</b> is cultured {{and sold}} commercially as food in Asian countries, {{including}} Korea and Japan. The {{demand for the}} fish in Korea is very high, and fisheries often employ the services of fish hatcheries for breeding more of the fish to supplement and enhance the supply of stock. This {{has been done to}} such a degree that some [...] As many as 95 alleles have been found to be unique to one of the populations, resulting from minor variations in certain genes that occur exclusively within either population; genetic differentiation between S.cirrhifer born in the wild and those bred in a hatchery has apparently occurred.|$|E
500|$|Thread-sail <b>filefish</b> grow to {{a maximum}} adult length of about [...] The first dorsal fin is a strong {{retractable}} (folding backwards) spine. The second dorsal fin and anal fin are soft. They have comparatively small pectoral fins and truncated, fan-shaped tail fins. The dorsal and anal fins are colorless. Their second dorsal, anal and caudal fins rounded. In males, 1-3 soft dorsal fin rays extended as filaments; the first ray has a particularly long thread. The fish have a small abdominal spike. The fish are colored from light brown, to grayish- to light greenish-beige, and are slightly patterned with irregular, broken stripes that range from medium brown to blackish.|$|E
500|$|Stephanolepis cirrhifer, {{commonly}} known as the thread-sail <b>filefish,</b> is a species of marine fish in the family Monacanthidae. It is found in the western Pacific, in an area that ranges from northern Japan to the East China Sea, to Korea. Other common names for the fish include [...] "Kawahagi" [...] "カワハギ" [...] "皮剥" [...] (Japanese) and [...] "Jwi-chi" [...] (Korean). The fish grows to a maximum length of about , and consumes both plant material and small marine organisms like skeleton shrimp. S.cirrhifer is host of the parasite Peniculus minuticaudae. Some minor genetic differentiation between S.cirrhifer born in the wild and those bred in a hatchery for consumer use has been shown. The fish is edible and sold commercially for culinary purposes in many Asian countries.|$|E

500|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, when {{threatened}} the blotchy swellshark is capable of rapidly inflating its stomach with water or air. This allows the shark to wedge itself inside a rocky crevice, becoming extremely difficult to remove. This species is an opportunistic, highly voracious predator; one recorded female [...] long had 10 fish about [...] long and 15 squid about [...] long in her stomach. Predominantly piscivorous, this species is known to prey upon hagfish and at least 50 species of bony fishes, including fast-swimming types that inhabit open water; significant prey species include the mackerel Scomber japonicus, the sardine Sardinops melanostictus, the <b>filefish</b> Thamnaconus modestus, and the hakeling Physiculus japonicus. Unusually for such a small shark, it also feeds on at least 10 species of cartilaginous fishes, including lantern sharks, catsharks (particularly the cloudy catshark, Scyliorhinus torazame, and its eggs), the electric ray Narke japonica, and skates (including their eggs). It also cannibalizes smaller members of its own species. Cephalopods, mostly the squid Doryteuthis bleekeri and the cuttlefish Sepia spp., are also frequently taken, while crabs, shrimp, and isopods are occasionally consumed. The dietary composition of juveniles varies notably from place to place.|$|E
2500|$|Like many Indo-Pacific carangids, {{the biology}} and {{ecology of the}} blue {{trevally}} is poorly known, with the only data on the species relating to its diet. It is a fast-swimming predator which often forms small schools, and takes a variety of small fish (specifically mackerel and <b>filefish),</b> crustaceans including prawns, crabs, and sea lice, soft molluscs, and other soft prey. In Hawaii, they have been observed following foraging bonefish or goatfish, consuming any scraps uncovered by the foragers. The species {{appears to be in}} constant abundance all year, but ripe individuals have rarely been reported. No information regarding the reproduction and growth of the species is available, although [...] larvae of the species are known to appear during February in the waters off Taiwan, suggesting a December spawning period, and make up a high proportion of the larval abundance. Juveniles are known to sometimes shelter among the tentacles of large pelagic jellyfish.|$|E

50|$|Aluterus scriptus, {{commonly}} known as scrawled <b>filefish,</b> broomtail <b>filefish</b> or scribbled leatherjacket, is a marine fish belonging to the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
50|$|It has {{a number}} of predators. These include pufferfishes, parrotfishes and <b>filefishes</b> which feed on the branch tips and hermit crabs which scrape the {{skeletal}} tissue. Other predators feed on the soft tissues while leaving the skeleton intact. These include such fish as the butterflyfishes, the angelfishes and the damselfish, Stegastes acapulcoensis. Invertebrate predators include the crown-of-thorns starfish, the sea urchin, Eucidaris galapagensis, and the gastropods, Jenneria pustulata and Quoyula sp.|$|R
50|$|Various bizarre {{forms are}} {{included}} here, all radical departures from the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes.

50|$|Cantherhines macrocerus, {{commonly}} known as the whitespotted <b>filefish</b> or American whitespotted <b>filefish,</b> is a marine fish found along the coast of Florida extending southward into the Caribbean. This species is distinct and separate from Cantherhines dumerilii, the similarly named whitespotted <b>filefish</b> which is found in the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E
50|$|Either solitary, {{in pairs}} or small groups {{depending}} on the species, <b>filefish</b> are not terribly good swimmers; their small fins confine the fish to a sluggish gait. <b>Filefish</b> are often observed drifting head downward amongst stands of seaweed, presumably {{in an effort to}} fool both predator and prey alike. When threatened, <b>filefish</b> may retreat into crevices in the reef.|$|E
50|$|The tetraodontiform {{strategy}} {{seems to}} be defense {{at the expense of}} speed, with all species fortified with scales modified into strong plates or spines — or with tough, leathery skin (the <b>filefishes</b> and ocean sunfish). Another striking defensive attribute found in the pufferfishes and porcupinefishes is the ability to inflate their bodies to greatly increase their normal diameter; this is accomplished by sucking water into a diverticulum of the stomach. Many species of the Tetraodontidae, Triodontidae, and Diodontidae are further protected from predation by tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin concentrated in the animals' internal organs.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} predators feed on this coral. These include pufferfishes, parrotfishes and <b>filefishes</b> which {{feed on the}} tips of the {{branches}} and hermit crabs which scrape the skeletal tissue. Other animals feed on the soft tissues while leaving the skeleton intact including the butterflyfishes, the angelfishes and the damselfish, Stegastes acapulcoensis. Invertebrates which feed on this coral are the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), Jenner's cowry (Jenneria pustulata), the sea urchin, Eucidaris galapagensis and the coral snails, Coralliophila spp.. Both the starfish and the cowry can kill a mature coral colony by stripping off the living tissue.|$|R
500|$|The {{silky shark}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from {{all levels of}} the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfishes, <b>filefishes,</b> triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented [...] "herding" [...] a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|R
