Among edible nuts and dried fruits, hazelnuts, raisins, dried apricots and dried figs are of significant importance for Turkish agricultural export. Due to their importance, they are considered as the traditional agricultural export products of Turkiye. The sum of the exported value of dried fruits and edible nuts in 2005 reached 1, 713 US $ (www. igeme. gov. tr). The <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle,</b> Carpophilus hemipterus (L.) (Nitidulidae: Coleoptera) {{is one of the major}} pests on dried figs in Aegean region of Turkiye. Due to a complete ban of methyl bromide which was the main fumigant for the dried figs, alternative control methods are urgently needed. Phosphine fumigation can be an alternative control method for conventional fumigation during the processing of the figs. To evaluate the efficacy of phosphine on the <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle,</b> laboratory tests were conducted at 15 oC, which is the lower temperature limit of the dried fig harvest and processing season, and at the concentration of 200 ppm that is often encountered at improper sealing conditions in case of tarpaulin for bulk fumigation. In the experiments, 1 to 2 day-old eggs, 15 day-old mature larvae, 1 to 3 day-old pupae and 1 week-old adults of the <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle</b> were exposed to phosphine at 75 % ± 5 r. h. for different exposure periods. According to the results (Table 1), phosphine applications at a concentration of 200 ppm at 15 oC gave a complete mortality in all life stages of C. hemipterus in 36 h of exposure. Results also showed that complete mortality time of eggs, larvae, pupae and adult stages of C...|$|E

Several {{bacterial}} strains associated with cow dung such as Campylobacter, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli cause serious human diseases. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the use of insect larvae including <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle,</b> waxworms and tiger worms to improve the breakdown of agricultural wastes and reduce their pathogen loads. Fresh cow faeces were collected from a cattle farm and distributed into plastic boxes (100 g/box). Each box was provided with 10 larvae of <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle,</b> Waxworms and Tiger worms, respectively. There were 3 replicates in each treatment including the control. Bacteria were isolated weekly from both control and cow faeces to which larvae were added to determine the bacterial populations. Results revealed that the bacterial load was higher in the cow faeces treated with <b>fruit</b> <b>beetles</b> than in the control, while the bacterial load was lower in the cow faeces treated with waxworms and tiger worms than in the control. The activities of the <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae led to the cow faeces being liquefied which provided a more conducive growing media for bacteria. Therefore, higher bacterial load in the cow faeces treated with <b>fruit</b> <b>beetle</b> might be attributed to the liquefaction of cow faeces...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>fruit</b> is {{fruit that}} is {{preserved}} {{by removing the}} original water content naturally, through sun drying or artificially, {{by the use of}} specialized dryers or dehydrators. <b>Dried</b> <b>fruit</b> has a long tradition of use dating back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value and long shelf life. Traditional <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and prunes have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. The Mediterranean region is very favourable for production of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits,</b> not only with its climatic conditions, but also its exceptional fertile lands. Additionally, proximity to trade routes historically has allowed Mediterranean countries more access to <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> than landlocked countries. Today, <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> sold throughout the world are raisins, followed by dates, prunes (dried plums), figs, apricots, peaches, apples and pears. Dates, prunes, apricots, figs and raisins are the major <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> produced in the Mediterranean area. <b>Dried</b> <b>fruits</b> are not perishable but can support mold growth, some of which can produce mycotoxins. Occurence of toxigenic molds and mycotoxins on these <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> can be a problem in the Mediterranean basin, as in the other parts of the world, being a health hazard to the population as well as a trade issue for the export of local products.

Recently, massive and frequent infestation of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> imported from the Mediterranean region by the mite Carpoglpyhus lactis L. (Acarina: Carpoglyphidae) has been found. In 180 analyzed samples taken from supermarkets, 13 % were contaminated; the contamination levels ranged from 0 to 660 mites per g of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit.</b> The contamination was found in dried apricots, figs, plums and raisins. To estimate the risks and food preferences of C. lactis, its growth rate was examined under laboratory conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{fruits of}} Lagenara scerara Standl. (Cucurbitaceae) {{are widely used}} for {{medicinal}} and nutritional purposes in Africa. The health promoting ability of the fruits {{might be related to}} antioxidant properties of its constituents. In this study the antioxidant effect of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara was evaluated by comparing the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reducing capacity of ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> The comparison was further emphasized by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the extracts so as to relate activities with their chemical profiles. Results indicated that ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the fresh fruits exhibited higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than other samples. At 0. 01 mg/ml the order of activity was: EA <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (50. 6 %) < Bt (n-butanol) fresh fruits (53. 3 %) < Bt (n-butanol) <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (64. 8 %) < EA fresh fruits (68. 6 %) < Gallic acid (81. 8 %). A slight change of activity was observed at 0. 1 mg/ml, where the order was; EA <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (70 %) < Bt <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (71. 8 %) ≤ Bt fresh fruits (72 %) < EA fresh fruits (81. 6 %) < Gallic acid (88. 5 %). In the reducing capacity assay, Bt fresh fruits extract exhibited higher reducing power than all test samples. The HPTLC chemical profiles of both fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> extracts showed some slight differences. The slight differences in antioxidant activities were justified by the HPTLC chemical profiles of the fruits. Therefore, taking fresh or <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara may relatively give similar antioxidant effects.
