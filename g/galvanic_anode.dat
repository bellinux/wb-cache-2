50|$|CP {{works by}} {{introducing}} another metal (the <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode)</b> {{with a much}} more anodic surface, {{so that all the}} current will flow from the introduced anode and the metal to be protected becomes cathodic in comparison to the anode. This effectively stops the oxidation reactions on the metal surface by transferring them to the <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode,</b> which will be sacrificed in favour of the structure under protection.|$|E
50|$|Cathodic {{protection}} {{on ships}} is often implemented by <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> {{attached to the}} hull and ICCP for larger vessels.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper {{and it is}} {{available}} here with the kind permission of the publisher. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> {{can be used to}} limit the extent of concrete replacement and extend the service life of patch repairs to reinforced concrete (RC) structures. They respond to changes in environmental conditions and this attribute has been employed to extend their use. Traditionally, <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> are installed within the repair area itself. Although simple to install, this has certain limitations however, due primarily to the resistivity of the repair material. A recent alternative has been to install <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> in pre-drilled cavities in the parent concrete {{around the perimeter of the}} patch repair. This paper reviews and compares the performance of discrete <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> installed both within the repair area and parent concrete in full-scale RC structures. Results indicate that <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> installed within the parent concrete had a more profound effect on the polarisation of the steel around the perimeter of the patch repair. This provides the empirical basis for alternative designs incorporating <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> that will enable increased corrosion protection to the steel reinforcement around the patch repair, which is generally considered to be at the highest risk...|$|R

50|$|A <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> is {{the main}} {{component}} of a galvanic cathodic protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> CP system should {{consider}} many factors, including the type of structure, the resistivity of the electrolyte (soil or water) it will operate in, the type of coating and the service life.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{operation}} of a <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal {{can be used to}} protect some other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential. For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} more economically viable {{to protect a}} pipeline using <b>galvanic</b> (sacrificial) <b>anodes.</b> This {{is often the case}} on smaller diameter pipelines of limited length. [...] <b>Galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> rely on the galvanic series potentials of the metals to drive cathodic protection current from the anode to the structure being protected.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are made}} from a metal alloy with a more [...] "active" [...] voltage (more {{negative}} reduction potential / more positive electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure. The difference in potential between the two metals means that the <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{application}} of passive cathodic protection, a <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode,</b> {{a piece of a}} more electrochemically [...] "active" [...] metal, is attached to the vulnerable metal surface where it is exposed to an electrolyte. Galvanic anodes are selected because they have a more [...] "active" [...] voltage (more negative electrode potential) than the metal of the target structure (typically steel). For effective cathodic protection, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative until the surface has a uniform potential. At that stage, the driving force for the corrosion reaction with the protected surface is removed. The <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> continues to corrode, consuming the anode material until eventually it must be replaced. Polarization of the target structure is caused by the electron flow from the anode to the cathode, so the two metals must have a good electrically conductive contact. The driving force for the cathodic protection current is the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode.|$|E
50|$|Some ships {{may require}} {{specialist}} treatment, for example aluminium hulls with steel fixtures will create an electrochemical cell where the aluminium hull {{can act as}} a <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> and corrosion is enhanced. In cases like this, aluminium or zinc galvanic anodes can be used to offset the potential difference between the aluminium hull and the steel fixture. If the steel fixtures are large, several galvanic anodes may be required, or even a small ICCP system.|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] this study, a unique concrete specimen was used to analyse the response of embedded sacrificial zinc and steel anodes to rainfall and fluctuations in temperature. Current from the zinc and steel anodes increased when the environment was aggressive, showing that the required protection current depends on the present level of corrosion risk. A basis for using the ‘responsive behaviour’ of <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> is provided by the protective effects of pit re-alkalisation and pH maintenance. By contrast, protection based on achieving adequate polarisation inhibits the use of responsive behaviour and <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> might only deliver adequate polarisation in aggressive environments...|$|R
50|$|Galvanization {{consists}} of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), cadmium plating is preferred. Galvanization often fails at seams, holes, and joints where there are gaps in the coating. In these cases, the coating still provides some partial cathodic protection to iron, by acting as a <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> and corroding itself instead of the underlying protected metal. The protective zinc layer is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.|$|E

40|$|This {{conference will}} serve as an {{introduction}} to the Workshop untitled « Cathodic Protection of Steel in Concrete by galvanic anodes and will present the French state of the art on the use of this type of repair. Galvanic (or sacrificial) anode systems can be applied in many structures like bridges, harbours, industrial silos, buildings, car parks, for example. These structures exist in various environments : carbonated, chlorinated, marine, etc. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> systems can be surface installed or embedded within the concrete. The following different key aspects of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> systems will be discussed: Galvanic current directly depends on the steel current demand. As corrosion rate varies with weather conditions (humidity, temperature) and with concrete cover components (old concrete, marine salts, de-icing salts, new concrete,), the galvanic current is never constant and can even be nil if the steel is not corroding anymore. Thus the current variations of the electrochemical cell with time needs to be explained. Design of these systems is essential to ensure that the required protection will work efficiently. The number, size, capacity and location of galvanic anodes is dependent on the current demand, the electrolyte resistivity, the structure geometry, etc. In a classical design of cathodic protection in sea water for instance, resistivity of the media is constant whereas concrete is not a homogeneous material. Different design parameters will be considered. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> systems monitoring is at the option of the purchaser and this is often understood as an advantage compared to impressed current cathodic protection that obviously needs to be checked all life through. But without monitoring, no evidence of the performance of the system can be achieved. Embedded reference electrodes, special connexion systems, electrical and electronic devices are available for monitoring galvanic current and will be referred to. Performance criteria can be based on potential measurements (current off, on, cartography), polarisation tests (upon time), current density monitoring. Nevertheless, more studies and analysis are necessary to find out or develop proper performance criteria that has been difficult to obtain if we look back over past experiences. Durability of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> systems has not been sufficiently and scientifically explored yet. Examinations could be made on old anode systems that are still in service (visual examination, chemical analysis, estimation of the anode consumption rate) in order to estimate it. All these points will be presented and discussed during this introducing conference...|$|E
50|$|Smaller vessels, with {{non-metallic}} hulls, such as yachts, {{are equipped}} with <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> to protect areas such as outboard motors. As with all galvanic cathodic protection, this application relies on a solid electrical connection between the anode and the item to be protected.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{of different sizes}} of zinc, and aluminium <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> on the cathodic protection of mild steel in seawater and 0. 2 M sulphuric acid was evaluated at ambient temperature. The magnitude of corrosion protection by the <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> was observed by weight loss method,corrosion rate calculation and potential measurement technique. It was observed that the aluminium anodes proved more effective as sacrificial anode for mild steel in seawater environment. In sulphuric acid environment, the zinc anode gave a more protective performance than aluminium anode. Potential measurement results obtained were found to correspond with the results obtained from weight loss method. For both environments, {{the effects of a}} varying cross-sectional area and the anode material on the cathodic protection of mild steel were examine...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the results}} of an {{in-depth}} literature review, the following CoP methods were selected for evaluation in this experimental work: two (2) types of embedded <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes,</b> a humectant activated galvanic thermal sprayed zinc, a penetrating T-SS, an EP-C, and an acrylic coating. The EP-C included a first coating of epoxy followed by a second coating of polyurethane.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} thermally sprayed zinc as galvanic and/or as impressed current anode showed good results under favourable conditions such as high zinc/steel area ratio and sufficient direct moistening. Cathodic protection with sprayed zinc on chloride containing concrete is achieved at least 2 years. With unfavourable zinc/steel area ratio and with temporarily inadequate moistening after one year a marked decline in the protective effect (<b>galvanic</b> <b>anode)</b> was observed. Subsequent operation with external current required steadily increasing voltage due to the increase of the internal resistance of the zinc/concrete interface.

40|$|Case {{study of}} {{corrosion}} failure of urban {{water supply system}} caused by {{the harmful effects of}} stray currents was presented. The failure occurred at a site distant from the sources of these currents namely the tramway and railway traction systems. Diagnosis revealed the stray currents flow to pipeline over a remote distance of 800 / 1000  m from the point of failure. At the point of failure stray currents flowed from the pipeline to the ground through external insulation defects, causing the process of electrolytic corrosion of the metal. Long distance between the affected section of the pipeline and the sources of stray currents excludes the typical protection against stray currents in the form of electrical polarized drainage. Corrosion protection at this point can be achieved by using the earthing electrodes made of magnesium, which will also provide cathodic current protection as <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{reinforced}} concrete laboratory test specimens {{were used to}} evaluate a number of corrosion control (CoC) procedures to prolong the life of patch repairs in corrosion-damaged {{reinforced concrete}}. These specimens included layered mixed-in chlorides to represent chloride contamination due to deicing salts. All specimens were exposed to accelerated corrosion testing for three months, subjected to patch repairs with various treatments, and further subjected to additional three months of exposure to accelerated corrosion. The use of thermal sprayed zinc, galvanic embedded anodes, epoxy/polyurethane coating, acrylic coating, and an epoxy patch repair material was evaluated individually or in combination. The specimens were assessed with respect to corrosion currents (estimated mass loss), chloride ingress, surface rust staining, and corrosion of the reinforcing steel observed after dissection. Results indicated that when used in patch repair applications, the embedded <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> with top surface coating, galvanic thermal sprayed zinc, and galvanic thermal sprayed zinc with surface coating were more effective in controlling corrosion than the other treatments tested...|$|E

40|$|Carbonation induced {{corrosion}} is a {{major cause}} of decay of reinforced concrete structures. Electrochemical realkalisation treatment is described as an interesting technique to rehabilitate such structures. In this paper, the results of tests on both efficiency and durability of two realkalisation treatments (impressed current and <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes),</b> in accordance with the CEN/TS 14038 - 1 specification (threshold current density of 200 A. h/m²) are presented. The efficiency of both treatments is demonstrated qualitatively with acid/base indicators such as phenolphthalein and thymolphthalein and quantitatively by pH determinations. Non destructive electrochemical characterizations such as rest potential, linear polarization resistance and corrosion currents indicate a slight decrease of the corrosion activity after treatment although the passive state of the reinforcement encountered in uncarbonated concrete is not recovered. These results are confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Concerning the cement matrix, none evolution is detected by SEM, but alkaline content evaluation shows a noticeable enrichment in potassium (impressed current) or sodium ions (<b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes)</b> in the concrete cover...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews 25 {{years of}} {{experience}} with cathodic protection of steel in concrete in The Netherlands. Three phases have passed from the late 1980 s until present: pioneering, development and maturity. In the first period CP was mainly applied to precast elements corroding due to mixed in chlorides. The parties involved worked together {{to draw up a}} Technical Guideline. In the second period, application to bridges was developed, including post-tensioned structures, which was then innovative. Furthermore, <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> systems were introduced. In the third period, CP became a fully accepted method of securing safety and serviceability. The annual number of projects increases considerably and increased competition has reduced prices. Renewed collaboration led to a database that allowed analysis of various aspects of CP system working life; and to new developments in modelling. Major successes and lessons learned will be presented. Technical and non-technical developments are highlighted and some recent findings on long term behaviour are discusse...|$|E

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> technology has in recent years {{come to the fore}} as a cost-effective method of successfully mitigating the corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete structures. Developments in the field of cathodic protection have included the introduction of a novel Hybrid anode system, which uses the same sacrificial anode to pass a short-term impressed current before being connected to the steel directly to provide a long-term galvanic current. Galvanic and hybrid technologies are often seen as less powerful solutions in the treatment of reinforcement corrosion, and the test methodologies which determine the efficacy of cathodic protection systems favour impressed current technologies. The work completed has investigated the application of traditional and novel corrosion assessment techniques to laboratory samples to assess the protection offered by the hybrid treatment methodology in both treatment phases. In addition, the response of both galvanic and hybrid anodes to environmental conditions has been recorded and assessed before being discussed in the context of steel protection criteria. Finally, an investigation is presented into the on-site deterioration of commercially pure titanium feeder wire installed as part of the hybrid anode system and potential solutions to the problem have been documented. The research undertaken found that the hybrid anode system is capable of protecting steel in challenging, aggressive environments. This was confirmed by steel corrosion rate and indicative steel potential measurements. The responsive behaviour investigation showed that the current output of galvanic and hybrid anodes responds rapidly to changes in the corrosion risk posed to the steel and that this has a direct effect on anode system lifetimes. An assessment of the polarisation-based protection criteria applied to steel in concrete has found that the standard inhibits the use of responsive behaviour, and that revisions which consider the present risk of steel corrosion by considering the corrosion current resulting from the relative aggressivity of the concrete environment would be more valid in their application. A cathodic protection system based on the concepts of pit re-alkalisation and pH maintenance can fully utilise <b>galvanic</b> <b>anode</b> responsive behaviour. It was discovered that the deterioration of commercially pure titanium feeder wire seen on site installations was due to anodising in the presence of chloride media which had the potential to lead to pitting corrosion. The pitting risk varied depending on the duration of the treatment and proximity to the installed anode. An anodically grown oxide delayed the onset of corrosion in aqueous KBr solution, but did not significantly increase the pitting potential...|$|E
25|$|For larger structures, <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> cannot {{economically}} deliver enough {{current to}} provide complete protection. Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems use anodes {{connected to a}} DC power source (such as a cathodic protection rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires.|$|R
50|$|For larger structures, {{or where}} {{electrolyte}} resistivity is high, <b>galvanic</b> <b>anodes</b> cannot economically deliver enough current to provide protection.
