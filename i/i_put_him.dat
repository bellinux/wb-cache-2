5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
500|$|Rotheram {{remained}} {{in command of}} Bellerophon in the English Channel and the North Sea until 1808, when he was court martialled and reprimanded for unacceptable conduct towards his ship's junior officers and chaplain. Rotheram {{remained in}} the service, but was never again employed at sea. Collingwood summed the situation up {{in a letter to}} his sister, stating [...] "Though I think him a stupid man I was in hope he might have gone on in the ship <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in, which I believe was the only chance he had of being in a ship".|$|E

In [...] "Dream Song #145", he also wrote the {{following}} lines about his father: ...|$|E

[...] "I 'clare for it I done got scared kase you didn' come back, an' 'lowed it wouldn't do no ways to keep dat young snake whar he could kick up a row ef any ob de king's sogers come in, so <b>I</b> done <b>put</b> <b>him</b> away, honey, <b>I</b> done <b>put</b> <b>him</b> away." ...|$|R

6000|$|Frank quoted. 'What {{lines for}} a very old man to write! <b>I</b> should <b>put</b> <b>him</b> second only to Shakespeare had I the {{marshalling}} of them.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{syllogism}} was {{too much}} for Ted. He collapsed and fell on his umbrella which, though the night was hot, he had carried with him for hours neatly rolled up, and he broke it into two equal halves. We then, the sergeant and <b>I,</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> to bed, the sergeant all the time solicitously muttering, 'I bror 'im home. Jus' a l'il drunk, tha's all, pore f'ler.' Next morning Ted came down to breakfast fresh as a daisy and saw the broken halves of his umbrella which Mrs. Rodenhurst had carefully laid on the sofa. 'What the 'ell,' said Ted blankly. I told him what had occurred the night before. Ted reflected; 'Ah remember as far as commin' out of t' King's Arms wi' t' sergeant and gettin' as far as t' Royal Oak, An' Ah remembers nowt else.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Drummond grinned. [...] "I kept {{something}} back from Stormont; when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> wise <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> off the track. But I'm playing straight with Miss Strange and Thirlwell. You can bet on me!" ...|$|E
60|$|SHIRLEY [not budging an inch] Will you box Todger Fairmile if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on to you? Say the word.|$|E
60|$|There {{were only}} two <b>I</b> <b>put</b> to <b>him,</b> {{and that was when}} my hansom had been called and I was on the point of leaving.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} on well, and both Meg Margetson and the monks, in whose hands <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him,</b> say that they hope {{he is out of}} danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That is a {{wonderful}} boy,” the captain said with a smile. “I think he is too good to remain where he is, and <b>I</b> must <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on the quarter-deck.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Think he'd play if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down? Because, you know, I'm dashed if I'm {{going to}} do any grovelling and that sort of thing.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was dressed}} in a light check suit and wore patent-leather shoes. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down as a dandy, but fond of drink, and that he proved to be.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There!' cried Louis, starting, 'Origen {{is lying}} on the very chair where <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> last January. I will write to Jem Frost to-morrow {{to send him to}} the binder.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT [piteously] Oh no, please, please, doctor. He is not tiring me; {{and he will}} be so {{hurt when}} he wakes if he finds <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{into the}} out-house {{in the field}} next to the copse, hide his trappings here, and get him provender from Ewins's farm. Will that do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'When you can speak,' <b>I</b> said, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> into a chair, 'speak out. I see in {{your face}} that you bring me news I don't look for from Thorpe Ambrose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, he's a dam fool. That's the way <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> up," [...] said No. 5. [...] "Anybody {{can think}} {{different}} that wants to, {{but those are}} my sentiments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{to prevent}} it from being washed overboard. I nearly lost the poor little thing once or twice, and now when we are likely to be caught in bad weather <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> below." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!'said Hugh at length, {{carrying}} {{it off with}} a laugh: 'He's a rare fellow is Barnaby, and can do more, with less rest, or meat, or drink, than any of us. As to his soldiering, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on duty there.' ...|$|E
60|$|Onbáshi (corporal) Mahmu'd Abd el-Rahmán (infantry): <b>I</b> had to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in irons.|$|R
6000|$|J. M.—Well, then, though I love Scott so {{much that}} if any man [...] chooses to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> first, <b>I</b> won’t <b>put</b> <b>him</b> second, yet is there not [...] a vein of pure gold in Burns that gives you pause? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There,' was his aside, {{as he sat}} down, 'I {{only hope}} I have not made him surly; poor fellow, <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in a predicament, but {{it could not be}} otherwise!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you think, Mr. Crews, {{it would}} be going far enough if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on the bench with the substitutes?" [...] he pleaded. [...] "To be {{thrown out of the}} team entirely is a terrible blow for any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am as noble as she is,” {{he snapped}} peevishly, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down at once {{as a very}} {{offensive}} beast. “And as to being loyal, what is that? It is being truthful! It is being faithful! I know all about her.” ...|$|E
60|$|Max {{left for}} Halifax in the morning. Next day {{we got a}} wire saying it was all right. The evening of the {{following}} day {{he was back in}} Spencervale. Ismay and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in a chair and glared at him impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Goot! dat {{is better}} nor dried meat," [...] added Henri. [...] "Give him to me; <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on my hoss, vich is strongar dan yourn. But ver is your hoss?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's nonsense, Roger; {{you know}} <b>I</b> can't <b>put</b> <b>him</b> under the pump. Now you are ill, and you'd better see him just for five minutes. I'll {{make it all}} right with Dr Thorne." ...|$|R
60|$|Knowing my horse, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> at the Emperor's head, and Bugaboo went {{at it like}} a shot. He {{was riding}} his famous white Arab, and turned quite pale as I came up and went over the horse and the Emperor, {{scarcely}} brushing the cockade which he wore.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, he was. I {{found him}} walking along {{on top of}} the {{railings}} just as unconcerned as another man would walk a pavement; and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> to bed; now just this minute there he was again, away astern, going through that sort of tight-rope deviltry the same as before.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I walked round by Fowler's lodge, {{to bestow}} my little Athenian owl. I brought {{it all the}} way in my pocket, or on my hand, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in Tom Fowler's charge while I am here. I could not think what fashionable young lady you had here. How has that turned out?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that's right, sir," [...] {{said the}} Kid. [...] "Eddie stayed {{nineteen}} rounds against Jimmy, and if <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> away, it gets me {{into line with}} Jimmy, and he can't side-step me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's understood. However, I don't think he'll come, and if so, {{it will be}} Helen's {{money that}} {{prevents}} him. If he's foolish enough to doubt her, <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> right, which will be something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that's right," [...] {{said the}} Kid. [...] "Eddie stayed {{nineteen}} rounds against Jimmy, and, if <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>him</b> away, it gets me clear {{into line with}} Jim, and he'll have to meet me." ...|$|R
