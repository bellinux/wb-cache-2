40|$|AbstractDuchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} is an inherited disorder that {{is characterized by}} progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, with a failure of muscle maintenance/repair mediated by satellite cells (muscle stem cells). The function of skeletal muscle stem cells resident in dystrophic muscle may be perturbed by being in an increasing pathogenic environment, coupled with constant demands for repairing muscle. To investigate the contribution of satellite cell exhaustion to this process, we tested the functionality of satellite cells isolated from the mdx mouse model of Duchenne {{muscular dystrophy}}. We found that satellite cells derived from young mdx mice contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration within our in vivo mouse model. To then test the effects of long-term residence in a <b>dystrophic</b> <b>environment,</b> satellite cells were isolated from aged mdx muscle. Surprisingly, they were as functional as those derived from young or aged wild type donors. Removing satellite cells from a dystrophic milieu reveals that their regenerative capacity remains both intact and similar to satellite cells derived from healthy muscle, indicating that the host environment is critical for controlling satellite cell function...|$|E
40|$|A {{dystrophic}} muscle broadens {{the contribution}} and activation of immune cells reacting to rAAV gene transfer M Ferrand 1, 2, A Galy 1, 2 and F Boisgerault 1, 2 Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) {{are used for}} therapeutic gene transfer in skeletal muscle, but it is unclear if immune reactivity to gene transfer and persistence of transgene are affected by pathologic conditions such as muscular dystrophy. Thus, we compared dystrophic mice devoid of α-sarcoglycan with healthy mice to characterize immune cell activation and cellular populations contributing {{to the loss of}} gene-modified myofibers. Following rAAV 2 / 1 delivery of an immunogenic α-sarcoglycan reporter transgene in the muscle, both strains developed strong CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell-mediated immune responses in lymphoid organs associated with muscle CD 3 + T and CD 11 b+ mononuclear cell infiltrates. Selective cell subset depletion models revealed that CD 4 + T cells were essential for transgene rejection in both healthy and pathologic mice, but macrophages and CD 8 + T cells additionally contributed as effector cells of transgene rejection only in dystrophic mice. Vectors restricting transgene expression in antigen-presenting cells showed that endogenous presentation of transgene products was the sole mechanism responsible for T-cell priming in normal mice, whereas additional and protracted antigenic presentation occurred in dystrophic animals, leading to secondary CD 4 + T-cell activation and failure to maintain transgene expression. Therefore, the <b>dystrophic</b> <b>environment</b> diversifies cellular immune response mechanisms induced by gene transfer, with a negative outcome...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder of skeletal muscle, {{characterized by a}} steady muscle weakness. By using the animal model for DMD, the mdx mice, we have previously demonstrated that biomechanical properties of tendinous tissue are also significantly affected in this muscle pathology. Muscle specific over-expression of insulin like growth factor- 1 (mIgf- 1) is known to induce a partial recovery in muscle functionality, in particular increasing the muscle absolute force, but not the specific force. To test whether Igf- 1 muscle specific over-expression helps the recovery also in tendinous tissue, mechanical and cellular evaluation of mdx and mdx:MLC/mIgf- 1 mice tendons has been performed. Mechanical properties were investigated by measuring the viscoelastic response of the tissue, while cell viability was evaluated by molecular assays. An absolute recovery in the mechanical properties of EDL and TA tendons was observed through the measurement of tissue viscoelasticity for several different frequencies of interest. Moreover, when compared with tendons from dystrophic mdx animals, mdx:MLC/mIgf- 1 specimens showed an almost complete recovery {{in the number of}} viable cells for both extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) tendons. Of note, the partial recovery in muscle functionality and the full recovery in tendons response, suggests that mIgf- 1 muscle specific over-expression exerts its effect on tendons either indirectly, improving the tendon viability and its functional properties {{as a consequence of the}} reduction of the hostile muscle <b>dystrophic</b> <b>environment,</b> or acting directly on the tendon tissue, as a paracrine trophic factor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{anti-inflammatory}} agents glucocorticoids (GC) {{are the only}} available treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, long-term GC treatment causes muscle atrophy and wasting. Thus, targeting specific mediator of inflammatory response may be more specific, more efficacious, and with fewer side effects. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 is overproduced in patients with DMD and in the muscle of mdx, the animal model for human DMD. We tested the ability of inhibition of IL 6 activity, using an interleukin- 6 receptor (Il 6 r) neutralizing antibody, to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype. Blockade of endogenous Il 6 r conferred on dystrophic muscle resistance to degeneration and alleviated both morphological and functional consequences of the primary genetic defect. Pharmacological inhibition of IL 6 activity leaded {{to changes in the}} <b>dystrophic</b> muscle <b>environment,</b> favoring anti-inflammatory responses and improvement in muscle repair. This resulted in a functional homeostatic maintenance of dystrophic muscle. These data provide an alternative pharmacological strategy for treatment of DMD and circumvent the major problems associated with conventional therapy...|$|R
40|$|Muscle side {{population}} (SP) {{cells are}} rare multipotent stem cells that {{can participate in}} myogenesis and muscle regeneration upon transplantation. While they have been primarily studied {{for the development of}} cell-based therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, little is known regarding their non-muscle lineage choices or whether the <b>dystrophic</b> muscle <b>environment</b> affects their ability to repair muscle. Unfortunately, the study of muscle SP cells has been challenged by their low abundance and the absence of specific SP cell markers. To address these issues, we developed culture conditions for the propagation and spontaneous multi-lineage differentiation of muscle SP cells. Using this approach, we show that SP cells from wild type muscle robustly differentiate into satellite cells and form myotubes without requiring co-culture with myogenic cells. Furthermore, this myogenic activity is associated with SP cells negative for immune (CD 45) and vascular (CD 31) markers but positive for Pax 7, Sca 1, and the mesenchymal progenitor marker PDGFRa. Additionally, our studies revealed that SP cells isolated from dystrophic or cardiotoxin-injured muscle fail to undergo myogenesis. Instead, these SP cells rapidly expand giving rise to fibroblast and adipocyte progenitors (FAPs) and to their differentiated progeny, fibroblasts and adipocytes. Our findings indicate that muscle damage affects the lineage choices of muscle SP cells, promoting their differentiation along fibro-adipogenic lineages while inhibiting myogenesis. These results have implication...|$|R
