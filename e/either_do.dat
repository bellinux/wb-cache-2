5|$|The boccamela group (large weasels): Very large weasels {{with large}} skulls, {{relatively}} long tails and lighter coloured pelts. Locally, they <b>either</b> <b>do</b> not turn white or only partially change colour in winter. They inhabit Transcaucasia, from western Kazakhstan to Semirechye {{and in the}} flat deserts of Middle Asia. They are also found in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians <b>either</b> <b>do</b> not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that <b>either</b> <b>do</b> not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that self-regulation relies on glucose as a limited energy source, such that self-regulation is impaired when glucose is lower and is improved when glucose is higher. Two studies examined whether levels of oxygen, the other primary {{energy for the}} brain, also influences self-regulation. While completing the Stroop task, participants breathed through a paper bag that <b>either</b> <b>did</b> or did not reduce oxygen levels (Study 1) or, while completing a measure of prejudice, participants breathed through a paper bag that <b>either</b> <b>did</b> or did not reduce oxygen levels and that <b>either</b> <b>did</b> or did not have increased oxygen flowing through it (Study 2). Results indicated that these manipulations of oxygen levels did not influence Stroop performance or prejudice. Minor fluctuations in oxygen levels thus {{do not appear to}} influence self-regulation...|$|R

5|$|Under the IIHF, {{there are}} three levels for member organizations. The highest level, {{and the only one}} in which members can vote at the IIHF Congresses, is the IIHF Full Members. These nations have their own {{independent}} hockey association, and regularly participate in the various IIHF-sanctioned World Championships. IIHF Associate Members is the second level. These nations <b>either</b> <b>do</b> not have their own independent hockey association, or have one, but have limited participation in the World Championships. The third level, IIHF Affiliate Members, is for nations that only participate in the Inline Hockey World Championships.|$|E
5|$|The German Army entered Vilnius on 24 June 1941, as part {{of their}} {{invasion}} of Russia in World War II. After their arrival, Gens was put in charge of the Jewish hospital. The occupying authorities ordered the creation of the Judenrat, or Jewish Council, with community-selected members. In early September 1941, the Germans murdered most of the Judenrat, which left the Jewish community leaderless before and during the relocation of the Jews into two ghettos in Vilnius. During this period, the hospital sheltered several prominent Jews from Vilnius. When the ghettos were formed, the Jewish hospital was included {{within the confines of the}} larger ghetto, an unusual arrangement for a Nazi-period ghetto. Most ghettos were organized to exclude any Jewish hospitals, forcing the inhabitants to <b>either</b> <b>do</b> without a hospital or set up a makeshift one.|$|E

25|$|Subjects with a {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} <b>either</b> <b>do</b> {{not produce}} enough {{of one of}} the eleven enzymes required to break down these sugar chains into simpler molecules, or they produce enzymes that do not work properly. Over time, these glycosaminoglycans collect in the cells, blood and connective tissues. The result is permanent, progressive cellular damage which affects appearance, physical abilities, organ and system functioning, and, in most cases, mental development.|$|E
25|$|In {{all other}} cases, {{where the two}} {{components}} <b>either</b> <b>do</b> {{not have the same}} amplitudes and/or their phase difference is neither zero nor a multiple of 90°, the polarization is called elliptical polarization because the electric vector traces out an ellipse in the plane (the polarization ellipse). This is shown in the above figure on the right. Detailed mathematics of polarization is done using Jones calculus and is characterised by the Stokes parameters.|$|E

25|$|Many electrophilic substitutions on {{pyridine}} <b>either</b> <b>do</b> {{not proceed}} or proceed only partially; however, the heteroaromatic character can be activated by electron-donating functionalization. Common alkylations and acylations, such as Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead {{only to the}} addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-position, {{which is the most}} electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is, therefore, more susceptible to an electrophilic addition.|$|E

In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would {{run the risk of}} forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.|$|E

25|$|Taxable {{income of}} taxpayers {{resident}} in the jurisdiction is generally total income less income producing expenses and other deductions. Generally, only net gain from sale of property, including goods held for sale, {{is included in}} income. Income of a corporation's shareholders usually includes distributions of profits from the corporation. Deductions typically include all income producing or business expenses including an allowance for recovery of costs of business assets. Many jurisdictions allow notional deductions for individuals, and may allow deduction of some personal expenses. Most jurisdictions <b>either</b> <b>do</b> not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income. Nonresidents are taxed only on certain types of income from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions.|$|E
