Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting [...] "carried away" [...] in the studio, appreciating the [...] "mad distorted and hectic" [...] sound {{they were able}} to create. Rusko said [...] "She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of crazy ideas".

500|$|According to Moody, he {{was very}} {{impressed}} with Clarkson and the song itself, saying [...] "She had these ideas already in place for songs; all <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to do was build music around them and develop them. It was quite easy." [...] Clarkson also admitted that [...] "Because of You" [...] is the most depressing song she has ever written. Despite the revelation, she told Entertainment Weekly in August 2011 {{that she wanted to}} be remembered for the song because she had to work hard to get it on Breakaway (2004) when everyone was against it. She added, [...] "I think I’m most proud of that song – just getting it on an album because no one liked it until it hit no. 1 worldwide and everybody was on board." ...|$|E
500|$|Maureen Teefy, an {{established}} actress of Irish descent, was cast as Doris Finsecker, a shy and uptight Jewish girl. De Silva disagreed with Teefy's casting, stating, [...] "...I'd envisioned [...] as a 16-or 17-year-old Barbra Streisand from Brooklyn, and when [...] cast this Irish actress {{that was a}} trouble... that was my only reservation; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> envisioned {{she was a young}} Barbra Streisand, a Jewish girl." [...] Parker and the casting department had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Hilary Van Doren. Antonia Franceschi, who had previously acted as a background dancer in the musical Grease (1978), secured the role based on the strength of her audition. Meg Tilly appears in her acting debut as a principal dancer. In his first credited screen role, Peter Rafelson, son of Bob Rafelson, appears as a principal musician and vocalist.|$|E

Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl speak for itself, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> fun making this record, and I thought it might interest you {{to know something about}} each song. After all, I wouldn't want to be a chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E

500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them... but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E

[...] In moving to Chelsea, Gullit played an important part in the [...] "foreign revolution" [...] as numerous high-profile international stars, such as the Italian superstar Gianfranco Zola who became a Chelsea legend, and the Dutch magician Dennis Bergkamp, joined FA Premier League clubs and helped to increase its worldwide profile.|$|E

2500|$|Jennifer Judith Jones {{was born}} to Larry and Carol Jones who were both curlers. She also has a sister named Heather 18 months older. During her childhood, she was often {{described}} as [...] "shy". Larry Jones started teaching Jones when she was 11 although Jones' interest of the sport took up before that, in a daycare at the St. Vital Curling Club. She attended General Vanier School in South Winnipeg from kindergarten to grade 8. After, she attended Windsor Park Collegiate. At that point, Jones was proficient at Volleyball and Curling. [...] "When I {{was in high school}} <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to make a choice and it was actually my volleyball coach who told me I had to choose either volleyball or curling, and I chose curling."

2500|$|Several {{months later}} in July {{of the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that Ciara would be reuniting with L.A. Reid by signing to his Epic Records label. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace at the start of her career, and played a role in executively producing her debut album Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine officially confirmed Ciara's signing to Epic in September 2011. During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying [...] "It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, and I think my fans deserve that. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to be in a comfortable place, and I really am and I'm excited about it, that's the beauty of music. Music is like really being able to express yourself. I {{wanted to make sure that}} I expressed myself in the best way that I could, and I let the music also be a healing process for me at points. There's a lot of happy moments as well, so that's what it's about. That's music. You laugh, you cry, you dance, you love, you hurt, you feel all kinds of things. That's the beauty of music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robinson came {{to teach}} at Howard University after {{delivering}} a lecture there in February 1979. Impressed with his knowledge and force of personality, students formed a committee to investigate his background, then met with faculty to discuss their findings. The joint student-faculty group then petitioned Howard University President James E. Cheek to hire Robinson as the next dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. Robinson joined Howard in September 1979. During his tenure as dean, he expanded the curriculum, organized the African American Architect Initiative, and established a program to encourage D.C. schoolchildren to choose a career in urban design and planning. Robinson has long advocated equal access for African-American architects, but argues that black architects should seek work {{where they can get}} it. [...] "I don't want to ask for anything. It's embarrassing to me," [...] he told Newsday in 1991. [...] "I have a new sense of being a radical. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to, with the barrage of negative press and complaints of what we don't have. I'm tired of it. ... We simply aren't going to get large corporate work. That's a different network. But we have our own network. We have the black church, we have the black sororities and fraternities. Of course we want equal access, but no profession is without its barriers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E
