25|$|The Monroe Epic {{programmable}} calculator {{came on the}} market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached <b>floor-standing</b> logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions.

Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a {{programmable calculator}} from a computer.|$|E

50|$|The Monroe EPIC was a {{programmable}} calculator that {{came on the}} market in the 1960s. It consisted of a large desktop unit which attached to a <b>floor-standing</b> logic tower, and was capable of being programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However the only form of a branching instruction available was a hard-coded unconditional branch (GOTO) that always executed at program completion (the end of the operation stack) to return to the starting instruction of the program (looped back to beginning of operation stack). This made the creation of conditional branching logic, such as IF-THEN-ELSE, impossible.|$|E

50|$|While fairly {{uncommon}} in modernity, during the 17th century tulipieres {{were used to}} grow tulip bulbs indoors and were common pieces of decorative art that could often {{be found in the}} houses of European elites. After the advent of large-scale global trade in the 17th century, numerous flower bulbs from Asia such as the tulip, crocus, and hyacinth became luxury items in Europe and these bulbs remained an exotic novelty {{until the end of the}} 17th century. Large <b>floor-standing</b> pyramid-shaped tulipieres were particularly ornate and were used as a status symbol to indicate the owner's wealth.|$|E
5000|$|The Wells {{light was}} a typical {{blowlamp}} in principle, consisting of a <b>floor-standing</b> fuel tank with the burner on a tall post above it. It was distinguished by its large size, the more common plumber's blow lamp being a hand-held tool of about a pint in capacity. Wells lights were made {{in a number of}} sizes, the smallest Nº1 being of 800 candlepower with a 15 inch flame. Weighing 75 lb when filled, it was advertised as [...] "can be carried by a boy". The largest Nº3 produced 2,000 candlepower, weighed 240 lbs, and was available with barrow wheels for portability.|$|E
5000|$|These tape drives were {{mechanically}} sophisticated <b>floor-standing</b> drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long U-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these U-shaped tape loops, extremely rapid {{start and stop}} of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in films and television.|$|E
50|$|Callan {{sold about}} a {{thousand}} units in various models, including the Unistar 100, 200, and 300. The 100 and 200 models, first delivered in 1982, used the desktop chassis/CRT combination with Multibus backplane, with a list price of about $12,000. The 300 model of 1985 was a <b>floor-standing</b> chassis using dumb terminals, and sold for about $20,000. CPU speeds were typically 8 MHz, with 256KB to 2MB of main memory, and from 10MB to 43MB of hard disk storage. A 400 model using 360MB Fujitsu hard drives was prototyped. UNIX V7 was originally ported to the Unistars, and later UNIX System V; all the Uniplus ports were provided by UniSoft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} DRS was the DRS 20 {{produced in}} Utica, New York and launched in September 1981. This ran the proprietary DRX (Distributed Resource Executive) operating system. The basic 'intelligent terminal' (model 10/110/210) used 8-bit 8085 processors (workstation, application and network processors), each with between 32 KB and 128 KB of memory. The Model 210 {{also had an}} 80188 application processor with 512 KB to run CP/M. The larger models 20 and 40 had floppy disk drives. The <b>floor-standing</b> models 50, 150, and 250 had hard disks, from which diskless models booted. In early models, these were 8" [...] floppy disks, and later 5¼" [...] disks.|$|E

Vaillant UK (former Hepworth Heating before 2002, with headquarters in Remscheid) make Glow-worm boilers on the A609 near Belper School. Abel Systems in North Wingfield make demountable systems for trucks.|$|E
5000|$|Early IBM tape drives, {{such as the}} IBM 727 and IBM 729, were {{mechanically}} sophisticated <b>floor-standing</b> drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these u-shaped tape loops, fast start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5 ms from stopped tape to full speed of 112.5 in/s m/s. The fast acceleration is possible because the tape mass in the vacuum columns is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high inertia reels. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in movies and television.|$|E
