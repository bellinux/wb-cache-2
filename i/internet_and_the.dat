5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available on the <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{produced}} during a photo shoot which remains the most expensive one to be ever developed in Romania, with the total costs amounting to €15,000. It was shot by Edward Aninaru at the Media Pro Pictures studios in Buftea. Over 50 male and female models were featured in the shooting, which consisted of two different images — an uncensored one leaked onto the <b>internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> photograph used to commercialize the album. The artwork portrays Inna standing {{in the center of}} a background with semi-nude models wearing a red-black suit, long boots and a French-like bun.|$|E

25|$|Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, {{including}} baseball cards, {{exploded in}} price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading.

Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means {{of making a living}} was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s virtual {{airlines}} utilized {{manual processes}} for reporting flights and tracking statistics for members, progressing through to online databases in 2000, and since 2010 {{the trend has}} been towards automated flight statistics integrated into the flight simulation software. One of these automated systems is the ACARS system. Pilots complete their flight, say in Microsoft Flight Simulator, while connected to the <b>internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> software tracks the flight {{as well as the}} pilots actions. At the completion of the flight the data is sent to the virtual airlines server and then processed into the online database. This has streamlined participation and opened up new avenues for statistics and tracking, enhancing realism for those involved.|$|E
25|$|Technology can {{be viewed}} as an {{activity}} that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> computer. Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.|$|E
