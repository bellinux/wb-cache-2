30|$|We used a {{split-plot design}} to {{elucidate}} tornado and fire effects on {{large and small}} stands of cane. Our first fixed effect was stand type, for which we differentiated among stands {{that occurred in the}} large tornado blowdown versus those under intact forest canopy, and also by their area (small, discrete stands versus large, continuous stands). The result was three <b>stand</b> types: small <b>forest</b> <b>stands,</b> blowdown stands (all of which were initially small), and large <b>forest</b> <b>stands.</b> At first census, the small <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> and blowdown stands ranged in area from 11.1 m 2 to 6985 m 2, with a median of 133.2 m 2; these were separated by tens to hundreds of meters, by roads or watercourses or both. The areas of large, continuous stands was indeterminable by definition as they covered large areas with diffuse borders. We previously demonstrated that cane stands grow outward at similar rates of radial expansion whether or not under forest canopy (Gagnon et al. 2007); being larger in area, we surmised that large <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> had expanded longer and were therefore demographically older.|$|R

500|$|In {{selectively}} logged eucalypt {{forests in}} the central highlands of Victoria, {{it has been estimated}} that about 3–5% of the forest area is [...] "moderately to severely affected" [...] by Armillaria root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by A.luteobubalina was rare, and only accounted for 1% of mortality in total. In this instance, the cases had been restricted to Eucalyptus nitens on the Dorrigo Plateau. Unlike other Armillaria species found in Australia's native forests, which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species, A.luteobubalina is a primary pathogen, and can infect healthy trees. Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above-ground symptoms, making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a <b>forest</b> <b>stand.</b> Surveys are usually conducted in autumn, to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars on the trees, and the appearance of fruit bodies. Several factors, however—such as cost, variable on-site conditions, and non-symptomatic diseased trees—make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections. One study showed that above-ground examinations detected only 50% of the trees actually infected, leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20–40%. The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30-year-old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40–45% incidence of infection.|$|E
500|$|Researchers {{reported}} finding Armillaria gallica in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in {{the early}} 1990s, during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of extremely low frequency radio stations, which were being investigated {{as a means to}} communicate with submerged submarines. In one particular <b>forest</b> <b>stand,</b> Armillaria-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as A.gallica (then known as A.bulbosa). Using molecular genetics, they determined that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to examine isolates collected from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along [...] transects in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or clone, that had reached its size through vegetative growth. In their conclusion the authors noted: [...] "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth." [...] After the Nature paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; {{as a result of this}} publicity, the individual acquired the common name [...] "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood.|$|E
