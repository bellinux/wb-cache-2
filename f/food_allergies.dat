40|$|The {{effect of}} food {{introduction}} timing {{on the development}} of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> remains controversial. We sought to examine whether the presence of childhood eczema changes the relationship between timing of food introduction and <b>food</b> <b>allergy.</b> The analysis includes 960 children recruited as part of a family-based <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> cohort. <b>Food</b> <b>allergy</b> was determined by objective symptoms developing within 2 hours of ingestion, corroborated by skin prick testing/specific IgE. Physician diagnosis of eczema and timing of formula and solid food introduction were obtained by standardized interview. Cox Regression analysis provided hazard ratios for the development of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> for the same subgroups. Logistic regression models estimated the association of eczema and formula/food introduction with the risk of <b>food</b> <b>allergy,</b> individually and jointly. Of the 960 children, 411 (42. 8 %) were allergic to 1 or more foods and 391 (40. 7 %) had eczema. Children with eczema had a 8. 4 -fold higher risk of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> (OR, 95 % CI: 8. 4, 5. 9 – 12. 1).

However, {{data on the}} actual situation of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> in young adult students are limited in Japan. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the actual situation of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> in young adults. Methods: <b>Food</b> <b>allergy</b> was examined, along with the presence or absence of allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma complicating <b>food</b> <b>allergy,</b> in 2053 Japanese university students. Results: <b>Food</b> <b>allergy</b> was noted in 5. 2 % of subjects, with a higher prevalence in female students. In terms of the causative allergen, the rank order of incidence was egg, buckwheat, shrimp, crab, mackerel, milk, yam, beef fat, shellfish and other foods. In comparison with Western countries, the incidence of allergy to buckwheat and seafood tended to be higher. Among students with a <b>food</b> <b>allergy,</b> the proportion of those with allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma was 45. 8, 29. 0 and 12. 1 %, respectively, showing higher prevalences than in students without any <b>food</b> <b>allergy.</b> Conclusion: In the future, the number of young adults with <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> complicated by other allergic diseases will increase and measures against this issue seem to be necessary...|$|R
40|$|Background. <b>Food</b> <b>allergy</b> {{is related}} to poorer quality of life (QoL) and mental health of caregivers. Many parents {{diagnose}} <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> in their child without seeking medical care and there is limited research on this group. This study investigated parental QoL and mental health in {{parents of children with}} parent-diagnosed <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> (PA), medically diagnosed <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> (MA), and a control group with no allergy (NA). Methods. One hundred and fifty parents from a general population completed validated measures of QoL, anxiety, depression, and stress. Results. Parents of children with <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> (PA or MA) reported higher stress, anxiety, and depression than the control group (all p< 0. 05). Parents of children with MA reported poorer <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> related QoL compared to parents of children with PA (p< 0. 05); parents of children with PA reported poorer general QoL compared to parents of children with MA (p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Parents of children with <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> have significantly poorer mental health compared to healthy controls, irrespective of whether <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> is medically diagnosed or not. It is important to encourage parents to have their child medically tested for <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> and to recognise and refer for psychological support where needed...|$|R
40|$|True <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> is less {{prevalent}} than common ly perceived. Up to 34 % {{of individuals}} or parents {{think that they}} or a family member has a <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> and 22 % avoid particular foods because the food may possibly contain an allergen. However, only 1 6 % of persons test positive on full evaluation, which may include doubleblind placebocontrolled food challenges. [14] Epidemiology of IgE-mediated <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> The prevalence of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> varies significantly based on geographical region, allergens tested, diagnostic criteria, population age and concurrent atopic conditions. [5] Variations in <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> definitions and inconsistencies in study design make studies on <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> prevalence difficult to compare. Self reporting significantly overestimates <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> prevalence up to 10 fold;[4] hence, objective measurements are necessary to establish a true <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> diagnosis. Similarly, sensitisation to foods {{is much higher than}} clinically relevant allergies; therefore, sensitisation should always be combined with more objective information to prove <b>allergies.</b> <b>Food</b> challenge testing is the optimal way of proving <b>food</b> <b>allergy,</b> albeit labour and cost intensive. Recent large populationbased studies, such as the EuroPrevall study in Europe[6] and HealthNuts study in Australia,[7] have used food challenge testing and can be considered flagship studies of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> prevalence. Prevalence of <b>food</b> <b>allergy</b> Despite the large number of foods that can cause immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated reactions, most prevalence studies have focused on the most common allergenic foods, i. e. cow’s milk, hen’s egg, peanut, tree nut, wheat, soya, fish and shellfish. [8] <b>Food</b> <b>allergy</b> peaks during {{the first two years of}} life, and then diminishes towards late childhood as tolerance to several foods develops over time.
