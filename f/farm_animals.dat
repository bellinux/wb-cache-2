She cares for two pet rats, Sir Edward and Basil, and a cat named Fish/Fishy, and endorses companies such as Manic Panic and Samson Tech.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of <b>farm</b> <b>animals,</b> which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E

5|$|<b>Farm</b> <b>animals</b> such as {{cows and}} horses {{as well as}} pet animals are also {{susceptible}} {{to the effects of}} lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of <b>farm</b> <b>animals,</b> and laws and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
50|$|The anti-cruelty {{provisions}} of the Animal Welfare Act 2013 apply to <b>farmed</b> <b>animals.</b> The Law also contains legislation dealing specifically with <b>farmed</b> <b>animals,</b> including requirements for holding areas that meet animals' needs and provide freedom of movement for eating, drinking, resting, and protection from the elements. Secondary legislation created under the Minister for Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries makes species-specific provisions for rearing, livestock transportation, and slaughter. Legislation on <b>farmed</b> <b>animals</b> largely exists to comply with European Union (EU) regulations on <b>farmed</b> <b>animal</b> welfare; however, Denmark's laws go beyond EU requirements in some cases, as in its removal of the religious exemption for stunning prior to slaughter.|$|R

The farm offices make up the north wing, to fully enclose the square but gently south-sloping yard.|$|E
5|$|The {{organs of}} <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E

5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This paper {{identifies}} the dilemmas experienced by government veterinarians during their investigations of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare incidents that involve herd owner social, health, and/or psychological difficulties. The paper builds on exploratory qualitative {{research into the}} impact of these difficulties on <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare. Design: The study used a qualitative research approach. Focus groups were conducted. Setting: In Ireland, an Early Warning System (EWS), which brings together relevant agencies, is in place to identify and prevent <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare problems before they become critical. This study is concerned with the experiences of government veterinarians who respond to <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare incidents. Specific focus is on incidents that involve herd owner social/ psychological/health-related difficulties. Participants: In total, n= 18 government veterinarians (representing 15 per cent of the population sample), all with a keen interest in <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare, participated. These were {{selected on the basis of}} their interest, experience, and involvement in <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare. One government veterinarian declined to participate. Four focus groups were conducted with government veterinarians. These took place in the south (S), south-west (SW), midlands (M), and north-west region of Ireland (NW). All 16 District Veterinary Offices (DVOs) were represented in the focus groups. Results: The results reveal three professional dilemmas that exist for government veterinarians: (1) defining professional parameters; (2) determining the appropriate response; (3) involvement versus detachment. Participants reported not wanting any additional training. Instead, it was agreed that a formal bridge to social service providers who have the professional capability to respond appropriately and with confidence, was required. Conclusions: Clearly defined guidelines are required for government veterinarians in their encounters with <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare incidents where there is a complex human component. A coordinated multiagency approach that is flexible enough to meet the needs of individual <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare cases is required. ...|$|R
40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 {{animal welfare}} {{movement}} 2 ̆ 2 {{has been gaining}} impetus recently in Western Europe and the U. S. Concern about the moral status and treatment of animals in research laboratories and on confinement farms has brought increasing public activism, a burgeoning of animal welfare organizations, and legislative deliberations. Yet sociologists have failed to place the movement on their research agenda. Despite sociological relevance from a social movement perspective, the potential for <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare legislation that will impact the livestock industry lends the phenomenon special important for rural sociology;This study provides data {{on the status of}} the <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare issue in Iowa. Mail survey data were collected in 1985 from representative samples of rural and urban Iowans. Participants in the study included 536 farm residents, 221 open-country nonfarm residents, and 324 city residents. Factors hypothesized to be important determinants of support for <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare legislation were age, education, gender, residence, environmentalism, moral orientation toward animals, perception of a <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare problem, and support for the animal welfare movement. These arguements were tested using a linear structural relationship (LISREL) model, with multiple indicators of the key variables;Residence was found to be an important predictor of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare attitudes, while age, education and gender contributed relatively little to this explanation. Urban residence was associated with a moral orientation toward animals, perception of a <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare problem, and support for <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare legislation. The next highest levels on these attitudinal dimensions were from open-country nonfarm respondents. Farm residents collectively displayed the most conservative stance toward the animal welfare issues. These findings of residential differences suggest the potential for considerable public turmoil along residential lines, in Iowa and elsewhere, over <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare issues...|$|R

5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, <b>farm</b> <b>animals,</b> and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is in the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b> Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} of <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that the consumption of <b>farmed</b> <b>animal</b> products must be curtailed to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This paper argues that a careful assessment of the different emissions produced by different actual and potential diets is needed to evaluate whether or not restricting the consumption of <b>farmed</b> <b>animal</b> products could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and if so, by how much. It is also argued {{that the question of}} whether or not the consumption of <b>farmed</b> <b>animal</b> products should be restricted must be addressed in the light of information derived from various sustainability indicators, rather than on the basis of a narrow focus on greenhouse gas emissions. A case study from the UK is used to develop a broader understanding of how dietary modifications might reduce a range of problems associated with the consumption of <b>farmed</b> <b>animal</b> products. It is argued that even more comprehensive studies of the different Global Health Impacts (GHIs) are needed to assess the merits and demerits associated with the consumption of <b>farmed</b> <b>animal</b> products.
