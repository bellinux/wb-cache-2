5000|$|Descending from Le Plaret, {{the group}} left the glacier, {{successfully}} passed the crevasse zone, unroped and ate a meal. Afterwards, Cordier went ahead. In {{front of his}} horrified companions, he performed a standing glissade down a steep snow slope above the <b>glacial</b> <b>torrent</b> of La Clause below the surface. The snow surface broke suddenly and Cordier was carried away by the white water under the ice and drowned. Jakob Anderegg was lowered into the twelve-foot hole on a rope, but could find no trace of Cordier and nearly suffocated before being pulled up. According to Henri Béraldi, Cordier had very poor eyesight, but refused glasses due to vanity. As he amused himself by slipping on the snowy slope, he was alerted by his guides and replied, [...] "Ne vous inquiétez pas, je vais m'arrêter sur ce rocher noir" [...] ("Do not worry, I'll stop on the black rock"). Unfortunately for Cordier, the rock in reality was a hole.|$|E
5000|$|In Italy, an {{intermittent}} stream is termed a torrent [...] In full flood the stream {{may or may}} not be [...] "torrential" [...] in the dramatic sense of the word, but there will be one or more seasons in which the flow is reduced to a trickle or less. Typically torrents have Apennine rather than Alpine sources, and in the summer they are fed by little precipitation and no melting snow. In this case the maximum discharge will be during the spring and autumn. However, there are also <b>glacial</b> <b>torrents</b> with a different seasonal regime.|$|R
5000|$|When the <b>glacial</b> <b>torrents</b> found {{cracks in}} the hard capstone, the water poured through to flush out the soft middle layer. This left long tunnels where the gorges are today. Eventually, {{the weight of the}} tops caused them to come {{crashing}} down. The [...] "slump rocks" [...] in the gorges today are what’s left of the hard top layer. In just a few centuries, the rushing waters of the glacier carved the soft middle layer of sandstone into the myriad dimples and wrinkles that decorate the cliffs and grottos today.Early settlers in Muskingum County found an ancient black human handprint on a cliff that is part of this same sandstone formation. That is the same [...] "Black Hand Sandstone" [...] that is seen in six areas of the Hocking Hills State Park.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{geocoding}} of Earth observing (EO) {{satellite imagery}} is one major prerequisite {{to monitor the}} Earth’s environment. The quality of the obtained geocoded images depends on {{the accuracy of the}} sensor model parameters and the accuracy of the used height information. As for monitoring applications automated image processing chains are desired this paper concentrates on the automatisation of the required measurement ground control points (GCPs). Moreover, several methods to make least squares adjustment a robust estimator are presented. To improve the performance of the robust estimation with respect to the reduction of computational effort and reduction of number of GCPs needed, the use of the median absolute deviation is introduced. The presented general geocoding workflow and the proposed enhancements are tested using an ENVISAT-ASAR scene of the highly active Neovolcanic Zone of Southern Iceland. This test site, prone to natural hazards like volcanic eruptions and massive <b>glacial</b> <b>torrents</b> is equipped with a network of artificial corner reflectors enabling a detailed verification of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R
