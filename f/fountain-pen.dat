60|$|It was a pathetic, {{a tragic}} letter, {{the letter of}} a woman endeavouring to express all the anguish of a torn heart {{with one of those}} <b>fountain-pens</b> which suspend the flow of ink about twice in every three words.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, better copying methods {{had become}} available. Consequently, the copying pencil was being used as an {{indelible}} pencil, a precursor to the ball-point pen. When used dry, it left a slightly-purplish gray mark on paper, not dissimilar to a lead pencil's, but which could not be erased. When used wet, its tip moistened repeatedly by water or saliva, it produced a bright purple writing. The copying pencil served as a convenient substitute for the fountain-pen: it could be carried on one's person without need for ink or fear of leaks. Furthermore, for producing copies using carbon paper, copying pencils were considered superior to both ordinary pencils (whose writing in the original could be erased) and <b>fountain-pens</b> (whose nibs could not always withstand the pressure needed to produce the carbon-copy).|$|R

60|$|I {{always used}} to think that {{publishers}} had to be devilish intelligent fellows, loaded down with the grey matter; but I've got their number now.

6000|$|Carl looked back. He {{clenched his}} fist and pounded the soft side of it on his thigh, drawing in his breath, puffing {{it out with a}} long exasperated [...] "Hellll!" [...] For the Greek professor, the comma-sized, sandy-whiskered martinet, to whom nothing that was new was moral and nothing that was old was to be {{questioned}} by any undergraduate, stalked into the room like indignant Napoleon posing before two guards and a penguin at St. Helena. A student in the back row thriftily gave the Greek god his seat. The god sat down, with a precise nod. Instantly a straggly man with a celluloid collar left the group by the door, whisked over to the Greek professor, and fawned upon him. It was the fearless editor and owner (also part-time type-setter) of the Plato Weekly Times, who dated {{back to the days of}} Washington flat-bed hand-presses and pure Jeffersonian politics, and feared neither man nor devil, though he was uneasy in the presence of his landlady. He ostentatiously flapped a wad of copy-paper in his left hand, and shook a spatter of ink-drops from a <b>fountain-pen</b> as he interviewed the Greek professor, who could be seen answering pompously. Carl was hating them both, fearing the Greek as a faculty spy on Frazer, picturing himself kicking the editor, when he was aware of a rustling all over the room, of a general turning of heads toward the platform.|$|E
60|$|In {{the small}} hours he woke {{to one of}} his {{habitual}} revulsions. Was that, he asked himself, the sort of letter a lover should write to the beloved on her release, on the sudden long prayed-for opening of a way to her, on the end of her shameful servitude and his humiliations? He began to recall the cold and stilted sentences of that difficult composition. The gentility of it! All his life he had been a prey to gentility, had cast himself free from it, only to relapse again in such fashion as this. Would he never be human and passionate and sincere? Of course he was glad, and she ought to be glad, that Sir Isaac, their enemy and their prison, was dead; it was for them to rejoice together. He turned out of bed at last, when he could lie still under these self-accusations no longer, and wrapped himself in his warm dressing-gown and began to write. He wrote in pencil. His <b>fountain-pen</b> was as usual on his night table, but pencil seemed the better medium, and he wrote a warm and glowing love-letter that was brought to an end at last by an almost passionate fit of sneezing. He could find no envelopes in his bedroom Davenport, and so he left that honest scrawl under a paper-weight, and went back to bed greatly comforted. He re-read it in the morning with emotion, and some slight misgivings that grew after he had despatched it. He went to lunch at his club contemplating a third letter that should be sane and fine and sweet, and that should rectify the confusing effect of those two previous efforts. He wrote this letter later in the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|For three privileged years I lived all but next-door {{neighbor}} of Doctor Holmes {{in that part}} of Beacon Street whither he removed after he left his old home in Charles Street, and during these years I saw him rather often. We were both on the water side, which means so much more than the words say, and our library windows commanded the same general view of the Charles rippling out into the Cambridge marshes and the sunsets, and curving eastward under Long Bridge, through shipping that increased onward to the sea. He said that you could count fourteen towns and villages in the compass of that view, with the three conspicuous monuments accenting the different attractions of it: the tower of Memorial Hall at Harvard; the obelisk on Bunker Hill; and in the centre of the picture that bulk of Tufts College which he said he expected to greet his eyes the first thing when he opened them in the other world. But the prospect, though generally the same, had certain precious differences for each of us, which I have no doubt he valued himself as much upon as I did. I have a notion that he fancied these were to be enjoyed best in his library through two oval panes let into the bay there apart from the windows, for he was apt to make you come and look out of them if you got to talking of the view before you left. In this pleasant study he lived among the books, which seemed to multiply from case to case and shelf to shelf, and climb from floor to ceiling. Everything was in exquisite order, and the desk where he wrote was as scrupulously neat as if the sloven disarray of most authors' desks were impossible to him. He had a number of ingenious little contrivances for helping his work, which he liked to show you; for a time a revolving book-case at the corner of his desk seemed to be his pet; and after that came his <b>fountain-pen,</b> which he used with due observance of its fountain principle, though he was tolerant of me when I said I always dipped mine in the inkstand; it was a merit in his eyes to use a fountain pen in anywise. After you had gone over these objects with him, and perhaps taken a peep at something he was examining through his microscope, he sat down at one corner of his hearth, and invited you to an easy chair at the other. His talk was always considerate of your wish to be heard, but the person who wished to talk when he could listen to Doctor Holmes was his own victim, and always the loser. If you were well advised you kept yourself to the question and response which manifested your interest in what he was saying, and let him talk on, with his sweet smile, and that husky laugh he broke softly into at times. Perhaps he was not very well when you came in upon him; then he would name his trouble, with a scientific zest and accuracy, and pass quickly to other matters. As I have noted, he was interested in himself only on the universal side; and he liked to find his peculiarity in you better than to keep it his own; he suffered a visible disappointment if he could not make you think or say you were so and so too. The querulous note was not in his most cheerful register; he would not dwell upon a specialized grief; though sometimes I have known him touch very lightly and currently upon a slight annoyance, or disrelish for this or that. As he grew older, he must have had, of course, an old man's disposition to speak of his infirmities; but it was fine to see him catch himself up in this, when he became conscious of it, and stop short with an abrupt turn to something else. With a real interest, which he gave humorous excess, he would celebrate some little ingenious thing that had fallen in his way, and I have heard him expatiate with childlike delight upon the merits of a new razor he had got: a sort of mower, which he could sweep recklessly over cheek and chin without the least danger of cutting himself. The last time I saw him he asked me if he had ever shown me that miraculous razor; and I doubt if he quite liked my saying I had seen one of the same kind.|$|E

5000|$|A dip pen or nib pen usually {{consists}} of a metal nib with capillary channels like those of <b>fountain-pen</b> nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials {{can be used for}} the holder, including bone, metal, and plastic; some pens are made entirely of glass. Generally, dip pens have no ink reservoir, so the user must recharge the ink from an ink bowl or bottle to continue drawing or writing. There are simple, tiny tubular reservoirs that illustrators sometimes clip onto dip pens, which allow drawing for several minutes without recharging the nib. Recharging can be done by dipping into an inkwell; but some illustrators and cartoonists, who are the main users of such pens, are likelier to charge the pen with an eyedropper, a syringe, or a brush, which gives more control over the amount of ink applied. Thus, [...] "dip pens" [...] are not necessarily dipped; many illustrators call them [...] "nib pens".|$|E
40|$|A {{multifunctional}} tool which {{expands the}} application field of atomic force microscope-based surface modification is presented. The AFM-probe {{can be used}} for surface modification and in-situ characterization at the same time, due to a special configuration with two cantilevers. Various applications from different fields are presented, which were carried out with one and the same tool: in-situ characterization o f wear generated with and without local lubrication (tribology), <b>fountain-pen</b> lithography in which material is deposited or removed (physical-chemistry), and electrochemical metal deposition (electro-chemistry) ...|$|E
40|$|Contact-drop {{dispensing}} {{is central}} to many small-scale applications, such as direct-scanning probe lithography and micromachined <b>fountain-pen</b> techniques. Accurate and controllable dispensing required for nanometer-resolved surface patterning hinges on the stability and breakup of liquid bridges. Here, we analytically study the stability of catenoids pinned at one contact line with the other free to move on a substrate subject to axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations. We apply a variational formulation to derive the corresponding stability criteria. The maximal stability region and stability region are represented in the favourable and canonical phase diagrams, providing a complete description of catenoid equilibrium and stability. All catenoids are stable with respect to non-axisymmetric perturbations. For a fixed contact angle, there exists a critical volume below which catenoids are unstable to axisymmetric perturbations. Equilibrium solution multiplicity is discussed in detail, and we elucidate how geometrical symmetry {{is reflected in the}} maximal stability and stability regions...|$|E
40|$|Scanning probe {{microscopy}} (SPM) nanolithography {{has been}} found to be a powerful and low-cost approach for sub- 100 nm patterning. In this thesis, the possibility of using a state-of-the-art SPM system to controllably deposit nanoparticles on patterned Si substrates with high positional control has been explored. These nanoparticles have a range of interesting properties and have been characterised by electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy. The influence of different deposition parameters on the nanoparticle properties was studied. Contact mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) -based local oxidation nanolithography (LON) was used to oxidise sample surfaces. Two different substrates were studied which were native oxide silicon (Si) and molybdenum (Mo). A number of factors that influence the height and width of the oxide features were investigated in order to achieve the optimal oxidation efficiency. The height and width of the oxide structures were found to be strongly dependent on the applied voltage and scan speed. The tunneling AFM (TUNA) technique was used to measure the ultralow currents flowing between the tip and the sample during the oxidation process. It was found that a threshold voltage for our oxidation experiments was - 4. 0 ± 1. 6 V applied to the tip when fabricating geometric patterns as well as 2. 9 ± 1. 6 V and 2. 8 ± 2. 2 V applied to the substrate for nanodot fabrication. In addition, comparisons of nanodot-array patterns produced with different AFM tips were studied. The influence of applied voltage, type of AFM tip and substrate, humidity and ramping time has been studied for dot formation providing a comparison between native oxide Si and Mo surfaces. The nanodot sizes were found to be clearly dependent on the applied voltage, type of substrate, relative humidity and ramping time. Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) was used to study a direct deposition strategy for gold (Au) nanodot fabrication on a native oxide Si substrate. In this process, hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl 4) molecules were deposited onto the substrate via a molecular diffusion process, in the absence of electrochemical reactions. This approach allowed for the generation of Au dots on the SiO 2 substrate without the need for surface modification or additional electrode structures. The dependence of the size of the Au dots on different „scanning coating‟ (SC) times of AFM tips was studied. A thermal annealing process was used to decompose the generated HAuCl 4 molecular dots to leave Au (0) metal dots. A stereomicroscope has been used for preliminary observation of different steps of Au deposition treatments. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterise the SC AFM tips both before and after the DPN process. SEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) has provided information about the elemental content of deposited particles for different annealing temperatures. <b>Fountain-pen</b> nanolithography (FPN) has also been used to study nanowriting of HAuCl 4 salt and a variety of solvents on a native oxide Si surface. In this technique, a nanopipette was mounted within an AFM to deliver appropriate solutions to the silica substrate. We found that an aqueous Au salt solution was the most suitable ink for depositing gold using the FPN technique. In the case of solvents alone, ethanol and toluene were achieved with depositing onto a SiO 2 substrate using the FPN technique...|$|E
