2500|$|After Sun Ce {{was assassinated}} in 200 CE, Lady Wu (the mother of Sun Ce and Sun Quan) was worried that Sun Quan, who had succeeded his elder brother, would be too young to handle the {{precarious}} situation in Jiangdong. She consulted Dong Xi about her <b>incertitude,</b> and Dong emboldened her by saying, [...] "The lands in Jiangdong enjoy natural barriers from mountains and rivers, while the good government and virtue of Sun Ce have already won {{the hearts of the}} people. The young lord can build on these foundations so that everyone can follow his commands. Zhang Zhao can take charge of internal affairs, while others like me can serve as 'claws and teeth' (a euphemism for military servicemen). With both geographical advantage and popular support, there is certainly nothing to worry about." [...] His sanguine speech was applauded by many.|$|E

2500|$|The spiritual crisis {{experienced}} in France was the probable reason why Fondane refused to write poems between 1923 and 1927. As he stated in various contexts, he mistrusted the innate ability of words {{to convey the}} tragedy of existence, describing poetry as the best tool for rendering a universal [...] "wordless scream", an [...] "ultimate reality", or an eternal expression of things ephemeral. In his essays, he suggested that the invention of art, like the invention of theory and rhetoric, had deprived poets of their existential function; beyond letting themselves be guided by their art, he argued, writers needed {{to confirm that the}} principles of life, negative as well as positive, exist. He saw poets as waging an unequal battle with both scientific perspectives and moralism, urging them to place their unique faith [...] "in the mysterious virtue of poetry, in the existential virtue that poetry upholds". Rimbaud le voyou was in part a study of how, during his self-exile to Harar, Rimbaud had not merely abandoned poetry for the sake of adventure, but rather transformed his lifestyle into a poetry of <b>incertitude</b> and personal ambition. As Fondane explained in his Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre, a poet and thinker could also evidence the abyss he faced, and alleviate his own anxiety, through the use of irony: [...] "Laugh in the face of tragedy, or disappear!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Apart {{from his}} {{academic}} career, Jean Carbonnier {{was also a}} writer: his book Les <b>incertitudes</b> du jeune Saxon. Une autofiction de Jean Carbonnier [...] was published posthumously, in 2011. This fiction shows that Jean Carbonnier {{was not only a}} theorist, but also an author of literature. This element can be perceived while reading his theoretical works about law, since he always explained his thoughts with an elegant and precise way of writing. Les <b>incertitudes</b> du jeune Saxon represents {{at the same time a}} fiction (sort of Bildungsroman) and a reflection about law and history.

Then we apply robust control techniques, and present a sufficient stability condition based on interval algebra methods that allows testing system stability by simply evaluating a time invariant matrix.
