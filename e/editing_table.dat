In order to compare and edit the ages of the persons in the same household, each household with more than 3 persons is converted into a threeperson household. We will discuss how the edit system is used to incorporate the age comparison into an <b>edit</b> <b>table,</b> which is the input of the system. The DISCRETE edit system is based on the Fellegi and Holt model [1976] of editing. Advantages of using the DISCRETE edit system include that the logical consistency of the edit system can be performed before the real production begins and that an <b>edit</b> <b>table</b> is used as an input file instead of the if-then-else rules...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s, it {{was learned}} that Eisenstein's wife, Pera Attasheva, had saved splices of film from the <b>editing</b> <b>table</b> {{that was used}} for Bezhin Meadow. Starting in 1964, a {{reconstruction}} of the film was created and set to a musical score by Sergei Prokofiev by Russian film director Sergei Yutkevich with Eisenstein scholar Naum Kleiman. The film was edited to the original script, to preserve the original cutting continuity; new intertitles were also created from the script, and a new spoken introduction was added. The film now exists as a 35-minute [...] "silent film slide show". In 1988, the filming of Bezhin Meadow {{was the focus of}} a retrospective at the Tisch School of the Arts in New York City.

The foreman seeing that the piece was not only about [...] "the Sanitary spree" [...] surrounding the Flour Sack, but was written in the hand of the acting editor in chief, so he published it without Twain's knowledge. As he did not bother to read the Enterprise every day, Twain told Mollie he had no knowledge that the piece made the paper until the paper received the angry reply from the ladies of Carson City. Twain told Mollie he was stuck and unable to do anything to resolve the situation, for he couldn't admit [...] "that I & all concerned were drunk. No—I'll die first."

The major letdown in remake comes mainly from the script work and the direction. The script with more tongue-tied anxiety than sense, fails to capture the nature of the original and G Nageswara Reddy spineless guiding comes across as more concerned with perceived commercial viability rather than pure story-telling craft. The film received positive feedback from fans as well as audience.
