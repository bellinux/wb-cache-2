5000|$|In the 19th {{century and}} beyond, it was usual in many {{countries}} that voters did not directly vote the members of parliament. In Prussia for example, in 1849-1918 the voters were Urwähler (original voters), appointing with their vote a Wahlmann (elector). The group of electors in a district elected the deputy for the Prussian House of Representatives. Such <b>indirect</b> <b>suffrage</b> was a means to steer the voting, {{to make sure that}} the electors were [...] "able" [...] persons. For electors, the requirements were usually higher than for the original voters. The left wing opposition was very much opposed to <b>indirect</b> <b>suffrage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|De Gaulle {{was elected}} President of the French Republic {{and of the}} African and Malagasy Community on 21 December 1958 by <b>indirect</b> <b>suffrage.</b> He was {{invested}} on 8 January 1959. In the meanwhile, de Gaulle had met the German chancellor Konrad Adenauer on 14 September 1958; had sent a memorandum to US President Dwight D. Eisenhower on 17 September 1958, recalling his will of national independence; he also took financial measures on 27 December 1958 to reduce the state deficit, and, in Algeria, called for the [...] "peace of the brave" [...] (paix des braves) in October 1958.|$|E
50|$|The Vinieru episode came {{shortly after}} the democratization reforms {{initiated}} by Brătianu, which had increased representation for the middle classes, rural ones included, and merged the lower two electoral colleges into a Third. Such enfranchisement came with its own limitations: some 98% of the electorate could only vote for Assembly with <b>indirect</b> <b>suffrage,</b> the rest being excluded from this by wealth and literacy requirements; some 41% of the deputies elected under these new laws represented rural constituencies, {{but most of them}} were not land-working peasants. By Dobrescu's own calculations, there was still a 1:20,000 ratio of representation in the new college, whereas the upper two had 1:180 and 1:421, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Elections for the ad-hoc Divan {{were held}} in Wallachia in September 1857. They {{restored}} a liberalizing trend that had been repressed following the 1848 revolution, also giving expression to the national awakening that was taking part among the Romanians. The toppling of the conservative Regulamentul Organic regime in both Danubian Principalities made them possible: following the 1856 Treaty of Paris, Wallachia and Moldavia functioned as a protectorates of the European powers; both were also clients of the Ottoman Empire. Excluding the spontaneous rallies of 1848, {{this was the first}} public consultation to be held in eleven years. It ran in conjunction with the Moldavian Divan elections, and, like them, had unusually lax criteria for participation, allowing peasants and guilds to vote by <b>indirect</b> <b>suffrage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Senate of Kazakhastan (Қазақстан Парламентінің Сенаты, Qazaqstan Parlamentiniñ Senatı) is {{the upper}} house of two {{chambers}} in Kazakhstan's legislature, {{known as the}} Parliament (Parlamenti). The Senate is composed of elected members - two from each region, the city of republican importance (Almaty) and {{the capital city of}} the Republic of Kazakhstan at joint sessions of the members of all representative bodies of respective regions, city of the republican importance and the capital city of the Republic. Members of the Senate are elected on the basis of <b>indirect</b> <b>suffrage</b> by secret ballot. Half of elected members of the Senate are up for election every three years. Fifteen members are appointed by the President of Kazakhstan with the view to ensure representation for all the diverse national, cultural components of society. The term of office for the members of the Senate is 6 years. According to constitutional norms in the Parliament of the fifth convocation, members of the Senate elected in 2011 and 2014 and those appointed by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2011 and 2013 continue to hold office.|$|E

50|$|The {{appointment}} of the councilors was by <b>indirect</b> census <b>suffrage</b> {{at the rate}} of 1 for each of the 5 provinces that formed the newly created nation on two levels (Santo Domingo, Santiago or Cibao, Azua, La Vega and El Seibo). Counselors would last 6 years and could be re-elected indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|On April 12, 1917 the Russian Provisional Government {{issued an}} {{order on the}} {{provisional}} autonomy of Estonia. The Governorate of Estonia, comprising what is now northern Estonia was merged with the Estophone {{northern part of the}} Governorate of Livonia, to form the autonomous governorate. The Russian Provisional Government decreed that a provincial assembly, colloquially known as the Maapäev, be created with members elected by <b>indirect</b> universal <b>suffrage.</b>|$|R
50|$|Senators {{are elected}} through <b>indirect</b> {{universal}} <b>suffrage</b> by an electoral college composed of deputies, senators, regional councillors elected within a department, councillors of the Corsican Assembly designated under conditions set out within the electoral code, councillors of the Guianese Assembly, councillors of the Martinican Assembly, and departmental councillors. Delegates of municipal councils, however, {{make up the}} large majority of the electoral college, representing 95% of the 162,000 electors. The number of delegates of the municipal councils depends on the municipal population authenticated on 1 January 2014 by the census. Delegates must be French nationals and be registered on the electoral list of the municipality in question.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} {{election}} of the Council of the Republic of the Fourth Republic, the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) group (groupe du Mouvement républicain populaire) obtained 76 seats, {{a quarter of the}} upper chamber, following senatorial elections on 8 December 1946. During the debate on the existence of the upper chamber, the MRP advocated for a bicameral system in which both the roles and modes of {{election of the}} two houses were clearly distinguished from each other, calling for the replacement of the system of <b>indirect</b> universal <b>suffrage</b> to select electors with greater representation of local collectivities. This proposal eventually prevailed despite the reluctance of certain members of the MRP, cognizant of the fact that such a system would favor it significantly less. Indeed, with a lack of representation at the local level {{as a result of the}} 1947 municipal elections in which the newly-founded Rally of the French People (RPF) of Charles de Gaulle secured a massive victory (the RPF having deprived the MRP of its flag as the party of the resistance), the MRP was reduced to just 22 seats following the senatorial elections of 7 November 1948. and never regained its former strength through the duration of the republic, with 24 seats following senatorial elections on 18 May 1952, 21 seats following senatorial elections on 19 June 1955, and 23 seats following senatorial elections on 8 June 1958.|$|R
