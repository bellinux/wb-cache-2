40|$|My {{first contact}} with Mordeckai Magaritz {{was in the}} summer of 1972, when he wrote me a letter asking about doing post-doctoral {{research}} at Caltech. Mordeckai was just finishing up his Ph. D. thesis Carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate rocks from Israel at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the direction of Joel Gat. Little did I realize at the time that Mordeckai had in fact analyzed virtually every type of limestone and dolomite in Israel, including a variety of non-sedimentary occurrences, and that he had basically delineated all of the isotopic variations in these kinds of rocks throughout the entire country. Thus, his Ph. D. thesis became a hallmark of the Magaritz approach to science, namely, picking an important problem and attacking it with careful sampling and data collection on a massive scale. Also, because of this, he and I later got along quite well together, inasmuch as <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the really lasting contributions in geochemistry are not necessarily the scientific interpretations (which can come and go), but the discovery of new phenomena, backed up by accurate analyses of carefully collected and documented samples, from areas with relatively straightforward geological relationships and good outcrops...|$|R

2500|$|Visually, the {{presentation}} of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as [...] "bombardment".

[...] Rogers composed almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he addressed common childhood fears with comforting songs and skits. For example, one of his famous songs explains how a child cannot be pulled down the bathtub drain because he or she will not fit. He even once took a trip to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. During the Gulf War (1990–91), he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for and asked parents to promise {{to take care of their}} own children. The message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Eugene Thomas from Ohio, USA, told James Powell and Roy P. Mackal in 1979 a {{story that}} {{involved}} the purported killing of a Mokèlé-mbèmbé near Lake Tele in 1959. Thomas was a missionary who {{had served in the}} Congo since 1955, gathering much of the earliest evidence and reports, and claiming to have had two close-encounters himself. Natives of the Bangombe tribe who lived near Lake Tele were said to have constructed a large spiked fence in a tributary of Tele to keep Mokèlé-mbèmbé from interfering with their fishing. A Mokele-mbembe managed to break through, though it was wounded on the spikes, and the natives then killed the creature. As William Gibbons writes, [...] "Pastor Thomas also mentioned that the two pygmies mimicked the cry of the animal as it was being attacked and speared... Later, a victory feast was held, during which parts of the animal were cooked and eaten. However, those who participated in the feast eventually died, either from food poisoning or from natural causes. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the mythification (magical powers, etc) surrounding Mokèlé-mbèmbés [...] began with this incident." [...] Furthermore, Mackal heard from witnesses that the stakes were in the same location in the tributary as of the early 1980s.|$|E

And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance.

40|$|In 2009 I {{commenced}} a phenomenological {{research study}} investigating {{the experience of}} family estrangement. At the outset, I {{was aware of the}} potentially sensitive nature of the issue under study, that participants might be experienc-ing grief reactions to the estrangement, and the likelihood that some participants would be drawn from vulnerable populations. I <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> my thoughtful planning and adherence to human ethics requirements had prepared me well for researching this population. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> my social work knowledge and skills would help me to assess vulnerabilities in potential participants, reduce any adverse reactions that participants might experience while telling their story, and guide me in relation to self-care. What I did not anticipate was the breadth and depth of vulner-ability in the population under study, and lessons I would learn about participant autonomy, self-determination, and resilience. In this article I examine the risks and challenges of researching vulnerable populations and sensitive issues, through personal reflections on a study of older people who were experiencing family estrangement. Throughout the study period research participants used a number of strategies to ensure their well-being. With this in mind, I suggest that researchers should move beyond the mini-mum standards espoused by human ethics committees by recognizing, facilitating, and collaboratively using participant knowledge, strengths, and skills to ensure safety and reduce the risk of harm. I discuss the usefulness of “strengths ” questions in assessing risk, and propose a model for reducing risk that involves the “lessons learned” from ethics committees, researchers, and the participants themselves...|$|R

The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired. Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders.

40|$|Previous studies (Madole, Eastman, Stone, 2 ̆ 6 White, 2005) have {{suggested}} that children do not make inferences about people {{on the basis of}} race until around 8 years of age. The present study was a replication of a study performed by Madole et al. The distinction between the two studies was in the sample used, hi the previous study the majority of children used were Caucasian. The present study sought to examine whether African American children were more likely to make inferences {{on the basis of race}} than Caucasian children. Children ages 6 to 11 years were asked to perform an inference task. The inference task consisted of the children looking at a target picture and two comparison sets of pictures. The children were then asked to choose which set of pictures was more comparable to the target picture based on a novel characteristic. These characteristics were social, biological, and individual in nature. There was also a control task in which trivial characteristics were used. The children were able to make their choices based on age, race, or sex. I hypothesized that the sample of African American children would more often choose their matches in the inference task based on race. I <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> this choice would be made across all characteristics as well as the control tasks. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> older children would more often make matches according to race than younger children. Lastly, I expected that the sample in the current study would more often make matches based on race than the sample in the Madole et al. study. The analyses indicated that the children in the current study made more age-based inferences than race- or sex-based inferences. They only made more race-based inferences when given social attributes. They did not make more race-based inferences than the children in the Madole et al. study...|$|R
