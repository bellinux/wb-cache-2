40|$|An {{existing}} {{furnace oil}} fired boiler {{is used to}} supply process steam to an instant tea manufacturing factory. The instant tea is manufactured the Broken Mixed Fannings (BMF) through extraction and other required processes. The average steam consumption of the plant is 6000 kg/h at 10 barg pressure. During the process, tea waste is generated at a nominal rate of 50, 000 kg/day, about 2000 kg/h at around 70 % MC content on wet basis. At the moment this waste tea is either dumped in the surrounding area by spending money or sent to landfilling purposes, which create environmental issues.    The tea waste coming out at 70 % MC wet basis, is looked at to press through continuous belt press to reduce the moisture content to about 55 % on wet basis. The water removed from this pressing process is sent to effluent treatment plant at the factory. The output from the belt press is sent to a steam operated  The average generation of tea waste from the instant tea manufacturing process process is about 2000 kg/h, after pressing in the belt press an output rate of about 1, 400 kg/h at 55 % MC. This amount of tea waste at 55 % MC is sent to a rotary steam <b>tube</b> <b>dryer</b> and the MC is reduced from 55 % to 30 % and the output rate from the steam <b>tube</b> <b>dryer</b> is about 857 kg/h. The amount of steam consumed by the rotary steam <b>tube</b> <b>dryer</b> at 6 barg pressure is 760 kg/h. Then the tea waste from the rotary <b>tube</b> <b>dryer</b> is mixed with firewood of 30 % MC and fed to the boiler to generate process steam, out of which 857 kg/h steam at 6 barg pressure is {{sent back to the}} rotary steam dryer. From tea waste alone, a steam amount of 2, 472 kg/h can be supplied after giving steam to the rotary steam dryer. The balance steam amount of 3, 528 kg/h for the process requirement is supplied by burning additional firewood at 30 % MC content. The tea waste fuel and firewood in combination have an overall moisture content of 30 % on wet basis. The boiler is rated at 10, 000 kg/h F & A 100 deg C with an actual generating capacity of about 9000 kg/h at 10 barg operating pressure at 70 deg C feed water temperature. By implementing the combination of belt press, rotary steam <b>tube</b> <b>dryer</b> and firewood boiler in place of the existing furnace oil fired boiler, an annual monetary saving of 168 Mn SLR/year can be achieved with a simple payback period of 21 months which is a highly feasibly project...|$|R

40|$|Massive gas {{injection}} (MGI) is a promising technique for reducing tokamak wall damage during disruptions, with reductions observed in both conducted wall heat loads and in halo currents, {{when compared with}} unmitigated disruptions [1]. It is unknown at present if MGI can prevent the formation and amplification of runaway electrons (RE) in future high-current tokamaks, so RE formation during MGI remains an outstanding concern. To avoid RE during MGI shutdowns, efficient delivery of injected impurities into the plasma core is desirable. This is because complete collisional suppression of RE amplification is predicted to occur at very large total (free+bound) electron densities (ncrit 1016 cm- 3 in DIII-D). To achieve a rapid gas delivery rate, a flange holding six fast-acting gas valves was installed. With all six valves fired simultaneously, up to 1000 torr-l of argon could be delivered to the plasma edge in a pulse about 3 ms long. Previous (2005 and 2006) MGI experiments have suggested that rapid gas delivery rate is crucial for achieving large core impurity densities; this was confirmed in the present experiments. Schematics of MGI valves used {{in the last three}} years are shown in Fig. 1. In 2005, a single low-flow valve was used; this delivered about 1000 torr-l of argon to the plasma edge in a pulse about 15 ms long. In 2006, a single large-flow valve was used; this delivered about 10, 000 torr-l of argon in a pulse about 10 ms long.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} solutions {{of scientific}} and practical issues for increasing energy efficiency of peat drying process in tube steam driers. Thoroughness of the solution consists in developing a method of drying peat regimes. That method should allow to dry peat to the required quality by the lowest consumption of energy. To achieve this, the analysis of drying peat factors was carried out and set of factors that have influence to the technical and economic parameters of the process was defined. In order to develop mathematical dependencies of changes of the target or output functions due {{to changes in the}} input variables, the active experiments were conducted. It was found that some features could were affected by noise during the investigation of peat drying process in steam <b>tube</b> <b>dryer.</b> The problem of features selection was resolved by using Group of Adaptive Model Evolution method. The procedure of selection models obtained from different optimization methods by solving feature?s selection criteria was developed. The values of control parameters were found by using simplex method. These parameters satisfy the criteria for energy efficiency. The number of experiments on the peat plant was limited, so there were only few data sets for getting accurate models that calculate outputs by using neural network. That is why in order to increase data set it is necessary to create a synthetic data. It was used the Monte Carlo method for generating new data set. Then there were found the structure and characteristic of neural network that solve the task of searching optimal control parameters of peat drying process. It was used a classification algorithm for classifying the data into a number of optimal operational regimes by using the experimental data, possibly extended with synthetic data. Classification functions obtained using discriminant analysis, can be classified with sufficient accuracy to the required sample class. After classifying and recognizing industrial regimes an algorithm for operating the peat drying process was developed. ??????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????????????????????? ?????????? ????? ????? ?? ???? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ?? ?????????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????????????????. ??? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ??????????????????? ???????????????? ????????? ???? ???????? ?????, ???????? ???????? ???????, ??????????? ???????? ?? ??????????????????? ?????????? ?????????????????????? ???????? ????? ????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????. ?????????????? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????????

Experiments were conducted using sand of mean particle size 507 mum. Water was injected into the sand through a tube of semicircular cross-section (internal diameter 0. 55 cm) located at the wall of the tank, forming a half jet. At sufficiently high flowrate a U-shaped fluidized region formed around the <b>jet</b> <b>tube.</b> The fluidized zone was characterized by measuring scour depth, diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth and diameter of the fluidized region at half the jet insertion depth. For a fixed jet insertion depth, increasing the jet velocity increased the scour depth, the diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth, and the diameter at half the jet insertion depth. For a fixed jet velocity, the scour depth was independent of the insertion depth, however the two diameters of the fluidized region decreased with increasing jet insertion depth. The profiles obtained for inclined jets were more asymmetric than those for vertical jets. The effectiveness of the 'up-flow washing' technique for the removal of a water-soluble contaminant (CuSO 4) from a saturated bed of sand was investigated for a vertical jet at jet velocities of 213 cm/s and 320 cm/s and jet insertion depths of 5. 5 cm and 7. 5 cm. Up-flow washing removed the contaminant from the sand bed. The cleaned region extended well beyond the boundary of the fluidized region as jet liquid leaked from the fluidized region and percolated through the fixed bed region.

Problems with speciation methods that couple chromatography to atomic spectrometric detection and how to overcome the problems are discussed. Analytical techniques primarily studied and evaluated are high performance liquid chromatography-cold vapour-atomic absorption spectrometry (HPLC-CV-AAS), HPLC-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS), capillary electrophoresis-ICP-MS (CE-ICP-MS) and gas chromatography-ICP-MS (GC-ICP-MS). Applying a multi-capillary approach increased the analyte amount injected into a CE-ICP-MS system and improved the overall sensitivity. A microconcentric nebulizer with a cyclone spray chamber was shown to improve the detection limits for mercury species 3 - 13 times in HPLC-ICP-MS and 11 - 19 times in CE-ICP-MS compared to a cross-flow nebulizer with a Scott spray chamber.

The valve is suitable only for breathing systems that require a constant gas supply. The regulator was evaluated during anaesthesia, using a modified Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo <b>jet</b> ventilation <b>tube</b> to obtain simultaneous pressure measurements within the cuff and the lumen of the tracheal tube. A greater pressure was demonstrated in the cuff than in the airway and the two traces were approximately parallel throughout the respiratory cycle. The device should prevent excessive cuff inflation pressure and solves the problem of forgetting to let the cuff down before extubation. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Healthy men {{and women}} were {{exercised}} on a cycle ergometer in a hot environment (46 ‡ C). Cold air (5 ‡ C) was blown onto the face either as a <b>jet</b> from the <b>tube</b> directed towards the nose or being introduced under a face mask. There was a subjective feeling of increased comfort although the temperature under the mask decreased to only 28 ‡ C- 32 ‡ C. Facial cooling did not cause any changes in either blood pressure or heart rate. It is concluded that this degree of facial cooling does not invoke the previously described peripheral vasconstriction which could inhibit further heat loss...|$|R
40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} jet flow, issuing as a {{fully developed}} flow {{from a long}} straight pipe at Re = 1600 and 5500, was actively controlled by an annular synthetic <b>jet.</b> The Pitot <b>tube,</b> hot-wire anemometry (CTA) and flow visualization were used for an experimental investigation of the flow control. The working fluid was air. The effect of varying Strouhal number (St = (0. 18 ÷ 1. 94)) on a width and entrainment of the main jet flow was studied. It {{was found that the}} main jet is the most sensitive to the actuation at St = 0. 28 ÷ 0. 60 and St = 0. 18, for Re = 1600 and Re = 5500, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The adsorbed charges play a {{key role}} in the {{generation}} of plasma <b>jet</b> inside capillary <b>tube</b> as in any dielectric barrier discharge configurations. This work aims at exhibiting and understanding the role of adsorbed charges in a pin to ring discharge in helium inside a capillary tube. For this purpose, fast imaging and electrical measurements are performed in several dielectric barrier discharge configurations and different gas mixture. A double high voltage electrodes surface dielectric barrier discharge shows that the role of adsorbed charges in breakdown process is strongly dependant on oxygen impurities. The influence of light emitted by the discharge itself on charges desorption from the dielectric surface appears also to be strongly dependant on the configuration...|$|R
40|$|Present study {{investigates the}} effect of the mixture {{equivalence}} ratio on the heat transfer characteristics of impinging premixed methane-air flame <b>jets</b> of <b>tube</b> burners equipped with twisted tape inserts. The induced swirl flow enhances the mixing process and improves the flame stability limits. The flame jet with mixture Reynolds number of 800 and burner to plate spacing of four times burner diameter is chosen based on the flame stability range. The heat transfer characteristics of non-swirling flame jet are compared with the swirling flame jets for various mixture compositions. Swirl flow is achieved with twisted tape inserts having twist ratios of 2, 3. 2, 4. 5 and 7. 5. Twisted tape inserts resulted asymmetric flame. The flame shape is found to be highly influencing the heat transfer from the flame jet to the target surface. Better heat transfer distribution is achieved with stoichiometric mixture. However, the rich mixture produces more uniform heat flux distribution. Best thermal performance is observed for twisted tape with twist ratio of 7. 5. The present study helps in better understanding and optimum design of the flame jet impingement heat transfer equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the means by which {{turbulent}} flows entrain sediment grains from alluvial stream beds. Entrainment was considered to include both the initiation of sediment motion and the suspension of grains by the flow. Observations of grain motion induced by turbulent flows led to the formulation of an entrainment hypothesis. It was based on the concept of turbulent eddies disrupting the viscous sublayer and impinging directly onto the grain surface. It is suggested that entrainment results from the interaction between fluid elements within an eddy and the sediment grains. A pulsating jet was used to simulate the flow conditions in a turbulent boundary layer. Evidence is presented to establish the validity of this representation. Experiments were made to determine the dependence of jet strength, defined below, upon sediment and fluid properties. For a given sediment and fluid, and fixed jet geometry there were two critical values of jet strength: one at which grains started to roll across the bed, and one at which grains were projected up from the bed. The jet strength K, {{is a function of the}} pulse frequency, ω, and the pulse amplitude, A, defined by K = Aω -s Where s is the slope of a plot of log A against log ω. Pulse amplitude is equal to the volume of fluid ejected at each pulse divided by the cross sectional area of the <b>jet</b> <b>tube.</b> Dimensional analysis was used to determine the parameters by which the data from the experiments could be correlated. Based on this, a method was devised for computing the pulse amplitude and frequency necessary either to move or project grains from the bed for any specified fluid and sediment combination. Experiments made in a laboratory flume with a turbulent flow over a sediment bed are described. Dye injection was used to show the presence, in a turbulent boundary layer, of two important aspects of the pulsating jet model and the impinging eddy hypothesis. These were the intermittent nature of the sublayer and the presence of velocities with vertical components adjacent to the sediment bed. A discussion of flow conditions, and the resultant grain motion, that occurred over sediment beds of different form is given. The observed effects of the sediment and fluid interaction are explained, in each case, in terms of the entrainment hypothesis. The study does not suggest that the proposed entrainment mechanism is the only one by which grains can be entrained. However, in the writer’s opinion, the evidence presented strongly suggests that the impingement of turbulent eddies onto a sediment bed plays a dominant role in the process. ...|$|R
