5000|$|A bolt is an <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> {{designed}} for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally {{intended to be}} tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> which {{is prevented from being}} turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.)

50|$|ASTM A193/A193M is a {{specification}} {{from the}} ASTM International that primarily govern industrial piping applications. In {{the assembly of}} an industrial plant, many complex components are bolted together of which include parts such as valves, piping, and pressure vessels. ASTM A193 defines the methodology to procure and certify <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> according to specific chemical and mechanical criteria. It is standards such as this that allow industrial process applications to be safely engineered so they do not exceed the tensile strength of the fasteners that hold them together.|$|R
50|$|Bolts {{have been}} defined as headed <b>fasteners</b> having {{external}} <b>threads</b> that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> that {{do not meet the}} above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction. And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them. However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.|$|R

40|$|The work in {{this paper}} {{presents}} the effect of material and blank dimension on the dimensions of external rolled threads. This paper will be helpful for the auto industry, {{one of the largest}} fasteners markets, that typically consumes between 2800 to 3100 fasteners in the assembly of an average family vehicle. <b>Externally</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined. The size of the blank is dependent on material, surface finish, type of threads etc. This paper describes the effect of blank material and dimensions on nominal diameter of external rolled threads. The work has been carried out at M/s Gayatri Auto Industries on Master Reciprocating Dies Thread Rolling Machine using HSS die. Mild Steel (C 15), EN- 8 (C 40), and EN- 47 (Spring Steel) materials have been taken as blank material for the analysis to produce M 8 x 1. 25 6 g threads. The result indicates that the variation on surface roughness, carbon percentage and dimension of blank affects significantly the nominal diameter and PCD of threads. This paper is helpful for the professionals to determine the accurate dimension of thread rolling blank for desired threads to minimize rejections. 1...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{two studies}} {{related to the}} design of cold-formed steel connections. The study topics included the creation of a test standard for determining the strength of a screw, and the determination of the strength of a screw connection. A standard test protocol does not exist for determining the strength of a screw. Today, manufacturers use test protocols developed for their products. Thus, there is no consistency in defming the structural performance of a screw. A test standard has been developed. The standard used as its model the American Society of Testing and Material's F 606, Standard Test Methods for Determining the Mechanical Properties of <b>Externally</b> and Internally <b>Threaded</b> <b>Fasteners</b> and Rivets. Tests have been conducted to show the practicality of the proposed test standard. The connection strength equations in the AISI design specification are based primarily on tests of single- and double-screw connection tests. Also, design assumes that the connection strength is proportional to the number of screws. The connection strength study considered the variation of connection strength with the number of screws, the screw center-to-center spacing, and the location of the screws in the connection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the loosening tendency of a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener.</b> To achieve the objective, the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> looseness model is constructed through the following procedures. Firstly, static and dynamic <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> models are derived to find the static and dynamic interior forces respectively. Secondly, for investigating the bolt loosening behaviour, the effects of thread lead angle, initial preload, vibration frequency, and the nature of material on the bolt looseness, the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> looseness model is constructed by combining the above models with a Karnopp frictional model. The proposed approach not only analyses both the static and the dynamic behaviours of the bolt as well as the bolt loosening but also detects whether the bolt is within the elastic range or not. The approach can serve as a guide for designing a thread fastening procedure to avoid the failure of <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> due to vibration...|$|R
