500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her. I really got to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{appeared}} as Martin Heiss, a skeptical ghost debunker, in the reboot of Ghostbusters, which {{was released on}} July 15, 2016. There had been speculation that he might return to the Ghostbusters franchise for a rumored Ghostbusters 3, he dispelled such rumors {{in an interview with}} GQ. In March 2010, Murray appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about his return to Ghostbusters III, stating [...] "I'd do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel." [...] In an interview with GQ, Murray said: [...] "You know, maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> do it. Maybe it'd be fun to do." [...] In the interview, when asked [...] "Is the third Ghostbusters movie happening? What's the story with that?", Murray replied, [...] "It's all a bunch of crock." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{has long}} been a fan of Hollywood action man Steven Seagal, who he had {{mentioned}} several times on radio, and remarked that he would love to meet. However, when Seagal rang O'Connell the relationship and understanding between the two was quite difficult and left O'Connell feeling disappointed. Seagal did not understand O'Connell's ironic personality and sense of humour and much of the recorded interview had to be removed from the radio broadcast. The Observer described the interview as, [...] "a spectacularly terrible interview in which O'Connell's questions dropped into a seemingly bottomless well of apathy." [...] O'Connell described the interview remarking; [...] "It was the single worst thing I've ever done on radio. And the other week I was having a go at Michael Parkinson, saying he used to be fantastic but sadly now he's become too fawning, and then I did the Seagal thing and I thought: <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> leave." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} July, Tunney competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England {{where she}} was Team GB's {{youngest}} athlete at the games, aged 15. She helped the British team qualify in fifth place and individually she qualified to the all around final with a score of 56.391. [...] Tunney said, [...] "I went out thinking <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> enjoy my first Olympics and I really did. It was {{the most amazing thing}} I've ever done in my life. It was tense but the crowd were so supportive." [...] In the team final, Tunney contributed scores of 14.866 on vault and 14.766 on uneven bars toward the British team's sixth-place finish. [...] She said, [...] "First Olympic Games and we're getting into the team final and finishing sixth, you can't ask for anything bigger. It was inspiring to see the men get a medal.

[...] She said, [...] "It's been an amazing experience here in London; the best week of my life. To compete at a home Games in front of this crowd has been incredible.

2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't come to give it. I {{just dropped}} in because if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>just</b> dropped outside. How {{have you been}} getting along with your ridiculous {{critical}} bookstore?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} be no sacrifice," [...] she urged. [...] "I have little reason to love France, and I can assure you <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be <b>just</b> as happy in your country as in my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, uncle," [...] {{said the}} nephew, with extreme deference, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> {{like to ask}} you one question. Will you let me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Syne the Kite came back, an' McRimmon {{paid off}} me an' Bell personally, an' {{the rest of}} the crew pro rata, I believe it's ca'ed. My share--oor share, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say--was <b>just</b> twenty-five {{thousand}} pound sterlin'." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's true for you, sir; {{and when}} I {{come to think}} of it, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be <b>just</b> as easy and {{comfortable}} in a snug little cot in Killarney, which is my county, whether King James or Queen Anne was ruling it in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I don't understand." [...] Mrs. Pendyce {{dropped her}} eyes, a flush {{came into her}} white cheeks; she looked up again and said quickly: [...] "George, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like <b>just</b> a little bet on your horse--a real bet, say about a sovereign." ...|$|R
5000|$|As he {{is about}} to be executed, the soldier has an epiphany: [...] "My God...I wasted my whole life {{thinking}} about this stuff. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>just</b> gone fishing! <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have had a sandwich, or had a few laughs!

6000|$|... 'Well, I really don't know. Of course I {{could not}} decline it; {{but on the}} whole <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be <b>just</b> as well pleased to have been spared. If I get through it well, why it will be well. But even that cannot help me at this examination.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> like to {{know who}} can be cross {{with you when you}} put on those ways. Are your feet wet? Ah! I thought so. Run on in and take them off." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{told you}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do <b>just</b> what the wise people told me. I asked papa, {{and he said that}} it would be better. So the lawyers were driven out of their minds, and the milliners out of their bodies, and the thing was done." ...|$|R
