The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip. Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in {{that he did not have}} a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E

25|$|Newspapers often refine {{distribution}} of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and <b>editorial</b> <b>content</b> change {{to reflect the}} location to which the product is delivered. The <b>editorial</b> <b>content</b> often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, {{but there will be}} different region-specific <b>editorial</b> <b>content.</b> As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising rate card provides a good example of editioning.|$|E
25|$|At {{around that}} time, Universul Copillor began {{contributing}} to Antonescu's propaganda effort, supporting Romania's Eastern Front efforts, against the Soviet Union.

25|$|A {{newspaper}} typically generates 70–80% of {{its revenue}} from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions. The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called <b>editorial</b> <b>content,</b> editorial matter, or simply editorial, although the last term {{is also used to}} refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time– early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from <b>editorial</b> <b>content.).</b> The business model of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by The Sun, a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.|$|E

The quality of the <b>editorial</b> <b>contents</b> is usually estimated as being that of a [...] "local rack".|$|R
