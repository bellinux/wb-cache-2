50|$|In 1960, at the {{initiation}} of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy due {{to the influence of}} a new generation of technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent, and by 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. On a long term analysis, after an extended period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic (1910-1926), the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1960, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960-1973 under the Estado Novo regime (and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against independence guerrilla groups from 1961 onwards) created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism, and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy brought new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams. The economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new capital equipment and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable consumer goods. The Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates. Economically, the Estado Novo regime maintained a policy of corporatism that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates, including those founded by the families of António Champalimaud (Banco Totta & Açores, Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor, Secil, Cimpor), José Manuel de Mello (CUF - Companhia União Fabril), Américo Amorim (Corticeira Amorim) and the dos Santos family (Jerónimo Martins).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditional {{approaches}} for environmental hazards and disaster planning under condi-tions {{of risk and}} uncertainty are discussed, including normative expected utility theory, “satisificing”, and robustness analyses. Prospect theory, a descriptive technique with roots in psychology, has emerged as an alternative theory of decision making under risk and uncertainty to utility theory and other classic approaches. Over {{the past quarter century}} Prospect theory has been increasingly used in various disciplines such as political science, public health, <b>engineering,</b> economics, <b>insurance,</b> and business. This paper aims to introduce and discuss some of the potential implications of prospect theory for environmental hazards and disaster planning theory and practice. It is argued that pros-pect theory can significantly enhance environmental hazards and disaster planning theory and prac-tice, particularly for decision making under uncertainty. Several practical examples are provided to illustrate the strengths of this versatile method...|$|R

So the following conclusions can be drawn from this empirical analysis: Firstly, different lines of business should be engineered by different risk management strategies, especially the liability line needs to be improved. Secondly, the effect of “Risk Pool” can reduce the economic capital requirement for unexpected loss.
