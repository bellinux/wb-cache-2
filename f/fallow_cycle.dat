40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Effects of {{different}} tillage systems on nitrate-nitrogen accumulation in a 120 cm profile and on soil {{structure in the}} top 30 cm of the profile were studied under a fallow-wheat rotation. Treatment effects on nitrate-nitrogen, soil moisture and soil aggregation were measured. Fallow tillage treatments consisting of bare fallow, stubble-mulch and no-till were established on the trial plots. Bare fallow, stubble-mulch, and no-till tillage treatments had no significant effect on nitrate-nitrogen accumulation. However, the fact that nitrate-nitrogen accumulated {{at the end of}} fallow was several times higher than {{in the beginning of the}} fallow has great importance in terms of fertilizer application. Adequate moisture and temperature favored nitrate-nitrogen accumulation in the tillage plots during the fallow. The 0 - 10 cm soil layer appeared to be the accumulation zone in the three tillage systems. Effects of tillage treatments on soil structure were investigated through evaluation of aggregate size distribution and water stability. In the 0 - 10 cm soil layer, the aggregates larger than 0. 84 mm, considered to be a good indicator of soil resistance to wind erosion, were more prevalent in bare fallow than in the other two treatments. The percentage of aggregates in the 2 - 4. 75 mm range showed similar distribution patterns among the treatments. The 0 - 10 cm soil layer is disturbed every other <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> in the bare fallow and every <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> in the stubble-mulch. In notill, the 0 - 10 cm soil layer is disturbed only at planting. As a result, more destructive action of no-till and stubble-mulch may be reason for these differences. It should be noted that in no-till the soil is pulverized enough during seeding to favor low aggregation and stability...|$|E

40|$|Tropical {{deforestation}} {{is significant}} {{to a range}} of themes that have relevance for the study of environmental change and economic development, including global warming, land degradation, species extinction, and sustainability issues. Recognition that both the location and pattern of forest clearance are often as important as its magnitude has motivated an increasing number of econometric studies that link satellite data and government census data with the aim of modeling the spatial dimensions of deforestation processes. Initial research focused on time series analysis, while recent work has started developing models that make use of time series data on land use. In this paper, we use satellite data from three dates over an approximate 15 -year period to estimate the probability of a satellite pixel being in a forested or human-disturbed state. Our study focuses on land-use change in an agricultural frontier spanning the southern Mexican states of Campeche and Quintana Roo. This region contains {{one of the largest and}} oldest expanses of tropical forests in the Americas outside of Amazonia and has been identified as a "hot spot" of forest and biotic diversity loss. Over the past 30 years, these forests have been under sustained pressure following the construction of a highway in 1972 that opened the frontier to settlement. The road was part of a larger development effort to promote agricultural colonization and has contributed to a prolonged period of land transformation that has been captured by Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery. We capture these landscape dynamics by assembling a spatial database that links the pixels from three TM images spanning the years 1986 - 1997 and other spatial environmental and GIS-location derived data with government census socio-economic data of data. We develop a simple utility-maximizing model of the forest clearance decision. Based on previous research, the theoretical model suggests many possible determinants of forest clearance in an economic environment characterized by missing or thin markets, as typifies frontier regions in the nascent stages of economic development. We subsequently test the significance of these determinants using discrete choice analysis These modeling questions have particular relevance for informing carbon sequestration and global warming policy initiatives. Other on-going research conducted by the ecologists associated with the project focus on the species composition, abundance, structure, and re-growth of the different forests types in the region. In addition, litter and biomass studies have been completed which included carbon estimates for the different forest types, including forest re-growth on agricultural land, as function of <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> dynamics. <b>Fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> dynamics are extremely important as the region is dominated by semi-subsistence agriculture with very little chemical inputs, so farmers depend on the <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> to restore soil productivity.

The Amazonian Slash-and-Burn Model and the Succession Model, both agentbased models, were developed to help address how much influence prehistoric Amazonian populations practicing slash-and-burn cultivation had on their surrounding environment and if different slash-and-burn cultivation strategies, i. e. short-fallow, bush-fallow, and long-fallow, could be identified based on the signatures left behind by these cultivation practices in subsequent forest composition and patterning. Both models were sensitivity tested to determine the validity and predictability of the parameters generated from ethnographic data. The outcome of this testing indicates that varying cultivation and <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> lengths create different proportions of forest land, fallow land, and cultivation land on the total landscape through time.

40|$|Babassu palms (Orbignya spp.) cover nearly 200, 000 km 2 in Brazil, {{providing}} cash income, fuel, fibre, {{edible oil}} and food {{to a large}} number of tenant farm households. Babassu is closely integrated within pastoral and shifting cultivation systems of Mid-North Brazil. In pastures, babassu provides shade for cattle, aids soil moisture retention, produces organic matter, generates supplementary farm income at little cost, and offers year-round employment. On the other hand, the persistence of juvenile palms reduces pasture grass productivity due to plant competition, and therefore there is a trend to eradicate babassu through clearcutting and understorey suppression. At moderate densities of less than 100 individuals per ha, mature babassu palms in cropland do not appear to harm crop productivity. In such cases, palms are thinned and leaves of the remaining ones are cut back, supplying fuel for the burn and nutrients to the soil.

40|$|Swidden {{agriculture}} is often deemed responsible for deforestation and forest degradation in tropical regions, yet swidden landscapes are commonly not visible on land cover/use maps, {{making it difficult}} to prove this assertion. For a future REDD+ scheme, the correct identification of deforestation and forest degradation and linking these processes to land use is crucial. However, it is a key challenge to distinguish degradation and deforestation from temporal vegetation dynamics inherent to swiddening. In this article we present an approach for spatial delineation of swidden systems based on landscape mosaics. Furthermore we introduce a classification for change processes based on the change matrix of these landscape mosaics. Our approach is illustrated by a case study in Viengkham district in northern Laos. Over a 30 -year time period the swidden landscapes have increased in extent and they have degraded, shifting from long crop <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles</b> to short cycles. From 2007 to 2009 degradation within the swidden system accounted for half of all the landscape mosaics change processes. Pioneering shifting cultivation did not prevail.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the relation of}} shifting cultivation to deforestation and degradation, and hence its impacts in terms of carbon emissions and sequestration potential. There {{is a need to}} understand these relationships better in the context of international policy on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The article reviews the way in which shifting cultivation has been incorporated in global and national estimations of carbon emissions, and assembles the available information on shifting cultivation in Tropical Dry Forests (TDF) in Mexico, where it is widely practiced. It then takes the case of two villages, Tonaya and El Temazcal, which lie within the basin of the River Ayuquila in Jalisco, Mexico. Field data for the typical carbon stocks and fluxes associated with shifting cultivation are compared with stocks and fluxes associated with more intensive agricultural production in the same dry tropical forest area to highlight the carbon sequestration dynamics associated with the shortening and potential lengthening of the fallow cycles. The biomass density in the shifting cultivation system observed can reach levels similar to that of old growth forests, with old fallows (> 20 years) having higher carbon stocks than old growth forests. Per Mg of maize produced, the biomass-related emissions from shifting cultivation in the traditional 12 year cycle are about three times those from permanent cultivation. We did not, however, take into account the additional emissions from inputs that result from the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the case of permanent agriculture. Shortening of the <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is occurring in the study area as a result of government subsidies, results in higher remaining stocks of carbon and lower emissions at the landscape level...|$|E

In this pa-per, two applications, using imagery of different spatial resolution (Landsat TM/ETM+ and QuickBird), were assessed as tools for understanding changes in land use. Using TM/ETM+ data over an eight-year period, the period of cropping, the fallow periods, and the capacity to regenerate vegetation during the fallow were identified and spatially mapped at a meso-scale. TM/ETM+ was found to be appropriate for time-series analysis owing to the abundant data archives. By contrast, QuickBird data was assessed for higher resolution and lower scale analyses using both panchromatic (0. 6 m/pixel) and multi-spectral (four bands) data (2. 4 m/pixel). The superior resolution of QuickBird images was found to be useful for the identification of plot boundaries and for the efficient production of land use maps. In addition, various derived indices, such as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and texture indices, were cor-related with some field information on vegetation and soil. Although the relationships between satellite data characteristics and field properties need to be refined, these data indicate that spatial analysis with satellite imagery has wide capability for land resource management.

40|$|Agricultural land {{devoted to}} {{vegetable}} crops in the Caribbean has strongly increased {{during the past}} twenty years, which raises major concerns regarding a reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks because of lowC inputs and high SOC outputs fromthese cropping systems. The aimof this studywas {{to assess the impact}} of farming practices on SOC stocks at the farm type level. We designed a framework which encompasses a farm typology describing the diversity of farm practices applied to vegetable crops and a model of SOC dynamics to estimate the impact of these practices on SOC stocks. The study was carried out in the Guadeloupe archipelago, which offers a good representation of the variability of Caribbean agriculture, in a context of transition from traditional sugarcane and banana monocultures for export to a more diversified agriculture including vegetable crops. A farm typology was developed from a survey of 71 farmers concerning their socio-economic characteristics and farming practices. The MorGwanik model of SOC dynamics was then used {{to assess the impact of}} farming practices on SOC at the farm type level, and to interpret the observed SOC changes. Five farm types were identified varying from traditional export agriculture with low diversification to monoculture of vegetable crops based on compost application and reduced soil tillage. The observed and simulated results indicated that systems with a fallow/vegetables cycle ratio N 2 and the monoculture of vegetables including compost applications at ≥ 10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 presented C sequestration corresponding to SOC increases of 10 % and 3 % of the initial stock, respectively. The monoculture of vegetables with a compost rate b 10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 and systems including vegetables in rotation with export crops and a short <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle</b> presented a reduction in SOC that ranged from 10 % to 18 %. Pedoclimatic conditions had a lower impact on SOC changes. Similar socio-economic profiles of farmers were observed for farm types including very different cropping systems. The model well described SOC changes for each farm type and offered valuable insights about the factors affecting SOC losses and C sequestration. The framework proposed in this study was helpful to identify improved managements that can maintain or increase SOC stocks under tropical conditions...|$|E

Sediments at both farms showed some improvement in the community structure over a three month fallow period, but the community structure only recovered to that present before stocking not to that at the reference sites. The similarity of the impact sites to the reference sites increased from ca. 25 % to 31 % at one site and 11 % to 27 % at the other after fallowing. Rate and extent of recovery were affected by farm location, initial impact of the sediments, and length of fallow period. Initial recovery was faster at the more sheltered site than at the more exposed site, possibly reflecting differences in environmental resilience with the more sheltered location better able to assimilate organic inputs. Accordingly general fallowing management protocols may need to be adapted to reflect differences between sites.

40|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} systems, one of {{the most}} widely distributed forms of agriculture in the tropics, provide not only crops of cultural significance, but also medicinal, edible, ritual, fuel, and forage resources, which contribute to the livelihoods, health, and cultural identity of local people. In many regions across the globe, shifting cultivation systems are undergoing important changes, {{one of the}} most pervasive being a shortening of the <b>fallow</b> <b>cycle.</b> Although there has been much attention drawn to declines in crop yields in conjunction with reductions in fallow times, little if any research has focused on the dynamics of noncrop plant resources. In this paper, we use a data set of 26 fields of the same age, i. e., ~ 1. 5 yr, but differing in the length and frequency of past fallow cycles, to examine the impact of shorter fallow periods on the availability of noncrop plant resources. The resources examined are collected in shifting cultivation fields by the Yucatec Maya in Quintana Roo, Mexico. These included firewood, which is cut from remnant trees and stumps spared at the time of felling, and 17 forage species that form part of the weed vegetation. Firewood showed an overall decrease in basal area with shorter fallow cycles, which was mostly related to the smaller diameter of the spared stumps and trees in short-fallow milpas. In contrast, forage species showed a mixed response. Species increasing in abundance in short-fallow milpas tended to be short-lived herbs and shrubs often with weedy habits, whereas those declining in abundance were predominantly pioneer trees and animal-dispersed species. Coppicing tree species showed a neutral response to fallow intensity. Within the cultural and ecological context of our study area, we expect that declines in firewood availability will be most significant for livelihoods because of the high reliance on firewood for local fuel needs and the fact that the main alternative source of firewood, forest patches, has also declined in short-fallow areas. Declines in some forage species can likely be compensated for by the use of other species or by adaptive responses such as managing declining species in home gardens. However, the loss of pioneer tree species in short-fallow milpas suggests that the regenerative capacity of the fallows may be reduced with implications for maintaining effective fallow cycles in this shifting cultivation system. Our findings indicate that the dynamics of noncrop plant resources and their implications for local livelihoods require further consideration in the debate over improving the productivity of shifting cultivation systems...|$|E
30|$|However, soil {{nutrient}} {{and organic}} matter depletion, acidification and soil erosion losses as result of inappropriate land use practices have become {{major cause of}} concern for agricultural soils in the Ethiopian highlands (Elias 2002; IFPRI 2010). In particular, due to the land form of occurrence (high to mountains relief hills with moderately steep slopes) and intensive cereal cultivation and cattle grazing, Nitisols have become prone to degradation {{in spite of their}} high structural aggregate stability to resist erosion (FAO 2001; Elias 2016). Land use changes and cultivation of fields without adequate conservation practices, low levels of fertilizer application and failure to recycle crop residues are among the causal factors. Traditionally, soil fertility is replenished through <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles</b> of up to 20  years during which time the land gains fertility through atmospheric deposition, biological fixation and the supply of fresh organic matter and nutrients to the soils (Smaling and Braun 1996; Elias et al. 1998). As population increases, fallow periods are either shortened or abandoned altogether resulting in continuous cultivation of the land. In some parts of the Ethiopian highlands, steep slopes with gradients as steep as 50 % are cultivated without installing adequate conservation measures (Assen and Tegene 2008). Often, resource-poor farmers have a short time horizon, i.e., they are primarily concerned with the crop and animal production of the forthcoming season than the long-term productivity of the soil. Longer-term processes that adversely affect agricultural sustainability such as depletion of soil organic matter and nutrient stocks are less visible and perhaps less noteworthy by farmers (Hailu et al. 2015; Elias 2016).|$|R
40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, farmlands in Uzbekistan have been widely abandoned. However, the dependency on agriculture is still high for cash crops, particularly in context of food security and a rapidly growing population. Despite vast research in land degradation, the processes and drivers for abandonment remain hardly understood. Until now, no or little attention was paid to site-specific developments such as abandonment of arable land in irrigation agriculture and abandonment of land that was reclaimed in arid and semi-arid regions. Analysis of time series from Landsat earth observation data are recognised as highly suitable to establish retrospective and current land use changes. We combined multi-annual Landsat data and Random Forest machine learning to classify arable land and to discriminate between used and unused fields for the observation period between 2000 and 2016. The fields classified as 'unused' were then subdivided according to their intensity of intra-annual NDVI signal that was used as further proxy to get information on the time at which the field became abandoned. A pixel-based classification was preferred instead an object-based classification to minimise prediction errors on field level. Furthermore, intensity information was used for validating retrospective data for years without field survey information. Overall, the classification of unused land was challenged by the complexity of the crop rotations, long <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles,</b> and the data scarcity. The derived information is concluded to support regional land use planners and decision makers to improve land management and to designate regions for alternative usages such as pastoralism...|$|R
40|$|In {{the mixed}} farming systems that characterise the {{semi-arid}} zones of {{eastern and western}} Africa, low rural incomes, {{the high cost of}} fertilisers, inappropriate public policies and infrastructural constraints prevent the widespread use of inorganic fertilisers. As population pressure increases and <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles</b> are shortened, such organic sources of plant nutrients as manure, crop residues and compost remain the principal sources of nutrients for soil fertility maintenance and crop production. In this paper, the effect of manure on soil productivity and ecosystem functions and services is discussed. This is followed by highlights of the management practices required to increase manure use efficiency. We end with a discussion of emerging new research opportunities in soil fertility management to enhance crop–livestock integration. Although the application of manure alone produces a significant response, it is not a complete alternative to mineral fertilisers. In most cases the use of manure is part of an internal flow of nutrients within the farm and does not add nutrients from outside the farm. Furthermore, the quantities available are inadequate to meet nutrient demand on large areas. Research highlights have shown that efficiency is enhanced by different management practices including the timing and methods of manure application, its sources and integrated nutrient management. Research opportunities include analysing and understanding the ecosystem functions and services of manure use, the establishment of fertiliser equivalency for different manure sources, the assessment of the best ratios of organic and inorganic plant nutrient combinations, the crop–livestock trade-offs required to solve conflicting demands for feed and soil conservation and the use of legumes to enhance soil fertility and for animal feed. The establishment of decision support system guides and assessment of the economic viability of manure-based technologies in farmer-focused research are presented as powerful management tools intended to maximise output while preserving the environment in the mixed farming systems of the semi-arid zones...|$|R
40|$|Shifting cultivation" - the {{alternation}} of {{periods of}} cropping with relatively {{long periods of}} fallow-encompasses many indigenous agricultural systems, developed in a remarkable diversity of environments throughout the tropics. When the fallow includes woody perennials, shifting cultivation is an agroforestry practice with temporal sequencing of agricultural crops and trees. The cultural, edaphic, ecological, and agronomic features of shifting cultivation systems have been studied in great detail (Conklin 1957, 1963; Nye and Greenland, Unesco, de Schlippe, Allan, Fresco). It has been established that in any agroecosystem {{the length of the}} cropping period and length of fallow period are key components of long-run stability. Although the pivotal role of labor for clearing and weeding in regulating the cycles of shifting cultivation has been repeatedly remarked (Conklin 1957, de Schlippe, Nye and Greenland, Jurion and Henry, Dabasi-Schweng), the relationship between the labor economy of shifting cultivation and the cropping and <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles</b> has been neglected. Labor is the primary input {{in the vast majority of}} west African farming systems, and clearing and weeding operations account for most agricultural labor in almost all cases (Baldwin; Fresco; Guyer 1972, 1984). Clearing and weeding operations are central to the decision to mechanize (Pingali, Bigot, and Binswanger). Nevertheless, economists have looked elsewhere for explanations of land-use intensity in fallow-based systems (Stryker). In the present paper, a model of shifting cultivation is proposed based on the hypothesis that labor required for clearing and weeding are major determinants of the age of fallow to clear and length of time to crop. The model provides the economic complement to the cultural and biophysical mechanisms regulating allocation of human and natural resources in shifting and bushfallow agriculture. Most of the examples in this paper will be drawn from fallows with predominantly woody climax vegetation in humid and subhumid, lowland, tropical areas, mainly in west and central Africa...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{suitability}} {{maps are}} a key input for land use zoning and projections of cropland expansion. Suitability assessments typically consider edaphic conditions, climate, crop characteristics, and sometimes incorporate accessibility to transportation and market infrastructure. However, correct weighting among these disparate factors is challenging, given rapid development of new crop varieties, irrigation, and road networks, as well as changing global demand for agricultural commodities. Here, we compared three independent assessments of cropland suitability to spatial and temporal dynamics of agricultural expansion in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 2001 ? 2012. We found that areas of recent cropland expansion identified using satellite data were generally designated as low to moderate suitability for rainfed crop production. Our analysis highlighted the abrupt nature of suitability boundaries, rather than smooth gradients of agricultural potential, with little additional cropland expansion beyond {{the extent of the}} flattest areas (0 ? 2 % slope). Satellite-based estimates of the interannual variability in the use of existing crop areas also provided an alternate means to assess suitability. On average, cropland areas in the Cerrado biome had higher utilization (84 %) than croplands in the Amazon region of northern Mato Grosso (74 %). Areas of more recent expansion had lower utilization than croplands established before 2002, providing empirical evidence for lower suitability or alternative management strategies (e. g., pasture?soya rotations) for lands undergoing more recent land use transitions. This unplanted reserve constitutes a large area of potentially available cropland (PAC) without further expansion, within the management limits imposed for pest management and <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles.</b> Using two key constraints on future cropland expansion, slope and restrictions on further deforestation of Amazon or Cerrado vegetation, we found little available flat land for further legal expansion of crop production in Mato Grosso.

40|$|Data on {{agricultural}} {{and natural resource}} management typically have spatial patterns related to the landscapes from which they came. Consequently, econometric models designed to explain the determinants of humans' natural resource management practices or their outcomes often have spatial structure that can bring bias or inefficiency to parameter estimates. Although econometric tools are available to correct for spatial structure, such tools are largely lacking for use with discrete dependent variable models. While one obvious solution would be to develop the necessary tools, an alternative is to identify conditions under which spatial dependency can be managed effectively without formal spatial autoregressive models. This study examines conditions under which spatial structure corresponds closely to defined agro-ecological zones, {{making it possible to}} model spatial effects by random effects regression. Using household survey data sampled along agro-ecological zone strata, this article develops two models of links between farmer assets and agricultural natural resource degradation in southern Peru. The first stage model looks at determinants of crop yield loss over time (an index of soil productivity), while the second stage model looks at determinants of the extent of <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles</b> in crop rotation, a key agricultural practice reducing crop yield loss. Diagnostic statistics for spatial dependency reveal spatial structure, particularly in the fallow model. This spatial dependency is eliminated in the ordinary least squares (OLS) models by inclusion of the agro-ecological zone random effects. In the spatially dependent fallow model, comparison of coefficient estimates between OLS and the spatial autoregressive maximum likelihood models showed OLS with random effects to give virtually identical results to the spatial autoregressive models, making the latter unnecessary. These results show that spatial structure in natural resource management models can sometimes be captured by zonal variables. When this occurs, random effects regression can largely eliminate spatial dependency. A necessary precondition for this approach with household survey data is prior sample stratification according to landscape characteristics. Where random effects models can effectively capture spatial structure, they may also offer analysts greater flexibility in analyzing models with limited dependent variables. Farm Management,...|$|R

These impacts are widely considered to be localized and transitory, and are commonly managed by imposing a period of <b>fallowing</b> between <b>cycles</b> of production. The implications of these ecosystemic effects for contaminant cycling, however, have not previously been considered. We found elevated levels of mercury in demersal rockfishes near salmon farms in coastal British Columbia, Canada, attributable {{to a combination of}} higher rockfish trophic position and higher mercury levels in prey near farms. Mercury concentrations in long-lived species such as rockfishes change over a longer time scale than cycles of production and fallowing, and thus at least some important effects of fish farms may not be considered transitory...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{population}} {{and land use}} restrictions in northern Laos have resulted in decreasing bush <b>fallow</b> rotation <b>cycles</b> and yield declines in traditional upland rice production systems. To maintain forest cover {{and the integrity of}} watersheds, Lao government policy promotes crop diversification and permanent cropping on fixed fields. Livestock is a major source of cash income for upland villagers in northern Laos. Most households raise a few local-breed pigs in low-input, low productivity systems. Pigs are often free-ranging and subsist by scavenging with supplementary feeding based on household food waste, collected greens, and rice bran. Pigs are often kept for two to three years before they reach marketable weight. Undernourished pigs are prone to disease and significant losses occur even when adequate vet-erinary services are available. Improving the productivity of village pig systems could provide income for rice purchase and capital for diversification to more sustainable livelihood systems...|$|R
40|$|Improving fallow {{quality in}} upland rice-fallow {{rotations}} in West Africa through the site-specific use of leguminous cover crops {{has been shown}} to sustain the productivity of such systems. We studied the effects of a range of residue management practices (removal, burning, mulching and incorporation) on fallow biomass and N accumulation, on weed biomass and yield response of upland rice and on changes in soil physical and chemical characteristics in 2 -year field trials conducted in three agroecological zones of Côte d'Ivoire. Across fallow management treatments and agroecological zones, rice yields were on average 20 - 30 ␑igher in legume than in natural fallow plots. Weed biomass was highest in the savanna zone and lowest in the bimodal forest and tended to be less following a legume fallow. Regardless of the type of fallow vegetation and agroecological zone, biomass removal resulted in the lowest rice yields that varied from 0. 5 t ha- 1 in the derived savanna zone to 1. 5 t ha- 1 in the Guinea savanna zone. Burning of the fallow vegetation significantly increased yield over residue removal in the derived savanna (0. 27 t ha- 1, P< 0. 05) and bimodal forest zones (0. 27 t ha- 1, P< 0. 01), but not in the Guinea savanna. In both savanna environments, residue incorporation was superior to the farmers' practice of residue removal and rice yield increases were related to amounts of fallow N returned to the soil (r 2 = 0. 803, P< 0. 01). In the forest zone, the farmers' practice of residue burning produced the highest yield (1. 43 t ha- 1 in the case of legumes) and resulted in the lowest weed biomass (0. 02 t ha- 1). Regardless of the site, improving the quality of the fallow or of its management had no significant effects on either soil physical or soil chemical characteristics after two <b>fallow</b> <b>cycles.</b> We conclude that incorporation of legume residues is a desirable practice for rice-based fallow rotation systems in savanna environments. No promising residue management alternatives to slash-and-burn were apparent for the forest zone. Determining the possible effects on soil productivity will require longer-term experiments...|$|R
50|$|Crop {{rotation}} is {{also used}} to control pests and diseases that can become established in the soil over time. The changing of crops in a sequence decreases the population level of pests by (1) interrupting pest life cycles and (2) interrupting pest habitat. Plants within the same taxonomic family tend to have similar pests and pathogens. By regularly changing crops and keeping the soil occupied by cover crops instead of lying <b>fallow,</b> pest <b>cycles</b> can be broken or limited, especially cycles that benefit from overwintering in residue. For example, root-knot nematode is a serious problem for some plants in warm climates and sandy soils, where it slowly builds up to high levels in the soil, and can severely damage plant productivity by cutting off circulation from the plant roots. Growing a crop that is not a host for root-knot nematode for one season greatly reduces the level of the nematode in the soil, thus making it possible to grow a susceptible crop the following season without needing soil fumigation.|$|R

40|$|Forests in Myanmar have a {{long history}} of teak (Tectona grandis Linn.) production, which can be traced back to the age of the English rule in the 19 th century, when forests in Myanmar were {{categorized}} into those for timber production and those for other uses. Many farmers such as the Karen people, who were swidden cultivators, inhabited the forests. Therefore, the government established the "Karen Area" in the late 19 th century, permitting swidden cultivation (shifting cultivation) for their self consumption. Short cultivation, long fallow swidden cultivation has been continued for over 100 years in the areas. We surveyed fallow vegetation and total carbon and nitrogen after swidden cultivation by Karen people in the Bago mountain range and compared with those in natural teak forests under selective logging systems. We set 9 circular plots 20 m in radius at fallow stands of various ages. Trees were identified and measured by diameter at breast height (DBH). Surface soil was sampled at 0 – 5 cm. The amounts of total carbon and nitrogen in soils varied among the plots, but no stand age dependency was observed. Grass and herb species such as Chromolaena odoratum and Thysanolaena maxima were dominant and comprised the maximum biomass in 1 - and 2 -year fallows. Bamboo species such as Bambusa polymorpha and Bambusa tulda rapidly recovered after grass and herb species, and the bamboo biomass in the 5 -year fallow was nearly equivalent to that in over- 40 -years fallows. Tree species recovered to nearly the same biomass level as that of bamboos in the 10 -year fallow, and further facilitated the increase in the above-ground biomass. Xylia xylocarpa was the most common tree species while species such as T. grandis might be excluded from the <b>fallow</b> vegetation <b>cycle.</b> On the whole, swidden cultivation with a short cultivation period of 1 year and over 12 -year fallows maintained sufficient fallow vegetation recovery to sustain continuous swidden cultivation in the Bago mountain range...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Allan Abercrombie {{discusses}} the ayllu extensively {{as it exists}} today among the Aymara people in [...] "THE POLITICS OF SACRIFICE: AN AYMARA COSMOLOGY IN ACTION": [...] "The ranking of ayllus is (and was?) performed in an idiom derived from what is ... a central and divisive cleavage {{in the nature of}} the domestic group, birth order among siblings, who are contrasted not only by age but by their differing rights to leadership roles, fiesta-cargo offices, and property. ... Patrilines are not mere aggregates of patronym possessing men and their families, juxtaposed only because of rights in land. Rather, they are structured, internally hierarchical social units, in which collective action is both enabled by, and enables the creation of, formally recognized positions of authority.`... Within the [...] "patristem family" [...] -a group of brothers who have constructed houses around the patio of their father—authority is vested in the father until his death. Afterwards, however, it is the eldest brother, the jiliri or jiliri jilata, who is regarded as becoming the kamachiri. This works out at the level of the sibling group, but what about the group of patristem units, some with nearest linking ancestors beyond the reach of memory? There exists a notion of an informal collective body of jiliris within the hamlet and patriline which can act as a sole council of elders. On close inspection, however, it turns out that these jiliris are neither equal in status nor necessarily eldest brothers within their own patri-stem sibling groups! In fact, jiliri status outside the patristem unit (and this unit begins to fragment after the death of the father of the sibling group) depends on the combination of appropriate [...] "leaderly" [...] personal qualities and the individual's status in the [...] "elder brother and herder-making" [...] system of public ritual careers. Moreover, greatest authority, that accompanied by the power to impose sanctions by force, is said to reside in a body of officials known as the jach'a íilírís. the [...] "great eldest brothers," [...] that is, in ayllu level authorities also known as alcaldes, alguaciles, and íaías. It is almost certain that the name for this last office (the highest ranking of the three), is derived from the root jila, from which both jilata ("brother") and jiliri ("eldest" [...] or [...] "first born") are derived. The patrilineal hamlet as well as ayllu authority is also designated by terms related to herding roles. First, he is compared to the lead animal of the herd, the llantiru (from Sp.delantero, [...] "one who goes before"). Secondly, he is known as the patriline's or ayllu's awatiri (herder), in which capacity the group which recognizes his authority becomes his rama (herd).... Upon his death, the sullk'iri may inherit the house and herd, but it is to the eldest son, not the youngest, that the status of kamachiri falls. And his comnmand extends into serious matters such as the allocation of lands and pastures within the sibling group, control over <b>fallowing</b> <b>cycles,</b> decisions about the opening of new fields (which may lead to warfare with neighboring groups), and the timing/itinerary of collective caravan expeditions to the valleys. In addition, it is the kamachiri who controls important ritual matters (related to herd fertility) which take place at the very altars he does not inherit. ... Like the llama llantiru, the role of eldest brother and the authorities who are called iilírí encode a principle of reproduction. First, as authority at the level of hamnlet, patriline, ayllu, and moiety, the jiliri conjoins the particular domestic groups of a hamlet ando patriline, the patrilines of the ayllu, and the ayllus of a moiety, by standing to all in an equivalent transitive relationship. The sullk'iri, on the other hand, reaps the rewards of inheritance, but is thereby irrevocably identified with the continuity of a particular household-that of his father—rather than with its reproduction. Like the llama-llantiru, the jiliri-llantíru owes his dominant position to control over herds, but here we refer to both animal and human ones. Unlike the youngest brother in the sibling group, who remains essentially a social extension of the father and a permanent dependant, the eldest brother receives the father's [...] "command" [...] (kamachiri), though he is exiled from his father's house and (to a degree) disinherited from his herd. His authority is, in fact, closely connected to his outward-directedness. The eldest brother could be said to be autonomous and self-generating-by establíshing his own house and herd, he is the embodiment not of the continuity of a house and herd (like the sullk'iri), but of the principle of reproduction of the very unit he is excluded from. As such, within and outside the patrigroup the jiliri also embodies the fertility (that is, the expansion) and generativity of the patriline. Like the llama llantiru, the jiliri-llantiru is associated with the conjunction of disparate herds in a new, unified herd. The jiliri's actual leadership role within the sibling group and patronymic hamlet amplifies these associations. The jiliri's [...] "command" [...] extends from the role of arbiter in intra-sibling group disputes, to that of leader of the conjoined brothers in disputes with other sibling groups within the hamlet or patriline. In addition, it is the jiliri who, stereotypically, decides when and where to go on annual trading trips, and conjoins multiple herds to make up the large caravan needed for a successful trip. it is men who are (or are becoming) jiliris who are the most likely to be able to establish a conjoint herd, garner sufficient labor, and otherwise mount a successful trade expedition. Such expeditions are crucially important source of foodstuffs, and are refracted within the collective ritual sphere in an inverse type of caravan trade (carrying foodstuffs to the ayllu-and moiety level [...] "ladder" [...] of the town for the fiesta, and returning empty-handed to the hamlet) through which the status of jach'ajiliri is achieved. But it is not only in his capacity to circulate foodstuffs that the stature of the jiliri is achieved, but in an attendant control over the circulation of the generative substances blood (wila) and fat (as a kind of solidified muju) among the human and animal, and the earthly and otherworldly realms. The point is not that only jiliris establish independent, conjoint households and herds, but that the opposed attributes of youngest and eldest brothers make them appropriate vehicles for representing two opposed facets of the household and herd: the fírst (typified by the youngest brother in dependant filial roles) is its continuity per se, as a particular unit; the second (typified by the eldest brother in independent founding-pater role) the general model or generative principIe of the household and herd as a type of social arrangement produced by, and reproducing, the patriline. Once he has begun his career, or continued an inherited one, the sponsor-jiliri joins the ranks of patriline-hamlet [...] "fathers" [...] and [...] "elder brothers", and with it takes on, at the inter-domestic group level, what was, in the domestic group, the leadership roles of elder brother and father. This role is, of course, a function of the sponsor's [...] "outward directedness", expressed in his ritual duties but represented as well in the terms of the asymmetric relations among exogamous patrilines within the ayllu. Patriline jiliris, like jilaqatas, are made, not born. But they are made in the image of the [...] "self made man" [...] of K'ulta society, the eldest sons, who must build their households themselves through the control they achieve of herds and alliances. Marriage is but the fírst step towards becoming a collective elder brother, herd-leader, and herder of men. The asymmetrical nature of marriage alliances, however, does not make a man into a herder of men, but a subordinate member of the herds of his wife's brother and wife's father, and he will remain thus subordinated until he turns the relation on its head by becoming a herder of his own sisters' and daughters' husbands. Accomplishing this involves withholding one's children's inheritance and [...] "seniority" [...] as long as possible, just as it requires establishing oneself in the status of superior among equals among one's own sibling group".|$|R
40|$|Mitigation {{climate change}} is an urgent and crucial {{challenge}} for a sustainable earth-system. Curbing tropical deforestation, and increasing absorption of carbon by (new) tropical forests is being considered as a relevant mitigation strategy because of the assumption {{that it can be}} implemented quickly and more cost-effective than other strategies. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) {{has become one of the}} initiatives most prominently present in research and international climate policy. The idea is to create incentives for developing countries and forest users to reduce carbon emissions by keeping their forests standing, reducing forest degradation, managing forests sustainably and increasing forest carbon stocks. However, in order to make the mechanism work and to design effective, efficient and equitable REDD+ policies, adequate information is needed on several aspects of the local land system where one wishes to intervene: this entails the current land use and land use evolutions, its drivers, and the socio-economic and carbon outcomes of different land use systems. Despite its importance in terms of forest cover and rising deforestation rates, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been underrepresented in studies that address these aspects, especially at subnational scales. In this thesis, we aimed at achieving a better understanding of two aspects of the shifting cultivation land system in Tshopo province: (1) the effects of biophysical conditions, land use and land management on ecosystem services delivery, in particular carbon sequestration, and (2) the drivers of the evolutions of land use and land management, including options for future transitions. In chapter 3, we analysed variation in aboveground carbon and forest structure in old-growth forests in the central Congo Basin, and assessed its implications for carbon mapping. We found that aboveground carbon (AGC) differed significantly within the region and between forest types. With an estimated aboveground carbon stock of 189 ± 40 Mg C ha- 1 mixed forest stored significantly less carbon than monodominant forest, storing 225 ± 58 Mg C ha- 1. The difference in AGC between the two forest types was due to differences in mean wood density and mean tree heights and not basal area. Our observations confirm generally lower aboveground carbon stocks in the central Congo Basin as compared to the outer fringes. Environmental drivers of AGC correlate to a large extent to environmental conditions determining the occurrence of the two forest types, with higher AGC on sandier soils, but drivers of AGC in mixed forest remain inconclusive. Taking differences in forest structure across forest types into account will benefit forest carbon mapping at different scales. Full inventory plot AGC estimations can benefit from improved accuracy when using forest type specific height:diameter relationships. We further tested the capacity of Asner’s LiDAR universal model in predicting regional level AGC in old-growth forest and found that AGC could be predicted with an 80 % precision. We also found that when differences in forest type are not taken into account, a forest type bias would be induced. In chapter 4, we evaluated the importance of management history and plant community properties on biomass stocks and biomass productivity in fallow systems in the central Congo Basin. The sampled fallows (aged 8. 7 ± 5. 5 years) had 62. 5 (± 47) Mg ha- 1 aboveground dry biomass (AGB), on an average. AGB was positively related to fallow age and negatively related to the number of previous cultivation <b>cycles.</b> <b>Fallows</b> in the fourth cycle stored significantly less carbon. We explored the relations between management history, landscape characteristics, woody plant community properties and annual biomass increment (ABI) in fallows aged 5 to 10 years. Three hypotheses on how woody plant community properties could affect ABI were tested: functional diversity, functional identity and vegetation quantity. Stem density was the strongest predictor of mean annual biomass increment (ABI), while also the community weighted mean of traits associated with pioneer species (low WD and low adult stature) was positively related to biomass recovery rates. Management history strongly determined these community properties, with the number of previous cultivation cycles negatively affecting stem density and community-weighted pioneer trait values, and with the biomass of remnant trees negatively related to community-weighted pioneer trait values. Our results imply that management intensity, i. e. mainly the number of previous cultivation cycles associated with repeated burning and weeding and with Chromolaena odorata invasion leads to a decrease in biomass recovery, with the main effect occurring through a reduction in the density of regenerating individuals. In chapter 5 we assessed the variation in deforestation rate and drivers at different scale levels, among which the village and household level. We detected considerable variation in deforestation rate at each scale levels, with highest variation at village and household level, which has gone unaddressed so far in DRC’s REDD+ strategy and projects. Village level deforestation rates were best predicted by the distance to Kisangani, the distance to the forest, the village ethnicity and the village population density. Individual household contributions to deforestation were also strongly unevenly distributed. Our results demonstrated that not the poorest households, but those with certain means in terms of social and human capital are more likely to participate in primary forest clearing. About half of the deforestation was attributed to only 8 % of households. For those households, deforestation is part of their development strategy, with both short and mid-term benefits (increased harvests), and long-term benefits (ownership over lands to be passed on to their children). In chapter 6 we examined to what extent the concept of local forest cover transitions can provide a framework to identify appropriate land use interventions. Using land cover, population and population density and the importance of different livelihoods, we identified three village level forest transition types: (i) high forest cover-low population, (ii) low forest cover-low population and (iii) low forest cover-high population. Perceptions of forest cover change and the evaluation of forest availability vary between these types. In general, forests were mostly valued for provisioning services and as a land reserve for future agricultural development. The most valued forest products were perceived to be in decline and scarce (except wood products), irrespective of the local forest transition type. We conclude that (i) local ownership of the purpose of forest conservation is not met in a majority of villages due to a perception of abundant forest cover, (ii) restricting forest conversion under REDD+ without readily available, acceptable and better functioning alternatives could result in maladaptive changes in land and resources management and negative livelihood and environmental outcomes, and (iii) interventions supporting higher agricultural outputs per ha will be best received in low forest-high population villages.
