In this situation, Vandygriff took a 3.5-inch rocket launcher and fired into the North Korean attackers, {{causing them to}} break off the attack. By now Vandygriff's troops were nearly out of ammunition. He then instructed his men to gather up all the weapons and ammunition from North Korean dead they could reach, and in this manner they obtained for <b>emergency</b> <b>use</b> about 30 to 40 rifles, 5 PPSh-41 guns, and some hand grenades.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} {{factors associated with}} <b>emergency</b> department <b>use</b> among homeless and marginally housed persons. Methods. Interviews were conducted with 2578 homeless and marginally housed per-sons, and factors associated with different patterns of <b>emergency</b> department <b>use</b> were assessed in multivariate models. Results. Findings showed that 40. 4 % of respondents had 1 or more emergency de-partment encounters in the previous year; 7. 9 % exhibited high rates of use (more than 3 visits) and accounted for 54. 5 % of all visits. Factors associated with high use rates included less stable housing, victimization, arrests, physical and mental illness, and sub-stance abuse. Predisposing and need factors appeared to drive <b>emergency</b> department <b>use.</b> Conclusions. Efforts to reduce <b>emergency</b> department <b>use</b> among the homeless should be targeted toward addressing underlying risk factors among those exhibiting high rates of use.
