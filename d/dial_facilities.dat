40|$|Energy (DOE) {{signed a}} Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to {{coordinate}} research efforts {{to the maximum}} extent possible for issues associated with treatment and disposal of mixed wastes. A DOE study intended to investigate problems associated with selection of particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs) {{was one of the}} first projects selected by the MOU Core Management Team for inclusion in this DOE-EPA venture. The project was chosen because implementation of the Hazardous Waste Combustor (HWC) MACT PM CEMS requirement will be most problematic for those mixed waste incinerators that employ HEPA filters in their off-gas treatment system. A Technical Working Group (TWG) was formed to help provide direction for the research effort and is populated by personnel from state and federal EPA, DOE headquarters, DOE focus areas, and the Diagnostic Instrumentation and Analysis Laboratory (DIAL). Work outlined in this paper is being conducted at the <b>DIAL</b> <b>facilities</b> on the campus of Mississippi State University. The EPA has consistently indicated its intention to implement the PM CEM...|$|E

2500|$|Mina'a Sultan Qaboos, Muscat's main trading port, is {{a trading}} hub between the Persian Gulf, the Indian subcontinent and the Far East {{with an annual}} volume of about 1.6 million tons. However, the {{emergence}} of the Jebel Ali Free Zone in neighboring Dubai, United Arab Emirates, has made that port the premier maritime trading port of the region with about 44 million tons traded in cargo annually. Many infrastructural facilities are owned and operated by the government of Oman. Omantel is the major telecommunications organization in Oman and provides local, long-distance and international <b>dialing</b> <b>facilities</b> and operates as the country's only ISP. Recent liberalization of the mobile telephone market has seen the establishment of a second provider [...] Nawras.|$|R
40|$|Area {{sources are}} a key {{contributor}} to overall greenhouse gas emissions but present a particular challenge to emission measurement techniques due to the heterogeneous nature of the sources. A new Controlled Release Facility (CRF) has been developed that is able to recreate in the field both the distribution and rate of emissions seen in actual industrial applications. The results {{of a series of}} field validation experiments involving this facility and an infrared differential absorption Lidar (<b>DIAL)</b> <b>facility</b> are presented, which have demonstrated the capability of the CRF to generate controlled methane emissions from 1. 8 kg/h to 11 kg/h with a typical expanded (k = 2) uncertainty of ~ 0. 3 kg/h, and established that any underlying systematic uncertainty in the DIAL measurements across this range of methane emissions is less than 4 % (or 0. 2 kg/h) ...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The work {{is based}} on a project done by SAMES (South African Micro Electronic Systems) for the local {{production}} of an integrated circuit that previously had to be imported. The circuit finds application in the telecommunications field where it controls loop disconnect dialling in the telephones. The mechanical disc dial is thus replaced by an electronic network that makes use of push-button entry and full digital out-dialling. The push-button telephone is compatible with the rotary disc dial telephone with advantages in reliability, speed and ease of use. An access pause and re <b>dial</b> <b>facility</b> add towards a more efficient telephone. The circuit was bought from an American company for manufacturing purposes. A process fit and circuit modifications were done for product ion on the CMOS process line at SAMES. The work includes a circuit- and process study with modifications, computer aided design, prototype production and analysis. The original circuit is called the General Instruments AY- 5 - 9151 D and the re-designed version the SAMES SA 9151 -A 2...|$|R
50|$|New {{technologies}} are under development that could revolutionize the detection and monitoring of fugitive emissions. One technology, known as {{differential absorption lidar}} (DIAL), {{can be used to}} remotely measure concentration profiles of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere up to several hundred meters from a <b>facility.</b> <b>DIAL</b> has been used for refinery surveys in Europe for over 15 years. A pilot study carried out in 2005 using DIAL found that actual emissions at a refinery were fifteen times higher than those previously reported using the emission factor approach. The fugitive emissions were equivalent to 0.17% of the refinery throughput.|$|R
