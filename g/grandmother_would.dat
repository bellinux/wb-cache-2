25|$|Born {{and raised}} on the {{outskirts}} of Strasbourg in Alsace, France, Vongerichten’s earliest family memories are about food. The Vongerichten home centered around the kitchen, where each day his mother and <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> prepare lunch for the almost 50 employees in their family-owned business. His love for food cemented his choice of career at the age of 16, when his parents brought him to the 3-star Michelin-rated Auberge de l’Ill for a birthday dinner.|$|E
25|$|Alex Youngs's {{passion for}} music began {{at a very}} early age and was nurtured by her family. Her <b>Grandmother</b> <b>would</b> {{regularly}} bring her and her brother, to attend concerts at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center that inspired her to pursue her career. This diverse range of music she was exposed to at an early age profoundly influences her work. Alex Young's artistry combines dancing, singing and acting and is incorporated into all of her performances. Her love of jazz, bossa nova, and the blues is clear in much of her Pop styling. Young's music is a fusion between pop and dance with some shades of funk, according to her interview with Cosmogirl. During her PBS interview with Emmy Award-winning television news anchor, and Star-Ledger columnist Steve Adubato on OneonOne she stated that when she was young, she used to listen to different styles of music like jazz standards, classical and bossa nova. The artists who have inspired her music are Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, June London, Frank Sinatra, Prince and Britney Spears.|$|E
500|$|Ivan had {{previously}} been married to a woman and he enjoys flirting with females. One such moment is a flirtation with Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman); they bond over her liking of the Brontë novels Wuthering Heights and Shirley. When Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) confesses her attraction to Ivan, he tells her that it is her brother, Paul that he is interested in and kisses him on the cheek. Brocklebank told Laws that he had known Bose for six years prior to joining the serial and was also living with him. He {{said that it would}} be [...] "embarrassing" [...] if romance developed between their characters because of their friendship. However, the actor did think it was [...] "great" [...] to be given [...] "such a meaty storyline". Brocklebank told a reporter from The People that he dreaded to think what his <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> make of the storyline. He said he was interested to receive the reaction from viewers because [...] "it's a subject that hasn't been covered before". The actor later said that he found Ivan's bisexuality [...] "really interesting" [...] because he felt that it had not [...] "really been tackled in soaps before". Brocklebank later spoke of his belief that there was [...] "still a stigma attached to being bisexual" [...] and his hopes that Ivan's storyline would [...] "break some barriers" [...] around the issue.|$|E

50|$|From {{time to time}} {{other family}} members, such as grandfathers and <b>grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> stay over with the family and cause all sorts of mischief. Later the family also adopted two orphans, a young Afrikaner girl named Riekie (Bernice Du Plessis) and a {{coloured}} boy named Neelsie (Eugene Martin).|$|R
500|$|Born {{and raised}} by his single mother in Southern Houston, Texas, Lecrae moved often early in life, living in San Diego, Denver, and Dallas. He has stated {{that he would go}} to church with his Christian grandmother, but {{considered}} it for [...] "older people" [...] and said it [...] "wasn't for me." [...] Lecrae never met his father, who ended up becoming a drug addict. In the song [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", Lecrae reveals that when he was almost eight, a female baby sitter sexually molested him, an incident which Lecrae believes distorted his view of sexuality, influencing his later promiscuous lifestyle. Experiencing abuse and neglect during his childhood, Lecrae used his ability to rap as a source of significance. According to Lecrae, his <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> not allow him to watch rap music videos on television, but he would sneak in late at night. It was in these videos that Lecrae found individuals to look up to. Lecrae states that [...] "there were no Martin Luther Kings or Malcolm Xs, they had all passed away so I had Tupac." [...] After being shown a gun by his uncle, Lecrae began looking up to gangsters and turned to a life of crime. Lecrae remembers taking a BB gun and standing in the street pointing it to a car, frightening the female driver, simply for fun. At 11 years old, he started writing music for a rhythm and blues group formed by some neighbors. His first track, written for a neighborhood crush, emulated the style of Tupac, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest. At the age of 16, he started taking drugs, fighting, was arrested in high school for stealing, and eventually ended up on a gang list. Lecrae tried [...] "pretty much every drug there was to try" [...] except for heroin and crack cocaine.|$|E
2500|$|Pukui {{described}} it as a practice of extended family members meeting to [...] "make right" [...] broken family relations. Some families met daily or weekly, to prevent problems from erupting. Others met when a person became ill, believing that illness was caused by the stress of anger, guilt, recriminations and lack of forgiveness. Kupuna Nana Veary wrote that when any of the children in her family fell ill, her <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> ask the parents, [...] "What have you done?" [...] They believed that healing could come only with complete forgiveness of the whole family.|$|E
2500|$|Because of ill-health Douglas {{was sent}} {{to live with her}} {{maternal}} grandparents, Ellen [...] "Nell" [...] Quayle and Patrick [...] "Pat" [...] Holmes , when only a matter of months old. Her <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> influence her greatly through her knowledge of Manx folklore, song and dance. Her childhood was spent in the vicinity of Lezayre, and later Ballaragh near Laxey, where she received a very free and informal upbringing: [...] "I never went to school and I used to just go round Ballaragh with the farmers and down to Laxey and went out in the boats with the fishermen, and wandering about pretty well as I liked." ...|$|E
50|$|The red {{government}} {{consisted of}} a Great Red War Chief, The Great War Chief's Second, seven War Counselors, the Chief War Speaker, Messengers, Ceremonial Officers and War Scouts. The seven war counselors {{were in charge of}} declaring war when they felt the circumstances made it necessary. The Council of <b>Grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> declare the fate of captives and prisoners taken in times of war.|$|R
5000|$|As well, other Native {{women have}} chosen to {{decrease}} {{the size of their}} families. The <b>grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> choose a path of natural fertility and give birth until they no longer could. In the present day, most mothers decided to limit their families to three to four children. [...] "No longer sources of labor, the children become investments during long years of growth and education." ...|$|R
5000|$|An Ojibwe legend recounted by American ethnographer Frances Densmore {{says the}} dreamcatcher {{originates}} with Spider Woman, known as Asibikaashi; she {{took care of}} the children and the people on the land. As the Ojibwe Nation spread to the corners of North America it became difficult for Asibikaashi to reach all the children. So the mothers and <b>grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> weave magical webs for the children, using willow hoops and sinew, or cordage made from plants: ...|$|R
2500|$|Grandmother Annie Stephens {{was quite}} a character, both vulgar and a tyrant. After gaining control of her father Philip Fitzgerald's money after he died, she splurged on her younger daughters, {{including}} Margaret's mother, {{and sent them to}} finishing school in the north. There they learned that Irish Americans were not treated as equal to other immigrants, and that it was shameful to be a daughter of an Irishman. [...] Margaret's relationship with her <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> become quarrelsome in later years as she entered adulthood. However, for Margaret, her grandmother was a great source of [...] "eye-witness information" [...] about the Civil War and Reconstruction in Atlanta prior to her death in 1934.|$|E
2500|$|During his youth, {{his mother}} would work several jobs {{in order to support}} the family, often taking odd jobs as a nurse and caterer. She would also attend night school to learn English. His father later {{abandoned}} the family, prompting his maternal grandmother to take care of Abel. This allowed him to become fluent in Amharic in his early years, with this Semitic language acting as his first language. His <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> also take him to services at an Ethiopian Orthodox church. About his father, The Weeknd stated [...] "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} awkwardness of being {{surrounded}} by cameramen, castmembers have stated that they eventually adjust to it, and that their behavior is purely natural, and not influenced {{by the fact that}} they are being taped. Winick, an alumnus of the show's third season (San Francisco), adds that castmembers eventually stop thinking about the cameras because it is too exhausting not to, and that the fact that their lives were being documented made it seem [...] "more real." [...] Other cast members have related different accounts. Members of the [...] cast found the cameras burdensome at times, such as Jay Frank and Jacinda Barrett, who felt they intruded on the intimacy of their romantic relationships. Lars Schlichting related an anecdote in which roommate Mike Johnson asked a question when cameras were not present, and then asked the same question five minutes later when cameras were present, which Schlichting adds was not typical of Johnson. Johnson himself has remarked that castmate Barrett [...] "hammed it up a lot," [...] and that roommate Sharon Gitau withheld details of her life out of fear that her <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> react negatively. Movement of the roommates outside of the residence is restricted to places that are cleared by producers through contractual arrangements with locations to allow filming.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of child abuse}} and neglect is epidemic. Many abused children have sustained lifelong injuries. Often they become perpetrators of abuse, continuing the cycle into future generations. Studies have indicated that mothers who are likely to abuse their children can be identified by a predictive method during the prenatal and postpartum periods. Pilot studies have indicated that mothers who are identified by the method and who receive early intervention, consisting of home visits by registered nurses, show a significantly lower rate of verified cases of child abuse. The author proposes a strategy for early intervention to prevent child abuse and neglect and to help infants and children attain their appropriate developmental milestones. The strategy calls for training and employing women from the Foster Grandparent Program. Foster <b>grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> be a valuable resource for high-risk mothers, providing role models for parenting skills in the home setting. Participating foster <b>grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> be trained and supervised in an interdisciplinary team setting. Evaluation of the program would compare the target population of infants and children whose mothers received the proposed intervention with a similar high-risk group that received only traditional interventions...|$|R

It's old enough, and soft as silk, and I'm sure my blessed <b>grandmother</b> <b>would</b> think that it couldn't make a better end," [...] spoke up white-headed Madam Hubbard; for Tabby Tarbell had married one of that {{numerous}} and worthy race.|$|E
30|$|Our {{final point}} is that the {{ultimate}} success of a pension reform depends on many factors. Information and financial literacy that boost understanding of the reforms certainly facilitate their acceptance (Boeri and Tabellini 2012; Fornero 2015). A key role is also played by welfare policies specifically aimed to alleviate the burden of care activities that fall on women, particularly in Mediterranean countries. This requires massive structural improvements in care facilities. Working <b>grandmothers</b> <b>would</b> be less inclined to take sick leave if families could rely on public financial help to substitute at least the most important care activities they still heavily perform.|$|R

60|$|Thus {{authorised}} {{to exhibit}} her learning, even the discreet Maria actually blushed with pleasure. It was that young lady's most highly-prized reward to display her knowledge (in imitation of her governess's method of instruction) {{for the benefit}} of unfortunate persons of the lower rank, whose education had been imperfectly carried out. The tone of amiable patronage with which she now imparted useful information to a woman old enough to be her <b>grandmother,</b> <b>would</b> have made the hands of the bygone generation burn to box her ears.|$|E
