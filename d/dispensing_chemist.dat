60|$|Monsieur Leon Berthelini had a {{great care}} of his appearance, and sedulously suited his deportment to the costume of the hour. He {{affected}} something Spanish in his air, and something of the bandit, with a flavour of Rembrandt at home. In person he was decidedly small and inclined to be stout; his face was the picture of good humour; his dark eyes, which were very expressive, told of a kind heart, a brisk, merry nature, and the most indefatigable spirits. If he had worn the clothes of the period you would have set him down for a hitherto undiscovered hybrid between the barber, the innkeeper, and the affable <b>dispensing</b> <b>chemist.</b> But in the outrageous bravery of velvet jacket and flapped hat, with trousers that were more accurately described as fleshings, a white handkerchief cavalierly knotted at his neck, a shock of Olympian curls upon his brow, and his feet shod through all weathers in the slenderest of Moliere shoes - you had but {{to look at him}} and you knew you were {{in the presence of a}} Great Creature. When he wore an overcoat he scorned to pass the sleeves; a single button held it round his shoulders; it was tossed backwards after the manner of a cloak, and carried with the gait and presence of an Almaviva. I am of opinion that M. Berthelini was nearing forty. But he had a boy's heart, gloried in his finery, and walked through life like a child in a perpetual dramatic performance. If he were not Almaviva after all, it was not for lack of making believe. And he enjoyed the artist's compensation. If he were not really Almaviva, he was sometimes just as happy as though he were.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{construct}} and validate {{a scale of}} professional attitudes for both general practitioners (APMG) and <b>dispensing</b> <b>chemists</b> (APPO). Methods: Stage 1. The construction and qualitative validation of a scale. By interviewing 40 patients in a preventive-care center in Lorraine in addition to 21 general practitioners (MG) and 22 <b>dispensing</b> <b>chemists</b> (PO), we targeted items which could possibly help us formalize a theoretical construction of professional attitudes which intervened in the instauration and follow-up of patient treatments. Then, {{with the help of}} a group of experts, we determined which generic items in the questionnaire could be validated and, finally, identified the functions which fulfilled these attitudes. Stage 2. We statistically validated the APMG and APPO scales and then studied the metric characteristics of the scales by using a questionnaire which was auto-administered to 393 patients in Lorraine. Results: We isolated 15 relational attitudes associated with information, communication and education in general practitioners and nine in <b>dispensing</b> <b>chemists.</b> The APMG and APPO scales form two, one-dimensional scales. Analysis showed high internal coherence (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0. 91 and 0. 87 respectively) and acceptable reproducibility (the correlation coefficient between classes was respectively 0. 74 and 0. 72). Conclusion: The competencies we isolated represent important criteria in the quality of interpersonal doctor-patient and chemist-patient relationships. The metric characteristics of the scales (APMG: 15 items and APPO: 9 items) were deemed satisfactory. This suggests that they can be used as an aid in training in the healthcare professional-patient relationship, in decision-making and in assessing relational competencies...|$|R

We have completed this validation with a differential item functioning analysis to determine if the questions have similar properties among men and women. Results: 15 relational items in general practitioners and 9 in <b>dispensing</b> <b>chemists</b> were identified. They are associated with information, communication and education.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the current situation}} and prospects for community pharmacy practice in Switzerland, a confederation of 26 cantons {{with a population of}} approximately 7 million, located in the center of Europe. FINDINGS: For the past 10 years, the Swiss Association of Pharmacists has directed an in-depth reform of the profession, with measures such as a system of remuneration based on pharmaceutical cognitive services, a quality care program named QMS-Pharmacy, a postgraduate education program (including specific titles and certificates) and obligatory continuous education, programs of public relations and health promotion, innovative services of managed care, generics substitution, and others. DISCUSSION: The implemented changes in management represent a pharmaceutical care solution for Swiss community pharmacies, which face intense competition and a very liberal policy regarding healthcare organization, relating in particular to the important cantonal autonomy, free establishment of ownership of pharmacies, pharmacy chains, <b>dispensing</b> physicians, <b>chemist</b> shops, mail order, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacy in Switzerland is making modernization of its role in public health policy a clear orientation. Priorities for the future include reinforcement of education and academic research in pharmacy practice, demonstration of the added value of pharmacists, integration of new information technologies with pharmacies, and development of new pharmaceutical services for managed care network in collaboration with physicians and other healthcare professionals...|$|R

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this work is the elucidation of the {{circumstances}} {{that led to the}} decline of the apothecaries??? assistants. The Apothecaries Act (1815) formerly recognised them as dispensers of medicine and provided an appropriate examination and qualification. Initially, starting in 1850, men were the only candidates for the examination and it was not until 1887 that the first woman qualified. From that time the occupation became increasingly popular among young women, as it provided them with respectable employment dispensing medicines in institutions and doctors??? surgeries. This situation prevailed until The National Insurance Act (1911) transferred almost all the <b>dispensing</b> to the <b>chemists</b> and druggists. This dissertation examines the aspirations of the Pharmaceutical Society, the Society of Apothecaries, the government and the assistants themselves, all of whom were intimately involved in the changes brought about by the Act. 	While {{much has been written about}} medical history in the nineteenth century, little interest has been shown in the apothecaries??? assistants who were the main dispensers of medicines for a period of about 70 years. This thesis advances our understanding on this subject. Additionally, as most of the assistants were women from middle class families, it opens a window on the social and cultural changes that these young women and their families were experiencing in the second half of the nineteenth century...|$|R
40|$| {{to people}} {{interested}} in agricultural development in ACP countries, {{as well as to}} a number of subscribers in Europe. 7, 500 copies of SPORE are published in each of its two language versions, English and French. The magazine is by no means limited to information concerning CTA activities. It also contains in-depth articles, short news items, bibliographical data accounts of technical meetings and descriptions of sources of information of use to ACP countries. CTA contributes to financing the publication of works popularizing scientific and technical information such as the series a Le Technicien d'agriculture Tropicale' and abstracts such as a Bananas and Plan We also publish monographs in the series a Science and Technology for Development)) : five volumes in this series are currently being prepared, concerning problems of small-scale animal breeding and agroforestry. Seminar proceedings, either in full or in summary form, are published regularly, as are accounts of conferences organized by CTA. All these documents are available in both French and Enalish. The translation of reference works is a major activity for CTA, which has obtained the copyright on a dozen or so text books of sound scientific value and is translating them either into French or English. CTA supports the publication of periodicals destined for the farming community, in particular <` Caribbean Farm News ~ and the news bulletin RISED, published by the European Environment Bureau. Finally, CTA also carries out studies. These may consist of compiling material or preparing the ground work for technical meetings or publications. Or it may involve drawing up inventories of publications, information sources or research being carried out, or directories of programmes, projects, technical expertise or bibliographies. On other occasions, the work may be the preparation of resorts on topical scientific subjects or summaries of the state of knowledge on a given topic, such as the atlas of grazing potential in the Sahel or books aimed at drawing attention to topical issues such as the degradation of the environment. SPORE: You mention sources of information, and ways of circulating this. But is that enough to reach your target-groups ? There is a big difference between a researcher and a peasant farmer. MR DELLERE: If you don't mind a rather bold comparison, I would say that researchers are doctors, whilst those who disseminate information are <b>dispensing</b> <b>chemists.</b> Our role is to put information into a form which can be assimilated, just as chemists put medecines prescribed by the doctor into appropriate forms, giving injections, pills, solutions, and so on {{in such a way that}} the patient will be able to absorb the medicine. Our role is to adapt the information to the target-groups. In fact, we address ourselves to different target-groups. First of all, there are the researchers; what do they need ? They need detailed, up-to-date, well-researched information, together with all the relevant references. Decision- makers and planners are sufficiently educated to understand the information provided by the researchers, but they don't have the time. What they require is very concise information. And then there are the countless numbers of producers. In the countries which concern us, there are perhaps 250 million inhabitants, three-quarters of whom are involved in agriculture. Even if we only take the heads of families, this still amounts to tens of millions of individuals and it is obvious that we cannot address each and every one of them. We are therefore obliged to address an intermediary: the extension worker. The educational and cultural backgrounds of these extension workers are extremely varied. Consequently we must speak to them in a language and style which is accessible to them. This is what CTA aims to do by means of the different media which it uses to disseminate information. It is not an easy task, but it is one that is worth doing. SPORE: Do all these activities mean a cumbersome organization and a large number of staff ? MR DELLERE: No. CTA has always sought to avoid becoming a cumbersome structure. When it was set up in 1984, the Centre employed only seven people, from the Director to the driver. By the end of 1986 CTA had increased its staff to 18 half of them from Europe and half from ACP countries. It has fixed an operational budget and has diversified its programme. During this time, the Centre has established contacts, links and formal agreements with the major institutions in the fields of information, documentation and research in order to be able to fulfill its obligations. CTA is an organization with a small staff and a limited budget. It is an intermediary structure; it must rely on existing structures and draw on expertise from outside. December 1986 can be taken as the end of this second phase. SPORE: When you talk about the end of a second phase, does this mean the third phase will see CTA engaged in an even broader range of activities ? MR DELLERE: No. The third phase should see us consolidating what has been achieved so far and reinforcing our links with our clients, that is with the ACP countries. Now that the CTA has demonstrated its capacity to act, the emphasis must be put on quality. What we need now is in-depth work. More staff will be recruited on the basis of needs we have been able to define more precisely in the course of the previous phase. Our budget will be modified accordingly. The links we have established with ACP countries r'nust be reinforced by setting up regional branch offices. We intend to set up six of these during the duration of the present Lome Convention: in West Africa, East Africa Central Africa, Southern Africa the Caribbean and the Pacific. This network will be supplemented by national focal points, whether these be documentation centres research and development institutions, libraries or any other existing structure which is capable of attaining the objectives which have been set. This phase should be completed by the end of the 3 rd Lome Convention. We must already turn our attention to the period after Lome 111. This means carrying out an assessment of the work done by CTA, with a view to defining the role and importance of the Centre in the context of the next Convention. SPORE: Finally, can you answer a question which has more to do with the philosophy underlying your activities than with the work of the Centre itself. Even if one considers the natural sciences as objective factors, information, by virtue of the choices it makes, is not entirely neutral. Through the range of material you produce, what is the dominant image of agriculture you are trying to promote ? MR DELLERE: It would be incorrect to say that CTA is promoting one particular form of agriculture or another, or one specific development policy. Each member country is a sovereign state and it is not up to the Centre, which is a technical cooperation agency, to intervene in their affairs, any more than it is our business to give agricultural lessons to peasant farmers. If we did, it would be a serious denial of our commitments. Nevertheless, as you say, dealing with information means making choices and putting things into a particular form. These choices imply a certain philosophy of what is useful and a particular conception of the transfer of knowledge. Just now, I have explained that we attach major importance to producers, to peasant farmers. We feel our role is to graft on to their experience the conclusions of research which has been tested and confirmed locally, and to bring about technology transfers on the basis of this peasant experience. As Cheik Amidou Khane says, what we must aim for is cultural cross-fertilization grafting new knowledge onto the traditions of the past. Increases in agricultural production, natural resources and food self-sufficiency cannot be obtained by a plethora of projects which will never be carried out for lack of investments. These objectives can only be attained by mobilizing rural production capacities and through the determination of the peasants themselves. We do not share the view of those who decry as failures all development projects financed by international aid. We consider there have been many successes and no doubt a certain number of failures. When there have been failures, this has often been because socio-economic constraints were not taken into account. A good project should have the effect of a catalyst. A good project should be capable of being duplicated, extended and reproduced, which means it does not require heavy investments but investments suitable for the local producers. A good project is one which can be assimilated by village communities and by the producers, which is why people are so important in development. Behind the technology, it is people who are at the centre of any development process. All our efforts should be directed towards people. We firmly believe all our labours should go towards improving their productivity and their well-being.
