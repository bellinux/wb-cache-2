50|$|Styrene, {{also known}} as <b>ethenylbenzene,</b> vinylbenzene, and phenylethene, is an organic {{compound}} with the chemical formula C6H5CH=CH2. This derivative of benzene is a colorless oily liquid that evaporates easily and has a sweet smell, although high concentrations have a less pleasant odor. Styrene is the precursor to polystyrene and several copolymers. Approximately 25 million tonnes (55 billion pounds) of styrene were produced in 2010.|$|E
40|$|Poly(1 -phenylethene), {{commonly}} referred to as Polystyrene, is one of the world’s most common polymers. Made from the monomer styrene (<b>ethenylbenzene),</b> this polymer is used {{in a wide range of}} products from packing peanuts to disposable cutlery. The method of polymerization used in this research project is called admicellar polymerization. This process consists of four main steps: admicelle formation, adsolubilization, polymerization, and removal of admicelle and polymer. Admicellar polymerization has a number of advantages over related methods of thin film polymerization including simplicity and low cost of components and process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlkoxyamines and {{persistent}} nitroxide (= aminoxyl) radicals are important regulators of nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization. Since polymerization times decrease {{with the increasing}} homolysis rate constant of the CON bond homolysis between the polymer chain and the aminooxy moiety, the factors influencing the cleavage rate constant are of considerable interest. It has already been shown {{that the value of}} the homolysis rate constant kd is very sensitive to the stabilization of both released radical species. X-Ray, EPR, and kinetic data showed that the intramolecular H-bonding radical in the 1 -(diethoxyphosphoryl) - 2, 2 -dimethylpropyl 2 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -dimethylethyl nitroxide (3 a) (homologue of 2 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -dimethylethyl 1 -phenyl- 2 -methylpropyl nitroxide (2 a)) did not occur with the nitroxide moiety as expected but with the phosphoryl group. However, the polymerization rate of styrene (= <b>ethenylbenzene)</b> was significantly enhanced...|$|E
40|$|An earlier ^(15) NMR {{study of}} several series of para-substituted N-(arylmethylidene) amines 1 and 2 {{has shown that}} the {{nitrogen}} shifts are sensitive to the electronic influence of the ring substituents (X), as reflected by the Hammett o substituent parameters. Reasonable linear correlations could also be obtained for the nitrogen shifts of compounds in each series and the β-carbon shieldings of 4 -substituted <b>ethenylbenzenes</b> 3, with the changes in the ^(15) N shifts generally being about twice that of the ^(13) C shifts with respect to the substituent effects. To determine whether the greater sensitivity of the nitrogen shifts arises predominantly from a substituent induced perturbation of the nitrogen unshared pair of electrons, we have measured ^(15) N chemical shifts of a series of para-substituted N-(arylmethylidene) cyclohexanamine hydrotrifluoroacetates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{industrial}} production of poly (ethylene terephthalate), PET, {{continues to increase}} and thus {{it is important to}} understand the composition of fumes resulting from its disposal as a part of incinerated waste. In this study samples of PET material were combusted in a furnace corresponding to the German standard DIN 53 436 at the temperatures of 500 ○ C, 800 ○ C (in an air flow) and also uncontrolled burning in air. The gaseous products were then analysed using three different analytical methods: high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetylene, formaldehyde (methanal) and acetaldehyde (ethanal) were detected by FTIR. Water, methane, acetaldehyde, ethylene, formaldehyde, methanol, acetone, benzene, terephthalic acid, styrene (<b>ethenylbenzene),</b> ethanol, toluene (methylbenzene), xylene (dimethylbenzene), ethylbenzene, naphthalene, biphenyl and phenol concentrations were all quantified by both SIFT-MS and GC-MS. Additionally, the fumes resulting from uncontrolled combustion in air were analysed by FTIR which resolves the rotation-vibration structure of the absorption bands of formaldehyde (2779. 90 and 2778. 48 cm - 1) and propane, which was identified from characteristic vibrations of CH 3 groups at 2977. 00 and 2962. 00 cm - 1. The spectra were compared to the reference standards...|$|E
40|$|Emissions {{of organic}} {{compounds}} from wood burning {{in a modern}} ecolabelled residential boiler (30 kW) were studied. Smoke was collected in the chimney outlet at different times during the burning cycle for subsequent analysis by gas chromatography. The studied ecolabelled wood boiler had high combustion efficiency, and the flaming phase emissions were very low. The greenhouse gas methane (CH 4) was determined in low concentrations of about a few mg m&# 8722; 3 and was the major volatile hydrocarbon emitted. The CH 4 emission factor was calculated to 0. 04 g kg&# 8722; 1 dry fuel. Benzene, in the range 0. 1 - 1 mg m&# 8722; 3, was the predominant aromatic compound emitted. Other major aromatic compounds were methylbenzene, dimethylbenzenes and <b>ethenylbenzene.</b> The concentrations of the studied polycyclic aromatic compounds were generally low, except for naphthalene, which was the third most prominent aromatic compound. However, the total emissions of these health and environmentally hazardous compounds were low. The already low emissions {{of most of the}} organic compounds decreased further {{towards the end of the}} burning cycle, although the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) increased. This indicates that large CO emissions are not necessarily linked to large emissions of organic compounds. Relative to benzene, the concentrations of many of the aromatic compounds studied were higher in the glowing combustion phase, than in the flaming combustion phase. The total environmental and health impact of the studied emissions from the ecolabelled boiler is considered to be low. This wood boiler can be recommended as an environmentally sound residential heating alternative...|$|E
40|$|Three {{photoluminescent}} zinc coordination polymers (CPs), {[Zn 2 (tpeb) 2 (2, 5 -tdc) (2, 5 -Htdc) 2]· 2 H 2 O } n (1), {[Zn 2 (tpeb) 2 (1, 4 -ndc) (1, 4 -Hndc) 2]· 2. 6 H 2 O } n (2), and {[Zn 2 (tpeb) 2 (2, 3 -ndc) 2]·H 2 O}n (3) (tpeb = 1, 3, 5 -tri- 4 -pyridyl- 1, 2 - <b>ethenylbenzene,</b> 2, 5 -tdc = 2, 5 -thiophenedicarboxylic acid, 1, 4 -ndc = 1, 4 -naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, and 2, 3 -ndc = 2, 3 -naphthalenedicarboxylic acid) {{were prepared}} from reactions of Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O with tpeb and 2, 5 -H 2 tdc, 1, 4 -H 2 ndc, or 2, 3 -H 2 ndc under solvothermal conditions. Compound 1 has a two-dimensional (2 D) grid-like network formed from bridging 1 D [Zn(tpeb) ]n chains via 2, 5 -tdc dianions. 2 and 3 possess similar one-dimensional (1 D) double-chain structures derived from bridging the [Zn(tpeb) ]n chains via pairs of 1, 4 -ndc or 2, 3 -ndc ligands. The solid-state, visible emission by 1 − 3 was quenched by Cr 3 +, CrO 4 2 −, and Cr 2 O 7 2 − ions in water with detection limits {{by the most}} responsive complex 3 of 0. 88 ppb for Cr 3 + and 2. 623 ppb for Cr 2 O 7 2 − (pH = 3) or 1. 734 ppb for CrO 4 2 − (pH = 12). These values are well below the permissible limits set by the USEPA and European Union and the lowest so far reported for any bi/ trifunctional CPs sensors. The mechanism of Cr 3 + luminescence quenching involves irreversible coordination to free pyridyl sites in the CP framework, while the Cr 6 + quenching involves reversible overlap of the absorption bands of the analytes {{with those of the}} excitation and/or emission bands for 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} and sulfur isotopic composition of SO 2 and size-segregated sulfate aerosols were determined for Air Monitoring Station 13 (AMS 13) at Fort MacKay in the Athabasca oil sands region, northeastern Alberta, Canada {{as part of}} the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring (JOSM) campaign from Aug 13 to Sep 5, 2013. Sulfate aerosols were collected on filters by a high volume sampler, with 12 or 24 hour time intervals. Significant positive correlations between SO 2 to sulfate conversion ratio (F(s)) and the concentration of α -pinene (r =  0. 85), β -pinene (r =  0. 87), and limonene (r =  0. 82) during daytime and with other alkenes and aromatics (tetrachloroethene (r =  0. 69), 1 -methyl- 4 benzene (r =  0. 71) and <b>Ethenylbenzene</b> (r =  0. 66)) indicate that SO 2 oxidation by Criegee intermediates can be a potential oxidation pathway in highly polluted regions. Enriched 34 S sulfur, largely as SO 2, was emitted by a nearby Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS) and affected isotope samples for a portion of the sampling period. When it was realized this could be a useful tracer, samples collected were broken into two sets. The first set includes periods when the CIMS was not running (CIMS-OFF) and no enriched 34 S sulfur was emitted. The second set is for periods when the CIMS was running when sampling (CIMS-ON) and 34 S sulfur values expected to affect SO 2 and sulfate samples. δ 34 S values for sulfate aerosols with D  >  0. 49  μm during CIMS-OFF periods (no tracer 34 SO 2 present) indicating the sulfur isotope characteristics of sulfate in the region, were isotopically lighter (down to − 4. 5  ‰) than what was expected according to potential sulfur sources in the Athabasca oil sands region (+ 3. 9  ‰ to + 11. 5  ‰). For sulfate aerosols with D   δ 34 S values were lighter than δ 34 S value for SO 2 measured for the same time interval. A significant anti-correlation between δ 34 S values of sulfate aerosols with D   2 was likely oxidized by a transition metal catalyzed pathway on the surface of aerosols. This process involved O 2 and Fe 3 + or Mn 2 + (Transition Metal Ion (TMI) -catalyzed pathway) and this is the only known oxidation pathway favoring lighter sulfur isotopes. Analysis of 34 S enhancements of sulfur compounds during CIMS-ON periods indicated rapid oxidation (on a time scale of minutes) of SO 2 from this local source which was emitted near the ground...|$|E
