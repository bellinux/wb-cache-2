5|$|In 1917, Kenyatta {{moved to}} Narok, {{where he was}} {{involved}} in transporting livestock to Nairobi, possibly as an administrative clerk or a ranching hand. After the British Army conquered German East Africa, Kenyatta relocated to Nairobi where he worked in a store selling farming and <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment.</b> In the evenings, he took classes in a Church Mission School. Several months later he returned to Thika to work with another company, and then gained employment constructing houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in Dagoretti, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court.|$|E

5|$|From the north, Warsaw, which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for the river}} crossings inhibited a flanking attack of Warsaw from the west, which had been Russia's historical path of attack, towards Płock, Włocławek and Toruń, where their forces could cross the Vistula and strike Warsaw from the west and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the Warsaw Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from Warsaw in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E

25|$|After {{arriving}} in the Middle East in November 1941, the battalion {{was assigned to the}} Australian I Corps, serving in Palestine until early 1941. It then moved to the port of Tobruk, where it was allocated to the 6th Division and worked to repair the port's facilities, construct roads and collect captured <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment.</b> When the 6th Division was transferred to Greece, the 2/1st Pioneers remained in North Africa, supporting the 9th Division. The battalion subsequently took part in the Siege of Tobruk, remaining there for five months before being withdrawn when the bulk of Australian forces were relieved in September 1941. Its casualties at Tobruk amounted to 45 killed and 63 wounded; nine personnel were taken prisoner.|$|E
25|$|Following a month's stay at {{her home}} port, the {{aircraft}} carrier headed for New York and a major overhaul. Shangri-La was modified extensively during her stay in the yard. Four of her 5in (127mm) mounts were removed, but she received a new air search and height finding radar and a new arrester system. In addition, much of her electrical and <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment</b> was renovated. After sea trials and visits to Bayonne and Norfolk, Shangri-La returned to Mayport for a week in late March 1963; then put to sea for operations in the Caribbean. Eight months of similar duty followed before Shangri-La weighed anchor for another deployment. On 1 October 1963, she {{headed back to the}} 6th Fleet for a seven-month tour.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of battles (at Radzymin, Grochów and Ostrówek), the Polish forces {{defeated}} elements of the Austrian army, forcing the Austrians to retreat to {{the western side of}} the river. First a major attack on bridges in Warsaw's suburb of Praga by a 6,000-strong Austrian force which had crossed the river earlier was stopped by 1,000 Polish fortified defenders. Soon afterwards the Austrian forces besieging Praga were defeated by General Michał Sokolnicki, first at the battle of Grochów (on April 26), later, when the Austrian army tried to pursue Sokolnicki's Poles, it was routed on May 2 and May 3 at the battle of Góra Kalwaria (in which battle the Poles also destroyed the Austrians' partially built bridge together with their <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment).</b> This left the initiative on the right bank firmly with the Poles.|$|E

25|$|On 30 July 1965, Somers got {{underway}} from Yokosuka, Japan, {{to return}} to the United States. She arrived in San Diego on 12 August and, after a month of leave and upkeep, she resumed normal operations along the west coast. She continued to be so engaged until 11 April 1966 when she entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard to begin conversion to a guided missile destroyer. On that day, she was decommissioned at Hunters Point. From then until February 1968, Somers was in the shipyard having 90% of her superstructure replaced, installing the AN/SPS-48A 3D air search radar, receiving the Tartar surface-to-air missile system and the ASROC antisubmarine rocket system. In addition, her <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment</b> was completely overhauled, and she received a lot of additional electronic gear. On 10 February 1968, Somers was recommissioned at Hunters Point as the Navy's newest guided-missile destroyer, DDG-34.|$|E
25|$|On Kiriwina, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} of landing heavy <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment</b> the construction of Kiriwina airfield was delayed and with heavy rains hindering construction, General Krueger unhappy with the progress of the works replaced Colonel Herndon in command of Kiriwina Force with Colonel John T. Murray. By 20 July a single runway 1,500 feet (457 m) x 150 feet (46 m) was cleared and roughly graded. By the end of July the runway was 5,000 feet (1524 m) and ready to be surfaced with coral. No. 79 Squadron of the RAAF began operations on 18 August. A seaplane base was also constructed at Losuia, consisting of an anchorage and jetty. A PT boat base was also constructed at Louisa in October 1943, however was closed in February 1944. The island was also used as a supply base.|$|E

Meanwhile, combat engineers and truck drivers began using their organic assets, i.e., trucks and <b>engineering</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{to help with the}} rescue operations. 24th MAU medical personnel, Navy dentists LT Gil Bigelow and LT Jim Ware, established two aid stations to triage and treat casualties. Medevac helicopters, CH-46s from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM-162), were airborne by 6:45 AM. U.S. Navy medical personnel from nearby vessels of the U.S. Sixth Fleet went ashore to assist with treatment and medical evacuation of the injured, as did sailors and shipboard Marines who volunteered to assist with the rescue effort. Lebanese, Italian, British, and even French troops, who had suffered their own loss, provided assistance.|$|E
