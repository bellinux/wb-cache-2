A lot of methods are used today, such as the relational distance measuring based on RIBL 2. However, all these methods fail to consider the differences of similarity between the objects in both non-target table and target table, which stopped them from getting a high clustering accuracy. Using canonical correlation analysis in this paper and setting a weight for each table in the relational database, the weight indicated {{its role in the}} calculation of the distance among target tables. In addition, when calculating the distance between the two clusters to find the center of each cluster, turn the calculation of the distance between clusters into a <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> points.

The degradation results in noise and blurring which badly affect identification and extraction of useful information in image data. This study proposes a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using Point-Jacobian iteration to restore a degraded image. The proposed method assumes a Gaussian additive noise and Markov random field of spatial continuity.

Seakeeping response characteristics of a typical trimaran with a variable separation ratio (the ratio of the lateral <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> hull and side hull to the length of the ship) and with different longitudinal positions of the side hulls are analyzed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the behaviour of FRP composite bolted connections with one steel bolt exposed to tension load. The experimental analysis {{of three different}} configuration of bolted connection with one bolt has been conducted with the tension test. The distance between {{the center of the}} hole and the loaded edge of the composite plate is the only changing parameter, where the rest are all constant. Additionally, we checked the current equations, which are in use by the company Fiberline to design one bolt FRP connections. The introduction of the thesis discusses the basic of the FRP materials with their composition, mechanical characteristics, production methods together with standards and guidelines for design of structural elements and connections made of FRP materials. This is followed by the detailed description of the specimen and the test setup itself. The distance between the loaded FRP plate edge and the center of the bolt hole with the diameter of d is for the first series of specimens 1. 5 *d, for the second is 3. 5 *d and for the last one is 7 *d. Each series contained 4 specimens. During the experiment conduction the force and the relative displacement of the steel bolt have been recorded. Due to the bearing stress of the bolt the specimens have experienced different failure mechanisms in relationship to the distance between the center of the bolt hole and the loaded edge of the composite plate. As expected, the worst behaviour of the tested connections has shown the connection with the shortest distance (1. 5 *d). This type of connections has no post fracture load bearing capacity after the first recorded damage and represents brittle failure. For the other two configurations of specimens with longer <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> of the bolt hole and the loaded edge of the FRP plate we observed ductile behaviour and good post fracture behaviour. This shows that we must ensure the minimum adequate <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> of the bolt hole and loaded FRP plate edge whenever we use this type of connections for structural purposes. We additionally confirmed the failure mechanisms in relationship to the distance between the center of the bolt hole and the loaded FRP plate edge which are stated in the internal design manual of the company Fiberline...|$|E

To evaluate the effect of joint geometry on the failure loads the geometrical parameters such as the edge distance of first hole-to-hole diameter (E/D), {{the width of the}} specimen-to-hole diameter (W/D), and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> of two holes-to-hole diameter (K/D) were varied from 1 - 4, 2 - 4, and 3 - 4 respectively.

The unimmersed specimens are called dry specimens. Here Full Cubic models have proved to be very efficient. A comparison of the results from mathematical models with the experimental results from existing literature shows high values of correlation co-efficient, Root Mean Square Error and Maximum Absolute Error.

An implicit finite-volume scheme of second-order accuracy {{is used to}} solve the unsteady Euler equations. The structural equations with bending and torsional degrees of freedom for a rigid blade profile are integrated in time simultaneously with the flow equations. Investigations are performed on flutter of a turbine cascade in bendingmotion andwith alternatemistuning of the structural eigenfrequency. Previousworkby an uncoupled method shows a beneficial effect of alternating frequency mistuning on flutter stability. This paper shows that fluid–structure interaction tends to decrease the effective amount of mistuning. There exists a minimum amount of mistuning required to stabilize the cascade.

In designing moulds for injection molding process, {{it is very difficult}} to achieve efficient cooling with uniform thermal distribution. Most of researchers focus on an optimisation of processing parameters to improve the warpage. However, the conformal cooling channels have advantages with the uniform <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> of cooling channels and mould surfaces in order to get a better thermal distribution thus reducing the warpage.

A case study on front panel housing is investigated and the possibility of fabrication the conformal cooling channels on hard tooling for injection moulding process which is easier to design, fabricate and assemble compared to other method are presented. The performance designs of straight drilled are compared to the two types of MGSS conformal cooling channels by using Autodesk Moldflow Insight (AMI) 2012.

40|$|The optimal {{probability}} {{and distance}} of dispersal largely {{depend on the}} risk {{to end up in}} unsuitable habitat. This risk is highest close to the habitat’s edge and consequently, optimal dispersal probability and distance should decline towards the habitat’s border. This selection should lead to the emergence of spatial gradients in dispersal strategies. However, gene flow caused by dispersal itself is counteracting local adaptation. Using an individual based model we investigate the evolution of local adaptations of dispersal probability and distance within a single, circular, habitat patch. We compare evolved dispersal probabilities and distances for six different dispersal kernels (two negative exponential kernels, two skewed kernels, nearest neighbour dispersal and global dispersal) in patches of different size. For all kernels a positive correlation between patch size and dispersal probability emerges. However, a minimum patch size is necessary to allow for local adaptation of dispersal strategies within patches. Beyond this minimum patch area the difference in mean dispersal <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>center</b> and edge increases linearly with patch radius, but the intensity of local adaptation depends on the dispersal kernel. Except for global and nearest neighbour dispersal, the evolved spatial pattern are qualitatively similar for both, mean dispersal probability and distance. We conclude, that inspite of the gene-flow originating from dispersal local adaptation of dispersal strategies is possible if a habitat is of sufficient size. This presumably holds for any realistic type of dispersal kernel...|$|E

The size of the prototype crawler vehicle with a harvesting part is 2, 800 x 1, 460 x 1, 040 (mm) (LxWxH) with weight of 9. 21 kN (maximum).
