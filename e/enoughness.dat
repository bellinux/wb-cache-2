The pursuit of money and possessions was always subordinated to higher ideals, which were associated with views on ‘the good life’. This subordination led to standards about appropriateness and <b>enoughness.</b> This morality is gone. Dominant economic thinking accepts greed and insatiability as guiding principles. The needs of people {{are supposed to be}} unlimited and economic growth is supposed to create more well-being automatically. The Skidelskys reject this theory. They believe this theory has led to a rat-race in rich countries with adverse effects. They present an interesting proposal: let us make a list of things that are necessary for the good life, and together also sufficient. They think of features like health, safety, harmony with nature and leisure. Their list is acceptable, but such lists are always somewhat arbitrary and can easily lead to paternalism. Such dangers are smaller if subjective happiness is added. It is, however, fascinating and reassuring that the specific proposals of the Skidelskys contribute to more individual freedom. A basic income in particular creates more freedom {{to stay out of the}} rat-race, or to participate less intensively...|$|E

Liver often become target organ because getting mixed up with chemical metabolism which have the character of toxic and also free radical. the free radical and toxic chemical can cause damage of cell, network, macromolecules and also membrane. Activity of the free radical can be weakened by existence of an antioksidan. Basically hepar the functioningness as system defence of body it is of course also have antioksidan the good <b>enoughness,</b> however caused by hit liver shares free radical hence liver activity not maximal, so that require to be given by antioksidan coming from outside body. In so many plant medicinize a lot of consisting in vitaminses able to share antioksidan one of them is Meniran (Phyllantus Niruri L.). Active Compound at meniran which is have potency as antioksidan is flavonoid. Intention of this research is to know effect of extract herba meniran in normal rate bilirubin total of white mouse serum and to know extract concentration of herba meniran which is effective peling in normal rate bilirubin total of white mouse serum which induceed by CCL 4. This Research have the character of True Experiment of Research (real research) by using Complete Random Device (divided RAL) to become 5 treatment and 5 restating, that is; Normal (I), CCL 4 (II), Extract of Herba Meniran dose 5 + CCL 4 (III), Extract of Herba Meniran dose 10 + CCL 4 (IV), and also extract of herba dose meniran 15 + CCL 4 (V). Analysis Data which used in this research is; Test of Normalitas, Test Homogeneity, Test one way ANAVA and Test of Duncan with level 5...|$|E
