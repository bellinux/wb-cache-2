25|$|Louhi (pennant number 999) is a Finnish {{multipurpose}} oil {{and chemical}} spill response vessel {{owned by the}} Finnish <b>Environment</b> <b>Institute</b> (SYKE), but manned and operated by the Finnish Navy. The ship, ordered in 2007, was built by Uki Workboat in Uusikaupunki, Finland, and entered service in May 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{oil recovery}} equipment onboard Louhi {{is based on}} the same stiff brush technology that has been proved to be effective by the previous Finnish spill response vessels. The vessel is equipped with three different types of recovery systems developed and manufactured by Lamor, each suitable for specific weather conditions. The equipment is fully mechanized, remotely controlled and capable of deploying to operational mode in 10 minutes per side. The fourth system, designed for difficult ice conditions, is an innovation developed by the Finnish <b>Environment</b> <b>Institute.</b>|$|E

He also was awarded an honorary {{doctorate}} from Memorial University of Newfoundland at the fall convocation of 1999, another contribution to the impressive collection of approximately fifty academic honorary degrees bestowed on Galbraith. In 2000, he was awarded the Leontief Prize for his outstanding contribution to economic theory by the Global Development and <b>Environment</b> <b>Institute.</b> The library in his hometown Dutton, Ontario was renamed the John Kenneth Galbraith Reference Library in honor of his attachment to the library and his contributions to the new building.|$|E

25|$|The Finnish <b>Environment</b> <b>Institute</b> sent {{offers to}} several shipyards, both {{domestic}} and foreign, during the spring 2007. Construction of the new vessel was awarded to the Finnish shipyard UKI Workboat Ltd (Uudenkaupungin Työvene Oy) and the contract, worth 48 million euro, was signed on 26 October 2007. As the new vessel was more expensive than initially planned, an additional 13 million euro was allocated for the purchase in the supplementary budget. The vessel, expected to enter service in 2010–2011, would be operated by the Finnish Navy and based in Upinniemi, where it would replace the aging spill response vessel Hylje. The ship underwent sea trials in early 2011 and was commissioned in May.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of ordering the new multipurpose icebreaker {{was made in}} late 2004 and the Finnish <b>Environment</b> <b>Institute</b> and the Finnish Maritime Administration were authorized by the Government to make an agreement on the vessel and launch a request for tenders in early 2005. The new oil spill response vessel was expected to enter service in 2007. However, only a few offers were received and the new vessel, for which 134 million euro was reserved in the budget, {{turned out to be}} more expensive than expected. After evaluating more economic alternatives in October 2005 the committee working on the project came to a conclusion that a new multipurpose oil recovery vessel would still be the best solution to improve spill response readiness. 35 million euro were allocated for the purchasing of the new vessel.|$|E
500|$|The Weston Park Weather station, {{established}} in 1882, {{is one of}} the longest running weather stations in the United Kingdom. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record. In collaboration with the Stockholm <b>Environment</b> <b>Institute,</b> Sheffield developed a carbon footprint (based on 2004/05 consumption figures) of 5,798,361tonnes per year. This compares to the UK's total carbon footprint of 698,568,010tonnes per year. The factors with the greatest impact are housing (34%), transport (25%), consumer (11%), private services (9%), public services (8%), food (8%) and capital investment (5%).
