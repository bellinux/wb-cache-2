40|$|When {{you write}} papers, {{how many times}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to make <b>some</b> {{citations}} at a place {{but you are not}} sure which papers to cite? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish to have a recommendation system which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to make <b>some</b> citations? In this paper, we present our initiative of building a context-aware citation recommendation system. High quality citation recommendation is challenging: not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper under composition, but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made. Moreover, it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality. We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX. An extensive empirical evaluation in the Cite-SeerX digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers." [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duos critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show? the answer, obviously, is, Yeah, thats fine." [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I dont see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. Its all right to sell computers, isnt it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil - which I dont. Its not like were helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brian {{said that}} [...] "Good Time" [...] was {{recycled}} for Love You because Spring was unsuccessful and he thought: [...] "Maybe {{the exposure to}} that song to people might be good. Why waste a song?" [...] Mankey has said that Wizzard frontman Roy Wood contributed to [...] "Honkin' Down the Highway" [...] and [...] "Ding Dang", and asserted: [...] "everybody who showed up got subjected to 'Ding Dang'." [...] Fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine further explains: [...] "Brian had an obsession about 'Ding Dang'. He was channeling a certain vibration. He would get hyper-focused on one riff. That might have evolved into 'Shortenin' Bread'. Those songs had that great boogie piano behind them. He had such unique rhythmic expressions, and the voices were like punctuation marks." [...] McGuinn later expounded on his writing contributions, stating that Wilson had one day drove to his house unexpectedly for amphetamines. He recollects: Brian {{parked in the driveway}} and approached the house. I opened the front door and invited him in. [...] "I just wanted to see you," [...] he said. [...] "Do you have any speed?" [...] "Why yes," [...] I replied. [...] "Are you sure you should be taking it?" [...] He said, [...] "I'm running away from Dr. Landy, so it's OK," [...] with a half smile from the side of his mouth. I gave him two Biphetamine 20s and a glass of water and he gulped them down like someone gasping for fresh air after having been submerged for a long time. We had a beer and played pool {{for a while and then}} Brian found his way to the music room. He had seated himself at my upright piano and was playing a tune. [...] "What's that?" [...] I asked. [...] "Oh nothing. Just something I came up with now," [...] he replied. I said, [...] "It sounds great! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to write <b>some</b> words?" [...] "OK," [...] he replied. We played the tune for an hour or so but the only lyrics we had were: [...] "I love a girl and I love her madly / I treat her so fine but she treats me so badly," [...] et cetera. After about five or six hours of this, I got tired and went to bed. When I awoke the next morning, Brian was still at the piano playing the same verse over and over.|$|R
