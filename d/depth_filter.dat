50|$|There {{are several}} kinds of <b>depth</b> <b>filter,</b> some {{employing}} fibrous material and others employing granular materials. Sand bed filters are {{an example of a}} granular loose media <b>depth</b> <b>filter.</b> They are usually used to separate small amounts (<10 parts per million or <10 g per cubic metre) of fine solids (<100 micrometres) from aqueous solutions. In addition, they are usually used to purify the fluid rather than capture the solids as a valuable material. Therefore they find most of their uses in liquid effluent (wastewater) treatment.|$|E
50|$|Point-of-use filters {{for home}} use include granular-activated carbon filters (GAC) used for carbon filtering, <b>depth</b> <b>filter,</b> {{metallic}} alloy filters, microporous ceramic filters, carbon block resin (CBR), microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes. Some filters use more than one filtration method. An {{example of this is}} a multi-barrier system. Jug filters can be used for small quantities of drinking water. Some kettles have built-in filters, primarily to reduce limescale buildup.|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} for {{the variety}} of applications for <b>depth</b> <b>filters,</b> various designs have been implemented within industry to ensure feasible processes whilst retaining the main objective of <b>depth</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Depth</b> <b>filters,</b> where {{particulates}} {{are captured}} within a porous body of material.|$|R
50|$|Two main {{types of}} filter media are {{employed}} in laboratories: a surface filter, a solid sieve which traps the solid particles, {{with or without the}} aid of filter paper (e.g. Büchner funnel, Belt filter, Rotary vacuum-drum filter, Cross-flow filters, Screen filter); and a <b>depth</b> <b>filter,</b> a bed of granular material which retains the solid particles as it passes (e.g. sand filter). The first type allows the solid particles, i.e. the residue, to be collected intact; the second type does not permit this. However, the second type is less prone to clogging due to the greater surface area where the particles can be trapped. Also, when the solid particles are very fine, it is often cheaper and easier to discard the contaminated granules than to clean the solid sieve.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> is {{to act as a}} clarifier, {{separating}} suspended solids from a bulk flow liquid stream and as a result is employed within the final stage of a separation process. By convention, depth filters consist of a single outlet stream of a purified liquid retaining the waste particles within its system. Due to its length it has greater residue holding capabilities than standard filters. In terms of a waste stream, often the outlet stream may be recycled into a subsequent filter {{in order to ensure that}} the stream is free from particulates.A waste stream may also be produced when cleaning the filter media as the water passes in the opposite direction residue caught within the filter media or media particles that have been displaced may emerge from the unit before it is adequately disposed.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a variety}} of filter media that can be {{employed}} in <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> processes the most common being sand. Choice of filter media has effects on filter rate, turbidity and filter surface area. Clean bed head loss (pressure drop) is sensitive to media diameter where increasing media diameter results in a longer time to design head loss. Increasing the media diameter and filter rate however results in degradation of effluent turbidity. To compensate, media depth can be increased to reduce the effects on effluent turbidity. The max value of media depth used in designs so far for high rate filtration is 100 in, whilst the maximum media size used in pilots is 2mm in diameter. [...] Sand, magnetite, coke and anthracite are {{the most commonly used}} particle mediums in industry particularly to their wide availability.|$|E
50|$|Several {{heuristics}} {{are adopted}} {{into the design}} of <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> {{in order to ensure}} consistent operation throughout the life of the filter.|$|R
50|$|With {{the ongoing}} advancements in process technologies, <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> have been {{modified}} {{to improve its}} feasibility within a range of industrial sectors.|$|R

50|$|The {{flow rate}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the driving force over the filter resistance. The two {{conventional}} types of <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> designs: the rapid and slow filters operate with velocities of 5-15 m/h and 0.1-0.2 m/h respectively; whereas pressurised sand filters have design flow rates of 238 L/min14. During operation the filter rate decreases due to increasing filter resistance as particulates get lodged within the media. The rate of filtration affects the rate of clogging with high filter rates causing faster build up. Pilot tests demonstrate that the higher the filter rate the lower the filter area whilst increasing filter rate reduces the time to breakthrough, reduces the time to head loss (increases head loss) and results in shorter runs and lower optimum depths. They also demonstrate that higher filter rates can be achieved by using larger diameter media and increased media depth. High filtration rates depend on media design with the highest filtration rate design in service at 13.5gpm/ft2.|$|E
50|$|Depth {{filters are}} {{the variety of}} filters that use a porous {{filtration}} medium to retain particles throughout the medium, rather than just {{on the surface of}} the medium. These filters are commonly used when the fluid to be filtered contains a high load of particles because, relative to other types of filters, they can retain a large mass of particles before becoming clogged.Depth filtration typified by multiple porous layers with depth are used to capture the solid contaminants from the liquid phase. Due to the tortuous and channel-like nature of the filtration medium, the particles are retained throughout the medium within its structure, as opposed to on the surface. Depth filters pose the added advantage that they are able to attain a high quantity of particles without compromising the separation efficiency. Depth filters are commonly characterised by the sand filter and have the ability to be used with substantially higher filter rates than in other designs. It is these characteristics that have cemented the use and popularity of depth filters as an effective medium for separation. With ongoing advances in process technologies <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> designs are continuously adapting and improving to meet the needs of industry.|$|E
40|$|Recently we {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Suspension Trapping (STrap) for bottom-up proteomics sample processing that is based upon SDS-mediated protein extraction, swift detergent removal and rapid reactor-type protein digestion in a quartz <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> trap. As the <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> surface is made of silica, it is readily modifiable with various functional groups using the silane coupling chemistries. Thus, during the digest, peptides possessing specific features could be targeted for enrichment by the functionalized <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> material while non-targeted peptides could be collected as an unbound distinct fraction after the digest. In the example presented here the quartz <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> surface is functionalized with the pyridyldithiol group therefore enabling reversible in-situ capture of the cysteine-containing peptides generated during the STrap-based digest. The described C-STrap method retains all advantages of the original STrap methodology and provides robust foundation for the conception of the targeted in-situ peptide fractionation in the STrap format for bottom-up proteomics. The presented data support the method’s use in qualitative and semi-quantitative proteomics experiments...|$|E

5000|$|Depth {{filtration}} is also {{widely used}} for the clarification of cell culture clarification. The cell culture systems can contain yeast, bacterial and other contaminant cells and hence, an efficient clarification stage is vital to separate the cells and other colloidal matter to produce a particle free cell system 9. Most <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> used in pharmaceutical processes such as cell system harvesting are composed of cellulose fibres and filter aids. The direct flow design in <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> provides a financially suitable solution by trapping the contaminants within the filter channel while ensuring the maximum recovery rate of the product. The other advantages of this system includes its low power costs, since the pumps utilised in <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> require minimal power input due to the small pressure within the system. Depth filtration is also flexible {{in terms of being}} able to scale up or down the system while outputting a high rate of yield (>95%) Thomas P.O’brien, Large-scale, Single use of depth filtration systems for mammalian cell culture clarification, 2012.|$|R

When using this corrected initial tsunami-height distribution in 2 -D numerical tsunami simulations, the initial velocity {{distribution is}} usually assumed to be zero. Ward (unpublished note available at [URL] doc) proved that a tsunami propagating from a bottom displacement is identical to one from the same initial tsunami-height distribution, except for the <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> correction when the sea bottom uplifts instantaneously. We consider here an arbitrary source time function of χ (t) and examine the initial conditions for 2 -D numerical tsunami propagation simulations using Eqs. (20) and (21).|$|E

As an example, guided <b>depth</b> <b>filtering</b> is used at the encoder side, which results in a 1. 7 % coding gain for 3 D-HEVC and 8. 0 % for Multiview HEVC. However, applying additional filtering at the decoder side might deteriorate the subjective quality. Therefore, adaptively filtering based on the applied pre-processor filter is suggested, which can be done using a supplemental enhancement information message.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} five membrane filters for recovery of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts. These filters included the Pall Life Sciences Envirochek (EC) standard filtration and Envirochek high-volume (EC-HV) membrane filters, the Millipore flatbed membrane filter, the Sartorius flatbed membrane filter (SMF), and the Filta-Max (FM) <b>depth</b> <b>filter.</b> Distilled and surface water samples were spiked with 10 oocysts and 10 cysts/liter. We also {{evaluated the}} recovery efficiency of the EC and EC-HV filters after a 5 -s backwash postfiltration. The backwashing was not applied to the other filtration methods because of {{the design of the}} filters. Oocysts and cysts were visualized by using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody staining technique. For distilled water, the highest percent recovery for both the oocysts and cysts was obtained with the FM <b>depth</b> <b>filter.</b> However, when a 5 -s backwash was applied, the EC-HV membrane filter (EC-HV-R) was superior to other filters for recovery of both oocysts (n = 53 ± 15. 4 per 10 liters) and cysts (n = 59 ± 11. 5 per 10 liters). This was followed by results of the FM <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> (oocysts, 28. 2 ± 8, P = 0. 015; cysts, 49. 8 ± 12. 2, P = 0. 4260), and SMF (oocysts, 16. 2 ± 2. 8, P = 0. 0079; cysts, 35. 2 ± 3, P = 0. 0079). Similar results were obtained with surface water samples. Giardia cysts were recovered at higher rates than were Cryptosporidium oocysts with all five filters, regardless of backwashing. Although the time differences for completion of filtration process were not significantly different among the procedures, the EC-HV filtration with 5 -s backwash was less labor demanding...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a new class}} of {{hierarchical}} depth test which saves memory bandwidth in 3 D graphics rendering engine by reducing the number of pixels being passed to the per-pixel operation pipeline. This new filtering, <b>Depth</b> <b>Filter,</b> can be implemented by adding a simple hardware in front of the per-pixel operation pipeline. m e <b>Depth</b> <b>Filter</b> is a filtering block which decides whether a pixel is shaded by celiain plane. The plane is the mask which has the history that a pixel has appeared in front of the plane. If the pixel is shaded, the pixel can be removed. The simulation shows that <b>Depth</b> <b>Filter</b> reduces the number of pixels to the next stage up to 62. 1 percent in random scene. As a result, 62. 1 % of memory bandwidth is saved with simple extra hardware. 1. INTRODUCTlON Consumer-oriented 3 D graphics hardware rapidly incorporates algorithms that increase flexibility and quality of per-pixel color processing; a recent example is a pixel shader [I]. However, determination if a pixel is visible and needs to be processed by a shader still relies on the screen Z buffer algorithm [2]. If the scene is more and more complex, depth buffer test also becomes a burden to the rendering engine. Consider, for example, an interactive walk-through of a detailed geometric database describing an entire city, complete with vegetation, buildings, Furniture inside the buildings and the contents of the furniture. Traditional visibility test which runs on current graphics hardware, the screen 2 buffer algorithm, is not capable of rendering very complex images at interactive rates because of the shortage of memory bandwidth. The vast memory bandwidth is used in the 2 buffer algorithm because every pixel requests the depth value stored in the depth buffer and the depth of every pixels survived in the depth test must be updated to the depth buffer...|$|E
40|$|The {{clarification}} of biological feed stocks during {{the production of}} biopharmaceutical proteins is challenging when large quantities of particles must be removed, e. g. when processing crude plant extracts. Single-use <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> are often preferred for clarification because they are simple to integrate {{and have a good}} safety profile. However, the combination of filter layers must be optimized in terms of nominal retention ratings to account for the unique particle size distribution in each feed stock. We have recently shown that predictive models can facilitate filter screening and the selection of appropriate filter layers. Here we expand our previous study by testing several filters with different retention ratings. The filters typically contain diatomite to facilitate the removal of fine particles. However, diatomite can interfere with the recovery of large biopharmaceutical molecules such as virus-like particles and aggregated proteins. Therefore, we also tested filtration devices composed solely of cellulose fibers and cohesive resin. The capacities of both filter types varied from 10 to 50 L m- 2 when challenged with tobacco leaf extracts, but the filtrate turbidity was ~ 500 -fold lower (~ 3. 5 NTU) when diatomite filters were used. We also tested pre coat filtration with dispersed diatomite, which achieved capacities of up to 120 L m- 2 with turbidities of ~ 100 NTU using bulk plant extracts, and in contrast to the other <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> did not require an upstream bag filter. Single pre-coat filtration devices can thus replace combinations of bag and <b>depth</b> <b>filters</b> to simplify the processing of plant extracts, potentially saving on time, labor and consumables. The protein concentrations of TSP, DsRed and antibody 2 G 12 were not affected by pre-coat filtration, indicating its general applicability during the manufacture of plant-derived biopharmaceutical proteins...|$|R

Clarification can account for approximate to 40 % of these costs, especially when {{a large amount of}} dispersed particulate material is generated, such as during the extraction of intracellular proteins from plants. Filter capacity can be increased (and DSP costs reduced) by using flocculants. Here we show that cellulose-based filter aids can enhance the positive effect of flocculants by improving <b>depth</b> <b>filter</b> capacity even further. A design-of-experiments (DoE) approach was used to identify the optimal size and concentration of filter aids, at different values of pH and conductivity, for the clarification of tobacco leaf extracts during the production of a monoclonal antibody and a fluorescent protein. Filter aids approximate to 28 or approximate to 100 m in length at concentrations of approximate to 10 and approximate to 5 g L- 1 respectively were most efficient in combination with a strong cationic flocculant, but were ineffective without the flocculant.
