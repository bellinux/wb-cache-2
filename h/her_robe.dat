5|$|Meanwhile, Lois urges Peter {{to watch}} {{relationship}} videos with her, but the videos {{turn out to}} be pornography hosted by Dr. Amanda Rebecca, who strips after asking the women to leave the room. Peter becomes addicted to the videos, much to Lois's chagrin. She gets herself on the end of one of the tapes in black lingerie and entices Peter. While kissing, Peter rewinds the tape, playing the part of Lois taking <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> off over and over.|$|E
5|$|Mary sits under a brocade canopy or {{cloth of}} honour, painted in brown hues which have since {{discoloured}} to dark green. The canopy hangs {{down to a}} wooden bench attached to the wall behind her. Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her neck is a light veil, and she {{is shown in the}} act of nursing. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.|$|E

5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Santa Muerte {{generally}} {{appears as}} a skeletal female figure, clad in a long robe and holding one or more objects, usually a scythe and a globe. <b>Her</b> <b>robe</b> can be of any color, as more specific images of the figure vary widely from devotee to devotee {{and according to the}} rite being performed or the petition being made.|$|E
25|$|There are {{variations}} on {{the color of the}} cloak, and in which objects Santa Muerte holds in her hands. Interpretations of the color of <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> and accoutrements also vary. Images of Santa Muerte range from mass-produced articles sold in shops throughout Mexico and the U.S. to handcrafted effigies, to tattoos. Sizes vary immensely from icons held in one hand to those requiring a pickup truck to transport them.|$|E

25|$|Cassiopeia {{has been}} {{variously}} portrayed throughout her {{history as a}} constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon in her right hand, wearing a crown, {{as well as a}} two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left hand, holding <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> in her right hand. This depiction is from Augustin Royer's 1679 atlas.|$|E
25|$|The Crusade itself {{achieved}} little. Louis was a {{weak and}} ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. In eastern Europe, the French army was at times hindered by Manuel I Comnenus, the Byzantine Emperor, who {{feared that the}} Crusade would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. Notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at Constantinople, Louis was fêted and Eleanor was much admired. She was compared with Penthesilea, mythical queen of the Amazons, by the Greek historian Nicetas Choniates. He added that she gained the epithet chrysopous (golden-foot) from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed <b>her</b> <b>robe.</b> Louis and Eleanor stayed in the Philopation palace just outside the city walls.|$|E
25|$|Javuto finds Katia {{and takes}} her to Asa. Asa begins to drain Katia, who ages rapidly during the act. Just as the witch goes {{to take her}} blood, she is thwarted by the {{crucifix}} around Katia's neck. Gorobec enters the crypt to save Katia but finds Asa instead. Asa pretends to be Katia and tells Gorobec that the now weakened and unconscious Katia is really the witch. She tells him to kill Katia immediately by staking her. He agrees {{but at the last}} possible moment he notices the crucifix she is wearing. He turns to Asa and opens <b>her</b> <b>robe,</b> revealing a fleshless skeletal frame. The priest then arrives with numerous torch-carrying villagers, and they burn Asa to death. Katia awakens from her stupor, her life and beauty restored, and is reunited with Gorobec.|$|E

500|$|According to a {{description}} in her {{card in the}} Disney Villains set, [...] "the Witch's ugliness symbolises the evil disguised by the Queen's beauty." [...] Her castle might {{have been inspired by}} Spain's Alcázar of Segovia and the throne she is uses has a peacock motif to symbolise her extreme vanity. The Queen is clad mostly in black and other [...] "negative" [...] dark colors, providing a contrast to Snow White's bright colorful wardrobe, and has [...] "shiny black hair" [...] under her hood. Her royal costume was painted with specially developed paints made to look like satin for her collar and like velvet for <b>her</b> <b>robe.</b> The Queen's music tracks were created with low celio notes, basses, and bassoons; the scribblings in her book of spells were written in Italian.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to take off <b>her</b> <b>robe,</b> and stand there in her bathing suit. She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E
500|$|Cicadas {{have been}} {{featured}} in literature {{since the time of}} Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty (1766–1122 BC.). They are described by Aristotle in his History of Animals and by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by Hesiod in his poem Works and Days [...] "when the Skolymus flowers, and the tuneful Tettix sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song". In the classic 14th-century Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Diaochan took her name from the sable (diāo) tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas (chán), which adorned the hats of high-level officials. In the Japanese novel The Tale of Genji, the title character poetically likens one of his many love interests to a cicada for the way she delicately sheds <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> the way a cicada sheds its shell when molting. A cicada exuviae plays a role in the manga Winter Cicada. Cicadas are a frequent subject of haiku, where, depending on type, they can indicate spring, summer or autumn.|$|E

500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has heard of such a thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on the hem of <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E
500|$|As {{she leaves}} the mansion, she exits into [...] "Emancipation Street", a ghetto looking plaza made up entirely of props and hand made stores. With shops named [...] "So So Fetch" [...] and [...] "Pink Yet Lavender", Carey then walks up to a wall, where she passes Jermaine Dupri, who makes a cameo appearance. As she leans on the wall, her coat slips off, and two schoolgirls do a shake dance at the pay phones. Carey then appears in a Lamborghini Murcielago {{speaking}} on her PDA with Chris Tucker, who as a cameo, appeared {{on the set of}} the video shoot, as the man in the passenger's seat. As Carey leaves her lover a second message, he is seen frolicking pool-side with two other women, while she says [...] "with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets." [...] Her phone breaks up as she drives past the [...] "Hollyhood" [...] sign, so she tells him, [...] "Hold on," [...] singing, [...] "Save this recording, because I'm never coming back home." [...] Carey is then shown on bleachers at a high school football game, with Da Brat featured as a cameo act, as she argues with a man in the background. She writes 'MIMI' on one of the bleachers and the letters transform into a large shiny [...] "MIMI" [...] sign made of lights, which appear in large, vibrant lights. Carey walks up to a microphone in front of the large 'MIMI' lights, and dances and sings in front of the camera, wearing a revealing black ensemble and leopard print boots. In the final scene, Carey is seen on a beach, as she slips out of <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> and walks into the sunset, with the glare obscuring whether she's wearing any clothing.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{revolves}} around the fantasy of a computer store employee, as he dreams about a relationship with Carey. Throughout the video, the pair is seen to have a pillow fight; play laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars; and throw a frisbee. The video also features Carey in various revealing outfits. The video begins with a small Compu Nerd Volkswagen, parodying Geek Squad, pulling up into the driveway of Carey's large manor. As the employee introduces himself, Carey flippantly refers {{to him as a}} [...] "CompuNerd", and asks him to follow her to the broken computer. As he attends to it, Carey removes <b>her</b> <b>robe,</b> and enters her large closet, leaving McBrayer to begin his fantasy with her. The first scene is of Carey wearing a tight pink number, laying seductively on the bed, as the computer employee plays with an electric guitar. He joins her on the bed, and she begins playfully spanking him as the two enter a pillow fight. Another scene is interspersed, of Carey sporting a mini silver dress, with tall socks and heels, flaunting her body. The fantasy then adapts to a new scenery, of the pair dressed in medieval clothing, while walking a unicorn, followed by the duo in a large room in the mansion, racing electronic cars. As they proceed to play laser tag, they are shown outside, laying on a picnic bed, with Carey dressed in a [...] "naughty school girl outfit". They both get up, and begin to throw a frisbee, before relocating in front of the main stairwell in the mansion. The final scenes of the fantasy are of Carey, wearing a shortened red gown, standing atop the staircase, and McBrayer climbing on his knees while carrying flowers. All the scenes begin to fade, with the last being Carey feeding him by hand by the refrigerator, as he wakes up with Carey, now dressed, poking him. She tells the employee that security will let him out when he is finished, and leaves him while he is still fantasizing about her.|$|E

2500|$|However, Helen's {{portraits in}} Troy seem to {{contradict}} each other. From one side, {{we read about}} the treacherous Helen who simulated Bacchic rites and rejoiced over the carnage of Trojans. On the other hand, there is another Helen, lonely and helpless; desperate to find sanctuary, while Troy is on fire. Stesichorus narrates that both Greeks and Trojans gathered to stone her to death. When Menelaus finally found her, he raised his sword to kill her. He had demanded that only he should slay his unfaithful wife; but, when {{he was ready to}} do so, she dropped <b>her</b> <b>robe</b> from her shoulders, and the sight of her beauty caused him to let the sword drop from his hand.* Maguire, Helen of Troy, 52 Electra wails: ...|$|E

Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." [...] The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying: [...] "O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, roll in the ashes" [...] (...) [...] The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God: [...] "I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes" [...] (...) [...] Just prior to the New Testament period, the rebels fighting for Jewish independence, the Maccabees, prepared for battle using ashes: [...] "That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes" [...] ( [...] ; see also [...] ).|$|E
