30|$|Unfortunately, the {{bootstrap}} approach makes {{a strong}} independence assumption that is inappropriate for DWD data under either a design- or model-based approach (for {{details on the}} distinction, see Gregoire 1998). Within a design-based framework (Kaiser 1983; Gregoire and Valentine 2008), DWD pieces are fixed but sample selection is random. The entire transect is a single randomly selected sample unit, and treating segments within a sample unit {{as if they were}} drawn independently is anathema. Without substantial additional information (such as the joint inclusion probabilities of the individual pieces of DWD) it is difficult to make progress from <b>this</b> <b>perspective,</b> <b>beyond</b> inference based on the design that was actually employed (except for changes in the number, rather than the length, of sample transects). While a design-based approach has substantial benefits, both in terms of formulating a design for a specific inventory, and computing defensible estimates once the data are in hand, to understand how different designs (such as varying transect lengths) would impact estimates and their uncertainty, a model is invaluable. However, from a model-based perspective, the independence of short, contiguous segments is also suspect. One might expect positive autocorrelation of the values from adjacent segments, {{not only because of the}} potential for spatially clumped inputs from tree mortality, but also because local terrain might cause DWD pieces that are close to each other also to share similar orientation. In the presence of positive autocorrelation, the variance of estimates from transects of a given length would be higher than that implied by independent segments, and the transect length needed to reach a given level of accuracy would be longer. To summarize: from a design-based perspective, successive segments within a randomly selected transect are likely to display autocorrelation because of the fixed characteristics of the downed woody debris population. From a model-based perspective, the independence of successive short segments is also suspect, because of likely clumping in the random process that generates the population. Whichever perspective is taken in inference, it would appear important to incorporate autocorrelation within any simulations.|$|R

Before investing financial resources in prevention measures, we should try to identify intervention points that have proven to be causal for doping behaviour throughout various studies, and also develop and evaluate new intervention measures.

40|$|International audienceThe Messinian {{salinity}} crisis (MSC) {{is characterized}} by gigantic erosion that remodels the margins while a thick, essentially evaporitic and detrital, sedimentary sequence forms in the deep basins. Based on recent (MAURESC, 2003) and earlier (MESEA 1, 1990; MAGIRAA, 1996; GEOBREST, 2002) seismic reflection data, this work brings to light {{the record of the}} MSC on the Provençal margin, which has until now been rarely explored from <b>this</b> <b>perspective.</b> <b>Beyond</b> its strictly regional interest, this study fits into a larger synthesis of MSC seismic markers in the Mediterranean and Black Sea marine domain [Lofi et al., 2011] and employs the new nomenclature established on this occasion. The results obtained reveal a Messinian detrital body (CU unit) of 625 metres maximum thickness {{at the foot of the}} margin, accumulating at the mouths of the principal canyons. Its form, facies and extension assimilate it to clastic fans, fed by subaerial erosion linked to the MSC. The relative geometry of CU and the Messinian units MU and UU deposited in the deep basin give indications to their chronostratigraphic relations. The deposition of the CU unit is posterior to the basal part of the mobile unit consisting of halite (MU), but contemporary to its top. These results agree with the recent scenarii, which propose that the precipitation of MU in the basin began early, during the lowering of the sea level, and ended at a low level during the MSC [Blanc, 2000; Martin et al., 2001; Sage et al., 2005; Ryan, 2009]. The UU unit surmounts MU and is subdivided into two sub-units with perceptibly different seismic facies : UU 1 at the base and UU 2 at the summit. UU 1 could correspond to a unit containing more halite and/or more clastic material than UU 2. The UU 1 sub-unit could be partially contemporary to the CU unit. Concerning salt tectonics and its markers, three structural provinces have been evidenced in the sector of study, respectively : an upslope domain in extension (normal faults), an intermediary domain in translation (tabular MU) and a downslope domain in contraction (salt diapirs). These domains are directly linked to the gravity spreading and/or gliding of the brittle sedimentary cover formed by the CU, UU and Plio-Quatenary units and of the mobile level, MU. In the study area, a close relation between the distribution and thickness of CU and salt tectonics has additionally been evidenced at the mouths of the large Messinian canyons, being best expressed where CU is thick...|$|R

40|$|In {{this book}} Jos Bazelmans {{offers a new}} {{perspective}} on the relationship between lord and retainer in early medieval society. <b>This</b> <b>perspective</b> goes <b>beyond</b> established politico-economic interpretations and aims for an interpretation of this relationship in ritual-cosmological terms. Drawing on recent developments within French structuralist anthropology and the anthropology of gift exchange, Bazelmans develops a new model of early medieval socio-political structure (as represented in Old English Beowulf) which explicitly deals with exchange relations between the living and the supernatural, the commensurablity of subject and object in gift exchange, and the whole set of interdependent life-cycle rituals of lords and their warrior-followers. The value of gifts is considered to be determined not only by their function within a competitive game about prestige, status and power, but also by its equivalence with a constituent. The value of the gift is fundamental to the noble person and develops through a man's life-time. It is, ultimately, of a supernatural origin. The model enables us to understand certain acts at Beowulf's funeral pyre which at first sight appear to be no more than an ethnographic curiosity (Beowulf 3111 b- 3114 a). The warrior's contributions to his pyre form the concluding part of a grand ritual undertaking in which society as a whole is involved and in which the constitution of the noble person, and the disarticulation of that person at his death, is realized. This ritual undertaking goes beyond the politico-economic concerns of the participants which are central to established power-based models of early medieval societal structure. The volume includes an extensive overview of the anthropology of gift exchange...|$|R

The economic growth model has been identified as patriarchal, in many ways. The two movements diametrically opposing economic growth and patriarchy, namely degrowth and feminism, only partially overlap. Degrowth lacks feminist voices and dominant contemporary feminism is deemed compatible with economic growth.

Whereas much of computational social science has offered new ways of monitoring health behavior and healthcare behavior, or for analyzing those data, a further contribution has been to directly analyze these social processes in system dynamics models, microsimulation, and agent-based models. These approaches allow for computational experiments that assist in predicting and interpreting outcomes from health interventions.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} one of the most {{controversial}} and ambitious urban regeneration policies of recent years – the plan to create sustainable communities via Housing Market Renewal Pathfinders (HMRP). Announced as a ‘step change’ in urban policy to overcome problems of low demand and abandonment experienced most acutely in nine former industrial towns and cities in the north and midlands of England, the Sustainable Communities Plan (SCP) (ODPM, 2003 a) involves the demolition and relocation of mainly white, working class inner-urban communities. This thesis focuses on a year long moment in the process of regeneration in one such HMRP in North East England, known as ‘Bridging NewcastleGateshead’ (BNG) and draws from rich, detailed ethnographic case studies of three former industrial communities. Originally, the thesis draws together critical engagements with the concepts of space, governance, community, sustainability and materiality to develop a relational understanding of urban regeneration. Starting with an understanding of ‘spaces of regeneration’ as spaces in the process of becoming <b>this</b> <b>perspective</b> moves <b>beyond</b> normative, prescriptive understandings of spaces as static and contained and subject to the process of spatial regulation from above i. e. power over. Rather than a straightforward process of spatial regulation to transform people and places, the process of regeneration involves uncertainties, negotiations, contestations and emotions between the multiple social, material, economic and environmental networks. The thesis has drawn together urban theories and empirical evidence (including historical and contemporary policy analysis as well as a range of qualitative methods) to illustrate the relational transformation of people and places. Governmentality provides the main conceptual framework. This leads to an in-depth exploration of the rationalities and technologies of urban regeneration from three perspectives in the empirical chapters - governing communities, demolishing communities and transforming communities. ...|$|R
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has become}} a {{pervasive}} topic in the business literature, but has largely neglected the role of institutions. This introductory article to the Special Issue of Socio-Economic Review examines the potential contributions of institutional theory to understanding CSR {{as a mode of}} governance. <b>This</b> <b>perspective</b> suggests going <b>beyond</b> grounding CSR in the voluntary behaviour of companies, and understanding the larger historical and political determinants of whether and in what forms corporations take on social responsibilities. Historically, the prevailing notion of CSR emerged through the defeat of more institutionalized forms of social solidarity in liberal market economies. Meanwhile, CSR is more tightly linked to formal institutions of stakeholder participation or state intervention in other advanced economies. The tensions between business-driven and multi-stakeholder forms of CSR extend to the transnational level, where the form and meaning of CSR remain highly contested. CSR research and practice thus rest on a basic paradox between a liberal notion of voluntary engagement and a contrary implication of socially binding responsibilities. Institutional theory seems to be a promising avenue to explore how the boundaries between business and society are constructed in different ways, and improve our understanding of the effectiveness of CSR within the wider institutional field of economic governance. 26 page(s...|$|R

We argue that more secure, less vulnerable fishers make more effective and motivated fishery managers in the context of participatory or rights-based fisheries governance, and we further suggest that insecurity among fishers living in poverty can be most effectively addressed by social and political development that invokes the existing legal framework supporting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <b>This</b> <b>perspective</b> goes well <b>beyond</b> the widely advocated notion of 'rights-based fishing' and aligns what fishery sector analysts call the 'rights-based approach' with the same terminology used in the context of international development.

Considering the specificities of everyday school, its established rules and the educational guidelines historically constructed, aims to understand whether and how students involved in radio school activities of two elementary schools in the city of Fortaleza- Brazil, under the Brazilian Federal Program called âMais EducaÃÃoâ, participate in the programsâ production and the conducting of activities related to radio, for example, the choice of topics, research conducting, finalizing the script, choice of music and program implementation, including handling equipments. Accordingly, we seek to identify whether the radio productions have been able to translate the interest of these students, addressing issues related to their daily lives and establish itself as a space which favors the development of their autonomy as subjects. In order to develop this analysis, we rely on authors such as Foucault, Freire, Soares, Souza, among others and we resorted to the methodology used which was the participant observation with ethnographic incursions. Conversations with students participating in the activities of the radios of both schools investigated were also conducted throughout. Based on the research we can conclude that, despite the potential participation of radio school experiences, its existence in the school itself does not ensure the development of autonomous and participatory practices. Making the radio equipment, the computer, the internet access and other more sophisticated equipment available, whereas important, are insufficient to guarantee them.
