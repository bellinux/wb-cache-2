40|$|The {{identification}} of <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations</b> {{is important to}} the improvement of road safety. However, there is still no consensus on the best method of identifying <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations.</b> While traditional methods, such as the hot spot methodology, focus on the physical distances separating road crashes only, the hot zone methodology takes network contiguity into consideration and treats contiguous road segments as <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations.</b> Compared with the hot spot method, hot zone methodology is a relatively new direction and there still remain a number of methodological issues in applying the method to the {{identification of}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations.</b> Hence, this study aims to provide a GIS-based study on the identification of crash hot zones as <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations</b> with both link-attribute and event-based approaches. It first explores the general procedures of the two approaches in identifying traffic crash hot zones, and then investigates the characteristics of the two approaches by conducting a range of sensitivity analysis on defining threshold value and crash intensity with both simulated and empirical data. The results suggest that it is better to use a dissolved road network instead of a raw-link-node road network. The segmentation length and the interval of reference points have great impacts on the identification of hot zones, and they are better defined as 100 meters considering the stabilities of the performance. While employing a numerical definition to identify hot zones is a simple and effort-saving approach, using the Monte Carlo method can avoid selection bias in choosing an appropriate number as the threshold value. If the two approaches are compared, it is observed that the link-attribute approach is more likely to cause false negative problem and the event-based approach is prone to false positive problem around road junctions. No matter which method is used, the link-attribute approach requires less computer time in identifying crash hot zones. When a range of environmental variables have to be taken into consideration, the link-attribute approach is superior to the event-based approach in that it is easier for the link-attribute approach to incorporate environmental variables with statistical models. By investigating the hot zone methodology, this research is expected to enrich the theoretical knowledge of the identification of <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations</b> and to practically provide policy-makers with more information on identifying road hazards. Further research efforts have to be dedicated to the ranking of hot zones and the investigation of false positive and false negative problems. published_or_final_versionGeographyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Based on GIS and {{the basic}} model of hot zone, the {{identification}} method of road hot zone was studied. Road networks were merged by following a priority sequence, {{and the basic}} spatial units(BSU) of road were obtained. The spatial distribution of traffic accidents was simulated, and the threshold value of traffic accident for each BSU was defined by using Monte Carlo method. The spatial contiguities of BSUs were examined to obtain hot zones, and the hot zones around Shanghai Expo Venue were identified. Analysis result shows that the share of irregular BSUs decreases from 41. 5 % to 14. 8 % after merging road networks. There are 84 hot zones involving only vehicles and 33 hot zones involving pedestrians, which accords with the real situation.

30|$|The {{developed}} models enabled both {{identification of}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations</b> (network safety ranking) {{and evaluation of}} safety of planned infrastructure (road safety impact assessment). The models also provided interpretation of influence of statistically significant risk factors. Effects of typical variables (AADT, length, number of intersection legs, etc.) were consistent with literature [68]. On the other hand, several variables did not have sufficiently significant effect (for example channelization, parking space along motorway or intersection bypass lanes). However, {{it is important to}} note, that the reported effects are only associations; in order to capture causal effects, one would need to conduct before-after studies. Another caveat is that although original dataset was relatively large, there is always a risk of omitted variable bias [54]. Examples of variables, which were not taken into account, may include for example speed behaviour. Another issue was use of proportions of observed accident severities in obtaining accident severity frequencies, caused by sample size limitations. While this has been used by some authors [58], it was noted as potentially biased, due to ignoring correlations between severities and traffic volumes [75].|$|E

40|$|As road crashes are {{constrained}} to a one-dimensional space, {{this paper}} analyzes the {{spatial distribution of}} road crashes with a GIS-based network-constrained kernel density method. A dissolving procedure is introduced before road segmentation, which can significantly reduce the undesirable effects during the segmentation process. The result of the sensitivity analysis reflects that the bandwidth imposes great impacts on the spatial distribution of density estimates. Different bandwidths may be considered for different types of traffic crashes. In particular, vehicle-pedestrian crashes in downtown areas tend to be highly localized and a narrower bandwidth is more appropriate. Vehicle-vehicle crashes at the suburb and rural areas, however, tend to happen in a less concentrated manner along a continuous stretch of dangerous road segments; and a wider bandwidth is more powerful in identifying these hot zones.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{objective}} is to compare three approaches to identification of hazardous road locations: (1) Traditional reactive accident-based approach, resulting in identification of accident black spots; (2) State-of-the-art empirical Bayes method using accident prediction model, which identifies critical locations, i. e. both real and potential black spots; (3) Proactive âpreliminaryâ road safety inspection, identifying the risk factors, which may potentially increase accident occurrence and severity. Regional rural road network (approx. 1000 km) in South Moravia, Czech Republic was used. The methods were applied in identification and ranking of <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations</b> in the studied network. It was found that black spot approach is not a suitable method, especially in low-volume road network with scattered accident occurrence. On the other hand risk index, based on road safety inspection, is a valid alternative, with ranking performance comparable to state-of-the-art empirical Bayes method. In addition both empirical Bayes and risk index methods are compared {{with respect to their}} data requirements.

In this process empirical Bayes approach, using accident prediction models, has been recommended.

There is also a question whether each region requires its specific model or whether a transfer from elsewhere is feasible. These decision points motivated the presented study, which was conducted with data from national road network in two adjacent regions in the southeast of the Czech Republic (South Moravian region and ZlÃ­n region). For the purpose of network safety ranking, separate accident prediction models have been developed and applied in both regions. Several analysis steps were conducted in order to compare the model quality and performance, as well as both temporal transferability (between various periods) and spatial transferability (between the regions). The idea was to develop a transferable model, which would ease up on demands on data collection and modelling efforts and would thus increase effectiveness of the network safety ranking process.

This paper presents a methodology and case study of Rourkela, which is to contribute a national action plan for hazardous material transport for Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP). The main objective, is to develop a planning system for hazardous material transport. The planning system considers both economic and risk values. Risk assessment for the route system is discussed. Firstly, hazardous material identification and classification is studied and international norms for accidents of hazardous material carrying vehicle and their influence on routing decision are briefly described.. The consequences of the hazardous material accident are explosion, heat radiation, and toxicity. Secondly, intelligence phase is mainly used to understand the problem.

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{there are}} many efforts in {{different}} countries to identify <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations</b> through different models in Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Our goal was to identify hazardous locations {{on a part of}} Yazd-Kerman highway located in Yazd province. It was by using hot zone method in GIS, and the relationship between these locations and environmental and demographic variables was assessed. Methods: By using hot zone method, each road (Yazd-Kerman & Kerman-Yazd path) was divided into segments named Basic Spatial Units (BSUs). A BSU was defined as 1 Kilometer. For each BSU, variables such as number, time and cause of crashes, vehicle type, weather, age, sex and status of drivers were collected. The hazardous locations were classified in two definition groups as Hot Zones and Yellow Zones. Results: According to results, 17 % of total 212 -kilometer road was identified as hazardous locations. The most drivers engaged in crashes in these locations (34 %) were in age group of 31 - 40. Motorcars, trailers and trucks had the most crashes, respectively. The most frequently cause of crashes was non-attendance to front and miss control of vehicle. The most number of crashes were taken place in the sunny climate. Conclusion: Considering that hazardous locations increase near entrances, exits and junctions, it seems that paying attention to road design principles may cause a great reduction in the crash rate. A safe design also can reduce the effect of environmental factors such as weather, time and even vehicle type. Furthermore a good training program, especially for age 21 - 40, may have a great role in minimize the human errors in crash occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Road safety {{has been}} a main {{societal}} and policy issue in many European countries since {{the early years of}} last decade. After the 2000 - 2010 Road Safety Programme launched by the European Commission, in 2011 the Commission adopted the new 2020 programme, even more demanding than the previous. As the societal consequences of road casualties are increasingly perceived as a core dimension of smart mobility, road safety system is now facing new challenges. Current mobility shifts to softer and greener transportation means raise new safety concerns for an increasingly larger share of vulnerable road users. The need to integrate road safety requirements with other residential, mobility, and environmental policies calls for a more detailed understanding of the phenomenon at different spatial levels and with different observation lenses. The pilot study described in this paper is a contribution to this end. It aims at identifying the accident prone sites of the regional road network to help prioritizing safety interventions, by the regional administration having road planning responsibilities. The study develops a screening approach to select <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations,</b> outside urban premises, from the Piedmont provincial and state roads. The most recent data for the 2010 - 2012 years were considered, drawn from the ISTAT road accident database, managed by the CMRSS.

A methodological approach for the safety evaluation of two-lane rural highway segments that uses both analytical procedures referring to road safety inspection processes and alignment design consistency models is presented. Road safety inspections (RSI) are recognized as an effective tool for identifying safety issues. However, due to the subjective nature of the process, they may give rise to disagreements which limit their effectiveness. A RSI procedure aimed at improving the effectiveness and {{the reliability of the}} methodology was defined. Many studies show that safety evaluations based on the analysis of alignment design consistency can be effective in identifying <b>hazardous</b> <b>road</b> <b>locations.</b> The proposed approach makes use of theoretical-experimental models for the evaluation of alignment design consistency. A safety index (SI) that quantitatively measures the relative safety performance of a road segment is calculated from the procedure. The SI is formulated by combining three components of risk: the exposure of road users to road hazards, the probability of a vehicle being involved in an accident and the resulting consequences should an accident occur. Validation of the procedure was carried out on a sample of roads by a comparison of the risk rank obtained using the SI and accident history. The SI was assessed in 30 segments chosen from a sample of two-lane rural highways in Italy and the actual accident situation was obtained with the EB procedure. Spearmanâs rank-correlation was used to determine the level of agreement between the rankings obtained using the two techniques. The results from the Spearmanâs rank-correlation analysis validate the SI, indicating that the ranking from the SI scores and the EB estimates agree at the 99. 9 % level of significance with a correlation coefficient equal to 0. 8...|$|E
