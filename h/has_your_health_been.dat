40|$|Self-ratings {{of health}} are uniquely {{predictive}} of morbidity and mortality, and they encompass people’s evaluations of many medical, psychological, {{and social conditions}} in their lives. However, the longitu-dinal trajectory of self-rated health has not been evaluated to date. In the present study, 59 -year longitudinal multilevel analyses (1940 – 1999) of data from 1, 411 men and women revealed that self-rated health was relatively stable until age 50 {{and then began to}} decrease in an accelerating fashion {{through the rest of the}} life course. Men had higher self-rated health throughout most of adulthood than did women but had steeper linear rates of decline. As a result, the gender difference in self-rated health disappeared by late adulthood. Key words: gender, self-rated health, hierarchical linear models, longitudinal, life course Frequently, investigators instruct survey respondents to answer the question “How <b>has</b> <b>your</b> <b>health</b> <b>been</b> recently?”, choosing among perhaps five options (e. g., very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good). Despite this simplicity, self-rated health is a useful predictor of mortality (Benyamini & Idler, 1999; Idler & Benya-mini, 1997) and health service use (Hansen, Fink, Frydenberg, & Oxhoj, 2002). Even in representative studies with stringent statis-tical control, the odds of dying for people with “poor ” self-rated health are typically 50 %– 100 % higher than are those for people with “very good ” or “excellent ” self-rated health (Benyamini &...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} founded on the {{phenomenology}} of Martin Heidegger, with the objective to understand the care needs of women infected with the human papilloma virus. Participants were fourteen {{women who had been}} diagnosed with this infection. The guiding questions were: What is it like to have this diagnosis? Tell me your experience, from when you received your diagnosis until today. What <b>has</b> <b>your</b> <b>health</b> care <b>been</b> like? The questions revealed the theme - seeking care as solicitude - which showed the importance of the support of family and friends. The presence of the infection as the cause of marital conflicts and separation was another highlighted aspect. The statements showed that {{there was a sense of}} resignation after an unsuccessful attempt to find accurate and clear information in order to make assertive decisions. Health interventions for infected women must overcome the traditional models of care, including interventions for health promotion and prevention, with trained professionals who are sensitive to the subjective dimension...|$|R
