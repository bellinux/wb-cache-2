40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Psychological SciencesMark A. BarnettThe term “moral rebel” {{describes}} {{an individual who}} refuses to comply, stay silent, or conform to others when doing so would compromise his/her values (Monin, Sawyer, & Marquez, 2008). Preliminarily, {{this study examined the}} extent to which adolescents themselves, their peers, and their teachers agree in their ratings of adolescents’ general expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel, tendencies to possess <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> identity (i. e., prioritize morality as an important part of identity), and tendencies to possess moral courage characteristics (i. e., qualities that motivate individuals to take action on their beliefs and values). As a theoretical and empirical extension of previous research (see Sonnentag & Barnett, 2013), the present study's primary purpose was to examine the interactive and independent roles of moral identity and moral courage characteristics in adolescents’ general and situation-specific (i. e., caring, just, and brave) expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel. With regard to the interactive role of moral identity and moral courage characteristics, the present study examined (1) if relatively high levels of various general moral courage characteristics (i. e., Self-Esteem, [Low] Need to Belong, Self-Efficacy, Assertiveness, Social Vigilantism) encourage adolescents to act on their moral identities to display the general and situation-specific expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel and (2) if relatively high levels of situation-specific moral courage characteristics (i. e., Empathic Concern, Justice Sensitivity, Willingness to Take Action in Physically Dangerous Situations) encourage adolescents to act on their moral identities to display the corresponding situation-specific (i. e., caring, just, and brave, respectively) expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel. <b>As</b> predicted, results revealed significant positive correlations among the self-report, peer, and teacher ratings of adolescents' (1) general expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel, (2) tendencies to possess <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> identity, and (3) tendencies to possess general moral courage characteristics. These significant positive inter-correlations emerged for the entire sample {{as well as for the}} male and female participants when they were considered separately. Contrary to prediction, moral identity (when considered independently and in combination with the general and situation-specific moral courage characteristics) did not consistently predict the general nor situation-specific expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel. Furthermore, although the general moral courage characteristics did not consistently predict the adolescents’ caring, just, and brave expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel, all of the indices of the adolescents' general moral courage characteristics (i. e., Self, Peer, and Teacher ratings; Self-Esteem, [Low] Need to Belong, Self-Efficacy, Assertiveness, Social Vigilantism) positively predicted the adolescents’ self-reported general tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel. Finally, two of the situation-specific moral courage characteristics (i. e., Empathic Concern and Willingness to Take Action in Physically Dangerous Situations) were found to be positively associated with the corresponding situation-specific (i. e., caring and brave, respectively) expressions of the tendency to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> rebel.

25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

Both of these assumptions are false, claim Wyckoff, as though [...] "instances of possession, use, and transfer may possibly not violate the interests of an individual, the systematic treatment of that individual as the kind of entity that can be possessed, used, and transferred constructs that entity and others like it (or him, or her) as an object, and when that entity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> patient with interests, that construction as an object subordinates the interests of that patient and similar patients to those who benefit from the objectification of the individual". The philosopher Friederike Schmitz draws upon Wyckoff's argument in her challenge to Cochrane, arguing that it is necessary not only to consider whether ownership will harm animals in particular cases, but to explore the effects of the institution of animal ownership.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} uses for {{employing}} economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a business contract. This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. [...] Although {{this is an example}} of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer.

[...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life.
