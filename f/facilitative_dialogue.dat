40|$|From 7 to 18 November 2016, the twenty-second Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) {{took place}} in Marrakech. Due to the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, Marrakech also hosted the first Conference of the Parties serving as Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1). Researchers from the Wuppertal Institute {{observed}} the conference and elaborated {{a detailed analysis of}} the results. The report starts by discussing developments regarding the implementation of the Paris Agreement, in particular the detailed "rulebook" and cooperative mechanisms. Next, the article discusses developments in the various avenues for raising climate ambition that have been put in place by the Paris conference: the 2018 <b>facilitative</b> <b>dialogue,</b> the engagement of non-state and sub-national actors, and the elaboration of mid-century climate strategies. In addition, the article discusses other Marrakech developments, in particular on issues of climate finance and adaptation, as well as recent developments in the wider world that {{have an impact on the}} UNFCCC, in particular developing alliances, developments in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and under the Montreal Protocol, and possible repercussions of the US presidential election...|$|E
40|$|The {{hybrid model}} of {{international}} climate policy {{embodied in the}} Paris Agreement requires countries to regularly deliver their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and to progressively increase collective and individual efforts over time. To be effective, this type of regime requires international review processes that provide robust information about countries’ efforts to address climate change and the support they offer other countries to do so, {{as well as their}} future plans and trajectories. The regime must also provide substantial opportunities for state and non-state actor engagement with this information, as well as sharing of best practices. The Paris Agreement creates three different review processes, but leaves critical details regarding each and their relation to each other to future decisions: • a review of implementation of individual NDCs under an “enhanced transparency framework” for action and support, comprising a technical expert review and multilateral consideration (Article 13). • a global stocktake every five years to assess collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Agreement (Article 14), preceded by a mitigation-focused <b>facilitative</b> <b>dialogue</b> in 2018. • a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance through a committee that is expert-based, non-adversarial and non-punitive (Article 15). It is essential for Parties to develop effective modalities, procedures and guidelines for each of these processes, ideally before the Paris Agreement enters into force. To this end, this discussion brief highlights essential considerations and, where possible, potential options for each process. The aim is to show what is at stake as the Parties negotiate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and, to clarify the questions that need to be resolved going forward. </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the process of specifying a question-answering help facility {{in the context of}} UNIX mail. The specification was bosed upon experimental expert-user <b>facilitative</b> <b>dialogues.</b> These dialogues were analyzed using a classification scheme developed for the purpose. The scheme provides a meta-language for describing patterns of intent and rhetorical structure in dialogue. Using the scheme as a tool, comman patterns in expert-user dialogue emerged, providing insights into both tutoring strategy and the linguistic forms required to generate help output. These were refined to form a set of frames consisting of stereotypical patterns of rhetorical predicates to answer different types of ques-tions which could be adapted to the needs of a particular user. The significance of the system developed from this specification is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The central aim of {{this study}} was to {{contribute}} to the understanding of the process of interpretation as it occurs in the context of a dialogue in insight-oriented psychotherapy. The literature review consisted of two parts. Firstly, the philosophical literature on the theory of interpretation was reviewed. A set of central philosophical issues was identified, which pertain to the psychotherapeutic project of interpreting the meaning of a person's experience in the context of a dialogue with that person. Secondly, the psychotherapeutic literature was reviewed. Previous attempts to conceptualise and prescribe processes of interpretation were described. The issues which appeared to be in need of further clarification were identified. A clinical study was conducted to further explore the questions raised in the literature reviews. A methodology was developed which gave access to the direct experience of both clients and therapists during the events of psychotherapeutic interpretation. The methodology yielded a description of the interpretative structure of the psychotherapeutic dialogue for each therapist-client pair. These were then consolidated into a description of general structural features of the psychotherapeutic dialogue. The results consisted of a description of processes and structural features which are intrinsic to the psychotherapeutic interpretation of the meaning of a person's experience in the context of a dialogue. The results were elaborated in an extensive discussion from which the following findings emerged: (l) It is important to distinguish between communicative and interpretative forms of dialogue. (2) Thematisation activity is mediated by a number of dialectically related operations which are intrinsic to the interpretative project of psychotherapy. (3) Insight-oriented psychotherapy relies on the presence of the therapist as a dialogical partner and the therapist is not merely a facilitator of introspection on the part of the client. (4) The character of interpretation in psychotherapy may be understood in certain respects to be an elaboration of functions of the imagination. (5) The process of interpretation can be understood in relational terms and the variations of interpretative experience may be understood as variations of 'an inter-subjective interpretative ideal. (6) Understanding of certain forms of psychopathology is deepened when they are considered as variations of an ideal capacity to engage in interpretative dialogue. (7) It is possible to describe certain ideal conditions which are <b>facilitative</b> of interpretative <b>dialogue</b> and hence of the psychotherapeutic development of self-insight. In conclusion suggestions for further research were made. It was suggested that the perspective of hermeneutic phenomenology provides an appropriate philosophical and methodological foundation for understanding the unique dialogical interpretative situation which is psychotherapy. The study emphasized, both in its content and in the manner of its execution, the need for interpretative efforts to be accompanied by methodological reflection and especially an awareness of how interpretative strategies partially constitute the realities they set out to describe...|$|R
