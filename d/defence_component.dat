40|$|Precise {{control of}} {{transgene}} expression is pivotal to the engineering of plants with increased disease resistance. Many early attempts to boost disease resistance used constitutive overexpression of <b>defence</b> <b>components</b> but frequently {{this resulted in}} poor quality plants. It {{is now clear that}} the extensive cellular reprogramming associated with defence will reduce yields if uncontrolled defence reactions are activated in uninfected cells. Therefore, for many strategies pathogen-inducible promoters might be the most useful as they limit the cost of resistance by restricting expression to infection sites. Although progress to date has been hindered by a lack of suitable promoters, new research should reveal more potentially useful native promoters. Additionally, the first steps towards 'designer' synthetic promoters have proved encouraging...|$|R

To maintain growth and survival, the resources {{have to be}} shared more efficiently, which {{could result in a}} trade-off between the different physiological processes of a plant. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of defoliation in carbon allocation of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. ] to test the presence of a trade-off between allocation to growth, carbon storage and defence. Three defoliation intensities [control (C-trees, 0 % defoliation), moderately (M-trees, 41 to 60 %) and heavily (H-trees, 61 to 80 %) defoliated] were selected in order to monitor several variables related to stem growth (wood formation in xylem), carbon storage in stem and needle (non-structural soluble sugars and starch) and <b>defence</b> <b>components</b> in needles (terpenoids compound) from May to October 2011. The concentration of starch was drastically reduced in both wood and leaves of H-trees with a quasi-absence of carbon partitioning to storage in early summer. Fewer kinds of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were formed with an increasing level of defoliation indicating a lower carbon allocation for the production of defence. The carbon allocation to wood formation gradually reduced at increasing defoliation intensities, with a lower growth rate and fewer tracheids resulting in a reduced carbon sequestration in cell walls. The hypothesis of a trade-off between the allocations to <b>defence</b> <b>components</b> and to non-structural (NCS) and structural (growth) carbon was rejected as most of the measured variables decreased with increasing defoliation. The starch amount was highly indicative of the tree carbon status at different defoliation intensity and future research should focus on the mechanism of starch utilisation for survival and growth following an outbreak...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Changes in the {{activity}} and level of some antioxidative <b>defence</b> system <b>components</b> were determined in the rat skin during hypo- (ebb) and hypermetabolic (flow) phase of thermal trauma. At the same time, the effects of enzymatic (superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic (vitamin E and glutathione) antioxidants, {{as well as of}} L-arginine applied on the scalded skin area in different combinations {{in the form of a}} lyposomal ointment on endogenous antioxidative <b>defence</b> <b>components</b> were studied both in the injured and uninjured skin. In scalded skin during hypometabolic phase, a decrease in activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, as well as in the level of vitamin E was observed in comparison with the control. This decrease was accompanied by a complete loss of glutathione and {{the activity}} of glutathione-S-transferase and thioredoxin reductase. The same trend of changes was recorded in hypermetabolic phase. In the uninjured skin of scalded animals, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were at the control level both in hypo- and hypermetabolic phase. Also, no changes in vitamin E content were found, while the activities of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione-S-transferase were increased. Glutathione level in this group of animals was decreased, the decrease being more prominent in hyper- then in hypometabolic phase. The ointments applied to the injured parts of the skin expressed protective effects observed as an increase in vitamin E level and an attenuation of glutathione reductase activity inhibition.

40|$|Background: Forecasting the {{consequences}} of accelerating rates of changes in biodiversity for ecosystem functioning requires a mechanistic understanding {{of the relationships between}} the structure of biological communities and variation in plant functional characteristics. So far, experimental data of how plant species diversity influences the investment of individual plants in direct chemical defences against herbivores and pathogens is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used Plantago lanceolata as a model species in experimental grasslands differing in species richness and composition (Jena Experiment) to investigate foliar concentrations of the iridoid glycosides (IG), catalpol and its biosynthetic precursor aucubin. Total IG and aucubin concentrations decreased, while catalpol concentrations increased with increasing plant diversity in terms of species or functional group richness. Negative plant diversity effects on total IG and aucubin concentrations correlated with increasing specific leaf area of P. lanceolata, suggesting that greater allocation to light acquisition reduced the investment into these carbon-based <b>defence</b> <b>components.</b> In contrast, increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations best explained increasing concentrations of the biosynthetically more advanced IG, catalpol. Observed levels of leaf damage explained a significant proportion of variation in total IG and aucubin concentrations, but did not account for variance in catalpol concentrations. Conclusions/Significance: Our results clearly show that plants growing in communities of varying species richness an...|$|R

Eventually, the military <b>defence</b> <b>component</b> of county surveying in the UK began to separate from the civil in 1791, with the Crown's 'Board of Ordnance' being commissioned {{to carry out a}} comprehensive survey of the South Coast of England which, as a result of 'the last invasion of Britain 1797', at Fishguard in South West Wales ultimately extended to all of the UK. With that shift in emphasis, county surveying began to concentrate more on its civil engineering and civic architecture roles, producing the historically famous British county surveyors such as Thomas Telford, John Loudon McAdam and John Nash; the expression, [...] "County Surveyor", became a UK statutory title (Bridges Act 1803); and, in England and Wales, its incumbents were appointed by elected councils as of the coming into effect of the Local Government Act 1888 rather than being Crown-appointed by Justices of the Peace (hence the need for the UK Official Secrets Act 1889 to safeguard interests of the State from disclosure by elected councillors and appointed officials that were not subject to the oaths of freemasonry).|$|E

40|$|An early plant {{response}} to pathogen infection is an oxidative burst {{characterized by the}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide. The increase of these ROS {{has been found in}} plant tissues in {{response to}} infection of various pathogens, including viruses, and enzymatic and not-enzymatic antioxidant systems are activated by the host in order to prevent potential cell damages. The analysis of some enzymatic <b>defence</b> <b>components</b> such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, total peroxidases and ascorbate peroxidases allowed to evaluate their contribution to the tomato defense response to infections of different Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) strains. In particular, these enzymes were examined in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv. UC 82 plants inoculated with the aggressive strain CMV-Fny and with the same strain co-inoculated with a necrogenic variant of satellite RNA (CMV-Fny/ 77 -satRNA), a combination inducing systemic necrosis and plant death. Analyses included both the transcriptional activation and the enzymatic activity of such antioxidant components. Additionally, gene expression analysis was performed on genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, in general defense responses and in programmed cell death processes. The results obtained demonstrated that some scavengers of ROS and other defense responses were commonly activated by the two viral strains despite the different disease phenotype induced. Peculiar responses to either specific CMV inoculum were also evidenced, and their possible roles in the determination of the disease phenotypes are discussed...|$|R
