40|$|This study {{utilizes}} {{the data}} of the imported prices and quantities of an individual <b>feeding</b> <b>corn</b> importer to analyze {{whether there is a}} cooperation between domestic importers by using the conjectural variation model. The major conclusion is there is no cooperation between domestic firms in domestic <b>feeding</b> <b>corn</b> market. 飼料玉米是飼養畜禽產品重要的投入，台灣有一些飼料玉米專業進口商，進口飼料玉米來供給自配飼料養豬戶與小型商品飼料廠加工生產的需要。然而，近年來國際飼料玉米價格的劇烈波動，也造成國內飼料玉米、商品飼料及畜產品價格的大幅波動。當國際飼料玉米期貨價格下跌時，國內飼料玉米價格，卻無法相對應地下降，使得下游的畜牧業者，不斷質疑飼料玉米進口商，聯合壟斷國內的市場價格。由於國內進口飼料玉米，以美國二級玉米為主，在國內市場銷售的飼料玉米為同質性產品，因此，適合利用數量競爭模型，來研究國內飼料玉米專業進口商的競爭行為。本研究使用個別飼料玉米專業進口商的進口價量資料，利用數量競爭的猜測變量模型，分析國內飼料玉米專業進口商間，是否存在合作關係。結果發現，飼料玉米專業進口商做進口量決策時，並不存在合作行為...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the economic efficacy and to clarify the impact of <b>feed</b> <b>corn</b> cultivation on upland farmland under contract with dairy farmers. The following two analytical approaches were employed. First the net profit from the farmland under study was calculated by estimating the production costs and income from the dairy farm, which was adopted as an index of economic efficacy. Secondly, linear programming was used to determine optimum cropping composition. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) Upland farms can achieve profitability by growing <b>feed</b> <b>corn</b> as part of their crop rotation. (2) Upland farms can make effective use of farmland by cultivating <b>feed</b> <b>corn.</b> In general, the impact was shown to be greater for large-scale farms.

40|$|Three {{finishing}} {{trials were}} conducted to evaluate the effects of programmed gain feeding systems on performance, carcass characteristics, and profitability of finishing cattle. Programmed gain finishing systems reduced both dry matter intake and daily gain and did not improve feed efficiency. Likewise, programmed gain feeding systems did not improve carcass characteristics or net return per animal compared to allowing animals ad libitum access to feed throughout the feeding period. These data indicate that utilization of programmed gain finishing systems {{did not result in}} improvements in performance, carcass characteristics, or profitability of finishing cattle when compared to traditional ad libitum feeding systems. In addition, four finishing trials {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of corn processing method in finishing diets containing wet <b>corn</b> gluten <b>feed</b> on performance and carcass characteristics. When directly comparing finishing diets with and without wet <b>corn</b> gluten <b>feed,</b> <b>feeding</b> steam-flaked <b>corn</b> improved efficiency and dietary net energy available for gain while decreasing cost of gain compared to dry-rolled corn regardless of wet <b>corn</b> gluten <b>feed</b> inclusion. Similarly, in finishing diets containing wet <b>corn</b> gluten <b>feed</b> and comparing grain processing method, feed efficiency and dietary net energy available for gain tended to improve while cost of gain tended to decrease with increasing intensity of grain processing method. When compared to <b>feeding</b> dry-rolled <b>corn,</b> <b>feeding</b> steam-flaked <b>corn</b> improved efficiency 8. 5 % while <b>feeding</b> high-moisture <b>corn</b> resulted in a smaller improvement (3. 4 %) when averaged across trials.
