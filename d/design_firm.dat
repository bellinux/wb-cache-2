40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} {{the state of}} industrial <b>design</b> <b>firms</b> and businesses in China. The research includes mixed methods of primary and secondary research. Over 40 one on one interviews and site visits were conducted with Chinese Industrial <b>Design</b> <b>firms.</b> Additional {{interviews were conducted with}} professors from U. S. and Chinese universities, senior managers and founders from United States based <b>design</b> <b>firms.</b> Concurrently, significant amounts of secondary research data were collected. Based on the research, now is a great time for industrial design in China. Business is rapidly growing due to economic, political and other factors. However, the data also uncovers that most Chinese industrial <b>design</b> <b>firms</b> are not without challenges. First, it is difficult to make Chinese clients believe that there is any value in creativity. Design is perceived as a commodity and purely execution. Second, win their clients ‟ trust on their capability of generating innovative solution and becoming a partner in their clients ‟ strategy. Some Chinese industrial <b>design</b> <b>firms</b> have overcome the first challenge. As these Chinese firms overcome the second one, they will begin to compete directly with international industrial <b>design</b> <b>firms.</b> Currently Chinese industrial <b>design</b> <b>firms</b> and international ones have different strengths; the author suggests that collaboration between the...|$|R

5|$|The {{university}} logo, the upheld torch, {{is derived}} from the Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and <b>design</b> <b>firm</b> Chermayeff & Geismar. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, the center of learning in ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's <b>design</b> <b>firm,</b> which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E
