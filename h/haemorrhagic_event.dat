40|$|Apixaban {{does not}} require {{monitoring}} nor frequent dose adjustment. However, searching for the optimal dose for the individual patient {{may be useful in}} some situations. Moreover, {{there is a need for}} clinicians to know whether coagulation assays are influenced by apixaban use. The aim of this study was to determine which coagulation assay could be used to assess the impact of apixaban on haemostasis and provide good laboratory recommendations for the accurate interpretation of haemostasis assays. Apixaban is spiked at concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 ng/mlin platelet-poor plasma. Routinely used or more specific coagulation assays are tested. Results show a concentration dependent prolongation of aPTT, PT and dilute PT. The sensitivity mainly depends on the reagent, but none of these tests is sensitive enough to ensure an accurate estimation of the pharmacodynamic effect of apixaban. FXa chromogenic assays show high sensitivity and a linear correlation depending on the reagent and/or the methodology. Immunological assays and assays acting below the FXa are not influenced by apixaban. In conclusion, PT and/or dilute PT cannot be used to assess apixaban pharmacodynamic properties. More specific and sensitive assays such as chromogenic FXa assays using specific calibrators are required. In case of thrombophilia or in the exploration of a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>event,</b> immunological assays should be recommended, when applicable.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMany {{international}} {{guidelines on}} {{the prevention of}} venous thromboembolism recommend targeting heparin treatment at patients with stroke who have {{a high risk of}} venous thrombotic events or a low risk of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events.</b> We sought to identify reliable methods to target anticoagulant treatment and so improve the chance of avoiding death or dependence after stroke. MethodsWe obtained individual patient data from the five largest randomised controlled trials in acute ischaemic stroke that compared heparins (unfractionated heparin, heparinoids, or low-molecular-weight heparin) with aspirin or placebo. We developed and evaluated statistical models for the prediction of thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism) and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> (symptomatic intracranial or significant extracranial) in the first 14 days after stroke. We calculated the absolute risk difference for the outcome “dead or dependent” in patients grouped by quartiles of predicted risk of thrombotic and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> with random effect meta-analysis. FindingsPatients with ischaemic stroke who were of advanced age, had increased neurological impairment, or had atrial fibrillation had a high risk of both thrombotic and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> after stroke. Additionally, patients with CT-visible evidence of recent cerebral ischaemia were at increased risk of thrombotic events. In evaluation datasets, the area under a receiver operating curve for prediction models for thrombotic events was 0 · 63 (95 % CI 0 · 59 – 0 · 67) and for <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> was 0 · 60 (0 · 55 – 0 · 64). We found no evidence that the net benefit from heparins increased with either increasing risk of thrombotic events or decreasing risk of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events.</b> InterpretationThere was no evidence that patients with ischaemic stroke who were at higher risk of thrombotic events or lower risk of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> benefited from heparins. We were therefore unable to define a targeted approach to select the patients who would benefit from treatment with early anticoagulant therapy. We recommend that guidelines for routine or selective use of heparin in stroke should be revised. FundingMRC...|$|R

Methods Reports of epistaxis and other <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> (in all system organ classes excluding gynaecological) associated with varenicline {{were identified and}} assessed in both the NZ Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMMP) and the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb (Lareb). Additional reports were identified from the World Health Organisation Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) datasets, and these also underwent causality assessment. Results A total of 30 reports of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> were identified by the NZ IMMP (16 reports) and Lareb (14 reports). Six cases of epistaxis were identified, and four patients had a positive dechallenge on withdrawal of varenicline, suggesting a causal association. Another five reports of gingival bleeding were identified, with three patients having a positive dechallenge. Another patient who experienced haemoptysis while taking varenicline had a positive dechallenge and a positive rechallenge. In the WHO datasets, a further 49 reports of epistaxis, 39 reports of haemoptysis and 21 reports of thrombocytopenia were identified. A plausible mechanism for <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> associated with varenicline may {{be a result of}} interaction with the serotonin (5 -HT) receptor system and transporter. Conclusions This is the first specific investigation of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> associated with varenicline.

40|$|Optimal timing for {{restarting}} anticoagulant therapy after {{intracranial bleeding}} {{is a critical}} issue. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize published studies on the management of oral anticoagulant therapy after intracranial bleeding secondary {{to the use of}} vitamin K antagonists in patients with a mechanical heart valve. A computer-assisted search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases till January 2008 was performed. Two investigators independently performed study selection and completed a predefined quality assessment and data extraction form. Main inclusion criterion was the enrolment of patients with a mechanical heart valve and intracranial haemorrhage during oral anticoagulant treatment. Any randomised controlled trial, observational cohort study, case series and reports was included. No randomised controlled trials were identified. Six observational cohort studies were included in the final analysis. All studies were of low quality. A total of 120 patients were enrolled. Anticoagulation was restarted within a broad time range (2 days to 3 months). Four ischaemic strokes and two recurrent cerebral haemorrhages occurred after anticoagulation was restarted after a mean follow-up of 7. 9 months. Eighteen patients were described in the selected case reports. Anticoagulant therapy was restarted within four days to eight weeks. Two patients had a recurrent <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>event,</b> and no ischaemic events were reported. In conclusion, restarting oral anticoagulant therapy few days and, indirectly, stopping anticoagulant therapy for a few days (even for 7 - 14 days) after the occurrence of cerebral haemorrhage are both safe. However, well-designed studies are strongly recommended to provide better evidence. © 2009 Schattauer GmbH...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of plasma concentration/effect of {{edoxaban}} may {{be useful}} in some situations. Also, clinicians need to know how routine coagulation assays are influenced. It was our aim to determine coagulation tests useful for the assessment of edoxaban's pharmacodynamics and provide recommendations for the interpretation of haemostasis diagnostic tests. Edoxaban was spiked at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1, 000 ng/ml in platelet-poor plasma which covers the on-therapy range (from ± 25 ng/ml at Ctrough to ± 170 ng/ml at Cmax). aPTT, PT, dRVVT, chromogenic anti-Xa assays, TGA and a large panel of haemostasis diagnostic tests were performed using several reagents. A concentration-dependent prolongation of aPTT, PT and dRVVT was observed. The effect was dependent on the reagents. FXa chromogenic assays showed high sensitivity and a linear correlation depending on the methodology. TGA {{may be useful}} to assess the pharmacodynamics of edoxaban but its turnaround time and the lack of standardisation are limitations. Edoxaban impairs the assessment of lupus anticoagulant, protein S (clotting method), APC-R, antithrombin (FXa-based assay) and measurement of clotting factor activity. Immunological assays and assays acting below the FXa are not influenced by edoxaban. In conclusion, some PT reagents could be used to estimate edoxaban activity. Chromogenic anti-Xa assays are required to assess the plasma concentration. TGA may be useful but requires standardisation. In case of thrombophilia or in the exploration of a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>event,</b> immunological assays should be recommended, when applicable.

40|$|Introduction: We {{conducted}} a prospective study to investigate possible influence of genetic polymorphisms of the interleukin {{genes in the}} clinical severity, 6 months outcome and hemorrhagic events in patients with TBI. In particular, we tested the IL- 1 β(- 511 C/T), IL- 1 β(+ 3953 C/T), IL- 1 α(- 889 C/T), IL- 1 RA (VNTR), IL- 2 (+ 114 G/T), IL- 2 (- 384 T/G) and IL- 6 (- 174 G/C) polymorphisms. Patient-Methods: 365 (women= 60 [16. 4 %]) prospectively recruited patients with TBI were evaluated. Initial neurological status and six-month outcome were assessed {{by means of the}} Glasgow Coma Score and Glasgow Outcome Scale respectively. Based on computed tomography findings at admission patients were stratified according to the presence and type of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>event.</b> DNA was extracted using the salting out method, while SNPs genotypes were determined using standard PCR/RFLP methods The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by means of the Fisher’s exact test. For comparisons between categorical variables we used the χ 2 test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to control for possible confounding factors. Analysis for dominant recessive and allele contrast models of inheritance was performed. Linkage disequilibrium between SNPs was examined and haplotype estimation was performed by an expectation-maximization algorithm. Control for multiple comparisons was performed using Bonferroni’s correction for 7 polymorphisms. The level of significance (p) was equal to 0. 007 (0. 05 / 7 = 0. 007). Results: No statistically significant difference was found for IL- 1 β(- 511 C/T), IL- 1 β(+ 3953 C/T), IL- 1 α(- 889 C/T), IL- 2 (- 384 T/G) and IL- 6 (- 174 G/C) polymorphisms. Allele T of IL- 2 (+ 114 G/T) polymorphism was associated with more severe clinical presentation at admission(p= 0. 002). Compared to noncarriers, IL- 1 RA allele 2 carriers had 4. 5 times higher odds of having cerebral hemorrhages after TBI (p= 0. 004). Haplotype analysis of IL- 1 SNPs (IL- 1 α - 889 C/T, IL- 1 β + 3953 C/T, IL- 1 β - 511 C/T, IL- 1 RA VNTR) revealed that haplotype IV (1 - 1 - 2 - 2) was associated with increased risk for more severe clinical presentation at admission (p= 0. 0005) and hemorrhagic events (p= 0. 0058). Haplotype VIII (2 - 2 - 2 - 1) was associated with higher likelihood for milder clinical presentation at admission (p= 2. 64 * 10 - 5), while haplotype VI (2 - 1 - 1 - 1) was linked to unfavourable 6 month outcome (p= 0. 0004). Haplotype analysis of IL- 2 SNPs (IL- 2 + 114 G/T, IL- 2 - 384 T/G) revealed that haplotype II (2 - 1) was associated with increased risk for more severe clinical presentation at admission (p= 0. 00087). Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of an implication of interleukins genetic polymorphisms in the clinical presentation at admission, 6 months outcome and hemorrhagic events of TBI patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these associations and investigate underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Our aim in {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of haemostatic events in our Fontan patients, to identify pre-dictive factors and to determine their association with haemodynamics and anticoagulant therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 424 Fontan patients and examined correlations between postoperative haemodynamics and anticoagulant regimens with haemostatic events. RESULTS: After exclusion of 12 patients with a mechanical valve at the time of Fontan operation, our 412 patients were sub-divided into 21 groups based on the therapeutic duration of warfarin and antiplatelet agent therapy. During the early 5 - to 10 -year postoperative period, patients receiving warfarin showed higher central venous pressure and lower arterial oxygen saturation (Sat) (P < 0. 05 – 0. 001). During a mean follow-up of 11. 2 years, 29 (7. 0 %) haemostatic events occurred. With regard to <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events,</b> haemoptysis was most common (n = 13, 45 %), followed by cerebral bleeds in 3 (10 %). Of thrombo-embolic events, thrombosis in the Fontan pathway was the most common (n = 7, 24 %), followed by cerebral infarction in 3. Early <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> were associated with late Fontan oper-ation and use of preoperative renin–angiotensin system blockers, while late events were related to heterotaxy syndrome, male gender and low Sat (P < 0. 05 – 0. 01). A low Sat was the only predictor of early postoperative thrombo-embolic events (P = 0. 0192). Among the three sub-group analyses of fixed anticoagulant regimens, the most frequent <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> were associated with long-term use of warfarin (P = 0. 0033).

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to describe spontaneously reported <b>haemorrhagic</b> adverse <b>events</b> associated with rivaroxaban and dabigatran in Australia. Methods: Data were sourced from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Database of Adverse Event Notifications between June 2009 and May 2014. Records of <b>haemorrhagic</b> adverse <b>events</b> in which rivaroxaban or dabigatran was considered as a potential cause were analysed. Results: There were 240 <b>haemorrhagic</b> adverse <b>events</b> associated with rivaroxaban and 504 associated with dabigatran. Age was specified for 164 (68 %) haemorrhages associated with rivaroxaban, of which 101 occurred in people aged ⩾ 75 years. Age was specified for 437 (87 %) haemorrhages associated with dabigatran, of which 300 occurred in people aged ⩾ 75 years. Time from treatment initiation to haemorrhage was specified for 122 (51 %) haemorrhages associated with rivaroxaban, with 69 (57 %) haemorrhages occurring within 30 days of rivaroxaban initiation. Time from treatment initiation to haemorrhage was specified for 253 (50 %) haemorrhages associated with dabigatran, with 123 (49 %) haemorrhages occurring within 30 days of dabigatran initiation. Gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhages were the most frequent type of haemorrhages associated with both rivaroxaban (n = 105, 44 %) and dabigatran (n = 302, 60 %). Data were available on the severity of haemorrhage for 101 (42 %) haemorrhages associated with rivaroxaban, with haemorrhage leading to death in 17 people.

Observed events and CHADS 2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke history), CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (also adding: vascular disease and sex) and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal liver/renal function, stroke history, bleeding predisposition, labile international normalised ratios, elderly, drugs/alcohol use) -predicted events were compared. METHODS: LAA closure with an occlusion device was performed in 167 NVAF patients contraindicated for oral anticoagulants and recruited from 12 hospitals between 2009 and 2013. At least two transoesophageal echocardiograms were performed in the first 6  months postimplantation. Antithrombotics included clopidogrel and aspirin. Patients were monitored for death, stroke, major and relevant bleeding and hospitalisation for concomitant conditions. Mean age was 74. 68 ± 8. 58, median follow-up was 24  months, 5. 38 % had intraoperative complications and implantation was successful in 94. 6 % of subjects. Mortality during follow-up was 10. 8 %, mostly (9. 5 %) non-cardiac related. Bleeding occurred in 10. 1 % of subjects, 5. 7 % major and 4. 4 % minor though relevant, and 4. 4 % suffered stroke. Major bleeding and stroke/transient ischaemic attack events within 2  years (annual event rates, 290 patients/year) were less frequent than expected from CHADS 2 (2. 4 % vs 9. 6 %), CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (2. 4 % vs 8. 3 %) and HAS-BLED (3. 1 % vs 6. 6 %) risk scores (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 003, p= 0. 047, respectively).

Therefore, although important, the results of MATRIX have strong limitations and are not sufficient to definitively identify an approach of choice during PCI for ACS.

Venous thromboembolism risk is particularly high in hospitalized patients {{as well as in}} oncologic patients, being a factor of poor prognosis for the oncologic disease. Several clinical studies have shown the need to develop effective hospital strategies using a systematic and individualized assessment of venous thromboembolism risk, and additionally to optimize the institution of prophylaxis treatment and its proper use in the context of in-hospital and outpatient management. The ARTE national study is a non-interventional, multicentre, prospective study which is divided in two phases. In the first phase patients are followed in the hospital; in the second phase patients are followed in ambulatory context for a period of 6 months after discharge. Four thousand patients will be included, equally distributed over medical, surgical, oncologic and orthopaedic patients. Data will be collected from the patient's clinical files and through direct clinical evaluation of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, in the departments of medicine, oncology, surgery, and orthopaedics of the participating centres. The main objectives of the study are to assess the risk profile of venous thromboembolism of the study population using a risk assessment model adapted from the Caprini and Khorana et al models, and the validation of the score for the Portuguese population. Simultaneously, the secondary objectives are as follows: to determine the proportion of patients with venous thromboembolism risk, according to the risk assessment model, that are doing prophylaxis; to determine the duration of prophylaxis during the hospitalization; to determine the proportion of patients doing long-term prophylaxis, at the moment of the discharge; to determine the incidence of thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis; stroke; pulmonary thromboembolism; transient ischemic attack), <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> (major and minor haemorrhages) and death at 6 months after discharge.

30|$|After {{cessation}} of antiplatelet therapy, the optimum timing to resume treatment {{is a serious}} concern due {{to the possibility of}} thromboembolic complications. While there are no broadly accepted practice patterns addressing dual antiplatelet therapy in the flow diversion literature, the length and dose of antiplatelet therapy are reported to correlate with a decreased incidence of thrombotic and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> after flow diverter placement [10]. In our case, we diagnosed haemostasis at a relatively early stage by CT examination and resumed treatment 3 [*]days after surgery. Even after the resumption of antiplatelet therapy, the patient did not show relapse of symptoms and had a favourable course. In almost every reported case treated conservatively, hematoma contraction has been confirmed by CT or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 4 to 7 [*]days after onset. These reports may suggest that active bleeding stops at this time point and that resumption of antiplatelet therapy may be considered.|$|R

50|$|Warfarin {{treatment}} requires blood {{monitoring and}} dose adjustments regularly {{due to its}} narrow therapeutic window. If supervision isn't adequate warfarin poses a threat in causing, all too frequent, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> and multiple interactions with food and other drugs. Currently, the main problem with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the administration route, as {{it has to be}} given subcutaneously. Because of these disadvantages there has been an urgent need for better anticoagulant drugs. For a modern society, convenient and fast drug administration is the key to a good drug compliance. In 2008 the first direct Xa inhibitor was approved for clinical use. Direct Xa inhibitors are just as efficacious as LMWH and warfarin but they are given orally and don’t need as strict monitoring. Other Xa inhibitors advantages are rapid onset/offset, few drug interactions and predictable pharmacokinetics. The rapid onset/offset effect greatly reduces the need for “bridging” with parenteral anticoagulants after surgeries. Today there are three factor Xa inhibitors marketed: rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban.|$|R

40|$|AIMS: Oral {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIa inhibitors might {{enhance the}} early benefit of an intravenous agent and prevent subsequent cardiac events {{in patients with}} acute coronary syndromes. We assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of 1 month treatment with three dose levels of the oral GP IIb/IIIa blocker lefradafiban in patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction without persistent ST elevation. METHODS: The Fibrinogen Receptor Occupancy STudy (FROST) {{was designed as a}} dose-escalation trial with 20, 30 and 45 mg lefradafiban t. i. d. or placebo. Five hundred and thirty-one patients were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio to lefradafiban or placebo in a double-blind manner. Efficacy was assessed by the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and recurrent angina. Safety was evaluated by the occurrence of bleeding classified according to the TIMI criteria and by measuring clinical laboratory parameters. RESULTS: There was a trend towards a reduction in cardiac events with lefradafiban 30 mg when compared with placebo and lefradafiban 20 mg. The benefit was particularly apparent in patients with a positive (> or = O. 1 ng. ml(- 1)) troponin I test at baseline and less so in those with a negative test result. In patients receiving lefradafiban, the cardiac event rate decreased with increasing minimal levels of fibrinogen receptor occupancy. There was a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of bleeding: the composite of major or minor bleeding occurred in 1 % of placebo patients, 5 % of patients receiving lefradafiban 20 mg and in 7 % of patients receiving 30 mg, with an excessive risk (15 %) in the 45 mg group which resulted in early discontinuation of this dose level. Gingival and arterial or venous puncture site bleedings were most common and accounted for more than 60 % of all <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events.</b> There was an increased incidence of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1. 5 x 10 (9) /l) in the lefradafiban groups (5. 2 % vs 1. 5 % in the placebo group), which did not result from bone marrow depression but rather from a reversible redistribution of neutrophils by margination or clustering. CONCLUSION: One month's treatment with the oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor lefradafiban in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction without persistent ST elevation resulted in a decrease in cardiac events with lefradafiban 30 mg and a dose-dependent increase in <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events.</b> The observed favourable trend towards a reduction in cardiac events in patients with elevated troponin levels requires confirmation in a large clinical trial...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{endovascular}} procedures {{consist in}} percutaneously inserting a catheter into a blood vessel and steering the catheter {{to the region}} of interest. An accurate localization of the catheter {{with respect to the}} vessel is essential to successfully guide the catheter. X-ray imaging is traditionally used for visualization despite the exposure to ionising radiation and the low visibility of soft tissues. The latter requires intermittent injection of a nephrotoxic contrast agent (Briguori, 2003), lengthens the procedure time and can potentially cause <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> due to a puncture of the vessel wall (Shi, 2014). Actuation and sensing units embedded in robotic catheters have the potential to help the surgeon to safely steer the catheter through the vasculature. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is of particular interest, as it offers a detailed live view of the blood vessels from the inside. Placed at the catheter tip, an IVUS probe generates a radial ultrasound image that can be segmented to recognize the lumen, the adventitia and risk-prone regions, such as calcifications or bifurcations. The automated online segmentation of these regions can then be used to safely steer the catheter – either manually or robotically. This work investigates and improves upon three segmentation methods of IVUS images, and compares their performance and their potential for improving catheter steering. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} costs to the Spanish {{healthcare}} system of 35 days' treatment with triflusal (600 mg/day) and aspirin (300 mg/day) in patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. Design: A cost minimisation analysis {{based on the results}} of the Triflusal in Acute Myocardial Infarction study (TIM) was conducted. The hypothesis was that despite a higher acquisition cost of triflusal, savings would result because of differences in efficacy and safety outcome (non-fatal cerebrovascular <b>event</b> and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events).</b> Diagnostic Related Groups were used as a proxy for determining hospital costs in Spain and the values were obtained from different sources and refer to year 2000 costs. Only direct medical costs were considered for the economic analysis. Results: Although the acquisition cost of triflusal was more expensive than that of aspirin, the cost of prevented events - non-fatal ischaemic cerebrovascular events and cerebral haemorrhages - entirely compensated for the cost of triflusal. The overall cost of treating patients with triflusal, compared with aspirin, represented a net saving of 28. 4 % per patient treated. Conclusion: Our study showed that triflusal is cost saving compared with aspirin in the treatment of the acute phase of myocardial infarction.

40|$|AIMS: To {{correlate}} {{inhibition of}} platelet aggregation (IPA) with bleeding events assessed by TIMI, GUSTO, and BleedScore scales {{in a large}} cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischaemic stroke (IS) treated with chronic low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel. Data from recent trials and registries suggest a link between increased risk of bleeding and cardiovascular mortality. However, the potential association of bleeding risk and IPA is not established. It may {{play a critical role}} for the safety of more aggressive platelet inhibition or/and individual tailoring of antiplatelet strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Secondary post hoc analyses of 5 microM ADP-induced IPA and bleeding complications assessed by TIMI, GUSTO, and BleedScore scales in a combined data set consisting of patients with documented CAD (n = 246) and previous IS (n = 117). Demographic characteristics differ substantially depending on the underlying vascular disease; however, IPA and bleeding risks were similar between CAD and IS. All three bleeding scales adequately captured serious <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events,</b> where the TIMI scale was the most exclusive, whereas BleedScore was the most inclusive. Over half of all patients experienced superficial event(s), most commonly occurring during two to three distinct bleeding episodes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{reports the}} initial {{clinical}} and echocardiographic {{results of the}} Premium bioprosthetic aortic valve up to 4 years of follow-up. METHODS: Between October 2007 and July 2011, 121 consecutive patients were submitted for aortic valve replacement with the Premium bioprosthetic valve. The mean age was 68 ± 9 years and 64 patients were males. The patients were periodically evaluated by clinical and echocardiographic examinations. The mean follow-up was 21 months (min = 2, max = 48), yielding 217 patients/year for the analysis. RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 8 %. Late survival at 3 years was 89 % (95 % CI: 81. 9 – 93. 3 %), and 80 % of the patients were in NYHA functional class I/II. The rates of valve-related complications were low, with a linearized incidence of 0. 9 %/ 100 patients/year for thromboembolic complications, 0 % for <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> and 0. 9 %/ 100 patients/year of bacterial endocarditis. There was no case of primary structural valve dysfunction. The mean effective orifice area was 1. 61 ± 0. 45 cm 2; mean gradient 13 ± 5 mmHg and peak gradient 22 ± 9 mmHg. Significant patient–prosthesis mismatch was found in only 11 % of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The Premium bioprosthetic aortic valve demonstrated very satisfactory clinical and echocardiographic results up to 4 years, similar to other commercially available, third-generation bioprosthetic valves...|$|R
40|$|The lack of oral {{anticoagulant}} guidelines specific to paediatric practice {{has led to}} the adoption of adult regimens, often without scientific evidence of efficacy or safety. A two year prospective study of anticoagulant control was carried out in 45 children aged 9 months to 18 years, the majority of whom were receiving primary prophylactic anticoagulation. The main indication was congenital heart disease, either with (n = 8) or without (n = 34) mechanical valve prosthesis. During a follow up period of 602 patient months the average interval between visits was three weeks. Target international normalised ratios (INRs) were achieved on 62 % and 39 % of visits for children with low target INR (2. 0 - 3. 0) and high target INR (3. 0 - 4. 0) respectively. However warfarin dose was altered on only 22 % of visits. Warfarin doses required to achieve a stable INR of 2. 0 - 3. 0 in 33 children were strongly correlated with weight [dose (mg/d) = 0. 07 x weight (kg) + 0. 54] but independently influenced by age. No thrombotic complications were recorded, and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> were infrequent (2. 1 % of visits) and, with one exception, minor.

40|$|Stroke {{causes a}} vast amount of death and {{disability}} throughout the world, yet for many healthcare professionals it remains an area of therapeutic nihilism, and thus uninteresting. This negative perception is shared by the general public, who often have a poor understanding of the early symptoms and significance of a stroke. Yet within the past few years there have been many important developments in the approach to caring for stroke patients, for both the acute management and secondary prevention. After the completion of numerous clinical trials, there is now robust evidence to either support or discredit various interventions. Even more exciting is the prospect of yet more data becoming available in the near future, testing a whole array of treatments, as clinical interest in stroke expands exponentially. In this review an evidence based approach to the management of acute stroke within the first few days is presented, including ischaemic and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events,</b> but not subarachnoid haemorrhage. It is explained why stroke is regarded as a medical emergency, and the importance of a rational, methodic approach to the initial assessment, which is the key to accurate diagnosis and subsequent management, is emphasised. The potential early problems associated with stroke are identified and specific interventions for different stroke types are discussed. The review ends with a brief discussion of the implications that the evolving treatments have for the organisation of modern stroke services. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether anti-thrombotic treatment reduces {{the incidence of}} thrombo-embolism in patients with heart failure, {{so there is a}} need for a large scale controlled study to assess the effects of anti-thrombotic therapy in this setting. We report the design of a randomized controlled multicenter double blind trial examining the effects of aspirin, warfarin and placebo in patients with heart failure on the risk of thrombo-embolism. We planned to recruit 6000 patients with heart failure without contraindications to anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents and to follow them for a mean time of 2 years following randomization. The study was planned to determine the rate of thrombo-embolic and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>events</b> and death among patients randomized to aspirin, warfarin and placebo, strati®ed according to the presence or absence of underlying coronary disease. Ancillary studies parallel to the main study will attempt to identify clinical and echocardiographic risk factors for thrombo-embolism and will also examine whether hemostatic or neurohormonal mechanisms contribute to an increase in the risk of thrombo-embolism in patients with heart failure. We hoped that the results of the study would improve the clinical management and cost-effectiveness of treatment for patients with heart failure. However, the recruitment of patients proved more dif®cult than expected and a number of centers decided not to participate. To avoid a great delay it was decided by the principal investigators and submitted to the executive committee to terminate enrolment in this study when 300 patients had been enrolled, and accept that this is a pilot study.
