5|$|The alleged {{death of}} Moreno González was {{considered}} one of the most significant government victories since the start of the drug war in 2006. La Familia Michoacana was the focus of the government because their stronghold, Michoacán state, is approximately four <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> from the country's capital, Mexico City. In addition, Michoacán is the homestate of former President Felipe Calderón, who made it a top priority to pacify it.|$|E

5|$|Tensions began rising between Lhermitte and her husband. Moqadem {{would spend}} long <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> from home, {{becoming}} {{a regular at}} a bar and a spa. In addition, he would take several trips each year to visit his family in Marrakesh, with the length of each trip ranging from a week to a month. Lhermitte's first son and fifth child, Mehdi, was born on August 9, 2003. The following year, Schaar recommended that Lhermitte should see a psychiatrist and she began consulting the psychiatrist Dr. Diderick Veldekens in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{learns that}} Idris {{contains}} {{the personality of}} the TARDIS' matrix and that they can talk to each other for the first time. Without House's support meanwhile, Uncle and Auntie die, and Idris's body only has a short time before it too will fail. Idris reveals that House had stranded many TARDISes before, and that its universe is <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> from collapsing. The Doctor and Idris work together to construct a makeshift TARDIS from scraps, and then pursue House.|$|E

5|$|Travelling to {{the airport}} for her flight home, Diane and Ric come across a woman in labour, Joanna (Akofa Edjeani Asiedu), who is also {{suffering}} from malaria and having trouble breathing. It is unlikely she will survive a natural childbirth, and the nearest hospital is two <b>hours</b> <b>away.</b> They travel back to Kumi's clinic, collecting an inebriated Abra along the way. After Abra threatens to force entry, Kumi unchains the doors and they manage to deliver the baby and save Joanna.|$|E
5|$|According to German {{assessments}} of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps <b>hours</b> <b>away.</b> German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E
5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few <b>hours</b> <b>away.</b> He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E

5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe to Fall in November 2008. With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within {{a half a}} mile {{of each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living a couple <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} for weeks at a time. Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they might have to return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> by car.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several <b>hours</b> <b>away.</b> Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E

5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still <b>hours</b> <b>away,</b> there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
