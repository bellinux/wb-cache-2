5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with <b>her</b> <b>condition,</b> and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite <b>her</b> <b>condition,</b> in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after <b>her</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until <b>her</b> <b>condition</b> improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that <b>her</b> <b>condition</b> had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E

5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime engineering firm {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine <b>her</b> <b>condition.</b> If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves <b>her</b> <b>condition</b> greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on <b>her</b> <b>condition.</b> A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess <b>her</b> <b>condition</b> with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a New Statesman article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, Cliveden. In 1943, {{the worst of the}} London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. <b>Her</b> <b>condition</b> deteriorated, and she died in September.|$|E
