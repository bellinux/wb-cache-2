500|$|The {{thoroughness}} of the muster {{was heavily}} dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards {{were in charge of}} only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people.

With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely {{left to their own devices}} after being informed of the need to come on deck. Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was listing.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from Brooks & Dunn's fourth album, Borderline, was a cover version of B.W. Stevenson's 1972 single [...] "My Maria". Brooks & Dunn's {{version of the}} song spent three weeks at number one in mid-1996 and peaked at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100; it was also that year's top country song {{according}} to the Billboard Year-End charts. Dunn {{said that he was}} initially reluctant to record [...] "My Maria" [...] because the duo had not previously recorded any cover songs. The song won Brooks & Dunn its second Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Group or Duo, and the duo won the 1996 Entertainer of the Year award from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music, making them the first duo to win that award from the former. In 1997, Brooks & Dunn joined a double-headliner tour with Reba McEntire. Borderline produced another number one in [...] "A Man This Lonely", along with the top ten hits [...] "I Am That Man" [...] and [...] "Why Would I Say Goodbye". [...] "Mama Don't <b>Get</b> <b>Dressed</b> Up for Nothing", the third single and B-side to [...] "My Maria", became their first release not to make the top ten.|$|E

Along with Gamble and Millsap, there was Streamline Records head Vincent Herbert, who agreed on the concept of forming a boy band. Following the idea of forming the group, Gamble, Millsap, Herbert, songwriter Candice Nelson, and choreographer David Scott held open auditions in California in an attempt to find local boys that would fit the criteria of the group. Augusts' cousin had known Gamble, who encouraged her to bring him to the auditions. He was unaware of the group auditions, and was set to attend football practice the day of. Instead, his mother told instructed him to <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> in his football uniform, misleading him, as they’d gone to the auditions instead. For the auditions, he had to remember choreography that was given by Dave Scott. He performed them backwards, and was a terrible dancer. However, Gamble liked his personality, and thought he could improve overtime, much to Millsap’s dismay. In turn, he missed football tryouts, but he was the second member to join Mindless Behavior, behind that of Princeton.|$|E
2500|$|The Tsarevich {{was less}} than a month shy of his fourteenth {{birthday}} when he was murdered on 17 July 1918 in the cellar room of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The assassination was carried out by forces of the Bolshevik secret police under Yakov Yurovsky. According to one account of the murder, the family was told to get up and <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in the middle of the}} night because they were going to be moved. Nicholas II carried Alexei to the cellar room. His mother asked for chairs to be brought so that she and Alexei could sit down. When the family and their servants were settled, Yurovsky announced that they were to be executed. The firing squad first killed Nicholas, the Tsarina, and the two male servants. Alexei remained sitting in the chair, [...] "terrified," [...] before the assassins turned on him and shot at him repeatedly. The boy remained alive and the killers tried to stab him multiple times with bayonets. [...] "Nothing seemed to work," [...] wrote Yurovsky later. [...] "Though injured, he continued to live." [...] Unbeknownst to the killing squad, the Tsarevich's torso was protected by a shirt wrapped in precious gems that he wore beneath his tunic. Finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head, and he fell silent. Rumors of Alexei's survival began to circulate when the bodies of his family and the royal servants were located. Alexei's was missing, along with that of one of his sisters (generally thought to be Maria or Anastasia). As a result of this, there have been people who have pretended to be the Tsarevich; these people are Alexei Poutziato, Joseph Veres, Heino Tammet, Michael Goleniewski and Vassili Filatov. However, scientists considered it extremely unlikely that he escaped death, due to his lifelong hemophilia. The missing bodies were said to have been cremated, though scientists believe it would have been impossible to completely cremate the bodies given the short amount of time and the materials the killing squad had to work with. Numerous searches of the forest surrounding Yekaterinburg up until 2007 failed to turn up the cremation site or the remains of Alexei and his sister.|$|E
2500|$|Natural {{languages}} such as English have {{words for}} several Boolean operations, in particular conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and implication (implies). But not {{is synonymous with}} and not. When used to combine situational assertions such as [...] "the block is on the table" [...] and [...] "cats drink milk," [...] which naively are either true or false, the meanings of these logical connectives often have the meaning of their logical counterparts. However, with descriptions of behavior such as [...] "Jim walked through the door", one starts to notice differences such as failure of commutativity, for example the conjunction of [...] "Jim opened the door" [...] with [...] "Jim walked through the door" [...] in that order is not equivalent to their conjunction in the other order, since and usually means and then in such cases. Questions can be similar: the order [...] "Is the sky blue, and why is the sky blue?" [...] makes more sense than the reverse order. Conjunctive commands about behavior are like behavioral assertions, as in <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> and go to school. Disjunctive commands such love me or leave me or fish or cut bait tend to be asymmetric via the implication that one alternative is less preferable. Conjoined nouns such as tea and milk generally describe aggregation as with set union while tea or milk is a choice. However context can reverse these senses, as in your choices are coffee and tea which usually means the same as your choices are coffee or tea (alternatives). Double negation as in [...] "I don't not like milk" [...] rarely means literally [...] "I do like milk" [...] but rather conveys some sort of hedging, as though to imply {{that there is a}} third possibility. [...] "Not not P" [...] can be loosely interpreted as [...] "surely P", and although P necessarily implies [...] "not not P" [...] the converse is suspect in English, much as with intuitionistic logic. In view of the highly idiosyncratic usage of conjunctions in natural languages, Boolean algebra cannot be considered a reliable framework for interpreting them.|$|E

2500|$|Alex. Ştefănescu {{agrees with}} Negoiţescu's own {{belief in the}} book's {{narrative}} qualities, arguing that Straja dragonilor is, after Poezia lui Eminescu, [...] "the best of all that this feverish and uneven author has ever written". The same commentator commends the volume it for displaying a form of sincerity that was ultimately [...] "conquered through culture {{and the experience of}} writing", resulting in [...] "another level" [...] of a memoir. He writes: [...] "All is beautiful in Ion Negoiţescu's autobiography, even that which is ugly. [...] A reader who is purely spurred on by a prosaic curiosity will find himself disappointed and will abandon it (like the sexually obsessed will abandon a book by Freud)." [...] In Pârvulescu's view: [...] "Although they break all sorts of taboos, [...] Negoiţescu's memoirs are so well written that they never veer into vulgarity or obscenity." [...] Likewise, Adriana Stan esteemed the book [...] "singular in our literature" [...] and its author's [...] "capital work". Also according to Ştefănescu, readers who follow the account of young Negoiţescu's spontaneous sexual act at the cinema will sympathize with the protagonist, and even [...] "breathe a sigh of relief" [...] to note that his advances were not rejected. The same reviewer finds another outstanding quality of the book in [...] "the vast depiction of emotional states", which he believes comparable to sections of Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. In one such fragment, he argues, Negoiţescu presents him child self as [...] "a strange Pygmalion", helping his own mother <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> for a ball and obsessing over every detail in her appearance. The [...] "Proustian" [...] nature is also highlighted by Stan, who argues: [...] "the recollection performed by the grownup ego has therefore too little in common with a regular, constructed and directed writer's diary." [...] Additionally, Pârvulescu sees an essential quality of the book in its depiction of Transylvania as both a prolongation of Austria-Hungary's [...] "decadent greatness" [...] and an area of Balkan and Levantine echoes, [...] "the Ischler cookies on the same table as the qatayef." [...] A section of Straja dragonilor is based strictly on an inventory of Negoiţescu's genealogy, with insight into his family history. The segment is however deemed [...] "boring" [...] by Ştefănescu, who notes that the names mentioned [...] "do not mean anything to us", but nevertheless acknowledges the [...] "chill" [...] they evoke: [...] "the writer, alerted by the premonition of death, wishes to save [...] all things that he can remember about his forefathers." ...|$|E

We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
