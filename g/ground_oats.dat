In Exp. 1, 115 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 4 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a corn-soybean meal-based control, 2) <b>ground</b> <b>oats,</b> 3) oat groats, and 4) oat flour. Phase I diets were formulated to 1. 55 % lysine, and at d 10 postweaning the pigs were switched to a Phase II diets formulated to 1. 3 % lysine. At d 24 postweaning, all pigs were changed to a sorghum-based Phase III diet. The diets were fed in pelleted form. For Phase I, pigs fed the oat products tended to have greater efficiencies of gain compared to pigs fed corn. Pigs fed the reduced fiber oat products (groats and flour) were more efficient than pigs fed ground whole oats, and the most refined oat product (oat flour) tended to support the greatest efficiencies of gain (8 % greater ADG and 13 % greater F/G than the corn control). These same trends for pigs fed oat flour were noted in Phase II and for the overall experiment (I. e., d 0 to 38). In Exp. 2, 172 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 5 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a second 38 -d growth assay.

The data indicated that roasting decreased the nutritional value of <b>ground</b> <b>oats.</b> However, steam-flaking improved the nutritional value of oat groats. Feeding diets formulated with processed oat products (i. e., steam-flaked oat groats and oat flour) improved F/G through Phase II (e. g., 6 % greater efficiency of gain compared to the corn-based control), but much of that advantage was lost during Phase III while the pigs were fed the same sorghum- based diet. In conclusion, the most refined oat products (steam-flaked oat groats and oat flour) supported better F/G than com in Phases I and II.

The first breakfast food was “porridge” which was made by boiling coarsely <b>ground</b> wheat or <b>oats.</b> This was used chiefly by the people of the British Isles. These people subjected this oat or wheat meal to prolonged cooking, it being a historical fact that the porridge pot was always on the stove.

Finding little wheat of oats and learning to use corn, they substituted coarsely ground corn for the basis of their porridge.

60|$|It was {{a narrow}} {{patrimony}} for Archie, the only son of Dame Forbes, and his lady mother had {{hard work to}} keep up a respectable state, and to make ends meet. Sandy Grahame, who had fought under her husband's banner and was now her sole retainer, {{made the most of}} the garden patches. Here he grew vegetables on the best bits of <b>ground</b> and <b>oats</b> on the remainder; these, crushed between flat stones, furnished a coarse bread. From the stream an abundance of fish could always be obtained, and the traps and nets therefore furnished a meal when all else failed. In the stream, too, swam a score and more of ducks, while as many chickens walked about the castle yard, or scratched for insects among the vegetables. A dozen goats browsed on the hillside, for this was common ground to the village, and Dame Forbes had not therefore to ask for leave from her enemies, the Kerrs. The goats furnished milk and cheese, which was deftly made by Elspie, Sandy's wife, who did all the work indoors, as her husband did without. Meat they seldom touched. Occasionally the resources of the hold were eked out by the present of a little hill sheep, or a joint of prime meat, from one or other of her old vassals, for these, in spite of the mastership of the Kerrs, still at heart regarded Dame Mary Forbes as their lawful mistress, and her son Archie as their future chief. Dame Mary Forbes was careful in no way to encourage this feeling, for she feared above all things to draw the attention of the Kerrs to her son. She was sure that did Sir John Kerr entertain but a suspicion that trouble might ever come from the rivalry of this boy, he would not hesitate a moment in encompassing his death; for Sir John was a rough and violent man who was known to hesitate at nothing which might lead to his aggrandizement. Therefore she seldom moved beyond the outer wall of the hold, except to go down to visit the sick in the village. She herself had been a Seaton, and had been educated at the nunnery of Dunfermline, and she now taught Archie to read and write, accomplishments by no means common even among the better class in those days. Archie loved not books; but as it pleased his mother, and time often hung heavy on his hands, he did not mind devoting two or three hours a day to the tasks she set him. At other times he fished in the stream, wandered over the hills, and brought in the herbs from which Dame Forbes distilled the potions which she distributed to the villagers when sick.|$|R

Particle size analysis indicated that the average particle size of the grower diets was 884, 1037, 1420, 1031 and 1501 m while for the finisher diets, the average particle size was 800, 869, 1250, 854 and 1098 m for the barley, ground normal oat, rolled normal oat, ground low lignin-high fat oat and rolled low lignin-high fat oat diets respectively. Digestibility coefficients for pigs fed <b>ground</b> <b>oats</b> were significantly (p 0. 05) in nutrient digestibility between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat. During the growing period (35. 1 to 71. 4 kg) as well as over the entire experiment (35. 1 to 112. 5 kg), there were no differences (p> 0. 05) in daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion between pigs fed normal or low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs fed ground or rolled oat diets. During the finishing period (71. 4 to 112. 5 kg), feed intake and feed conversion were poorer (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the low lignin-high fat oat compared with the barley diet. There were no differences in carcass traits between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs fed rolled and <b>ground</b> <b>oats.</b> The overall results of this experiment indicate that both normal and low lignin-high fat oat can substitute for barley at levels as high as 40 % of the diet without hindering pig performance. Since the average yield of oat can be equal or higher than barley with lower input costs, a re-examination of feeding recommendations regarding oat in swine rations seems warranted. In addition, since pig performance and carcass traits were not affected by processing method and roller mills have been shown to have lower-energy requirements, lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and more exact control of particle size than hammer mills, there may be some advantage for pig producers to consider roller mills rather than hammer mills for use in processing pig feeds...|$|E
40|$|Test was {{conducted}} in 1960 - 61 with the purpose to study the effect of feedine different rations to pregnant ewes during late gestation on their production (body weight, fleece and milk yield and birth and weaning weigght of lambs). Fourteen pregnant five - year - old „pramenka“ ewes were devided into two uniform groups, about 60 days before lambing time. Both control and treated group dropped two pairs of twins and five singles (six female and three male). The first group of ewes was fed 1, 5 kgs meadow hay and 0, 25 kg concentrate dailv per ewe. The concentration mixture consisted of maize 40 %, wheat bran 30 %, <b>ground</b> <b>oats</b> 15 %, sunflower oil meal cake 11 %, mineral mixture (koštan) 3 % an salt 1 %. The second group (control ewes) was fed 2 kilos meadow hay daily per ewe only. According to Popov, both rations had the same nutritive value (1, 1 nutritional units and 75 - 82 grammes digastible proteine). After lambing time treated and control ewes wene fed as one flock. According {{to the results of}} this experiment cuold be concluded that pregnant ewes can be fed good quality meadow hay as the only ration.

Sydnor, Butenandt, Brillantes and Huggins (1962) demonstrated that this does not occur in all rat strains, but that multiple doses were required to induce {{a high incidence of}} cancer in some strains. The studies reported in this paper are an extension of these observations. They indicate that there are variations among rat strains in respect to their sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of DMBA. A high incidence of mammary cancer results if multiple doses are given to the August or Chester Beatty strains, but the Marshall rats are resistant. They further demonstrate that the feeding of the pyrimidines, thymine and uracil, affords limited protection against the carcinogenic action of this hydrocarbon. METHODS AND MATERIALS With the exception of the experiment shown in Table V in which Wistar, August, Sprague-Dawley and Marshall strains were included, experiments were performed on female rats of the Chester Beatty colony. 7, 12 -Dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) (Roche Products) was dissolved in arachis oil and administered in 1 ml. doses by gastric tube at fortnightly intervals. Control animals were given 1 ml. of arachis oil. In one experiment (Table VI) DMBA and 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 -MC) dissolved in arachis oil were administered intraperitoneally.

40|$|Summary of main {{findings}} When adipose tissue {{is present in}} excessive amounts, as in obesity, it predisposes {{to a number of}} pathologies. Obesity is a complex, multifactorial condition as it influences many endogenous genetic, endocrine, and inflammatory pathways. Excess dietary intake is one of the important factors which are responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity. For the understanding of the reciprocity between consumed diet and excessive amounts of adipose tissue, it is essential to investigate underlying functioning. In this thesis, I have addressed three important aspects that {{play a role in the}} development of diet induced obesity and its pathologies with a focus on adipose tissue metabolism.   Does a body weight set-point exist?   How is the diet-induced metabolic response affected by housing at thermoneutrality?   Does oxygen restriction induce inflammation in white adipose tissue?   The first aspect investigated was the existence of a body weight set point. A body weight set point is defined as a pre-determined or preferred level of body weight which is preserved by an internal feedback control mechanism. In chapter 2, a dietary intervention with none, one, or two diet alterations of purified diets was performed in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice to investigate if a long lasting effect on body weight persistence was present. Diets contained equal protein content and source of ingredients but differed in the fat-to-sugar ratio. Therefore, energy content and amount of fat was different for either the low fat diet or the high fat. In the intervention the last consumed diet of the mice determined energy intake, energy expenditure, body weight, body fat stores, circulating hormones and metabolites. These data support the settling point theory as body weight and metabolic parameters ‘settle’ based on current energetic input and output and do not support the set point theory. Next to that it underlines the importance of diet choice in intervention studies focusing on aspects on the crossroads of nutrition and physiology.   In chapter 3 adipose tissue physiology and molecular regulation was further investigated by exposure to more metabolic stress in the form of a weight loss challenge with different purified diets. Diet-induced obese C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a high fat diet restricted to 70 % intake of previous ad libitum high fat diet intake or they were changed to ad libitum low fat diet for 5 weeks. Beneficial effects were seen in both interventions regarding physiological parameters. However, molecular parameters in white adipose tissue differed between the two restriction interventions, with increased activation of mitochondrial carbohydrate and fat metabolism in high fat diet restricted mice. When extrapolated to the human situation this may suggest that a reduction of portion size is the best method for weight loss.   It is standard practice to house mice at ambient temperature during physiological intervention studies. Unfortunately mice are then exposed to a temperature below their thermal neutral zone. This implies that their metabolism is chronically increased which is known to influence study outcomes. In chapter 4 the second question; “how is the diet-induced metabolic response affected by housing at thermoneutrality?”was investigated. A 14 -week dietary intervention with two semi-purified diets, a low fat diet and a moderately high fat diet, was performed at 28 °C in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. This resulted in a large diet-induced difference in bodyweight, adipose tissue mass, adipocyte size, and serum leptin level. But no differential effects of the diets were seen on serum glucose, free fatty acids, triacylglycerides, insulin, a panel of cardiovascular markers, and a number of (metabolic) parameters in liver and muscle. Although adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size was increased significantly, there was no sign of inflammation or dysfunction in the adipose tissue. This study suggests that diet-induced obesity of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice at thermoneutrality results in a suitable model for the metabolically ‘healthy’ obese (people who are significantly overweight but show none of the usual metabolic problems). Next to that, this study emphasizes the importance of consideration and control of housing temperature for mice, as it has profound effects on study outcomes. The third and last question investigated was if oxygen restriction is able to induce inflammation in white adipose tissue. There is substantial evidence that white adipose tissue becomes hypoxic when excessively enlarged. Due to fast expansion of white adipose tissue the vasculature is not able to keep pace with growth. Next to that, adipocytes are able to increase in size beyond the limit of oxygen diffusion. To investigate if hypoxia was able to induce inflammation in white adipose tissue, the model for healthy obese adipocytes (developed in chapter 4) was used and exposed to ambient oxygen restriction (13 %) to challenge adipose tissue metabolism. This resulted in the presence of systemic oxygen restriction as shown by increased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Furthermore a switch to glycolytic metabolism, which is indicative for tissue hypoxia, was present. No differences in adipose tissue macrophage infiltration (as marker for inflammation) were found. But, serum branched chain amino acids and adipokines were affected. Branched chain amino acids were increased in mice exposed to oxygen restriction which shows resemblance with findings in humans where increased levels were found in lean versus obese people. The peptide hormone adiponectin was increased in serum, without differences in WAT expression. On the other hand, the peptide hormones CCDC 3 and CCK showed decreased transcript levels in white adipose tissue without significant change in serum levels, although for CCDC 3 a trend was seen. Together these results suggest that oxygen restriction does not induce inflammation in adipose tissue. However, it does affect adipokine regulation. After performing these studies it was clear that composition of the diet has a major influence on outcome parameters of physiological studies as shown in chapter 2. To compare functional effects of different nutrients, it is important to use standardized purified diets. Not only the experimental intervention diet is of importance but also the reference control diet can influence outcomes. For example, when an intervention is performed with a high fat purified diet and the reference diet is chow this will lead to a difficult comparison. The content of chow is variable as it is grain or cereal based (ground corn, <b>ground</b> <b>oats</b> alfalfa meal, soybean meal and ground wheat). Nutritional adequacy is ensured by addition of vitamins, minerals, and fat. However, the exact amount of the various ingredients is frequently kept secret by the manufacturer. Next to that, due to the plant based origin of chow it will contain nutritive (protein, carbohydrate, fat) components but also non-nutritive components (phytochemicals). The content of the chow diet will vary from batch to batch as the nutritive and nonnutritive value will change between harvests. When using a chow reference diet in comparison to a purified diet you will never know exactly what you are comparing, i. e. difference in amino acids or effects of phytochemicals etc. Therefore, a reference diet for physiology was designed (chapter 6) to improve comparison of study outcomes and to increase efficiency of resources and material. A key feature of the diet is the fixed protein concentration, which allows for an exchange of carbohydrate and fat in a high fat version of the diet. To conclude, the work presented in this thesis provides clear insight in factors that are of importance for improvement of translatability of mouse studies to the human situation. It was shown that when investigating the weight balance many parameters, i. e. genetics, metabolic rate, environmental factors like ambient housing temperature and light and cognitive behavior, besides the diet and its composition are able to influence the outcome parameters. As most mouse experiments are performed in a fixed environment with no choices of food and a standard temperature set to 22 °C. This is clearly not reflective of humans under free living conditions. However, these fixed conditions are able to result in experiments that unravel underlying mechanisms of weight balance, which form the basis for discovering a solution to the obesity epidemic...|$|E
