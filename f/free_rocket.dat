25|$|Tensions {{between the}} two governments peaked again during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The United States had a much larger arsenal of {{long-range}} nuclear weapons than the Soviet Union, as well as medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Turkey, whereas the Soviet Union had a large stockpile of medium-range nuclear weapons which were primarily located in Europe. Cuba agreed to let the Soviets secretly place SS-4 Sandal and SS-5 Skean MRBMs on their territory. Reports from inside Cuba to exile sources questioned the need for large amounts of ice going to rural areas, {{which led to the}} discovery of the missiles, confirmed by Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance photos. The United States responded by establishing a cordon in international waters to stop Soviet ships from bringing in more missiles (designated a quarantine rather than a blockade to avoid issues with international law). At the same time, Castro was getting a little too extreme for the liking of Moscow, so at the last moment the Soviets called back their ships. In addition, they agreed to remove the missiles already there in exchange for an agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba. Only {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union was it revealed that another part of the agreement was the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. It also turned out that some submarines that the U.S. Navy blocked were carrying nuclear missiles and that communication with Moscow was tenuous, effectively leaving the decision of firing the missiles at the discretion of the captains of those submarines. In addition, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian government revealed that nuclear-armed FROGs (<b>Free</b> <b>Rocket</b> Over Ground) and Ilyushin Il-28 Beagle bombers had also been deployed in Cuba.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of small spacecraft in educational institutions {{has traditionally been}} hampered by the high costs and integration complexities of launches. NASA’s Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program (ELaNa), kick started the concept of hitchhiking for <b>free</b> on a <b>rocket</b> launch to low-Earth or geostationary orbit. An ELaNa launch is typically provided by grouping multiple educational nanosatellites together in a rocket that is already carrying a larger and more expensive primary payload. In essence, providing the nanosats with a free hitchhike to space. The program promotes research and education by giving participants first-hand experience in spacecraft design and development. Although the ELaNa program has created unprecedented opportunities for student engagement in spacecraft design, it is limited in scope to low-Earth and geostationary orbits. Given {{the success of the}} program, it is time to consider the next leap in educational launches, namely that of interplanetary launches.

5000|$|If {{the rocket}} is a {{multi-stage}} system where stages fire sequentially, the rocket's ascent burn {{may not be}} continuous. Obviously, some time must be allowed for stage separation and engine ignition between each successive stage, but some rocket designs call for extra free-flight time between stages. This is particularly useful in very high thrust rockets, where if the engines were fired continuously, the rocket would run out of fuel before leveling off and reaching a stable orbit above the atmosphere. [...] The technique is also useful when launching from a planet with a thick atmosphere, such as the Earth. Because gravity turns the flight path during <b>free</b> flight, the <b>rocket</b> can use a smaller initial pitchover angle, giving it higher vertical velocity, and taking {{it out of the}} atmosphere more quickly. This reduces both aerodynamic drag as well as aerodynamic stress during launch. Then later during the flight the rocket coasts between stage firings, allowing it to level off above the atmosphere, so when the engine fires again, at zero angle of attack, the thrust accelerates the ship horizontally, inserting it into orbit.|$|R

Coming off his [...] "Linsanity" [...] performance in New York, Houston coach Kevin McHale said the expectations of Lin were undue. McHale said the public believed Lin would [...] "average 28 points and 11 assists", but he had never played a whole 82-game season before. Shortly before their regular-season opener in October, the Rockets acquired James Harden, who supplanted Lin as the face of the team. Throughout the season, though, Lin still placed pressure on himself {{to live up to the}} expectations from Linsanity. However, Harden was a ball-dominant, pick-and-roll player like Lin, and McHale chose to have the offense run through the more-proven Harden. The Rockets started the season with a 5-7 record and the youngest roster in the league. Lin was averaging 10 points and 6.3 assists, but was struggling shooting 33.3 percent and 22.9 percent of his 3-pointers. He was handling the ball less than he did with the Knicks, with Harden often controlling the ball on pick-and-rolls with Lin on the wing. In the Rockets' next game on November 23, Lin faced the Knicks for the first time since leaving as a free agent. The Knicks entered at 8-2 with the best record in the league, but Houston won at home 131-103 as Lin contributed 13 points, seven rebounds and three assists. He shot 6-for-12, making half of his shots for the first time in eight games, and breaking a personal five-game drought without a 3-pointer.|$|R
40|$|Poster) In {{the context}} of the {{concerns}} and fears over mobile telephony and health, various research programmes have been launched worldwide. Several of our research projects deal with molecular biology that uses techniques investigating biological effects at the DNA, protein and cellular level. Among them are cytogenetics, gene and protein expressions that can be related to cancer and can be studied using in vivo models. DNA damage and Hsp 70 expression in the brain of rats have been investigated after exposure to the GSM- 900 signal used for mobile telephony. The head of the rats was only exposed using an antenna operating at 900 MHz. After a one-week training period, rats were exposed (antenna ON) or sham-exposed (antenna OFF) to GSM- 900 in individual <b>rockets.</b> <b>Free</b> moving rats were used as cage-controls. (i) The DNA damage caused by GSM- 900 microwaves in brain cells at different SAR was assessed using the alkaline comet assay method. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups: cage control (n= 5), positive control (n= 8) (25 mg/kg of ethylmethane sulfonate, i. p.), sham-exposed (n= 8) and exposed animals (n= 8) to 1, 5; 3 or 6 W/kg local SAR for 2 hours and killed by decapitation immediately after exposure. A tissue press was used to obtain a single cell suspension from the whole brain. No consistent difference in the amount of damaged cells could be observed whatever the SAR used. (ii) The expression of Hsp 70 after a one-hour exposure to GSM- 900 signal was assessed in male Wistar rats. The animals were divided in four groups: positive controls (kainic acid injected) (n= 2), cage-controls (n= 4), sham-exposed (n= 5) and GSM- 900 (2 W/kg) exposed rats (n= 5).
