5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually <b>dun</b> Galloways were also allowed into the herd book. As a result, although black {{is still the most}} common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of <b>dun.</b> In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the white belt is unknown, but {{generally}} presumed {{to have come from}} cross breeding with Lakenvelder (Dutch Belted) cattle. A Polled Herd Book was started in 1852 which registered both Aberdeen-Angus and Galloways. Galloway breeders acquired their own herd book in 1878. The <b>Dun</b> and Belted Galloway Association was formed in Scotland in 1921, and in 1951 the name of the organisation was changed to the Belted Galloway Society and <b>dun</b> cattle were no longer registered. It also keeps and records pedigrees for Belted Galloways and oversees the registration of White and Red Galloways.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the four}} British {{divisions}} mentioned above, Gillespie's {{was the first}} to penetrate the enemy's frontier. The Nepalese had anticipated that Dehra <b>Dun</b> would be the first place of assault, and had tasked Captain Balbhadra Kunwar with the fortification of the place. When Balbhadra Kunwar, commander of the Nepalese defence army at Dehradun, heard of the approach of the British Army and its size, he realised that {{it would be impossible to}} defend the city. He withdrew from Dehradun and moved his force of about 600, including dependents, to a hill north-east of the city. He subsequently took up a position in the small fort of Nalapani, Khalanga. His force was ethnically diverse, consisting of Magar soldiers belonging to the Purano Gorakh Battalion and soldiers that had been recruited from Garhwal and nearby areas. On 22 October, before the British declaration of war on 1 November 1814, Gillespie seized the Keree Pass leading into the <b>Dun</b> Valley. He then proceeded to Dehra unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Presumably as a {{consequence}} of the Roman advance, various hill forts such as <b>Dun</b> Mor in Perthshire, which had been abandoned by the natives long ago, were re-occupied. Some new ones may even have been constructed in the northeast, such as Hill O'Christ's Kirk in Aberdeenshire.|$|E
5|$|Purebred Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as <b>dun,</b> cremello, palomino or buckskin. However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} at Meerut was formed under Gillespie, and originally consisted of one British infantry regiment, the 53rd, which with artillery {{and a few}} dismounted dragoons, made up about 1,000 Europeans. In addition to this, there were about 2,500 native infantrymen; this made up a total force of 3,513 men. Once assembled, it marched directly to Dehra <b>Dun,</b> which was the principal town in the <b>Dun</b> Valley. After having captured or destroyed the forts in the valley, the plan called for Gillespie to either move eastwards to expel Amar Singh Thapa's troops from Srinagar, or westwards to take Nahan, the largest town in the Sirmaur district, where Amar Singh's son, Ranjore Singh Thapa, controlled the government. Once completed, Gillespie was to sweep on towards the Sutlej in order to isolate Amar Singh, and force him to negotiate.|$|E
