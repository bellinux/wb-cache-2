It—and the {{following}} four singles—were not major hits, however each release {{was better than the}} last, thus gradually increasing her exposure and presence on the market. Hamasaki's debut album, A Song for ×× (1999), was likewise [...] "unassuming": the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of Da Pump), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of <b>Every</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Thing),</b> were [...] "cautious" [...] pop-rock songs. However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public. The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies.

500|$|Climax Studios {{began with}} the game's plot, which the {{development}} team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill, and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States, where the fictional town is located. Falling snow was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: [...] "ultimately <b>every</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> {{you do in the}} game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research." [...] The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer, Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player.|$|E

Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying <b>every</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> every different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz.

Shiflett added that for the first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while Grohl [...] "usually works out all the bits" [...] of composition.|$|E
