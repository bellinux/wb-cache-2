25|$|Liverpool did {{the double}} over Everton in 2007–08. However, the meeting at Goodison Park was {{shrouded}} in controversy when after a coming together between Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Everton's Tony Hibbert, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded Liverpool a penalty {{and seemed to}} change his mind in favour of a red card for Hibbert after Gerrard appeared to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to him, when most pundits felt a caution would have been sufficient. Everton dominated the game after going behind, but were denied what seemed to be two clear penalties in the closing stages of the game when Joleon Lescott was twice wrestled to the ground by Jamie Carragher at Everton corners. The victory helped secure a top-four finish and Champions League qualification for Liverpool, leaving Everton to settle for a UEFA Cup place. Referee Clattenburg was not chosen to officiate again at Goodison Park after that match until December 2013, six years later, and in that period only officiated one Everton game, away at Aston Villa.|$|E

2500|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> out loud because there was a print photographer standing beside me and he said, 'Did you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying.|$|E

2500|$|A {{day after}} O'Neal was traded, Bryant re-signed with the Lakers {{for seven years}} and $136 million. Bryant said he enjoyed playing with both Jackson and O'Neal, {{and he said he}} did not {{influence}} the Lakers' decisions regarding the two. Regardless, newspapers the next day criticized Bryant for his alleged manipulation of the team. O'Neal added, [...] "When it came to my leaving, [...] could have spoken up. He could <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>something.</b> He didn't say anything." [...] Winter said, [...] " [...] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, {{and urban}} ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s {{inspired}} {{the observation that}} [...] "The Bronx is burning": in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series, when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like, [...] "There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both {{the city and the}} borough's decline. A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.|$|E
