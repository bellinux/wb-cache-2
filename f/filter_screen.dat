40|$|We reared clones of the waterflea Daphnia galeata, {{a common}} grazer in {{many types of}} lakes, under several food regimes to study adaptations to feeding {{conditions}} in <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> morphology and life history. As food regimes, we used low and high concentrations of the green alga Scenedesmus, {{a high concentration of}} the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria, and a mixture of Scenedesmus and clay. Natural seston from Lake IJsselmeer was also tested. Clones from two contrasting habitats (mesotrophic versus hypertrophic lake) did not differ in either population growth rate, r, or filtering structures. However, all the clones exhibited phenotypic plasticity when reared under low and high food concentrations. In relation to their body length, daphnids grew larger filter screens with longer setae in response to low food concentrations, thus enhancing filtering efficiency. Supplementing the low food concentration with inert clay particles had no effect on either the growth performance or <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> morphology. In both cases, the growth and reproduction were low and filtering areas large. Filter screens were of intermediate size when daphnids were supplied with food supporting intermediate growth and reproduction. From these laboratory results, we concluded that the nutritional status of Daphnia is a more important cue for the phenotypic response of the <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> morphology than particle concentration.

40|$|Structural best {{management}} practices (BMPs) are used to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Most structural BMPs provide treatment by filtering runoff through a filter media or collecting it in a detention basin and slowly discharging it {{over an extended period}} of time to allow suspended solids and associated contaminants to settle out. The purpose of this study is to design an effective outlet structure that provides adequate filtration or slows discharge to 40 hours. A model detention basin was constructed in the Civil Engineering Hydraulics Laboratory at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and two full scale outlet structures were tested in it. The first outlet device was an orifice controlled perforated riser. Discharge from the device was measured at many head levels and the results correlated well with discharge given by the orifice equation. The orifice controlled perforated riser adequately provided a 40 hour drain time and can be sized for various detention basin sizes using the orifice equation. At low heads, however, it was observed that perforations in the riser pipe could also control flow rates, depending on the size, elevation, and number of the lowest perforations. The second outlet structure tested was a filtered perforated riser. An 18 ” diameter barrel was placed around the perforated riser and filled with coarse (D 50 = 0. 11 in) sand. Fifteen tests were run where sediment laden water was cycled through the filtered riser. The device provided good filtration but showed significant clogging. The filter media, in series with the orifice, impacted flow rates and was modeled using an unconfined aquifer equation. The unconfined aquifer equation was used to estimate changes in hydraulic conductivity as the filter began to clog with sediment. However, clogging of the <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> was also observed and was modeled as a minor loss. Estimation of the minor loss coefficient provided a better fit to the data than the hydraulic conductivity. Therefore, it was concluded that the clogging of the <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> was the significant driver of the head loss. Both methods of estimating clogging showed a dramatic initial increase in head loss, followed by much smaller increases. When designing the filtered riser these changes in head loss should be considered and the filtered riser should be sized based on flow rates after initial clogging. Advisor: David M. Admiraa...|$|E
40|$|Daphnia can {{enlarge the}} area of the <b>screens</b> on its <b>filtering</b> limbs in {{response}} to low concentrations of food. Seven species of Daphnia had larger <b>filter</b> <b>screens</b> when grown at low levels of food compared to animals of the same size raised at high levels of food. The increase in screen area varied between 19 and 83 % among species. Larger <b>filter</b> <b>screens</b> resulted in higher filtering and feeding rates. Threshold food concentrations for growth, calculated from the carbon budget for different Daphnia species, were biased when adaptation of the <b>filter</b> <b>screens</b> was ignored. Daphnids used for measuring assimilation rates are usually cultured at high levels of food and thus have small <b>filter</b> <b>screens.</b> If filter-screen enlargement is taken into consideration in estimating assimilation rates, thresholds come close to the realistic values measured in long-term growth experiments.

A needle valve degrader was modified to include partial recirculation of degraded fuel and heat addition in the bypass loop. A pressure drop across the needle valve {{of up to}} 4, 000 psi was used. The pressure drop across a 325 mesh <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> placed inline with the degrader and directly downstream of the needle valve was measured {{as a function of}} time for different values of pressure drop across the needle valve. A volume flux of 1 gpm/sq in was employed based on the frontal area of the screen. It was found that, at ambient temperatures, freshly blended AMK fuel could be degraded using a single pass degradation at 4, 000 psi pressure drop across the needle valve to give acceptable filterability performance. At fuel temperatures below - 20 C, degradation becomes increasingly difficult and a single pass technique results in unacceptable filtration performance. Recirculation of a fraction of the degraded fuel and heat addition in the bypass loop improved low temperature degradation performance.

40|$|Regenerable filters {{will play}} an {{important}} role in human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. Life Support Systems aboard crewed spacecrafts will have to operate reliably and with little maintenance over periods of more than a year, even multiple years. Air filters are a key component of spacecraft life support systems, but they often require frequent routine maintenance. Bacterial filters aboard the International Space Station require almost weekly cleaning of the pre-filter screen to remove large lint debris captured in the microgravity environment. The source of the airborne matter which is collected on the <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> is typically from clothing fibers, biological matter (hair, skin, nails, etc.) and material wear. Clearly a need for low maintenance filters requiring little to no crew intervention will be vital to the success of the mission. An impactor filter is being developed and tested to address this need. This filter captures large particle matter through inertial separation and impaction methods on collection surfaces, which can be automatically cleaned after they become heavily loaded. The impactor filter can serve as a pre-filter to augment the life of higher efficiency filters that capture fine and ultrafine particles. A prototype of the filter is being tested at the Particulate Filtration Laboratory at NASA Glenn Research Center to determine performance characteristics, including particle cut size and overall efficiency. Model results are presented for the flow characteristics near the orifice plate through which the particle-laden flow is accelerated as well as around the collection bands...|$|E

40|$|Daphnia {{collects}} {{more food}} at low particle concentrations by increasing its maximum filtering rate either by enlarging {{the area of}} its <b>filter</b> <b>screens</b> or by increasing its appendage beat rate (ABR). Various species of Daphnia grown at low levels of food phenotypically enlarge their <b>filter</b> <b>screens.</b> Models of the flow across a filter predict that the energy required to obtain a certain increase in filtering rate is a linear function of the screen area but increases proportionally to the square of ABR. A daphniid {{should be able to}} increase its filtering rate without expending more energy if it enlarges the filter and simultaneously reduces ABR. To test the model predictions, we measured morphometric parameters (areas, open space, intersetular distances) of the filters and ABR for Daphnia adapted to high food and to low food. Daphniids adapted to low food not only have larger <b>filter</b> <b>screens,</b> they also have finer meshes. In Daphnia adapted to low food, mean ABR is slightly reduced and there is a negative relationship between filter-screen area and ABR in the low-food treatment.

The distribution of {{the various types of}} setae on the mouthparts is mapped and structure of the mouthparts and their setae is correlated with function. Sediment collected by the pereiopods is brushed off by the endopodites of the 3 rd maxillipeds and transferred to the inner mouthparts by the endopodites of the 2 nd maxillipeds.

40|$|In the 1920 s, {{before the}} advent of echo sounders, fishery {{biologists}} were greatly concerned with assisting the fisherman to locate schools of pelagic fish. One of the approaches they developed was to relate the distribution of the planktonic food organisms to the presence of the schools of predators such as herring (Clupea harengus). The British planktologist, Alister Hardy, who had already carried out extensive studies on the feeding preferences of herring (Hardy, 1926 a), initiated a program to examine the fishermen's contention that herring schools avoided 'green', i. e., phytoplankton-rich, water but could be correlated with high concentrations of zooplankton. This practical program was centered on the use of a specially developed instrument, the 'Plankton Indicator', designed to be used by the fisherman to assist in the search for suitable waters. It had limited success in its main aim but, as a collecting device, it embodied several profoundly important features. It was a simple instrument which was robust enough to be deployed and recovered by the crew of commercial vessels (in this case fishing vessels) while they were underway. The Indicator however, {{was no more than a}} high speed net which integrated the plankton over the area of sampling, but Hardy had also become interested in describing the patchiness of planktonic populations. He thus developed the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) where he substituted the fixed <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> of the Indicator by a continually moving length of silk mesh. The screen traversed at constant speed across the path of the incoming water and the trapped organisms were retained in place by sandwiching beneath an additional second mesh screen. Thus, knowing the speed of the towing vessel and the shooting and hauling positions, the spatial patterns of the plankton could be determined. Hardy took the first CPR to the Antarctic where he used it in the Southern Atlantic (Hardy, 1926 b) and later deployed it in the North Sea to make some of the earliest contiguous records of plankton patchiness...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a high and low non-starch {{polysaccharide}} diet (HNSP and LNSP diet) and ultrasound treatment on particle size distribution and carbon bioavailability in fecal waste of rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss) was studied. Feces were collected from four flow-through fish tanks, two tanks fed the HNSP diet and two the LNSP diet. The collected feces were sonicated (disintegrated) in duplicate with high-intensity (0. 6 W/ml), low-frequency (f = 20 Hz) ultrasound at five different energy levels (0. 6 W/ml for 0, 0. 25, 1, 4, and 16 min). The particle size distribution of the treated feces samples was measured by wet sieving (1000, 500, 200, 100, 63, 36, 1. 2 µm screen size) and total suspended solids (TSS) measurement. Carbon bioavailability in sonicated fecal waste samples was determined with oxygen uptake rate (OUR) tests. The results showed that: (1) feces from the HNSP diet contained significant more particulate material and bigger particles; (2) carbon bioavailability was almost three times higher in untreated LNSP feces when compared with HNSP feces; (3) almost 50 % of HNSP feces could have been recovered on a microscreen of 36 µm after wet sieving, whereas it was only 10 % for LNSP feces; (4) the production of small particles (1. 2 – 36 µm), which could pass a drum <b>filter</b> <b>screen</b> and potentially accumulate in RAS, was approximately 50 g/kg feed, showing {{no significant differences between}} diets; (5) sonication increased fecal dry matter below 36 µm (p = 0. 015), but it had no significant effect on the median particle size; (6) sonication increased carbon bioavailability with 7 – 10 % for the HNSP feces (p = 0. 037); (7) fecal particles withstood up to 16 min sonication at an intensity of 0. 6 W/ml and a frequency of 20 Hz corresponding to specific energy input of 20, 000 kJ/kg DM without major changes in particle size distribution.

40|$|Spacecraft {{such as the}} International Space Station (ISS) and {{the space}} {{shuttles}} are enclosed environments where crewmembers may spend long periods of time. Currently, crewmembers spend approximately a period of 6 months in the ISS. It is known that these prolonged stays in space may result in weakening of the immune system. Therefore, exposure to opportunistic pathogens or high concentrations of environmental microorganisms may compromise {{the health of the}} crew. The detection of biocontaminants in spacecraft environments utilizes culture-based methodology, omitting greater than 90 % of all microorganisms including pathogens such as Legionella and Cryptosporidium. Culturable bacteria and fungi have been the only allergens studied; the more potent allergens, such as those from dust mites, have never been tested for in spacecraft environments. In addition, no {{attempts have been made to}} monitor microbial toxins in spacecrafts. The present study utilized quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) as a novel approach for monitoring microorganisms in the spacecraft environment. QPCR is a molecular biology technique that does not rely on the physiological state of the organisms for identification, thereby enabling detection of both culturable and non-culturable organisms. In this project, specific molecular primers and probes were utilized for the detection and quantitation of two fungi of concern in indoor environments, Aspergillus fumigatus and Stachybotrys chartarum. These organisms were selected because of the availability of PCR primers and probes, and to establish the sample processing and analysis methodology that may be employed with additional organisms. Purification methods and QPCR assays were optimized for the detection of these organisms in air, surface, and water; and sample processing and analysis protocols were developed.
