6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you?" [...] he muttered, for the Queen, {{who seemed}} to have {{forgotten}} all about him, was looking the other way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be cursing, I tell you, girl. And {{what is it}} your misthress is {{wishing to}} do now? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> {{you to come to}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clifford {{began to}} laugh and to blush, by no means like {{a young man with}} a romantic secret. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|Well, yes, {{it was her}} <b>doing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> me <b>she</b> doesn't mean to come to Egypt so much as in {{the past}} and wants her brother nearer to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to find that out, you must get it through Florence. You may be quite sure I shall tell her; and I suppose I may be quite sure <b>she</b> will <b>tell</b> you. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you everything?" ...|$|R
50|$|Lanseloet now {{understands how}} shamefully he has treated Sanderijn. He {{is still in}} love with her and sends of his manservant Reinout to find her. when he <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him <b>she</b> would never leave her husband for Lanseloet.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{fell out}} of the machine?" [...] cried Dick. [...] "There is some mistake here. I have had no fall. When <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{youthful}} inexperience {{will permit}} that pledge to be implied {{in matters of}} State," [...] said the Queen. [...] "Continue, Mistress Woodford; what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> {{you about}} me?" [...] asked Mollie, {{changing}} cows. Murray {{discovered that she}} was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> all {{the people}} outside the house about me? It is n't fair," [...] said Black Sheep. [...] "When I was in Bombay, and was bad--doing bad, not made-up bad like this--Mamma told Papa, and Papa told me he knew, and that was all. Outside {{people did n't know}} too--even Meeta did n't know." ...|$|R
50|$|Because {{she has no}} way to earn a living, Susan {{approaches}} Henchard for help. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> {{not correct}} his assumption that he is Elizabeth-Jane's father, nor <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> anyone about the auction incident. Henchard sends her a gift of five guineas (the amount for which he sold her to Newson) and sets her up as a genteel new arrival to town. He courts her and remarries her. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not <b>tell</b> him the truth about Elizabeth-Jane until her death {{a year or two}} later, when she writes a deathbed confession and seals it in an envelope to be opened only on Elizabeth-Jane's wedding day.|$|R
5000|$|Kate, {{after her}} {{failed attempt to}} kill Cassie, leaves town. Before she leaves, she admits to Charles that she tried to kill Cassie {{because it was the}} only way to find out how strong she was. When Charles says that he will let the other Elders know about what <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him that <b>she</b> knows he is {{involved}} on Henry's death and Jane's [...] "neurological issue".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} speak of him---- I hadn't meant to, unless you did. I want {{to be fair to}} him. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you about him?" [...] Jeff asked confidentially.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} induced Helen {{to bring that}} poor old Dutch doll along with her?" [...] demanded Flossie. [...] "The woman never opened her mouth all the time. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear friend; {{and perhaps}} I shall {{ask you to}} help me out of mine before I have done. But never mind that now. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you about the adventure?' ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{what had}} Eleanor meant when she {{declared}} that whatever <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> would <b>tell</b> her father first? What was <b>she</b> thinking of <b>doing?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary {{will stand}} no nonsense," [...] said the Colonel, {{laughing}} gently. [...] "We {{all have to}} <b>do</b> as <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> us. She'll turn you round her little finger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{should like}} to know is this: <b>did</b> <b>she</b> or <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not <b>tell</b> Lady Ongar what she was to do--about you, I mean? I dare say <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a {{bit about}} her beard," [...] said Lily. [...] "But why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> me to do my duty? I didn't go there to have a sermon preached to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{just the}} {{disadvantage}} {{of that kind of}} school that girls talk that sort of undesirable stuff. Gillian said to herself; but curiosity, or interest in the Whites, prompted her to add, 'What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia {{shook her}} head. [...] "Thinking, Francine, {{of the new}} life before her--and regretting, I am afraid, that she ever confided her hopes and wishes to me. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you last night what her {{prospects}} are when she leaves school?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} like it," [...] snapped Eve. [...] "But Mrs. Rastall-Retford is paying me a salary to <b>do</b> what <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> me, and I {{have to earn}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so!" [...] Miss Flite acquiesced {{with the}} {{greatest}} suavity. [...] "Jenny. Ye-es! And what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> our young friend but {{that there has been}} a lady with a veil inquiring at her cottage after my dear Fitz Jarndyce's health and taking a handkerchief away with her as a little keepsake merely because it was my amiable Fitz Jarndyce's! Now, you know, so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil!" ...|$|R
50|$|Nadine Bari {{takes us}} {{down a road}} in Guinea as she {{searches}} for her husband. As <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> us of the long battle she faced to get the Guinean authorities {{to tell her what}} had happened to her husband after he disappeared. Hopeful and desperate, her story is similar to that of thousands of women who are still trying to discover what became of their husbands, fathers, brothers or sons during Sékou Touré's dictatorship.|$|R
6000|$|V:3:69 [...] ALAR. [...] Ay, anon. [...] Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> me {{that she}} lived? Methought [...] It was all past. I came to confront death; [...] And we have met. This {{sacrificial}} blood-- [...] What, bears it no atonement? 'Twas an offering [...] Fit for the Gods.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems as}} if that's what she must have meant, else why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> about her best sheets bein' in the other room? I thought the old German woman's house was mighty nice; but it wasn't a marker 'longside of this. If the princess was only here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother Anastasia is very sensible," [...] said I, [...] "and if I were to see her, I {{should be}} happy to express my {{appreciation}} of her good advice upon the subject. And, by the way, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you {{that it was necessary}} to wear that hot bonnet while you are working?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mother, {{the power}} behind the dynasty: she organises {{everyone}} else. Cheerfully tackles endless housework and mountains of cooking for the extended Giles family. People mostly tend to <b>do</b> as <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; she has {{not been}} the same since she {{poisoned}} herself. And why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not <b>tell</b> about it? But for Trefusis we should never have known." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since then, Wapner has stated, [...] "She is {{a disgrace}} to the profession. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> things I don't think a judge should <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> people to shut up. She's rude. She's arrogant. She demeans people. If <b>she</b> <b>does</b> this on purpose, then that's even worse. Judges need to observe certain {{standards}} of conduct. <b>She</b> just doesn't <b>do</b> it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves. It says judge on the nameplate {{on the bench and}} she's wearing a robe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{she tell}} you that the poor {{stranger}} was young and pretty-faced, with black moustarches? that his store clothes must have cost a fortin, saying nothing of his gold-lined, broadcloth sarrapper? Did she say that his horse was so lame that when I went to get another he wouldn't WAIT for it? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you WHO he was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know--I know," [...] {{cried the}} Count, with a troubled look, {{as he passed}} his hand across his brow. [...] "I might have {{expected}} it. She cannot sustain the misery I have brought on her. Oh! why was I prevented from freeing her from such a father. Is she very ill? Did she send for me? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you what I am?" ...|$|E
60|$|From {{her lips}} I heard {{that day the}} old, scandalous story of Monseigneur de Richelieu's early passion for Anne of Austria. With much unction <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> us how the Queen had lured His Eminence to dress himself in the motley of a jester that she might make a mock {{of him in the}} eyes of the courtiers she had {{concealed}} behind the arras of her chamber.|$|E
5000|$|Haley (Sarah Hyland) has {{an essay}} for her {{school with the}} subject [...] "Biggest {{obstacle}} you had to overcome". She finds it difficult {{to find something to}} write about and she accuses Claire for that because they made her life easy and now <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have anything to write about. Claire, after hearing Haley's accusations, tricks her and drives her {{in the middle of nowhere}} abandoning her with no money or phone to come back home. When <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> her that <b>she</b> found her obstacle.|$|R
5000|$|At the Ball, Katherine {{arrives with}} Lucy and she runs into Matt. Matt is {{surprised}} seeing [...] "Elena" [...] there since {{she told him}} that she wouldn't come. Katherine compels him again to be sure that he knows what to do with Tyler (Michael Trevino) and when she is reassured that he <b>does,</b> <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him to go. Stefan and Damon also arrive and look around to see if Katherine is there, while Jeremy and Bonnie find a room to prepare it with the spell.|$|R
50|$|Gerda is {{exhausted}} and falls asleep in a blizzard but {{an old lady}} rescues her and her animals. She doesn't know {{the way to the}} Snow Queen's palace but she gives them a way to the Laplander's home. Gerda, the raven and the reindeer manage to beet many dangerous obstacles and make it safely {{to the land of the}} Midnight Sun where the Laplander gives them a potion which flies them through the Northern Lights. But before they <b>do</b> <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> them that the Snow Queen might freeze them to death.|$|R
