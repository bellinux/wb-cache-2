5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American botanist William Chambers Coker in 1917, in his monograph of Amanitas of the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Coker's description {{was based on}} several specimens he had collected from various locations in North Carolina in September and October 1914. The specific name honors George Atkinson, a Cornell University mycologist who collected and described mushrooms in the southern and <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States in the late 19th century. In 1952, Marcel Locquin chose to place it in the genus Armillaria as Armillaria atkinsoniana, but this change was not adopted by later authors.|$|E

5|$|Frances {{then passed}} over the central {{sections}} of Florida, in the United States, three weeks after Hurricane Charley, causing significant damage to the state's citrus crop, closing major airports and schools, and forcing the cancellation of a collegiate football game. The storm then moved briefly offshore from Florida, into the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and made a second U.S. landfall, at the Florida Panhandle, before accelerating northeast through the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States near the Appalachians and into Atlantic Canada while weakening. A significant tornado outbreak accompanied the storm across the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, nearly equaling the outbreak from Hurricane Beulah. Very heavy rains fell in association with this slow-moving and relatively large hurricane, which caused floods in Florida and North Carolina. Some 49 people died from the cyclone. Damages totaled US$12billion (2004 dollars).|$|E

5|$|The 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac {{hurricane}} {{was among}} the most damaging hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states in the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. The sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed in the eastern Atlantic, where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A strong ridge over New England allowed a continued northwest course, bringing the storm south of Bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall. It did so in northeastern North Carolina on August23 with winds of about 90mph (150km/h). Soon after, the eye crossed over Norfolk, Virginia, the first time that happened since 1821. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern Virginia shortly before passing near Washington, D.C., becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. Curving northward, the storm moved through Pennsylvania and New York before losing tropical characteristics on August25. Now extratropical, the former hurricane moved across Atlantic Canada, dissipating on August28.|$|E

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native {{only to the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, congregating in colonies that often consist of fewer than 20individuals.

Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global dimming {{may also}} have regional effects.
