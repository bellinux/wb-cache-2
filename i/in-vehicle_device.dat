The development system consists of an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device,</b> capable of acquiring various engine data by LIN/CAN, a client tool and a web server for the application. The data is send from ECU through an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> which collects and process information using KWP 2000 protocol to server, thus allowing users to remotely monitoring and calibrating diesel engine from their office instead of testing from the scene...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the issue}} of {{usability}} of <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> has received growing attention. This {{is in line with}} the increase in functionality of these devices, which has been accompanied by the introduction of various new interfaces to facilitate the user–device interaction. The complexity and diversity of the driving task presents a unique challenge in defining usability: user interaction with <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> creates a ‘dual task’ scenario, in which conflicts can arise between primary and secondary driving tasks. This, and the safety-critical nature of driving, must be accounted for in defining and evaluating the usability of <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices.</b> It is evident that defining usability depends on the context of use of the device in question. The aim of this review therefore is to define usability for <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> by selecting a set of criteria to describe the various factors which contribute to usability in this specific context of use. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Location-based {{services}} {{relying on}} <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> are becoming so common {{that it is}} likely that, in the near future, devices of some sorts will be installed on new vehicles by default. The pressure for a rapid adoption of these devices and services is not yet counterbalanced by an adequate awareness about system security and data privacy issues. For example, service providers might collect, elaborate and sell data belonging to cars, drivers and locations to a plethora of organizations that {{may be interested in}} acquiring such personal information. We propose a comprehensive scenario describing the entire process of data gathering, management and transmission related to <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices,</b> and for each phase we point out the most critical security and privacy threats. By referring to this scenario, we can outline issues and challenges that should be addressed by the academic and industry communities for a correct adoption of <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> and related services...|$|R
40|$|With the {{projected}} increase in older adults, the older driver population {{is estimated to}} be the fastest growing cohort of drivers among many developed countries. The increased physical fragility associated with the aging process make older adults who drive private automobiles a vulnerable road user group. Much of the current research on older drivers’ behaviours and practices rely on self-report data. This paper explores the utility of <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> (Global Positioning Systems and recording accelerometers) in assessing older drivers’ habitual driving behaviours. Seventy-eight older drivers (above 65 years of age), from the Australian Capital Territory, Australia, participated in the current study. The driving behaviours and practices of these participants were prospectively assessed over a two-week period. The use of combined GPS and recording accelerometers to improve understanding of older drivers’ driving behaviours show promise within the current study. The challenges of using multiple <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> in assessing driving beahaviours and performances within this cohort will be discussed. Based on the current findings, recommendations for future research regarding the use of <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> among the older driver cohort are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{occlusion}} {{technique was}} originally {{used to evaluate}} the cognitive demands of the roadway. Recently, the occlusion technique {{has been used as a}} cost-effective tool for assessing the visual demand of in-vehicle devices. Occlusions simulate glances from an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> to the roadway by interrupting visual sampling. However, occluding the <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> does not impose any additional cognitive demand on the participant like true glances back to the roadway. The purpose of this study was to compare standard no-task occlusions with occlusions requiring participants to perform a visual-motor tracking task. Results suggest that overestimates of resumability may result by not including a task during occlusions. Furthermore, estimations of visual demand based on individual post-occlusion resumption times may provide a more precise measure of transition costs and resumability than measures based on Total Shutter Open Time...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a system meant for near-term deployment that directly determines the distance traveled by a vehicle and uses {{this as a}} basis for charging a fee that reflects road use. An <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> with access to the vehicle data bus and power through a single standard connector available on all passenger vehicles since 1996, electronically calculates the distance and then securely communicates relevant information to a “back office” for processing and transferring accumulated fees from the user to the appropriate government jurisdiction. Also described are means for providing payment (and receiving credit for motor fuel use taxes paid at the pump) while also ensuring compliance, enforcement, transparency and privacy. Communication is via text messaging, available wherever cellular service is accessible. No new wireless infrastructure is needed. The <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> distinguishes distance traveled by state or by other regions of interest e. g., rural vs. urban areas, using the same cellular technology that is used for communications. Aggregating distance based on rural vs. urban travel can facilitate different pricing policies for these different road users. Neither a GPS receiver nor longitude/latitude position data is necessary. However, higher resolution position sensing can be added to the core platform as needed based on policy objectives, e. g., to consider alternate pricing for specific road facilities...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{widespread}} adoption, smartphone applications (apps) could {{allow for a}} simple, low-cost assessment of driving behavior on a population scale. A number of existing apps are capable of measuring g-forces while driving, but few evaluations have been conducted to determine their accuracy. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the measurement of g-forces between two devices: a custom-built smartphone app and an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> that is currently used for research purposes (DAS). The test occurred under experimental conditions on a test track, where a vehicle, equipped with both the DAS and a smartphone with the app installed, performed a number of different acceleration events (e. g. hard-braking, sharp turning, etc.) under controlled conditions. We found that the app captured data that followed the same overall pattern of the DAS, but had a lower amplitude of measurement and a lower signal-to-noise ratio in the data. In general, the strength of the association between the app and DAS improved as the velocity of the events increased (though this was not true for all maneuvers). The correlations between the app and DAS were weaker for other maneuvers, and this may be due to delays in registering the maneuver. These findings indicate that a smartphone application did not register driving maneuvers in the same way that a dedicated <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> recorded them. Smartphones are ubiquitous and could represent a valuable driving research tool, however steps such as validation and testing are required, before they can be deployed in field trials...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} system for dynamic speed {{adaptation}} in adverse conditions, such as wet/slippery roads, decreased visibility, darkness and sharp curves. Accident risks increase drastically in such conditions, especially since drivers often do not adapt speeds to lower friction or impaired visibility. Thus, the discussion is centred around a method for calculating the appropriate highest speeds and a system to influence driver’s speed-choice in these conditions via an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device.</b> The safety effect of the proposed system is estimated {{to result in a}} 19 % - 42 % reduction of injury accidents in Sweden.

40|$|This study {{develops}} a hybrid model that can reliably estimate travel times on freeways with sparsely distributed detectors having the spacing {{of more than}} one mile. The developed model, which includes a clustered linear regression model as the main component and a supplemental enhanced trajectory-based model, can effectively capture impacts of various geometric features, such as ramps and merging lanes, and different traffic patterns on the variability of travel times. The experimental results based on a field demonstration on a 25 mile stretch of I- 70 eastbound with 10 detectors have demonstrated the promising properties of the developed model under various congestion levels. INTRODUTION As is well recognized, travel times are essential information for traffic controls, operations, transportation planning, and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Several measurement methods have been used in practice to estimate travel times, including probe vehicles, vehicle identification with <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., electronic toll tags), and vehicle identification without <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., video-based vehicle identification and licens...|$|R

Lab tests, if validated, canevaluate prototype designs faster, more economically, and earlier than on-roadtests. The Static Load Test was evaluated {{for its ability}} to predict on-road driverperformance while using <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>devices.</b> In this test, participants performvarious in-vehicle tasks in a lab while viewing a videotaped road scene on amonitor, tapping a brake pedal when a central or peripheral light is observed. Forthe on-road comparison test, the device, tasks, and lights are the same, but theparticipants also drive the vehicle while performing the tasks and responding tothe lights.

40|$|This {{research}} {{adopted a}} model of goal activation to study the mechanisms underlying interrupted task performance. The effects of interruption timing, type of interruption, and age on task time and primary task resumption time were explored under conditions in which attention was switched {{back and forth between}} two tasks, much as when drivers shift attention between attending to the road and to an in-vehicle task. The timing of interruptions {{had a significant impact on}} task resumption times, indicating that the most costly time to interrupt task performance is during the middle of a task. However, this effect was overshadowed by age-related performance decrements for older participants. Interruptions that prevented strategic rehearsal of goals resulted in longer resumption times as compared with interruptions that allowed rehearsal.

30|$|The PV {{data were}} {{collected}} by in-vehicle devices which were equipped in each experimental car, separately. After starting the device, data were constantly sent from the moving car to the nearby base stations or receiving nodes. There are 78 channels which record the types of number, string, date, etc. Some of the data describe the road positions or environments, such as GPS (latitude, longitude, altitude, etc.) and road ID. Other data present vehicle’s moving information, such as fuel consumption (0.1  km/L), running speed (km/h), and engine speed (rpm). Data are eliminated, while engine is off or GPS data are invalid (e.g., driving in tunnel, on mountain road, or underneath the viaduct). It {{should be noted that}} once GPS signal is missed (e.g., after entering tunnel), localization estimation algorithm (LEA) embedded in the <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> will be operated automatically. Based on this algorithm, the vehicle is assumed in the extension line of the last-recorded direction at a constant speed which maintains the last-recorded speed. Considering the low credibility, the estimated records are also deleted in this study.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{emerging}} software applications for nomadic devices are useful in the car as well. In order to use these applications safely in the car, {{it is necessary to}} couple them with the vehicle’s infotainment system and its user interface which is optimized for use by the driver. This paper describes a new approach to exchange services and user interfaces between cars and nomadic devices. Services are exchanged through dynamically generated Web Services.

40|$|In some {{previous}} simulator studies, {{we showed}} that drivers, engaged in a secondary in-vehicle task at different display separations, were able to buffer {{some aspects of the}} driving task (e. g., vehicle control), but not others (e. g., hazard response; Horrey & Wickens, 2002, Horrey, Alexander, & Wickens, 2003). We speculate that this pattern of results may be a result of effective time-sharing between the ambient visual task of vehicle control and the focal visual in-vehicle task, but task interference between the in-vehicle task and the focal task of hazard detection and identification. Alternatively, drivers may be using an optimal scanning strategy that allows them to effectively monitor both the roadway and the <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device.</b> In this paper, we detail some of the theoretical background, describe some relevant research, and present a model of scanning behavior.

This is particularly a concern on monotonous roads, where a driver’s attention can decrease rapidly. While effective countermeasures do not currently exist, the development of in-vehicle sensors opens avenues for monitoring driving behavior in real-time. The aim {{of this study is to}} predict drivers’ level of alertness through surrogate measures collected from in-vehicle sensors. Electroencephalographic activity is used as a reference to evaluate alertness. Based on a sample of 25 drivers, data was collected in a driving simulator instrumented with an eye tracking system, a heart rate monitor and an electrodermal activity device. Various classification models were tested from linear regressions to Bayesians and data mining techniques. Results indicated that Neural Networks were the most efficient model in detecting lapses in alertness. Findings also show that reduced alertness can be predicted up to 5 minutes in advance with 90 % accuracy, using surrogate measures such as time to line crossing, blink frequency and skin conductance level. Such a method could be used to warn drivers of their alertness level through the development of an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>device</b> monitoring, in real-time, drivers' behavior on highways...|$|E
