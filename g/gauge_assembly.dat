40|$|There {{are three}} obvious {{advantages}} obtained by detecting the Korotkoff sounds {{from within the}} cuff. For example, since the piezoelectric element is {{in direct contact with}} the bladder surface, it has a large receiving area for sound. Since the element is within the cuff, the bladder surface is smooth and no net force is applied to the piezoelectric element. Finally, since the piezoelectric ele-ment is completely surrounded by the cuff, it is acoustically shielded from the environment. Therefore, when the piezoelectric element is connected to an amplifier and loudspeaker, high inten-sity sounds can be obtained without the presence of acoustic feedback. In summary, with a standard 3 l/g ” x 4, ’ lantern-slide projector in which the slide carrier is replaced by the <b>gauge</b> <b>assembly,</b> a large screen display is available for cuff pressure. With a standard blood-pressure cuff containing a piezoelectric element applied to the arm with the element over the brachial artery, high intensity Korotkoff sounds can be heard by a class of 200 or more.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} a series of investigations examining the operational performance followed by the fundamental re-development of two analytical instruments, namely a Pneumatic Spring Particle Sizer (PSPS) and handheld Spring Particle Sizer (handheld SPS) for size distribution analysis of dry powders in the 100 – 2000 μm size range. Each instrument shares the same basic principle of operation involving the use of a closed coil helical extension spring, which is partly filled with the test powder. Particle size distribution data is obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring the mass of the discharged particles from the spring’s coils. In the case of the Handheld SPS, aimed at on the spot quality control applications, the test particles are discharged from the spring using manual shaking. In the case of the PSPS on the other hand, the particles are discharged using pulsating pressurised air. The design, development and evaluation of two methods for the in-situ measurement of the sample mass within the PSPS are discussed. These include a full-bridge strain <b>gauge</b> <b>assembly</b> and the investigation of the correlation between the minimum fluidisation velocity and the mass of the test sample within the spring. The strain gauge proved to be a successful method producing a mass resolution of ± 1...|$|E

40|$|High {{efficiency}} and long-term life of hydraulic turbines and their assemblies are {{of utmost importance}} for the hydropower industry. Usually, hydroelectric turbine components are made of thick-walled low carbon martensitic stainless steels. The assembly of large hydroelectric turbine components {{has been a great}} challenge. The use of conventional welding processes involves typical large groove design and multi-pass welding to fill the groove which exposes the weld to a high heat input creating relatively large fusion zone and heat affected zone. The newly-developed hybrid/tandem laser-arc welding technique is believed to offer a highly competitive solution to improve the overall hydro-turbine performance by combining the high energy density and fast welding speed of the laser welding technology with the good gap bridging and feeding ability of the gas metal arc welding process to increase the productivity and reduce the consumable material. The main objective of this research work is to understand different challenges appearing during hybrid laser-arc welding (HLAW) of thick <b>gauge</b> <b>assemblies</b> of low carbon 13...|$|R
40|$|Medical jet injection, {{in which}} a narrow fluid drug stream is {{propelled}} into the skin without a needle, was first conceived in the 1940 s [1]. However, a major drawback of most injectors {{is the lack of}} controllability of jet parameters. Recent work at the BioInstrumentation Laboratory at MIT has resulted in a tunable, high-performance linear Lorentz-force jet injector which allows for careful control of many injection variables. The sensor presented in this thesis further improves the ability to quantify and control contact forces between the injection nozzle and tissue. This sensor uses a three-spoke flexure system with full-bridge strain <b>gauge</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted on each flexural arm to measure both normal and lateral forces applied to the nozzle. The design, fabrication, calibration, and validation for the sensor are detailed along with results for preliminary tissue injections into ex vivo porcine tissue. These preliminary tests showed higher percent volume delivery to the tissue with an elevated normal force. Under normal forces of 4 to 8 N, the BioInstrumentation Lab's jet injector achieved percent volume delivery of 89. 1 ± 5. 1 %, whereas with normal forces of 0 to 4 N, the percent volume delivery was 68. 9 ± 12. 7 %. by Nickolas Peter Demas.

40|$|The {{menopause}} {{is associated}} with a deficiency of reproductive hormones, and accompanied by a significant loss of bone mass. This bone loss is accelerated within the first five years post-menopause. Muscle strength at this time would have important clinical implications for correcting imbalance and preventing falls. The aim of the studies within this thesis were to 1) determine the rate and time course of force loss of the quadriceps muscle group over 12 months in three groups of women with varying hormonal status 2) establish the role of oestrogen in this weakness and 3) investigate the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in maintaining muscle function. The reliability of an isokinetic dynamometer and a strain <b>gauge</b> <b>assembly</b> was examined initially to determine the inherent variability of muscle function assessment. Strength of the knee extensors measured on the isokinetic dynamometer was deemed reliable in middle-aged women, although at 1. 05 rad/s more practice trials were needed to attain peak torque. Measurements of the knee flexors were highly variable. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions were repeatable using the strain gauge system, for both the knee extensors and first dorsal interosseus (FOI) muscle. There was greater variability in force production generated from electrically stimulated contractions. Maximal strength of the knee extensors declined by 9. 3 - 4. 6 and I 0. 3 ? 3. 1 % (mean?SE) for dynamic (1. 05 radls) and isometric strength respectively over 9 months in hypoestrogenic post-menopausal women. There were no changes at higher angular velocities, or for handgrip strength. These results support the role of reproductive hormones in influencing force production, which is further endorsed by the observation that females on HRT did not experience a reduction in strength over this time. The force loss was significant only when the post-menopausal and HRT group were compared (p O. OS). The difficulty in isolating oestrogen during the menstrual cycle does not render this a good model to assess its effects upon force production. Maximal strength and fatiguability of the FDI were examined in young women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment when acute, massive changes in oestrogen are induced. There were no differences in muscle function of the FDI when assessed under very low or high oestrogen changes (p>O. 05). The independent effects of oestrogen upon muscle function were not demonstrated here. Hormone replacement therapy is the most efficacious treatment for preventing menopausally-related bone loss. The results from the longitudinal study suggest that HRT confers protection against muscle weakness as a consequence of ovarian failure. Whether HRT maintains or restores strength was examined in the FDI of post-menopausal women (n= 9). The oestrogen only and oestrogen-progestogen phases were compared with baseline measurements. A positive change in strength was observed, although this did not reach significance (p<O. 1). The increase in strength (15. 2 ? 20. 6 %) between baseline and the oestrogen-progestogen phase of HRT corroborates the involvement of progesterone in determining muscle function. The findings suggest that the menopause {{is associated with}} a loss of strength, prevented by the administration of HRT. Oestrogen alone does not influence force production, although progesterone is implicated. This has important ramifications in hysterectomised women who are prescribed preparations containing oestrogen only...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the fabrication, assembly, and test of the Nb{sub 3 }Sn dipole magnet HD 2. The magnet, aimed at demonstrating the {{application}} of Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconductor in high field accelerator-type dipoles, features a 36 mm clear bore surrounded by block-type coils with tilted ends. The coil design is optimized to minimize geometric harmonics in the aperture and the magnetic peak field on the conductor in the coil ends. The target bore field of 15 T at 4. 3 K is consistent with critical current measurements of extracted strands. The coils are horizontally pre-stressed during assembly using an external aluminum shell pre-tensioned with water-pressurized bladders. Axial pre-loading of the coil ends is accomplished through two end plates and four aluminum tension rods. The strain in coil, shell, and rods is monitored with strain <b>gauges</b> during <b>assembly,</b> cool-down and magnet excitation, and compared with 3 D finite element computations.

In conventional type of filters when strainer gets clogged we have to manually clean it which takes time amp filtration processes stops during cleaning process.

In this study, the sensing measurement was performed at 573 K. The base pressure of the vacuum chamber, which was connected to a turbomolecular pump, was typically ~ 5 × 10 − 6 torr. Using mass flow controllers, O 2 and NO 2 environments were monitored.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in the use of electronic portfolios in higher education over the last five years, relatively {{little is known about the}} potential of such tools to support the development of higher order abilities for students, such as reflection, in a structured way that is suitable for assessment. This paper reports the findings from a small-scale research which sets out to compare the outcomes of reflective assignments in two cohorts of participants in a Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Practice in Higher Education in the UK. Participants in the programme were asked to submit reflective accounts using an e-portfolio system as part of their formal assessment. One cohort completed the assessment using some generic guidelines of how to reflect and construct an e-portfolio page without a given template or structure, whereas another cohort was given a specific template with clear assessment criteria to <b>gauge</b> the <b>assembly</b> of their reflections. The authors, who are also tutors in the programme, analysed the submitted reflections following open coding procedures. The analysis found a tendency for the reflection in the first cohort to be merely descriptive without progressing to speculating objectively about answers to relevant analytical questions about the process involved in the ability under scrutiny. In contrast the assignments of cohort two were found to be more insightful in terms of assimilating random bits of materials, thoughts and self-questions into complete reflective accounts. These findings bring some evidence to support and indeed promote a more structured approach to reflective practice, which can be further enhanced through a carefully created e-portfolio template and associated assessment criteria. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the CX- 100 blade manufacturing project. It presents the tooling design and manufacturing, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and adapter plate design and fabrication. The CX- 100 blade {{was designed to}} demonstrate the efficient use of carbon fiber in the spar cap of a wind turbine blade. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. ERS- 100 master plugs – for both the high pressure and low pressure skins – were modified to create plugs for the CX- 100. Using the new CX- 100 master skin plugs, high pressure and low pressure molds were fabricated. Similar modifications were also completed on the shear web plug/mold, the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture. Once all of the tooling modifications were complete, a production run of seven CX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain <b>gauges</b> before final <b>assembly.</b> After production at the TPI facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the NWTC at NREL, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory and three blades to the USDA-ARS turbine field test facility located in Bushland...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the variation in removal torque of implant prosthetic abutment screws after successive tightening and loosening cycles, in addition to evaluating the influence of the hexagon at the abutment base on screw removal torque. Material and methods: Twenty hexagonal abutments were tightened to 20 regular external hex implants with a titanium alloy screw, with an insertion torque of 32 N cm, measured with a digital torque <b>gauge.</b> The implant/abutment/screw <b>assemblies</b> were divided into two groups: (1) abutments without hexagon at the base and (2) abutments with a hexagon at the base. Each assembly received a provisional restoration and was submitted to mechanical loading cycles. After this, the screws were removed and the removal torque was measured. This sequence was repeated 10 times, then the screw was replaced by a new one, and another cycle was performed. Linear regression analysis was performed. Results: Removal torque values tended to decrease as the number of insertion/removal cycles increased, for both groups. Comparisons of the slopes and the intercepts between groups showed no statistical difference. There was no significant difference between the mean values of last five cycles and the 11 th cycle. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it was concluded that (1) repeated insertion/removal cycles promoted gradual reduction in removal torque of screws, (2) replacing the screw with a new one after 10 cycles did not increase resistance to loosening, and (3) removal of the hexagon from the abutment base had no effect on the removal torque of the screws...|$|R
40|$|In {{just the}} last decade, a {{multitude}} of bio-technologies and software pipelines have emerged to revolutionize genomics. To further their central goal, they aim to accelerate and {{improve the quality of}} de novo whole-genome assembly starting from short DNA reads. However, the performance of each of these tools is contingent on the length and quality of the sequencing data, the structure and complexity of the genome sequence, and the resolution and quality of long-range information. Furthermore, {{in the absence of any}} metric that captures the most fundamental "features" of a high-quality assembly, there is no obvious recipe for users to select the most desirable assembler/assembly. International competitions such as Assemblathons or GAGE tried to identify the best assembler(s) and their features. Some what circuitously, the only available approach to <b>gauge</b> de novo <b>assemblies</b> and assemblers relies solely on the availability of a high-quality fully assembled reference genome sequence. Still worse, reference-guided evaluations are often both difficult to analyze, leading to conclusions that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we circumvent many of these issues by relying upon a tool, dubbed FRCbam, which is capable of evaluating de novo assemblies from the read-layouts even when no reference exists. We extend the FRCurve approach to cases where lay-out information may have been obscured, as is true in many deBruijn-graph-based algorithms. As a by-product, FRCurve now expands its applicability to a much wider class of assemblers [...] thus, identifying higher-quality members of this group, their inter-relations as well as sensitivity to carefully selected features, with or without the support of a reference sequence or layout for the reads. The paper concludes by reevaluating several recently conducted assembly competitions and the datasets that have resulted from them. Comment: Submitted to PLoS One.

40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the TX- 100 blade manufacturing {{portion of the}} Carbon-Hybrid Blade Developments: Standard and Twist-Coupled Prototype project. The TX- 100 blade is a 9 meter prototype blade designed with bend-twist coupling to augment the mitigation of peak loads during normal turbine operation. This structural coupling was achieved by locating off axis carbon fiber in the outboard portion of the blade skins. The report will present the tooling selection, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and adapter plate design and fabrication. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. The molds used {{for the production of}} the TX- 100 were originally built for the production of the CX- 100 blade. The same high pressure and low pressure skin molds were used to manufacture the TX- 100 skins. In order to compensate for the difference in skin thickness between the CX- 100 and the TX- 100, however, a new TX- 100 shear web plug and mold were required. Both the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture used for the CX- 100 blades could be utilized for the TX- 100 blades. A production run of seven TX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken at TPI Composites during the month of October, 2004. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain <b>gauges</b> before final <b>assembly.</b> After production at the TPI Composites facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and three blades to the United States Department of Agriculture turbine field test facility in Bushland, Texas. An adapter plate was designed to allow the TX- 100 blades to be installed on existing Micon 65 / 13 M turbines at the USDA site.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of tyreroad contact forces {{is the first}} step towards the development of new control systems for improving vehicle safety and performances. Tyreroad contact forces measurement systems are very expensive and significantly modify the unsprung masses of the vehicle as well as the rotational inertia of the tyres. Thus, vehicle dynamics results are significantly affected. As a consequence, the measured contact forces do not correspond to the contact forces under real working conditions. A new low-cost tyreroad contact forces measurement system is proposed in this paper that can be applied to passenger cars. Its working principle is based on the {{measurement of}} three deformations of the wheel rim through strain <b>gauges.</b> The tyrerim <b>assembly</b> is thus turned into a sensor for tyreroad contact forces. The influence of the strain gauges position onto the measurement results has been assessed through finite element simulations and experimental tests. It has been proven that, for a large variety of rims, the strain gauge position that leads to high signal-to-noise ratios is almost the same. A dynamic calibration procedure has been developed in order to allow the reconstruction of contact force and torque components once per wheel turn. The capability of the developed device to correctly estimate tyreroad contact forces has been assessed, in a first stage, through indoor laboratory experimental test on an MTS Flat-Trac ® testing machine. Results show that the implemented measuring system allows to reconstruct contact forces once per wheel turn with a precision that is comparable to that of existing high-cost measurement systems. Subsequently, outdoor tests with a vehicle having all four wheels equipped with the developed measuring device have also been performed. Reliability of the measurements provided by the developed sensor has been assessed by comparing the global measured longitudinal/lateral forces and the product of the measured longitudinal/lateral accelerations times the vehicle mass. A good agreement has been found during all the performed manoeuvres...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} are a promising alternative energy source, {{capable of being}} deployed as successful replacements in many stationary and mobile applications. These devices, however, lack durability, and this {{has become one of}} the limiting factors for commercialization. Many projects have focused on finding ways to improve their lifetimes, but few have tried to examine the underlying causes behind their corrosion. The goal of this project was to identify which parameters have a significant impact, both positive and negative, on PEMFC durability. To do this, three series of samples were analyzed using microscopic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical methods. Electron microscope images provided information on the sample morphology and structural composition. Scanning electron microscopy provided information on the samples surface morphology, including roughness and porosity; transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the thickness and continuity of graphite sheet in the samples, and scanning transmission electron microscopy provided information on particle size distribution. Spectroscopic techniques interrogated the surface and bulk of the samples to provide information on their chemical composition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the surface chemistry of the samples, while electron energy loss spectroscopy was used to quantify the relative graphite content in the bulk. The electrochemical methods used determined how the samples reacted to differing operating conditions, and were used to accelerate the aging process. Rotating disk electrodes were employed to study the catalytic performance of the samples in an ideal setting, while membrane electrode <b>assemblies</b> <b>gauged</b> how well the samples performed in a more realistic application. By comparing the structural and chemical composition throughout a sample’s lifetime, correlations relating performance changes to changes in its physical structure were identified. Multivariate analysis provided a means of comparing highly different data sets, and identifying similar patterns between them. Based on the data, we have found that higher surface area cathode catalysts suffer greater performance losses over their lifetime due in large part to changes in their porosity. Higher surface area carbons are also characterized by discontinuous graphite structures, making them more susceptible to oxidation than lower surface area carbon supports. It was also found that samples with higher microporosity (nanometers) were more stable than samples with high mesoporosity (5 - 20 µm), but that porosity increases due to the aging process. The total graphite content was also found to be less important that the surface graphite content. It was determined that the speciation of platinum in the samples had an effect on the durability, and samples with high PtO and Pt-C content at the beginning of life were more stable than those with mostly Pt metal. Furthermore, it was found that samples that experienced the largest losses in performance were associated with the largest increase in Pt metal speciation, and PtO and Pt-C content was reduced overall. Finally, it was determined that it is difficult to directly compare results for durability testing performed using a rotating disk electrode to those obtained using a membrane electrode assembly. In order to increase the predictive capability of RDE experiments, future work will need to investigate altering many of the experimental conditions, such as the electrolyte and ionomer content.
