25|$|Anders briefly {{served as}} {{a fellow of the}} American Enterprise Institute, then joined General Electric in September 1977. As Vice President and General Manager of GE's Nuclear Products Division in San Jose, California, he was {{responsible}} for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, reactor internal equipment, and control and instrumentation for GE boiling-water reactors at facilities located in San Jose and Wilmington, North Carolina. He also oversaw GE's partnership with Chicago Bridge and Iron for making large steel pressure vessels in Memphis, Tennessee. In August 1979, Anders began attending Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. On the first day of 1980, Anders was appointed General Manager of the GE Aircraft Equipment Division. Headquartered in Utica, New York, the division included more than 8,500 employees in five locations in the northeastern U.S. Its products included aircraft flight and weapon control systems, cockpit instruments, aircraft electrical generating systems, airborne radars and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>systems,</b> electronic countermeasures, space command systems, and aircraft/surface multi-barrel armament systems.|$|E

2500|$|Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 â€“ November 17, 1929) was an American {{inventor}} {{who developed}} an electromechanical punched card tabulator {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. He was {{the founder of the}} Tabulating Machine Company that was [...] amalgamated (via stock acquisition) in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company later renamed IBM. Hollerith is {{regarded as one of the}} seminal figures in the development of data processing.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, [...] "intelligent" [...] {{television}} receivers {{were introduced in}} Japan. The addition of an LSI chip with memory and a character generator to a television receiver enabled Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast television signal. A patent was published in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an [...] "intelligent" [...] television system, linked with <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>systems,</b> {{by means of a}} digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. The mass acceptance of digital television in late 2000s and early 2010s greatly improved smart TVs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for their middle-end to high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs are expected to become the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. At the beginning of 2016, Nielsen reported that 29 percent of those with incomes over $75,000 a year had a smart TV.|$|E
