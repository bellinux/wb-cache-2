Firstly, sugar signatures were assessed from the monosaccharide composition. As results were not conclusive, a statistical approach using discriminant analysis {{was applied to the}} sugar data set in order to predict the origin of the <b>foulant</b> material. Three groups of various origins (algal, microbial, continental dissolved organic matter) were used as sugar references for the prediction. The results of the computation showed that the origin of reverse osmosis (RO) seawater <b>foulant</b> material is influenced by both the location of the water sources and the season.

The ability to predict the impact of <b>foulant</b> accumulation on basin percolation facilitates evaluation of the potential effectiveness of cleaning strategies or water pretreatment schemes in improving percolation efficiency. In this study, both laboratory and field data were used to develop a relatively simple mathematical model capable of describing basin percolation kinetics. This model suggests that initial percolation rate, <b>foulant</b> loading and the interaction between <b>foulant</b> and sediment {{at or near the}} sediment/water interface can describe the decay of percolation over time. Simulating performance of a recharge basin indicates that the interaction of <b>foulant</b> with sediment and reduction of overall <b>foulant</b> loading is perhaps the most effective method of improving recharge basin efficiency...|$|R

Deposit removal is either through deposit dissolution, particle re-entrainment, or deposit spalling, erosive wear, or exfoliation.

50|$|Composite fouling is common. This type of fouling {{involves}} more than one foulant or more than one fouling mechanism working simultaneously. The multiple <b>foulants</b> or mechanisms may {{interact with each other}} resulting in a synergistic fouling which is not a simple arithmetic sum of the individual components.|$|E
50|$|When {{designing}} a cleaning protocol {{it is essential}} to consider:Cleaning time - Adequate time must be allowed for chemicals to interact with <b>foulants</b> and permeate into the membrane pores. However if the process is extended beyond its optimum duration it can lead to denaturation of the membrane and deposition of removed <b>foulants.</b> The complete cleaning cycle including rinses between stages may take as long as 2 hours to complete.Aggressiveness of chemical treatment - With a high degree of fouling {{it may be necessary to}} employ aggressive cleaning solutions to remove fouling material. However in some applications this may not be suitable if the membrane material is sensitive, leading to enhanced membrane ageing. Disposal of cleaning effluent - The release of some chemicals into wastewater systems may be prohibited or regulated therefore this must be considered. For example the use of phosphoric acid may result in high levels of phosphates entering water ways and must be monitored and controlled to prevent eutrophication.|$|E
50|$|The {{control of}} fouling, as {{previously}} mentioned, is primarily undertaken using coarse bubble aeration. The distribution of bubbles around the membranes, the shear at the membrane surface for cake removal {{and the size}} of the bubble are greatly influenced by the mixing/hydrodynamics of the system.

40|$|In this study, {{a method}} of in situ {{membrane}} fouling quantification is developed that enables comparisons of <b>foulant</b> accumulation between desalination processes with different membranes, driving forces, and feed solutions. Unlike the conventional metric of flux decline, which measures the response of a process to fouling, the proposed method quantifies the <b>foulant</b> accumulation. <b>Foulant</b> accumulation is parameterized by two variables, cake structural parameter and hydraulic diameter, that are calculated from flux measurements using a model for salt and water transport through fouled reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) membranes, including dispersive mass transfer in the FO membrane support layer. Model results show that pressure declines through the <b>foulant</b> layer and can, in FO, reach negative absolute values at the membrane. Experimental alginate gel fouling rates are measured within a range of feed ionic compositions where cake hydraulic resistance is negligible. Using both flux decline and cake structural parameter as metrics, the effect of feed salinity on RO fouling is tested and RO is compared to FO. When RO is fouled with alginate, feed salinity and membrane permeability affect flux decline but not <b>foulant</b> accumulation rate. Between FO and RO, the initial rates of <b>foulant</b> accumulation are similar; however, FO exhibits slower flux decline, which causes greater <b>foulant</b> accumulation over time. The new methodology enables meaningful quantification and comparison of fouling rates {{with the aim of}} improving fundamental understanding of fouling processes.

In this case study, we report application of different techniques to extract <b>foulant</b> from the hollow fibre membrane and characterize the <b>foulant</b> into various components of organic, inorganic and different fractions. The organic <b>foulant</b> was subjected to high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF) analysis to study the influence of ionic strength on its elution behaviour using NaCl and CaCl(2) as carrier solutions. It was observed that an increase in ionic strength delayed the elution time of both the organic <b>foulant</b> and the Na-salt of Polysterene sulphone (PSS) with HPSEC. However, no such effect was observed with FIFFF analysis.

For example, fouling layers reduce heat transfer efficiency of a heat exchanger. As the fouling layers are considered as waste, {{this research aimed}} at extracting coconut oil from the <b>foulants</b> to produce a product from the waste. A model coconut milk foulant was used to simulate <b>foulants</b> formed during batch pasteurization process and coconut oil was extracted from the foulant using celloulase enzyme. The extracted oil then was evaluated in terms of fatty acid composition and antioxidant properties (total phenolic and flavonoid contents). The antioxidant activities were evaluated using DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging and FRAP (Ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods. Results showed that the oil extracted from the <b>foulants</b> appeared similar to virgin coconut oil (VCO); the extracted oil appeared as clear viscous liquid with aroma associated with roasted coconut. The oil extracted using enzyme contained all fatty acids found in VCO in lower proportions but large extent of linoleic acid was found. Antioxidant capacity {{was similar to that}} of VCO.

The negative peaks near 1060  cm− 1 are due to over-subtraction of carbohydrate group.

The addition of an acid is not recommended as {{it can lead to}} corrosion of the membrane. It is also known that organic fouling is usually accelerated with decrease in pH and increase in divalent cation concentration. In low pH and high divalent cation concentration, charge property of organic matters diminishes through the neutralization of functional groups as well as organic-calcium complexation. Moreover, it has been found that increasing pH of feed water is not as helpful as initially presumed. Feed water pH affects both the charge properties of bulk organic <b>foulants</b> as well as the interfacial interaction between organic <b>foulants</b> and membrane surfaces. The former leads to the formation of thick and dense fouling layers on the membrane surface due to the favorable multi-layer accumulation of organic <b>foulants.</b> The latter results in the reduction of electrostatic repulsion between organic <b>foulants</b> and membrane surfaces leading to accelerated accumulation of the <b>foulants</b> on the membrane surface (Al-Juboori and Yusaf 2012).|$|E

A nanofiltration (NF 270) membrane and a reverse osmosis (BW 30) membrane were used in this investigation. Four typical membrane fouling conditions were simulated under controlled laboratory conditions in a cross-flow membrane system using four model <b>foulants</b> including humic acid, sodium alginate, colloidal silica and CaSO 4. Amongst these model <b>foulants,</b> humic acid was found to increase boron rejection whereas the other <b>foulants</b> led to a decrease in boron rejection.

Results reported in this study also indicate that the extent of flux decline caused by different model <b>foulants</b> differed substantially from one another. The impact of membrane fouling on permeate flux decline was found to be dependent on the initial permeate flux and hydrophobicity of the foulant.

40|$|High {{pressure}} is often {{considered to be}} the cause of the high fouling propensity of reverse osmosis (RO) relative to forward osmosis (FO). Several experimental studies have shown that alginate fouling is more susceptible to cleaning in FO than in RO, but the theory that <b>foulant</b> compaction causes this disparity seems to be contradicted by the incompressibility of alginate hydrogels. In addition, the effect of hydraulic pressure on fouling in osmotic membrane desalination has never been experimentally isolated, because fixed-flux comparisons at different hydraulic pressures require different draw solution osmotic pressures. In this study, a new approach to isolating the effect of hydraulic pressure on alginate fouling and cleaning is introduced: operating FO with elevated but equal feed and draw hydraulic pressures. The same concentration of sodium chloride is used as the draw solution in all trials to eliminate possible effects of draw solution osmotic pressure on membrane fouling or cleaning. Theoretical modeling of the effect of alginate <b>foulant</b> compaction on flux reveals that <b>foulant</b> compaction should accelerate flux decline with low salinity feeds but retard flux decline at high salinity. However, in low-salinity alginate fouling trials, for which <b>foulant</b> compaction should accelerate flux decline, the measured flux decline rate was not affected by hydraulic pressure. Furthermore, when fouled membranes were cleaned by increasing the feed velocity and reducing the draw osmotic pressure, there was no apparent relationship between hydraulic pressure and cleaning effectiveness. Finally, in situ visualization of <b>foulant</b> removal during the cleaning process revealed no difference in <b>foulant</b> removal mechanisms between different hydraulic pressures. These findings demonstrate that alginate gel compaction by high feed hydraulic pressure does not occur and suggest that other explanations should be sought for FO's high fouling resistance relative to RO.

Three model organic <b>foulants</b> (bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, and humic acid) were selected and studied in depth. The rejections of mono- and di-anions by virgin membrane varied with different organic <b>foulants</b> because of foulant-enhanced co-ion competition. Subsequent multi-ions separations by fouled membranes were different due to the zeta potential and structure of the fouling cake. In contrast to the single protein system, Cl- and rejection was reduced by HA fouled membrane. However, with added proteins in the HA solution, mixed systems experienced decreasing Cl- rejection and increasing rejection. In addition, solution chemistry (solution pH, ionic strength, and Ca 2 +) had marked effect on the cake layer composition, likely due to the changing interaction between foulant and foulant, as well as between foulant and NF membrane.
