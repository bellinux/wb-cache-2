50|$|The Eurasian {{crag martin}} is 13 - 15 cm long with a 32 - 34.5 cm wingspan, and weighs an average 23 g. It has ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, {{and has a}} broader body, wings and tail than any other <b>European</b> <b>swallow.</b> The tail is short and square, with white patches near the tips of all but the central and {{outermost}} pairs of feathers. The underwing and undertail coverts are blackish, the eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are alike, but juveniles have buff-brown tips to the plumage of the head, upperparts and wing coverts. This species can be distinguished from the sand martin by its larger size, the white patches on the tail, and its lack of a brown breast band. Where the range overlaps with that of another Ptyonoprogne species, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, a male {{rock dove}} was {{observed}} copulating with {{the corpse of}} a dove that had shortly before had its head crushed by a car. In 2001, a researcher laid out sand martin corpses to attract flocks of other sand martins. In each of six trials, 1-5 individuals from flocks of 50-500 were observed attempting to copulate with the dead sand martins. This occurred one to {{two months after the}} breeding season; since copulation outside the breeding season is uncommon among birds, the researcher speculated that the lack of resistance by the corpses stimulated the behavior. Charles Brown observed at least ten cliff swallows attempt to copulate with a road-killed cliff swallow in the space of 15 minutes. He commented, [...] "This isn't the first time I've seen cliff swallows do this; the bright orange rump sticking up seems to be all the stimulus these birds need." [...] Necrophilia has also been reported in the <b>European</b> <b>swallow,</b> grey-backed sparrow-lark, Stark's lark, and the snow goose.

40|$|The rate of moult of <b>European</b> <b>Swallows</b> {{spending}} the non-breeding season in Botswana was studied during December-January of 1992 / 93, 1993 / 94 and 1994 / 95 {{to investigate the}} effects of variability in rainfall and roosting habitat availability. In January 1994, 2 - 3 million <b>European</b> <b>Swallows</b> were counted at a traditional roost along the Boteti River. The rate of moult was relatively slow, about one feather (primary, secondary or tail feather) was replaced every two weeks in both adults and juveniles. The speed of moult in juveniles was generally lower than in adults, in particular of secondaries and tail feathers. Moulting rate of both primaries and tail feathers was lowest in 1994 / 95 {{during a period of}} drought and coincided with the almost complete destruction of roosting habitat. In 1992 / 93, moulting rate was highest when rainfall was moderate and roosting habitat abundant. Moulting rate was intermediate in 1993 / 94 when rainfall was frequent but roosting habitat reduced because of the low water level in the Boteti River. The combined effect of reduced food availability during droughts and higher densities and longer foraging flights when roosting habitat is scarce might explain the annual variation in moulting rate. From the second week of January onwards many adults started moulting the outermost tail feather before the penultimate feathers. This phenomenon could indicate the importance of long tail streamers in aerial manoeuvring when foraging during the return migration to the breeding grounds...|$|R

50|$|While feeding in mudflats {{during the}} winter and {{migration}} red knots are tactile feeders, probing for unseen prey in the mud. Their feeding techniques {{include the use of}} shallow probes into the mud while pacing along the shore. When the tide is ebbing, they tend to peck at the surface and in soft mud they may probe and plough forward with the bill inserted to about 1 cm in depth. The bivalved mollusc Macoma is their preferred prey on <b>European</b> coasts, <b>swallowing</b> them whole and breaking them up in their gizzard. In Delaware Bay, they feed in large numbers on the eggs of horseshoe crabs which spawn just as the birds arrive in mid-summer. They are able to detect molluscs buried under wet sand from changes in the pressure of water that they sense using Herbst corpuscles in their bill. Unlike many tactile feeders their visual field is not panoramic (allowing for an almost 360 degree field of view), as during the short breeding season they switch to being visual hunters of mobile, unconcealed prey, which are obtained by pecking. Pecking is also used to obtain some surface foods in the wintering and migratory feeding grounds, such as the eggs of horseshoe crabs.|$|R
40|$|Parasites exert a {{major impact}} on the eco-evolutionary {{dynamics}} of their hosts and the associated biotic environment. Migration constitutes an effective means for long-distance invasions of vector-borne parasites and promotes their rapid spread. Yet, ecological and spatial information on population-specific host–parasite connectivity is essentially lacking. Here, we address this question in a system consisting of a transcontinental migrant species, the <b>European</b> barn <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo rustica) which serves as a vector for avian endoparasites in the genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon. Using feather stable isotope ratios as geographically informative markers, we first assessed migratory connectivity in the host: Northern European breeding populations predominantly overwintered in dry, savannah-like habitats in Southern Africa, whereas Southern European populations were associated with wetland habitats in Western Central Africa. Wintering areas of swallows breeding in Central Europe indicated a migratory divide with both migratory programmes occurring within the same breeding population. Subsequent genetic screens of parasites in the breeding populations revealed a link between the host’s migratory programme and its parasitic repertoire: controlling for effects of local breeding location, prevalence of Africa-transmitted Plasmodium lineages was significantly higher in individuals overwintering in the moist habitats of Western Central Africa, even among sympatrically breeding individuals with different overwintering locations. For the rarer Haemoproteus parasites, prevalence was best explained by breeding location alone, whereas no clear pattern emerged for the least abundant parasite Leucocytozoon. These results have implications for our understanding of spatio-temporal host–parasite dynamics in migratory species and the spread of avian borne diseases...|$|R
40|$|Transcontinental {{migration}} {{is a fascinating}} example of how animals can respond to climatic oscillation. Yet, quantitative data on fitness components are scarce, and the resulting population genetic consequences are poorly understood. Migratory divides, hybrid zones with a transition in migratory behaviour, provide a natural setting to investigate the micro-evolutionary dynamics induced by migration under sympatric conditions. Here, we studied the effects of migratory programme on survival, trait evolution and genome-wide patterns of population differentiation in a migratory divide of <b>European</b> barn <b>swallows.</b> We sampled a total of 824 individuals from both allopatric European populations wintering in central and southern Africa, respectively, along with two mixed populations from within the migratory divide. While most morphological characters varied by latitude consistent with Bergmann's rule, wing length co-varied with distance to wintering grounds. Survival data collected during a 5 -year period provided strong evidence that this covariance is repeatedly generated by disruptive selection against intermediate phenotypes. Yet, selection-induced divergence did not translate into genome-wide genetic differentiation as assessed by microsatellites, mtDNA and > 20   000 genome-wide SNP markers; nor did we find evidence of local genomic selection between migratory types. Among breeding populations, a single outlier locus mapped to the BUB 1 gene with a role in mitotic and meiotic organization. Overall, this study provides evidence for an adaptive response to variation in migration behaviour continuously eroded by gene flow under current conditions of nonassortative mating. It supports the theoretical prediction that population differentiation is difficult to achieve under conditions of gene flow despite measurable disruptive selection. © 2016 John Wiley Sons Lt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new technique}} {{in the investigation of}} object classification and illustrates the potential use of this technique for the analysis of a range of biological data, using avian morphometric data as an example. The nascent variable precision rough sets (VPRS) model is introduced and compared with the decision tree method ID 3 (through a ‘leave n out’ approach), using the same dataset of morphometric measures of <b>European</b> barn <b>swallows</b> (Hirundo rustica) and assessing the accuracy of gender classification based on these measures. The results demonstrate that the VPRS model, allied {{with the use of a}} modern method of discretization of data, is comparable with the more traditional non-parametric ID 3 decision tree method. We show that, particularly in small samples, the VPRS model can improve classification and to a lesser extent prediction aspects over ID 3. Furthermore, through the ‘leave n out’ approach, some indication can be produced of the relative importance of the different morphometric measures used in this problem. In this case we suggest that VPRS has advantages over ID 3, as it intelligently uses more of the morphometric data available for the data classification, whilst placing less emphasis on variables with low reliability. In biological terms, the results suggest that the gender of swallows can be determined with reasonable accuracy from morphometric data and highlight the most important variables in this process. We suggest that both analysis techniques are potentially useful for the analysis of a range of different types of biological datasets, and that VPRS in particular has potential for application to a range of biological circumstances. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{models of}} sexual {{selection}} {{based on the}} handicap principle assume a direct linkage between the degree of sexual signal exaggeration and the bearer’s quality, and set out a rather inflexible scenario where handicap exaggeration is maximised for sexual signalling purposes until it reaches the limit imposed by viability selection. Such a scenario {{makes it difficult to}} imagine the mechanisms by which multicomponent signalling systems can evolve and persist in time, given the costs of producing, disseminating and receiving signals. Based on non-equilibrium coevolutionary models, {{it has been suggested that}} variation in selection pressures derived from fluctuations in ecological and/or social conditions may lead to the emergence and maintenance of redundant and non-redundant multiple signals. Alternatively, the non-equilibrium dynamics to which coevolutionary systems are often subject can maintain multiple signals without environmental variability. Species with severe fitness constraints on costlier signal expression should be selected to utilize “cheaper” signals. And individuals not displaying at the maximum possible level might be selected to “compensate” their lack of fitness using phenotypically plastic traits, like behavioural ones. Here I investigate the effect of several potentially sexually selected barn swallow ornamental traits on several reproductive success indicators and on the habitat quality of foraging areas around breeding sites, and of several quality-indicating guppy traits on predator inspection activity, a behavioural character involved in mate choice. The findings presented here indicate ventral and throat plumage colouration, previously not studied for <b>European</b> barn <b>swallows,</b> to function as quality indicators and predict reproductive success and assortative mating patterns. Additionally, we found evidence for a “compensation mechanism” in both species studied, for individuals investing in “cheaper” sexual signals or not displaying at the maximum possible level.

Western Bluebirds were histori-cally birds of open areas, forest clearings, savannahs, or forest edges. However, recent dangerous declines have been noted for the Western Bluebird in many parts of its range. These declines have been attributed to the removal of large degenerating trees in which nests were most often found and to increased competition for nest sites with House Sparrows, <b>European</b> Starlings, and <b>swallows.</b> In addition, the open forests in which Western Bluebirds were historically most abundant have become dense forest stands domi-nated by young trees that contain few nest cavities and low numbers of insects. Due to suppression of natural fires, current tree densities in south-western ponderosa pine forests may be up to 8. 5 times greater than a century ago. These conditions lead to Effect of forest restoration being studied poor nutrient cycling, increased potential for large, high-intensity, stand-replacing fires, and a reduced ability of pine forests to support wildlife species supposed to have been present historically. For these reasons, efforts to restore southwest-ern forests are gaining momentum...|$|R

It can cause severe complications such as malnutrition, dehydration, respiratory infections, aspiration pneumonia, and increased readmissions, institutionalization, and morbimortality. OD is a prevalent and serious problem among all phenotypes of older patients as oropharyngeal swallow response is impaired in older people and can cause aspiration. Despite its prevalence and severity, OD is still underdiagnosed and untreated in many medical centers. There are several validated clinical and instrumental methods (videofluoroscopy and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing) to diagnose OD, and treatment is mainly based on compensatory measures, although new treatments to stimulate the oropharyngeal swallow response are under research. OD matches the definition of a geriatric syndrome as it is highly prevalent among older people, is caused by multiple factors, is associated with several comorbidities and poor prognosis, and needs a multidimensional approach to be treated.

40|$|Background: Fluid {{thickening}} is {{a well-established}} management strategy for oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD). However, {{the effects of}} thickening agents on the physiology of impaired swallow responses are not fully understood, {{and there is no}} agreement on the degree of bolus thickening. Aim: To review the literature and to produce a white paper of the <b>European</b> Society for <b>Swallowing</b> Disorders (ESSD) describing the evidence in the literature on the effect that bolus modification has upon the physiology, efficacy and safety of swallowing in adults with OD. Methods: A systematic search was performed using the electronic Pubmed and Embase databases. Articles in English available up to July 2015 were considered. The inclusion criteria swallowing studies on adults over 18 years of age; healthy people or patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia; bolus modification; effects of bolus modification on swallow safety (penetration/aspiration) and efficacy; and/or physiology and original articles written in English. The exclusion criteria consisted of oesophageal dysphagia and conference abstracts or presentations. The quality of the selected papers and the level of research evidence were assessed by standard quality assessments. Results: At the end of the selection process, 33 articles were considered. The quality of all included studies was assessed using systematic, reproducible, and quantitative tools (Kmet and NHMRC) concluding that all the selected articles reached a valid level of evidence. The literature search gathered data from various sources, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to systematic reviews focused on changes occurring in swallowing physiology caused by thickened fluids. Main results suggest that increasing bolus viscosity (a) results in increased safety of swallowing, (b) also results in increased amounts of oral and/or pharyngeal residue which may result in post-swallow airway invasion, (c) impacts the physiology with increased lingual pressure patterns, no major changes in impaired airway protection mechanisms, and controversial effects on oral and pharyngeal transit time, hyoid displacements, onset of UOS opening and bolus velocity—with several articles suggesting the therapeutic effect of thickeners is also due to intrinsic bolus properties, (d) reduces palatability of thickened fluids and (e) correlates with increased risk of dehydration and decreased quality of life although the severity of dysphagia may be an confounding factor. Conclusions: The ESSD concludes that there is evidence for increasing viscosity {{to reduce the risk of}} airway invasion and that it is a valid management strategy for OD. However, new thickening agents should be developed to avoid the negative effects of increasing viscosity on residue, palatability, and treatment compliance. New randomised controlled trials should establish the optimal viscosity level for each phenotype of dysphagic patients and descriptors, terminology and viscosity measurements must be standardised.
