5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's <b>jitter</b> effect. It was concluded that the <b>jitter</b> in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of <b>jitter</b> were detected. This <b>jitter,</b> or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, {{made it difficult to}} easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon <b>jitter</b> and texture warping found in early 3D games. <b>Jitter</b> and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high <b>jitter,</b> which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} {{field on the}} surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the hydrodynamic behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater <b>jitter</b> during measurements of its radial velocity. Variations of −1 were measured over a 20year period, which is much higher than the measurement uncertainty of −1. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of <b>jitter</b> have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

40|$|Persons using {{low coast}} hand held cameras are untrained, thus {{captured}} videos suffers from severe handshakes and <b>jitters.</b> Hence digital video stabilization algorithm {{is required to}} acquire video sequences by removing these unwanted handshakes and <b>jitters.</b> This paper proposed an adaptive motion smoothening method that removes high frequency <b>jitters,</b> by filtering the accumulated global motion vectors. A modified method for motion vector validation implemented on global motion vectors using adaptive threshold. Proposed method not only removes the <b>jitters</b> but also preserves the scene information. The proposed method reduces the missing image areas significantly.

5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon <b>jitter</b> and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} <b>jitter,</b> it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are {{based on the assumption that}} HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the assumption that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased <b>jitter</b> (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E

25|$|One {{desirable}} {{property of}} all PLLs {{is that the}} reference and feedback clock edges be brought into very close alignment. The average difference in time between the phases of the two signals when the PLL has achieved lock is called the static phase offset (also called the steady-state phase error). The variance between these phases is called tracking <b>jitter.</b> Ideally, the static phase offset should be zero, and the tracking <b>jitter</b> should be as low as possible.|$|E

40|$|<b>Jittering</b> estimators are nonparametric {{function}} estimators for mixed data. They extend arbitrary estimators {{from the}} continuous setting by adding random noise to discrete variables. We give an in-depth {{analysis of the}} <b>jittering</b> kernel density estimator, which reveals several appealing properties. The estimator is strongly consistent, asymptotically normal, and unbiased for discrete variables. It converges at minimax-optimal rates, which are established as a by-product of our analysis. To understand {{the effect of adding}} noise, we further study its asymptotic efficiency and finite sample bias in the univariate discrete case. Simulations show that the estimator is competitive on finite samples. The analysis suggests that similar properties can be expected for other <b>jittering</b> estimators...|$|R

25|$|More {{sophisticated}} analog oscilloscopes {{contain a}} second timebase for a delayed sweep. A delayed sweep provides a very detailed {{look at some}} small selected portion of the main timebase. The main timebase serves as a controllable delay, after which the delayed timebase starts. This can start when the delay expires, or can be triggered (only) after the delay expires. Ordinarily, the delayed timebase is set for a faster sweep, sometimes much faster, such as 1000:1. At extreme ratios, <b>jitter</b> in the delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades the display, but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome that.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{advances}} have enabled MEMS-based timing devices to offer performance levels similar, and sometimes superior, to quartz devices. MEMS oscillator signal quality {{as measured by}} phase noise is now sufficient for most applications. Phase noise of -150 dBc at 10kHz from 10MHz is now available, a level that is generally only needed for radio frequency (RF) applications. MEMS oscillators are now available with integrated <b>jitter</b> under 1.0 picosecond, measured from 12kHz to 20MHz, a level that is normally required for high speed serial data links, such as SONET and SyncE, and some instrumentation applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} subject to both burst errors and random errors. Burst errors include those due to disc {{material}} (defects of aluminum reflecting film, poor reflective index of transparent disc material), disc production (faults during disc forming and disc cutting etc.), disc handling (scratches – generally thin, radial and orthogonal to direction of recording) and variations in play-back mechanism. Random errors include those due to <b>jitter</b> of reconstructed signal wave and interference in signal. CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reed–Solomon code) {{is the basis for}} error detection and correction in the CD process. It corrects error bursts up to 3,500 bits in sequence (2.4nbsp&mm in length as seen on CD surface) and compensates for error bursts up to 12,000 bits (8.5nbsp&mm) that may be caused by minor scratches.|$|E
