Quilter belonged to the <b>Frankfurt</b> <b>Group,</b> a circle of composers who studied at the Hoch Conservatory in the late 1890s. His reputation in England rests largely on his songs and on his light music for orchestra, such as his Children's Overture, with its interwoven nursery rhyme tunes, and a suite of music for the play Where the Rainbow Ends. He is noted as an influence on several English composers, including Peter Warlock.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was born}} at Kensington (London).

The discovery of the plot in Frankfurt led to further arrests in the United Kingdom, where another plot of killing members of the European Parliament was discovered, in which MEPs were to be killed with sarin nerve gas during session in Strasbourg in February 2001. British police arrested twelve people including Doha in February 2001 {{as a result of the}} Frankfurt operation. All British suspects were quickly released due to [...] "lack of evidence," [...] although Doha was subsequently re-arrested.
