5000|$|<b>Form</b> <b>feed</b> is a page-breaking ASCII control character. It {{forces the}} printer to eject the current page and to {{continue}} printing {{at the top of}} another. Often, it will also cause a carriage return. The <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character code is defined as 12 (0xC in hexadecimal), and may be represented as control+L or ^L. In a related use, control+L can be used to clear the screen in Unix shells such as bash. In the C programming language (and other languages derived from C), the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character is represented as [...] Unicode also provides the character [...] as a printable symbol for a <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> (not as the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> itself).The <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character is considered whitespace by the C character classification function [...]|$|E
5000|$|<b>Form</b> <b>feed</b> {{is seldom}} used when {{programming}} with modern printers in modern operating environments like Windows, Unix, Linux or macOS. Instead, form feeds are generated {{by having the}} printing program call a <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> API function. For example, when printing using the [...]NET Framework, the property is used to indicate a <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> is desired.|$|E

50|$|Terminals may {{be given}} time to {{exercise}} various control codes that would (on a teletypewriter or similar) result in physical movements of the carriage that may take significant (from the computer's point of view) amounts of time, such as backspaces, horizontal tabs, carriage returns, <b>form</b> <b>feeds,</b> and line feeds.|$|R

50|$|The <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> {{character}} is sometimes used in plain text files of source code as a delimiter for a page break, or as marker for sections of code. Some editors, in particular emacs and vi, have built-in commands to page up/down on the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character. This convention is predominantly used in Lisp code, {{and is also}} seen in C and Python source code.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with writing}} fiction, Hodges is a {{professional}} nature photographer, with work appearing in Outside Magazine (Adventure Photography of the Year) and newspapers, amongst other places. Animals often play {{a big role in}} his fiction, and the two art <b>forms</b> <b>feed</b> each other. His latest novel is Black Friday, due in 2017.|$|R
50|$|Green-backed {{white-eyes}} feed on {{a variety}} of fruits and insects. Among the fruits taken are papaya and the berries of the introduced Lantana. They will <b>form</b> <b>feeding</b> flocks after the breeding season, which may increase in size as the months pass. Such flocks will also venture outside the primary rainforests in order to take seasonally variable food sources, and will <b>form</b> mixed species <b>feeding</b> flocks with silvereyes, fan-tailed gerygones, and red-throated parrotfinches. They are themselves preyed upon by barn owls.|$|R

5000|$|In Usenet, the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> {{character}} {{is used by}} several newsreaders as a [...] "spoiler character", causing them to automatically hide the following text until prompted, {{as a way to}} prevent spoilers from being inadvertently revealed. The precise behavior depends on the client displaying the article: for example, Gnus displays [...] "Next page..." [...] in boldface, and switches to a second screen to display text after the form feed; slrn displays all non-space characters following the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> as asterisks; Dialog turns the font and background color red between form feeds; and XRN simply inserts blank lines to fill up the remainder of the article display area so the user must scroll down to reveal the spoiler. This use of the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> {{character is}} not supported by all newsreaders, and is not standardized, although it has appeared in a draft of a Usenet Best Practices document by the IETF's USEFOR working group, as a feature that user agents should (but are not required to) support.|$|E
50|$|A {{prolonged}} {{absence of}} light or exposure to harmful chemicals may cause atrophy and absorption of the chloroplasts without otherwise harming the organism. There {{are a number}} of species where a chloroplast's absence was formerly marked with separate genera such as Astasia (colourless Euglena) and Hyalophacus (colourless Phacus). Due to the lack of a developed cytostome, these <b>forms</b> <b>feed</b> exclusively by osmotrophic absorption.|$|R

5000|$|When a Windows PC {{controls}} a LaserJet, the [...] "Form Feed" [...] button seldom {{does anything}} when pressed. It {{has a small}} indicator light, and was usually used with very simple DOS programs that did not eject the last page after sending data to the printer, though {{it could also be}} useful to print the data in the printer's memory if a program failed in the middle of sending a page to be printed. (In certain cases, this might {{be the only way to}} recover one's data in the event of a system crash that occurred while printing.) The <b>Form</b> <b>Feed</b> button would print whatever was remaining in memory and prepare the printer to accept any new data as the start of a new page. Note that for at least some LaserJet models, notably the LaserJet 4MPlus, the printer must be switched off-line before the <b>Form</b> <b>Feed</b> button will work. Most users of dot-matrix printers in the 1980s probably found the Online and <b>Form</b> <b>Feed</b> functions obvious, as most dot-matrix printers had these buttons and they worked similarly. The indicator on the <b>Form</b> <b>Feed</b> button illuminates when there is received data in the printer's buffer; this makes it much easier to predict what will happen if the printer is put online and a new job is sent to it, or if sending of a job in progress is resumed.|$|E

50|$|A page {{break is}} a marker in an {{electronic}} document {{that tells the}} document interpreter that the content which follows {{is part of a}} new page. A page break causes a <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> to be sent to the printer during spooling of the document to the printer. Thus {{it is one of the}} elements that contributes to pagination.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Muiscasaurus, in the Paja Formation has been recovered {{other kind of}} ichthyosaur, Platypterygius sachicarum; it is distinguished of Muiscasaurus for their teeth and cranial features, including thicker, robust teeth with grooved tooth enamel. The analysis could indicate that while P. sachicarum probably had a generalist diet, Muiscasaurus was a much more specialized <b>form,</b> <b>feeding</b> on smaller and softer prey items. This would show that during the Cretaceous period in the neotropics, ichthyosaurs kept some ecological diversity.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the animals}} entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that allied species made much private remark on each other, and were tempted {{to think that}} so many <b>forms</b> <b>feeding</b> on the same store of fodder were eminently superfluous, as tending to {{diminish}} the rations. (I fear the part played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for art to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the gullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.) ...|$|R

50|$|In early computing, {{computer}} output typically consists of monospaced text neatly arranged in {{equal number of}} columns and rows on each printed page. Such pages are typically printed using line printers (or, {{in the case of}} personal computers, character (usually dot matrix) printers) that accepts a simple code such as ASCII, and the end of a printed page can be indicated by a control character called the <b>form</b> <b>feed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|These {{comprise}} the control codes and escape sequences {{sent to the}} terminal in order for it to perform some action (not necessarily a display action). An example {{of one of the}} simplest is the output sequence to clear the screen, which may be the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> (ASCII [...] ) character on some types of terminal but may, say, be the escape sequence &#x241b;2J on a terminal that requires ANSI escape sequences.|$|E
5000|$|Any 8-bit byte value may be encoded with 3 characters: an [...] {{followed}} by two hexadecimal digits (- or -) representing the byte's numeric value. For example, an ASCII <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character (decimal value 12) can be represented by [...] "", and an ASCII equal sign (decimal value 61) must be represented by [...] All characters except printable ASCII characters or end of line characters (but also [...] ) must be encoded in this fashion.|$|E
5000|$|In Pristionchus species {{associated}} with insects, the nematodes usually live on their hosts in a dormant stage (the dauer larva). After {{the death of}} the host insect, the nematodes resume development, feeding and reproducing on the decaying host carcass. Most species of Pristionchus show a polyphenism in their feeding structures, which allows the nematodes to access different food resources in this rapidly changing environment. In one form (the [...] "stenostomatous" [...] form), the mouth is elongated, narrow, and equipped with one small tooth, whereas in the other ("eurystomatous" [...] form) it is short, wide, and with two large teeth. The emergence of a particular form depends on specific environmental conditions and the availability of food. Whereas the stenostomatous <b>form</b> <b>feeds</b> primarily on microorganisms, the eurystomatous <b>form</b> can <b>feed</b> additionally on other nematodes. In the laboratory, Pristionchus species can be cultured on bacteria such as Escherichia coli.|$|R
50|$|Recorded food {{plants for}} the species include Lupinus, Baccharis and Eriophyllum. There is one {{generation}} per year. Females drop hundreds to thousands eggs while flying over patches of lupine bushes. First and second instar larvae {{develop in the}} soil under lupines and feed on {{the exterior of the}} upper portions of lupine tap root. By mid to late spring, the larvae burrow into the plants, <b>forming</b> <b>feeding</b> galleries inside the central shoot and {{the upper part of the}} central tap root. Several larvae may be found in a single plant. Pupation occurs in fall.|$|R
50|$|The larvae cut {{and fold}} {{the leaves of}} Clidemia hirta and Miconia acinodendrum to <b>form</b> a <b>feeding</b> shelter. They are green with brown stripes and are about 50 mm long.|$|R
50|$|These provide Unicode {{with native}} {{paragraph}} and line separators {{independent of the}} legacy encoded ASCII control characters such as carriage return (U+000A), linefeed (U+000D), and Next Line (U+0085). Unicode does not provide for other ASCII formatting control characters which presumably then {{are not part of}} the Unicode plain text processing model. These legacy formatting control characters include Tab (U+0009), Line Tabulation or Vertical Tab (U+000B), and <b>Form</b> <b>Feed</b> (U+000C) which is also thought of as a page break.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{this year}} of life, the squid mature from their larval <b>form,</b> <b>feed</b> and grow, migrate, {{and at the end}} of their lives, congregate at the mating grounds, where they reproduce. Three subpopulations have been {{identified}} in Japanese waters. [...] "The main group spawns in winter in the East China Sea, the second in autumn, west of Kyushu, and the third, minor group in spring/summer in the Sea of Japan as well as off northeastern Japan." ...|$|E
5000|$|Restrictions {{may also}} apply for other reasons. For example, in HTML 4, , {{which is a}} {{reference}} to a non-printing [...] "form feed" [...] control character, is allowed because a <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character is allowed. But in XML, the <b>form</b> <b>feed</b> character cannot be used, not even by reference. As another example, , which is {{a reference to a}}nother control character, is not allowed to be used or referenced in either HTML or XML, but when used in HTML, it is usually not flagged as an error by web browsers - some of which interpret it as a reference to the character represented by code value 128 in the Windows-1252 encoding for compatibility reasons. This character, [...] "€", has to be represented as [...] in a standard-compliant HTML code. As a further example, prior to the publication of XML 1.0 Second Edition on October 6, 2000, XML 1.0 was based on an older version of ISO 10646 and prohibited using characters above U+FFFD, except in character data, thus making a reference like [...] (U+10000) illegal. In XML 1.1 and newer editions of XML 1.0, such a reference is allowed, because the available character repertoire was explicitly extended.|$|E

Nurse cell is a multinucleate syncytium.Tobacco {{cyst nematode}} causes significant damage on tobacco root system mainly by intracellular migration.
