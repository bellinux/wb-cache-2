40|$|Nitrate {{pollution}} in the Plana de Vic aquifers has presently reached very high levels, which pose enormous limitations to its use. The origin of nitrate is mainly caused by manure application as fer tilizer. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamic scheme of the Plana de Vic aquifer system, based on potentiometric data and nitrate concentrations obtained through a monthly monitoring effort of a 80 well database. The response of those wells to the recharge that ended a severe drought period allows us to depict different <b>hydrogeological</b> behaviours between <b>surface</b> and deep aquifer levels. We conclude that a mixing process occurs in this multilevel leaky-aquifer system facilitated by the uncasing {{of most of the}} wells. Therefore, a deficient exploitation of the aquifer is seen as an additional cause for the spreading of nitrat...|$|R
40|$|High local {{groundwater}} flow into rock tunnels {{may lead to}} a potential hazard and is an important factor influencing construction time and costs. Geological features such as fault zones and open fractures can be the source of very high local groundwater inflows. Having a reliable estimation of location groundwater inflows is essential before excavation of tunnels. To reduce the costs and time of field works, remote sensing investigations can be a good solution. The main aim of the present study is to propose a methodology for detecting the geomorphic markers of cuesta in the high local groundwater inflow to Nosoud tunnel using the satellite imagery data. For this purpose, a reflectance image from the ASTER satellite sensor was used. Our Experiments show that cuesta springs, caused by hydraulic fracturing, can be detected using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, computed on the ASTER image, and analyzing the topographic and morphometric features of the area. Moreover, observations in tunnel excavation stage showed that crossing through open fractures in hard and thick layers is the major cause of water inflow into the tunnel, which corresponds to the <b>surface</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> evidences obtained from the ASTER image...|$|R
40|$|Water {{tracks are}} zones of high soil {{moisture}} that route shallow groundwater down-slope, through the active layer {{and above the}} ice table. A water track in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, was analysed for <b>surface</b> <b>hydrogeological,</b> geochemical, and biological characteristics {{in order to test}} the hypothesis that water tracks provide spatial structure to Antarctic soil ecosystems by changing the physical conditions in the soil environment within the water tracks from those outside the water tracks. The presence of the water track significantly affected the distribution of biotic and abiotic ecosystem parameters: increasing soil moisture, soil salinity, and soil organic matter within the water track relative to soils outside the water track, and reducing soil phosphate, soil pH, and the population of nematodes and other invertebrates in water track soils relative to off track soils. These results suggest that water tracks are distinct and extreme ecological zones in Taylor Valley that provide long-range (kilometre to multikilometre) structure to Antarctic hillslope ecosystems through physical control on soil moisture and solute content. Contrary to expectations, these high soil-moisture sites are not hotspots for faunal biological activity because high soil salinity makes them suitable habitats for only the most halo-tolerant organism...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{below the}} results of a survey {{conducted}} with the CVES method on the Lake of Candia, near the city of Turin, in north-western Italy. The main objective of the study was the characterization of the sediments of the basin, in order to define the nature, the composition, the geometry and the spatial relationships of detected geological bodies. Another aim of the survey was to try to understand the hydrogeological dynamics that govern the lake basin, in order to determine, at least qualitatively, the presence of interconnecting paths with groundwater and to locate areas in which recharge or seepage flows are concentrated. Using a Laterally Constrained Inversion (LCI) approach for the data inversion, we managed to obtain fifteen resistivity sections that cover almost the entire area of the lake. By joining and interpolating the profiles it was possible to produce a three-dimensional model of the electrical resistivity distribution below the water basin. Thanks to the study, we found the presence of coarse glacial deposits, with high resistivity values, along the southern shore of the lake. These coarse deposits, primarily consisting of gravel and pebbles mixed with a sandy matrix, could be considered as the main <b>hydrogeological</b> window connecting <b>surface</b> and underground wate...|$|R
40|$|The vadose zone {{plays an}} {{important}} role in surface water–groundwater interaction and exerts strong influences on biogeochemical, ecological, and hyporheic processes. It is also the presence of an unsaturated zone that controls the state of connection between surface water and groundwater. Despite recent advances on how <b>hydrogeological</b> variables affect <b>surface</b> water–groundwater interactions, there is limited understanding of the hydroclimatic effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration. More specifically, there is a need for a physically based understanding on the changes that may occur in response to changes in vegetation. While it may seem qualitatively obvious that the presence of vegetation can cause an unsaturated zone to develop underneath a riverbed and alter the state of connection, it has so far not been demonstrated quantitatively. Also, the influence of variables such as root extinction depth, topography, and the influence of land clearance has so far not been explored. In this study, fully coupled, physically based 2 -D transient homogeneous models were used to simulate the impact of land clearance and revegetation on the state of connection of a perennial river system. The simulations showed that the presence of vegetation can create an unsaturated zone between a river and an aquifer and affect the state of connection and that the removal of deep-rooted vegetation from a catchment may have a significant impact on the state of connection as well as the condition of the water resource...|$|R
40|$|In {{the morning}} of February 15 th 2005, during {{excavation}} works in an underground gypsum quarry at Moncalvo (Monferrato area, Asti, Northern Italy), a water-bearing fracture was intercepted at level 134 m a. s. l. During the night {{a large amount of}} water (approximately 60, 000 m 3) and mud invaded the quarry tunnels reaching a height of 139 m a. s. l. {{the morning of}} the day after. Meanwhile a large sinkhole (20 m wide and 10 m deep) formed on the <b>surface.</b> <b>Hydrogeological</b> surveys were immediately carried out to follow the quickly evolving situation, while speleological and geomorphological fieldwork was made possible only seven months later. Two important caves were discovered both showing clear evidence of a hypogenic origin with sculpted morphologies due to slowly flowing water under pressure. The sinkhole formed by the collapse of one of the main chambers of the biggest of these caves, when buoyant support provided by the water started to decrease due to lowering of the virtual water table. The recharge of this karst system is from below and only very minor quantities of infiltration water come from the above lying surface, as has also been confirmed by hydrochemical analysis. This hypogene karst is completely invisible at the surface and develops entirely underground showing no relation whatsoever with the surface. Its presence is therefore extremely difficult to reveal and such types of karst can thus make up extremely dangerous situations. This is the first example of hypogene gypsum cave related to ascending waters in Italy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades hydrogeological know-ledge in Central Italy {{improved}} significantly due to many Contributors and to different research approaches. The most significant contributions as well as the most important results are considered. In 1970 regional hydrogeology of Central Italy was still unexplored and methods of investigation suitable to that area had not yet been successfully esperimented. As basic knowledge of the regional hydrogeology was however a preliminary condition to more detailed investigations. A first attempt of hydrogeological interpretation mainly based on <b>surface</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> evidences gave poor results while comparaison between hydrology and regional geology gave better results. These results took the form of an elementary hydrogeological scheme where the main aquifers and their limits were identified. Between 1975 and 1985 the original scheme was developed in a series of more detailed hydrogeological models based on new hydrochemical and isotope investigations and on the analysis of hydrogeological balances. Quantity and quality of ground water resources have been evaluated. During the period 1970 - 1985 new methods of investigation suitable to the hydrology of Central Italy have been successfully experimented. Researches are presently focused on preparing more reliable hydrodynamic models based on the analysis of discharge regimes, on hydrochemistry and isotope hydrology. First attemps in this field showed that radiometric age of ground water must be compatible with the evaluated by means of hydrodynamic madels. Separate use of the two methods can lead to unreliable results. The reconnaissance phase in hydrogeological researches has been completed. A new stage of quantitative hydrogeology is under way; its goal is to study every single aquifer considered {{as a part of a}} more complex regional system...|$|R
40|$|Controlled source {{electromagnetic}} (CSEM) geophysics {{has been}} used with {{a fair amount of}} success in near <b>surface</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> studies. Recently, these investigations have been conducted frequently in human impacted field sites containing cultural conductors such as metal fences and buried pipes. Cultural noise adds an element of complexity to the geological interpretation of this type of data. This research investigates the influence of mutual induction between two buried targets in a CSEM experiment. In particular, it looks at the mutual coupling between a buried cultural conductor and a geological heterogeneity. We attempt to isolate the Hz field induced by tertiary currents in targets caused by mutual coupling. This is achieved with a Texas A&M 3 D CSEM finite element code, which calculates the secondary Hz fields emanating from a target buried in a halfspace. Buried geological targets and cultural conductors are modeled as volumetric slabs embedded in a halfspace. A series of models have been simulated to study the effect of varying parameters such as target conductivity, transmitter location and shape of a target on the mutual inductance. In each case, the secondary Hz field is calculated for a model with two slabs, and two models with individual slabs. The mutual coupling is calculated by removing the secondary fields from the individual slab models from the response of a two slab model. The calculations of mutual inductance from a variety of such models suggests a complicated interaction of EM fields between the two targets. However, we can explain most of these complexities by adapting a simple approach to Maxwell?s equations. Although the tertiary Hz field is complicated, it may be useful in the characterization and delineation of electrical heterogeneities in the subsurface, which can then be related to geological features such as fractures or joints. It is seen that the most important factor affecting the mutual coupling is the host conductivity. The results have also shown that mutual coupling is very sensitive to transmitter (TX) location, especially when the TX is positioned near one of the targets...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Risle river, in {{its middle}} portion, is {{frequently}} affected by episodes of major sinkholes development; indeed, {{in the last}} decade or so, two major sinkholes developed in the river bed leading to crisis situation with a complete river loss in the underlying groundwater and a dried up river course over distances of several kilometers downstream during the summer season. This resulted in major modifications in <b>hydrogeological</b> and in <b>surface</b> – groundwater interaction processes, with major consequences on water quality, water uses and water dependent ecosystems. To understand this phenomenon, its impact both on surface-groundwater interaction processes and on aquatic ecosystems and to improve crisis management, a multi-parameter monitoring program called the middle Risle critical zone observatory has been set up, in order to acquire the necessary data and knowledge and develop proper tools to best manage these situations. Several monitoring networks were implemented involving several partners. Exploratory tools and methodologies were also developed. The work carried out in this project notably included setting up monitoring networks for groundwater level, water river level, differential flow in rivers, temperature and conductivity surveys, springs yield, ecosystem surveys (fishes, macroinvertebrates, vegetation) as well as modelling surface, karst and groundwater flow… Results obtained were numerous including river loss impacts on fishes, macroinvertebrates and vegetation and population recovery rates. Some vegetal species seem to be a reliable indicator for surface/groundwater interaction. The dynamics of local hydrogeological processes are assessed and linked to the consequences on the ecosystems habitats and on water use. Inverse modelling using an analytical solution of the diffusive wave equation helped assessing for lateral flows during flood events, quantifying spatio-temporal variability for surface water and groundwater exchanges. It also highlighted the important role of the karstic zones both on storage and on river flood peak attenuation processes, thereby protecting downstream villages against floods. Finally an approach using transfer model based on computing the convolution integral of up to several signals allowed building the first functional scheme of this karst system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of a human impacted river, the Seine (France), over the 21 st century, three driving factors were examined: climate, agriculture, and point source inputs of domestic and industrial origin. Three future scenarios were constructed, by modification of a baseline representative of recent conditions. A climate change scenario, based on simulations by a general circulation model driven by the SRES-A 2 scenario of radiative forcing, accounts for an average warming of + 3. 3 °C over the watershed and marked winter increase and summer decrease in precipitation. To illustrate a possible reduction in nitrate pollution from agricultural origin, a scenario of good agricultural practices was considered, introducing catch crops and a 20 % decrease in nitrogen fertilisation. Future point source pollution was estimated following the assumptions embedded in scenario SRES-A 2 regarding demographic, economic and technologic changes, leading to reductions of 30 to 75 % compared to 2000, depending on the pollutants. Four models, addressing separate components of the river system (agronomical model, <b>hydrogeological</b> model, land <b>surface</b> model and water quality model), were used to analyse the relative impact of these scenarios on water quality, in light of their impact on hydrology and crop production. The first-order driving factor of water quality over the 21 st century is the projected reduction of point source pollution, inducing a noticeable decrease in eutrophication and oxygen deficits downstream from Paris. The impact of climate change on these terms is driven by the warming of the water column. It enhances algal growth in spring and the loss factors responsible for phytoplankton mortality in late summer (grazers and viruses). In contrast, increased seasonal contrasts in river discharge have a negligible impact on river water quality, as do the changes in riverine nitrate concentration, which never gets limiting. The latter changes have a similar magnitude under the three scenarios. Under climate change, riverine and groundwater nitrate concentrations increase and crop production is advantaged with reduced growing cycles and increased yields. In contrast, nitrate concentrations decrease under the good agricultural practices scenario, with a limited decrease in crop production. When these two scenarios are combined, the changes in nitrate concentrations balance each other and crop yields increase. The results of this numerical exercise indicate that the potential changes to the Seine River system during the 21 st century will not lead to severely degraded water quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this short report is to discuss the {{rationale}} behind the design of hydrogeological monitoring networks. More specifically, to provide the background necessary for {{an assessment of the}} options for establishing hydrogeological baseline monitoring networks in three lowland permeable catchments that are being developed by the NERC Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) Thematic Programme. The aim of LOCAR is to undertake detailed, interdisciplinary programmes of integrated hydroenvironmental research relating to the storage-discharge cycle and groundwater-dominated aquatic habitats in three lowland catchments, the Pang-Lambourn, the Tern, and the Dorset Frome. In addition to the hydrogeological monitoring networks, instrumentation will also be established to monitor surface and atmospheric water and the ecology of each of the catchments. The LOCAR Programme will address five central questions, these are: - (i) What are the key <b>hydrogeological</b> processes controlling <b>surface</b> water-groundwater interactions and the movement of groundwater in lowland catchments? (ii) What are the key physical, chemical and biological processes operating within the valley floor corridor that affect surface water and groundwater? (iii) How do varying flow regimes control in-stream, riparian and wetland habitats? (iv) How does land use management impact on lowland catchment hydrology, including both water quantity and quality? (v) How can the hydrological, hydrogeological, geomorphalogical and ecological interactions resulting from natural or anthropogenic changes be predicted using integrated mathematical models? Data and observations from the hydrogeological monitoring networks and instrumentation will be principally used to address questions (a), (b) and (e), but will also be used along with data from the other monitoring networks in investigations and studies related to questions (c) and (d). The LOCAR Programme has identified a number of specific tasks or topics that may influence the design of the hydrogeological monitoring network and instrumentation. These may be summarized as follows: - • Flow and transport in the Chalk and Triassic Sandstone aquifers are poorly understood and the relationships between flow and transport properties at different scales, i. e. pore scale, borehole scale and catchment scale needs elucidating. • Aquifer heterogeneity is a dominant influence on contaminant dispersion and is not yet adequately characterized. The role of fracture flow in the Chalk and sandstones need particular attention. • The role of drift deposits in influencing recharge and pollution pathways needs investigation. • Chemical interactions need an understanding of pore and fracture scale processes (including heterogeneiety and scaling properties), and the role of, and constraints on, microbial degradation, and hence the scope for natural attenuation of pollutants, require investigation. • The spatial functioning of the surface water system must be mapped onto an understanding of surface water-groundwater interactions...|$|R
40|$|GEOMORPHOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE DISTAL VENETIAN PLAIN BETWEEN S. DONA’ DI PIAVE AND S. STINO DI LIVENZA This thesis {{analyzes}} {{a portion}} of the distal sector of the Venetian-Friulian Plain, extending for about 100 km 2, between the Piave and Livenza rivers. The area has been partly reclaimed in the 20 th century and the present topography spans between + 5 m and - 2. 5 m above mean sea level (msl). Alluvial, lagoon and swampy deposits are well represented and their age formed between Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present. One of the main goals of the research is the comparison between surface geomorphological data and high-resolution subsoil information. The selected zone allow to test this thanks to {{the quality and quantity of}} data now available. Besides the production of detailed geomorphological, geological, pedological maps, this zone has been also investigated for the general framework of the first subsoil in the framework of the mapping projects carried out by the Provinces of Venice and Treviso. Moreover, since 2012 the area considered in this thesis has been part of the fieldwork zone analyzed by the student of the Department of Physical Geography of the University of Utrecht for the course “Low Land Genesis” (responsible Prof. Esther Stouthamer). The course is part of the Bachelor course in Physical Geography and is organized in collaboration with the Department of Geosciences of Padova University (Dr. A. Fontana). The field activity mainly consists of carrying out hand augering up to the depth of 15 m from the surface along lines with a length of 3 - 4 km and an average distance of 100 m between neighboring corings. This activity brought to the creation of a large database of detailed stratigraphic logs for the first 3 - 16 m, that has almost no analogues for depth and areal density in Italy. I attended the fieldwork activity in 2015, between May 22 th and June 19 th, joining 2 students of Utrecht and coring 33 boreholes along the line named 303. This experience allowed to learn the theory and the technical skills in coring and logging and the use of the software LLG 2012. This has been designed by Utrecht Department to store and process the stratigraphic cores, helping in the creation of long profiles and their drawing. The Venetian-Friulian Plain is generally described as the eastern part of the Po Plain, but it can be differenciated for the presence of alluvial megafans. These can be recognized from the mouth of the major Alpine valleys up to the inner boundary of lagoons. The megafans formed during the LGM, supplied by the sediment generated by the fluvioglacial deposition. Since the withdrawal phase of the Alpine glaciers, in the Lateglacial and early Holocene, the lack of sedimentary input led the main river to incise in respect of the LGM surface and funneled the depositional flux along alluvial valleys. These erosive lanforms have been recognized in the distal sector of Tagliamento and Piave river systems. The fluvial valleys can be up to 2000 m wide and 25 m deep, but now they are almost completely filled by fluvial, lagoon and swampy deposits of mid and late VIII Holocene. Thus, for the recognition of these paleovalleys the use of stratigraphic cores is necessary. Few previous studies identified traces of incised-filled valleys in the studied area, but the new data collected through the fieldwork of Utrecht students allow to characterize in detail these buried landforms. In particular, this thesis aimed to describe the planform framework of the paleovalleys, the facies of the sedimentary infill and the age of the deposits. The research started from the interpretation of remote-sensed images (e. g. rectified aerial pictures and satellite images) and the comparison with high-resolution topographic data. This information was obtained through the analysis of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived from airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) and partly from heights points of the Regional Topographic Map (CTR) at scale 1 : 10, 000. The new investigation dealing with the geomorphology and geology have been mainly devoted to increase and check the map recently produced by the Province of Venice (SINPAV and DOGE projects). The interpretation of the litho-stratigraphic and chronological information were strongly improved by the new data of the database produced by students of Utrecht. This thesis realized 6 stratigraphic profiles along the lines 301, 302, 303, 304 (cored in 2015) and the lines 223 and 224 (cored in 2014), corresponding to a total number of 245 boreholes and a total length of 20. 5 km. Moreover, in some key sites, several single drills were carried out for detecting geological and morphological boundaries. The stratigraphic data have been also improved with the pedological profiles documented in the literature. The area is characterized by many traces related to the ancient anthropogenic activity and, in particular by the Roman and early Medieval site of Cittanova and the path of the Roman road Via Annia. Notwithstanding, the archaeological traces and remains were considered only for their chrono-stratigraphic meaning. The research allowed to recognize 2 main fluvial paleovalleys formed in the Lateglacial by the activity of Piave River, that merge together slightly north of the archaeological site of Cittanova. Here a maximum width of 1200 m is reached and the bottom is below 15 m from the present surface. The sedimentary infill is mainly characterized by fine dominated deposits and the occurrence of estuarine/lagoon sediments is documented since - 14 m msl, with a radiocarbon are of 8256 ± 70 years cal BP. This information documents that sea level was slightly above - 14 m msl at that time, while it was around - 9 m msl 7400 years cal BP, testifying the rapid rise of the marine level in that time interval. Moreover, the stratigraphic data demonstrate the existence of a geological unit belonging to Piave megafans, which formed at the end of the LGM and consists of coarse sand and fine gravels. This depositional body can be probably correlated to the so-called cataglacial unit, previously recognized only in the Tagliamento megafan and dated to the withdrawal period of the Alpine glacier. The new data and the reinterpretation of the previous available geomorphological and pedological information allow to build a robust stratigraphic framework that support a geological reconstruction with an unpreceded high resolution. This thesis can strongly support geotechnical and <b>surface</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> investigations and territorial planning...|$|R
