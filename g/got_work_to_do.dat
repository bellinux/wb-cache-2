5000|$|In {{his book}} Jack Kerouac: Prophet of the New Romanticism (1976), Robert A. Hipkiss criticizes much of Kerouac's poetry, but {{identifies}} Mexico City Blues as probably containing Kerouac's best poetry, and praises the 235th Chorus in particular. Hipkiss compares the 235th Chorus to Robert Frost's [...] "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening", and interprets the chorus, which reads [...] "How do I know that I'm dead / Because I'm alive / And I <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> ...", as referring to obligations which give purpose to the narrator's life, but which are [...] "painful and not satisfying". Unlike in Frost's poem, in Mexico City Blues [...] "there is no satisfactory putting aside {{of the death}} wish by contemplating the 'miles to go before I sleep.'" [...] Hipkiss describes the poem as [...] "an expression of the creative impulse very much {{for its own sake}} - a refusal of rules of creation and a celebration, in the act, of the spontaneity inherent in creativity." ...|$|E

It {{was love at first}} sight. ’ I swallowed hard, recalling the day Pimpant bounded into our lives. You try telling your child that he cannot have the puppy he’s embracing with all the love of which a 6 -year-old is capable. We kept the dog. That was 12 years ago. For 5 long bloody minutes that dog went Eee eee eee eee eee. The yelps grew softer — the canine ones, that is. Kip died in pain. ‘Can I give you something, Cyril?’ ‘No no, I <b>got</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I’m takin ’ ‘im home with me. He’s going out the back. ’ I didn’t want to know how the miner’s tired body could carve out a grave from the grey scree behind his shack. I just wanted the corpse off my hands. I went home and yapped at the kids for making too much noise and almost kicked the dog. I’ll never do that again. I mean it. When people ask me to put down their animals, I send them to Cyril Johanssen, who’s done a total volte-face. God knows what the poor man suffered during the 2 months nobody saw him. Whatever it was turned his heart. When his grief released him — or he entered the next phase — Cyril bought a. 22 and set himself up as an animal liberator, saying it’s quicker and more humane to put a bullet through their heads. Perhaps he’s right. But that’s not quite the end of the story. The old miner hates me now. Should I have acted differently? Would Cyril still go to the other doctor and cross the street to avoid me if I had refused to put down his dog? Now Pimpant’s hip dysplasia is so bad he drags his hind legs. And I’m dragging my feet.

60|$|As {{the summer}} months dragged along, the {{industrial}} situation in Oakland grew steadily worse. Capital everywhere seemed to have selected this city for the battle with organized labor. So many men in Oakland were out on strike, or were locked out, or were unable <b>to</b> <b>work</b> because of the dependence of their trades on the other tied-up trade's, that odd jobs at common labor were hard to obtain.

When the men went to the herring fishing, they had the croft ploughed; the women fed the sheep and the cattle and milked the cow, and when they {{came home from the}} fishing they had tatties for the winter feed and then they cut their harvest. When the herring fishing was finished, it was harvest time — it was a seasonal fishing, and it suited the Stroma men perfectly because their wives attended to the crofts. You could say the women in Stroma were liberated well before women's lib. They'd <b>got</b> men's <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> - milk cows, make butter; they were very industrious women.

60|$|And {{then there}} came the gradual {{awakening}} {{to the fact}} that this was really fame--fame, and perhaps also competence. First in the field, of course, was the editor of the 'Cosmopolitan Review,' with a polite request that Ernest would give the readers of that intensely hot-and-hot and thoughtful periodical the opportunity of reading his valuable views on the East End outcast question, before they had had time to be worth nothing for journalistic purposes, through the natural and inevitable cooling of the public interest in this new sensation. Then his old friends of the 'Morning Intelligence' once more begged that he would be good enough to contribute a series of signed and headed articles to their columns, on the slums and fever dens of poverty-stricken London. Next, an illustrated weekly asked him to join with his artist friend in getting up another pilgrimage into yet undiscovered metropolitan plague-spots. And so, before the end of a month, Ernest Le Breton, for the first time in his life, had really <b>got</b> more <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than he could easily manage, and work, too, that he felt he could throw his whole life and soul into with perfect honesty.|$|R

40|$|School {{principals}} are frantically busy people, chronically overworked, {{and always}} burdened with more jobs {{than they have}} time for. You are probably well-used to people attempting to add fresh burdens to what is already an impossible schedule, and I am sure {{it needs to be}} a most compelling argument that persuades you to accept new challenges and responsibilities. The theme of this conference is "The Principal and the Professional Development of Teachers". During the next two days you will be examining a number of techniques for staff development in your schools. But before we can look at any of these techniques in any detail it is probably necessary to persuade you that staff development is part of your business. Some of you, 1 suspect, have yet to be concerned that you should be heavily in-volved in the professional development of your staff. — haven't you <b>got</b> enough <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> already without talking on another huge, unknown challenge? — and why should you be responsible for completing what the teachers college and university have apparently failed <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> — and what about the Ministry of Education, the Education Officers, the Curriculum Development Unit, and the In-Service Training establishment — surely it is their job to look after the professional development of staff? The answer is straightforward. You are all trying to run effective schools. You <b>work</b> hard <b>to</b> build up a fine reputation for your school, you raise many thousands of dollars, you construct new buildings, you gather together a well trained staff, you stock the school with the best books and equipment. But even after you have done all this, all your efforts, can be thwarted almost without effort by the teacher at the classroom level. The criterion of effective education is effective learning. The most direct in-dication of effective learning is good teaching. Everything else that goes on in the school is of secondary importance, and even misdirected, if it <b>does</b> not contribute <b>to</b> good teaching and effective learning...|$|R
50|$|This great {{football}} {{match was}} played yesterday, on the Academy Cricket Ground, Edinburgh, with a result most gratifying for Scotland. The weather was fine, {{and there was}} a very large turnout of spectators. The competitors were dressed in appropriate costume, the English wearing a white jersey, ornamented by a red rose, and the Scotch brown jersey, with a thistle. Although the good wishes of the spectators went with the Scotch team, yet it was considered that their chances were poor. The difference between the two teams was very marked, the English being of a much heavier and stronger build compared to their opponents. The game commenced shortly after three o'clock, the Scotch getting the kick off, and for some time neither side had any advantage. The Scotch, however, succeeded in driving the ball close to the English goal, and, pushing splendidly forward, eventually put it into their opponents' quarters, who, however, prevented any harm accruing by smartly 'touching down’. This result warmed the Englishmen up <b>to</b> their <b>work,</b> and in spite of tremendous opposition they got near the Scotch goal, and kicked the ball past it, but it was cleverly 'touched down' they got no advantage. This finished the first 50 minutes, and the teams changed sides.For a considerable time after the change the ball was sent from side to side, and the 'backs' <b>got</b> more <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> By some lucky runs, however, the Scotch got on to the borders of the English land, and tried to force the ball past the goal. The English strenuously opposed this attempt, and for a time the struggle was terrible, ending in the Scotch 'touching down' in their opponents' ground and becoming entitled to a 'try'. This result was received with cheers, which were more heartily renewed when Cross, to whom the 'kick off' was entrusted, made a beautiful goal. This defeat only stirred up the English to fresh efforts, and driving the ball across the field, they managed also to secure a ‘try’, but unfortunately the man who got the 'kick off' did not allow sufficient windage, and the ball fell short. After this the Scotch became more cautious, and playing well together secured after several attempts a second 'try', but good luck did not attend the 'kick off' and the goal was lost. Time being then declared up the game ceased, the Scotch winning by a goal and a 'try'.|$|R

But what could I do, sir? The thing was no worse because I did it, instead of {{somebody}} else; and if putting me in possession of a house would put me in possession of three and sixpence a day, and levying a distress on another man’s goods would relieve my distress and that of my family, it can’t be expected but what I’d take the job and go through with it.

If there is anything wrong in being the agent in such matters—not the principal, mind you—I’m sure the business, to a beginner like I was, at all events, carries its own punishment along with it. I wished again and again that the people would only blow me up, or pitch into me—that I wouldn’t have minded, it’s all in my way; but it’s the being shut up by yourself in one room for five days, without so much as an old newspaper to look at, or anything to see out o’ the winder but the roofs and chimneys at the back of the house, or anything to listen to, but the ticking, perhaps, of an old Dutch clock, the sobbing of the missis, now and then, the low talking of friends in the next room, who speak in whispers, lest “the man” should overhear them, or perhaps the occasional opening of the door, as a child peeps in to look at you, and then runs half-frightened away—it’s all this, that makes you feel sneaking somehow, and ashamed of yourself; and then, if it’s wintertime, they just give you fire enough to make you think you’d like more, and bring in your grub as if they wished it ’ud choke you—as I dare say they do, for the matter of that, most heartily. If they’re very civil, they make you up a bed in the room at night, and if they don’t, your master sends one in for you; but there you are, without being washed or shaved all the time, shunned by everybody, and spoken to by no one, unless some one comes in at dinner-time, and asks you whether you want any more, in a tone as much to say, “I hope you don’t,” or, in the evening, to inquire whether you wouldn’t rather have a candle, after you’ve been sitting in the dark half the night. When I was left in this way, I used to sit, think, think, thinking, till I felt as lonesome as a kitten in a wash-house copper with the lid on; but I believe the old brokers’ men who are regularly trained to it, never think at all. I have heard some on ’em say, indeed, that they don’t know how! ...|$|R
