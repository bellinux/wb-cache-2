5000|$|Unlike Japanese or Malaysian instant noodles, Mama noodles {{are often}} used to cook {{different}} dishes using only the noodles, leaving out the seasoning. The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as [...] "yum Mama". This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Another method is to stir fry the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real <b>dehydrated</b> <b>meat</b> such as pork or beef. The average retail price is about six baht for the regular size and 10 baht for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.|$|E

40|$|Carne salgada desidratada é um produto largamente usado no Brasil, como fonte de proteína animal. O {{principal}} objetivo deste tipo de processamento é a remoção de água, inicialmente por mudanças de pressão osmótica e, a seguir por secagem, levando a um produto com umidade intermediária, como o charque e o "jerked beef". O processo de desidratação osmótica, pela penetração do sal e saída de água, causa redução nos níveis de atividade de água. Alterações de cor também ocorrem durante o processamento. Neste trabalho, estas duas variáveis são avaliadas, em pedaços de carne submetidos à salga seca e úmida. Os valores de atividade de água iniciais foram reduzidos em ambas as etapas, sendo mais acentuado para salga seca, obtendo ao término desse experimento 0, 79 unidades a 10 ºC e 0, 75 a 20 ºC. Os efeitos do sal também alteraram os parâmetros de cor, afetando os valores de L* a* b*, e direta e diferentemente o valor de DE das salgas. O estudo dos parâmetros de cor e da atividade de água é útil para um melhor conhecimento e controle do processo de carne salgada desidratada.

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{methods used to}} {{dehydrate}} food none have the potential of producing nondegraded foodstuffs {{like that of a}} vacuum assisted conductive heater, however the system required is relatively complex and many critical design choices are required to make it marketable. Continuing from promising experimental findings (Mitra, Shrivastave, & Srinivasa Rao, 2011) and high fidelity simulations (Nadi, Rahimi, Younsi, Tavakoli, & Hamidi-Esfahanim, 2012) a prototype food drier has been developed. The viability of such a system has been analysed as well as the trade-offs of all envisaged critical design choices. Simulations of top level components were used to validate purchases and the observation of Maillard reaction severity on a range of food stuffs was used to determine the performance of the Vacuum Hot-Plate System (VHPS). This project was able to develop a working prototype that could achieve the following operating parameters 70 ˚C drying temperature and 10 kPa chamber pressure. This produced dried product that was observed to be of higher quality (less degraded) than the control tests, which operated at atmospheric pressure. Only a small amount of dried food could be produced in each batch. This was to minimise the vapour entering the vacuum pump if the cold trap and heat tracer were not working as intended. Further optimisation is needed to determine the maximum amount of dried food that can be produced from a single batch. Based on the conventional preserving requirement a reduction of 40 % mass used to determine if the product was dried (Ramesh, 2003), however the results indicate that many not be applicable for vegetable and fungus materials. Images of the dried food {{can be found in the}} results section. The aim of this project was to develop a functioning prototype and validate it by experimenting on a range of foods. In such a system, the optimum operating conditions for <b>dehydrating</b> <b>meat,</b> fruit, vegetable and fungus all differ. These differing conditions cannot be achieve with existing ‘vacuum ovens’ as they use forced convection. This report has developed system requirements so that food can be dehydrated solely by conduction in absence of either natural or forced convection. Further component requirements were determined by Maillard reaction, saturation temperature and presence of bacteria and pathogens. These factors justify an operating temperature range of 40 ˚C to 70 ˚C. The optimum temperature however is determined on the timely and unburnt delivery of the produce. Food degradation can cause loss of nutrients as well as physical appearance that would reduce the ‘eat-ability’ of the product. A VHPS also has the advantage of processing food in a low oxygen environment, which reduces the rate of nutrients oxidising. Outside the scope of this project was the effect or lack thereof by oxidation of psilocin in fungus, as investigated in studies (Horita, 1961). In order to materialise such a system a signification investment of a 2 stage rotary vane vacuum pump is needed. Although a vacuum injector & air compressor are a cheap alternative for a minimum chamber pressure of ~ 20 kPa and is not susceptible to water damage. To safeguard the longevity of this investment heat tracing and cold traps were investigated. For a small batched process a cold trap is not necessary as the mixed flow entering the pump was determined to be 0. 013 % vapour. The JAVAC pump used has the operation requirement that entering gas be 50 ˚C, so heat tracing is required as the gas will only reach saturation temperature (45 ˚C at 10 kPa). A vacuum assisted conductive heater is a viable method of food drying, which can be performed on foodstuffs with a very high moisture content. From the prototype developed, a refined product has potential for commercial success but an in-depth market study is needed. Further investigation is needed to numerically verify the nutritional content of the dried foo...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cereal grains}} grown in Canada are damaged prior to {{harvesting}} and become available for animal feeding. There {{is a lack}} of information about the nutritive values of such grains. Wheat frozen prior to reaching maturity can safely be- fed to both laying hens and chicks (MacNaugh-ton, 1952) but such grain has a reduced energy digestibility coefficient (Bell and Gidyk, 1954; Whiting and Bezeau, 1954) possibly due to the failure of the kernels to develop fully. Grains which have sprouted tend to contain more B-vitamins and less dry matter than non-sprouted controls (Anon., 1943; Cheldelin and Lane, 1943). The present experiment was designed to study the nutritive worth of wheat dam-aged by sprouting, freezing and mould development after maturity had been reached. A sample of Avon wheat (52 lb. /bu.) was soaked for 8 hours in water and then spread in a thin layer between sacking in an atmosphere maintained at 22 °C. The grain was sprayed twice daily with water. After 60 hours two sub-samples of the wheat, which by this time had sprouted, were removed. The first sub-sample was placed in a drying oven (50 °C.) for 24 hours, while the second sub-sample was frozen and held at 0 °C. for 24 hours be-fore similar drying. The remaining wheat was left to sprout for a further 72 hours during which there occurred a growth of moulds but little change in sprout length.

Smoking and drying meat has been done for centuries ? it?s {{one of the oldest}} kinds of preservation. But, there are health concerns related to drying meat. As usual, preparation and washing {{needs to be done in}} a clean area, and boiled water should be used. And different kinds of meat will require different drying times and storage periods. But why dry meat at all? Martha Chindong finds out. IN:	?Well basically there are two reasons? OUT:	?when meat will be scarce. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 53 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Martha Chindong speaking to Chofor Ndimofor of the Ministry of Secondary Education in Cameroon. It is always best to seek advice about how long it is safe to dry your meat or fish. If it decays, it can cause serious illness. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ndimofor	Well basically there are two reasons. The first reason is that when meat is dried it is properly preserved and secondly it is a way of improving the taste of the meat. People consider dry meat as a delicacy. Chindong	So which type of meat or fish are also best to dry? Ndimofor	Well, as you see presently, I am in the process of drying a rabbit. Chindong	What of fish? Ndimofor	Yes fish, all kinds of fish can be dried, especially fish that is not too oily and which does not have a lot of water. We are thinking of fish like mackerel. Chindong	So how do you just get started?Just describe one, how you get started with at least one? Maybe this here rabbit which I see in front of you? Ndimofor	All right, in order to dry a rabbit, the first thing is you select a healthy rabbit, one that is not lean, one that is in good health. You kill it, you skin it and then you open it up. You actually open it up in such a way that it is spread out and you can use pieces of stick to get it well spread out so that it remains in shape. And then you salt it with brine; that is you put some salt in water and steep it in it for a while. You hang it out or you expose it in the sun to drip a little then you put it over the fire as you see me doing. Chindong	So is that the same process you do for meat and fish? Ndimofor	No, for meat you have to choose meat that does not have too much fat because too much fat will not enhance the drying process. Then the meat should be lean, it should not have too much fat and the best way is for you to slice it into strands. When you slice it into strands you treat it with brine in the same way. Sometimes in order to give added flavour you might like to spice it with other ingredients, maybe curry, maybe ginger then you hang it out to drip and then you put the strands either over a grill or you hang them from a hook or a rope over a fire, a smoke fire. Chindong	Smoke fire like what we are seeing? Ndimofor	Yes, what we are seeing, we are using the grill now. There is fire under the grill, not burning into flames but only producing the smoke and heat that go up to <b>dehydrate</b> the <b>meat</b> and after some three or four hours the <b>meat</b> is well <b>dehydrated</b> and now you only leave it for sometime to get properly dried. Chindong	Is it within the reach of smallscale farmers living in the villages? Ndimofor	Yes, I think it is within the reach of smallscale farmers. I say it is within their reach because the materials are not expensive. Chindong	So you have constructed it with what type of material? Ndimofor	Burnt bricks and then he will need to have a good piece of grill which cannot be rusted. The best one within the reach of the people in the rural areas is the traditional everyday fire with which they prepare their meals. What they do is they prepare their meat or whatever animal they have to smoke or dry and just hang it over the fireplace. Chindong	So, Mr Chofor Ndimofor, this meat that you have dried can keep for how long? Ndimofor	Ah, it depends. If you really want the meat to keep for long it should be properly dehydrated. The only things is that you should avoid during that time, you should avoid it coming into contact with moisture. Chindong	When it comes in contact with moisture can it be contaminated? Ndimofor	Oh yes, when it comes in contact with moisture you know especially in rural areas there is this tendency that it can fall out of the containers and when it falls out of the containers onto the ground it can pick up dirt and germs and all kinds of things. When dry meat gets into contact with moisture maggots tend to infest it and it will reduce the quality and also the look of it and nobody would really like to eat it. Chindong	What advice do you have for farmers? What message do you have for people who are interested in drying meat? Ndimofor	Yes what I have to say is, you know in the first place why do we dry meat? We dry meat because there are certain seasons when you have abundance of meat. Use that opportunity to dry the meat and preserve it for when meat will be scarce. End of trackHow to get the most from your mea...|$|R
