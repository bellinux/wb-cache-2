40|$|T cells {{respond to}} peptide antigen in {{association}} with MHC products on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). A number of accessory or costimulatory molecules have been identified that also contribute to T cell activation. Several of the known accessory molecules are expressed by freshly isolated dendritic cells, a distinctive leukocyte {{that is the most}} potent APC for the initiation of primary T cell responses. These include ICAM- 1 (CD 54), LFA- 3 (CD 58), and class I and II MHC products. Dendritic cells also constitutively express the accessory ligand for CD 28, B 7 /BB 1, which has not been previously identified on circulating leukocytes freshly isolated from peripheral blood. Dendritic cell expression of both B 7 /BB 1 and ICAM- 1 (CD 54) increases after binding to allogeneic T cells. Individual mAbs against several of the respective accessory T cell receptors, e. g., anti-CD 2, anti-CD 4, anti-CD 11 a, and anti-CD 28, inhibit T cell proliferation in the dendritic cell-stimulated allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) by 40 - 70 %. Combinations of these mAbs are synergistic in achieving near total inhibition. Other T cell-reactive mAbs, e. g., anti-CD 5 and anti-CD 45, are not <b>inhibitory.</b> <b>Lymphokine</b> secretion and blast transformation are similarly reduced when active accessory ligand-receptor interactions are blocked in the dendritic cell-stimulated allogeneic MLR. Dendritic cells are unusual in their comparably higher expression of accessory ligands, among which B 7 /BB 1 can now be included. These are pertinent to the efficiency with which dendritic cells in small numbers elicit strong primary T cell proliferative and effector responses...|$|E
40|$|The role of ion fluxes in the {{increased}} plasma membrane permeability of tumor cells {{exposed to the}} anticarcinogenic and tumor cell proliferation <b>inhibitory</b> <b>lymphokine,</b> leukoregulin, was examined by flow cytometic analysis of cell surface perturbations indicative of membrane destabilization. The pI 5. 3 form of leukoregulin was isolated by ion exchange, isoelectric focusing, and molecular sizing chromatography of lymphokines from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes. Membrane permeability increased within 5 min of leukoregulin exposure of tumor cells and was quantified by following the efflux of fluorescein or influx of propidium iodide. Membrane permeability increased in proportion to leukoregulin concentration. By 2 h, 0. 25 - 30 units/ml induces a 10 - 90 % change in K 562 erythroleukemia cell permeability. Similar changes are effected by Ca 2 + ionophores A 23187 and X- 537 A but not by the Na+ ionophore monensin or the K+ ionophore valinomycin. The Ca 2 + ionophores and the intracellular Ca 2 + mobilizers ouabain and amphotericin B enhance, whereas calmodulin inhibits leukoregulin action. Ca 2 + channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil and the Na+ and K+ ion transport inhibitors amiloride and atractyloside, respectively, neither alter membrane permeability nor influence leukoregulin activity. Further evidence {{for the role of}} increased Ca 2 + flux in leukoregulin's action is provided by detection of increased intracellular free Ca 2 + in leukoregulin-treated cells with the Ca 2 +-sensitive fluorescent probe 2 -[2 -bis(carboxymethyl) amino- 5 -methylphenoxy]methyl- 6 -methoxy- 8 -bis (carboxymethyl) aminoquinoline. Kinetic analysis of cell volume, forward and right angle light scatter, fluorescein efflux, and propidium iodide influx, moreover, reveals that the action of leukoregulin is unique. Membrane perturbations may be critical initial steps in the ability of leukoregulin to directly prevent the development of carcinogenesis as well as inhibit the continued proliferation of neoplastic cells...|$|E
40|$|When tuberculin-sensitive peritoneal exudate {{cells are}} {{incubated}} {{in a culture}} flask with tuberculin purified protein derivative, macrophage inhibition factor and other lymphokines are released into the culture medium. We have described how, if incubation is carried out in a stationary conical culture tube, intercellular contact between the peritoneal exudate cells is facilitated as the cells sediment into a pellicle {{at the bottom of}} the tube. This results in augmented release of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>lymphokines</b> into the supernatant culture medium with titers up to 109 times greater than those obtained by conventional culture methods using a flatbottomed culture dish or flask. When such high-titered inhibitory supernatants were subjected to fractionation by sequential Amicon ultrafiltration, two clearly distinct macrophage-inhibitory lymphokines were found. The first was present, after fractionation, in a titer of 1012, had a molecular weight in the range of 50, 000 to 100, 000, and was heat stable at 56 Â°C for 1 h. This moiety is probably identical to guinea pig macrophage inhibition factor. Unexpectedly, a second heat-labile inhibitory substance with a molecular weight between 500 and 1, 000 was found in a titer of 104 after fractionation. This low-molecular-weight, heat-labile material may represent a new lymphokine with a direct inhibitory action on macrophage migration. Theoretically, the data are also consistent with the possibility that it could act as a chemical immunotransmitter which stimulates amplified production of macrophage inhibition factor by lymphocytes within the cell pellicle and leads indirectly to inhibition of macrophage migration...|$|R
40|$|Two {{consecutive}} daily i. m. {{injections of}} cyclosporin A (Cs A) (greater than 50 mg/kg) inhibited {{delayed type hypersensitivity}} (DTH) responses in mice immunized with SRBC. Maximal suppression was observed when Cs A was administered 24 and 48 h after sensitization. Culture of spleen cells from these animals with antigen, insoluble concanavalin A (iCon A) or PHA revealed inhibition of the production of two lymphokines: that inducing macrophage procoagulant activity (MPCA) and macrophage chemotactic factor (LDCF). The <b>inhibitory</b> effect on <b>lymphokine</b> production was not due to depletion of T cells. In vitro, 25 ng/ml Cs A suppressed T cell proliferative responses to antigen and mitogen but much higher doses were required to impair the response to LPS. Similar doses of Cs A also suppressed lymphokine production, but the responses of macrophages to these lymphokines was unaffected, even at doses which totally inhibited lymphokine production. Production of interleukin 1 by LPS stimulated macrophages was inhibited by Cs A only at concentrations much greater than those required to suppress lymphokine production...|$|R
