40|$|Abstract. The paper firstly numerically simulates the coupled {{model of}} {{triangle}} <b>fastening</b> <b>screw</b> threads {{in the application}} of ANSYS software. Calculate stress intensity of the screw thread on the axial pressure of 200 MPa. The fittest coupled turn number of the screw nut is designed to make sure the strength of coupled teeth and make every turn of the screw thread go on very well and also save material. The maximum equivalent stress of the screw thread changes linearly with the axial pressure. The stress of the thread's root is greater than that of the thread's top so that the root is easily damaged. The paper's research method can apply to the optimal design of the other patterns of screw thread's turn number...|$|E
40|$|Aim: As {{more and}} more dental {{practitioners}} are focusing on implant-supported fixed restorations, some clinicians favor the use of cement retained restorations while others consider screw retained prosthesis {{to be the best}} choice. Discussion: In screw-retained restorations, the <b>fastening</b> <b>screw</b> provides a solid joint between the restoration and the implant abutment, while in cement-retained prostheses the restorative screw is eliminated to enhance esthetics, occlusal stability, and passive fit of the restorations. The factors that influence the type of fixation of the prostheses to the implants like passivity of the framework, ease of fabrication, occlusion, esthetics, accessibility, retention and retrievability are discussed in this article with scientific studies demonstrating superior outcomes of one technique over another. Screwretained implant restorations have an advantage of predictable retention, retrievability and lack of potentially retained subgingival cement. However, a few disadvantages exist such as precise placement of the implant for optimal and esthetic location of the screw access hole and obtaining passive fit. On the other hand, cement retained restorations eliminate unesthetic screw access holes, have passive fit of castings, reduced complexity of clinical and lab procedures, enhanced esthetics, reduced cost factors and non disrupted morphology of the occlusal table. Conclusion: This article compares the advantages, potential disadvantages and limitations of screw and cement retained restorations and their specific implications in the most common clinical situation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} liaison to better integrate product model and assembly process model so as to enable sharing of design and assembly process information in a common integrated form and reason about them. Liaison {{can be viewed as}} a set, usually a pair, of features in proximity with which process information can be associated. A liaison is defined as a set of geometric entities on the parts being assembled and relations between these geometric entities. Liaisons have been defined for riveting, welding, bolt <b>fastening,</b> <b>screw</b> fastening, adhesive bonding (gluing) and blind fastening processes. The liaison captures process specific information through attributes associated with it. The attributes are associated with process details at varying levels of abstraction. A data structure for liaison has been developed to cluster the attributes of the liaison based on the level of abstraction. As information about the liaisons is not explicitly available in either the part model or the assembly model, algorithms have been developed for extracting liaisons from the assembly model. The use of liaison is proposed to enable both the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out, as well as maintaining integrity of both product and process models as the inevitable changes happen to both design and the manufacturing environment during the product lifecycle. Results from aerospace and automotive domains have been provided to illustrate and validate the use of liaisons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} achieving better convergence between different phases (here design and manufacturing) of the product development cycle. The use of liaison has been proposed to better integrate the product and assembly process. Two facets of integration have been addressed in this thesis. One is concurrent evolution of the process model with the product model {{and the second is}} associativity between product model and process model. A liaison data structure has been proposed, which is set of geometric entities, associated with one or more assembly process that acts as an interface between the product model and process model. As the liaison data is not available explicitly in the product model, a set of algorithms have been developed and implemented to identify and extract the geometric entities defined in the liaison data structure from assembly model. The proposed algorithms can identify and extract liaisons for riveting, welding, bolt <b>fastening,</b> <b>screw</b> fastening, adhesive bonding (gluing) and blind fastening. The developed algorithms have been implemented and tested. The process model needs to evolve with the product model concurrently so that any mistakes or infeasibility in the process model can be flagged right away. The use of liaison enables the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out. A framework based on liaison has been proposed and implemented to demonstrate the concurrent evolution of product and process model. Linking the changes in the product model to flag the changes (or at least identify the need for changes) in the process model forms the associativity problem. The liaison has been used for maintaining associativity between the product and process model. A framework has been proposed for maintaining associativity between product model and process model that makes use of expert knowledge or tribal knowledge to track impact of changes in product model or process model. An aircraft wing box has been used as an example to illustrate and validate the proposed approaches. Finally the thesis concludes by summarizing contributions of the research and outlining future work...|$|E

The most common wiring supported five digital connections (for up, down, left, and right movement, and one fire button), plus one pair of analog 100 kΩ potentiometers or paddles. Some computers supported additional buttons, and on some computers additional devices, such as a computer mouse, a light pen, and/or a graphics tablet were also supported via the game port. Unlike the basic one-button digital joysticks and the basic paddles, such devices were not typically interchangeable between different systems.|$|R

30|$|<b>Fastening</b> <b>screws</b> {{with the}} {{appropriate}} torque {{is very important for}} the success of an implant. First, fastening is done with a hand driver, and then final fastening must be done at a certain torque with a torque wrench. It is very important that to know whether we can exert a torque of how much with hand driver in advance. However, dentists may not have the same torque wrench that is used in the implant system of another dental clinic. There are also implant systems that do not have a torque wrench, and it is important for each dentist to know what torque can be exerted with the hand driver. Doing so requires the use of a torquemeter (Shiigai 2007), but it is not realistic for a general-practice dentist to be equipped with a torquemeter. Therefore, we have developed and introduce here a simple adapter that makes it possible to use a standard torque wrench already in one’s possession to measure the torque that can be exerted with a hand driver.|$|R

30|$|To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of the number of <b>fastened</b> self-tapping <b>screws</b> on the strength of a connection, this study tested Japanese cedar glulam beam–girders fastened using the face-nailing approach. In general, the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with 12 self-tapping screws was 11.7  % higher than that with 8 screws. Findings further showed the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with a half-threaded shank and self-tapping screws had significant improvement when increasing from 8 to 12 screws, i.e., 38.6 and 63.3  % for 8 and 10  mm screws (F 8 - 260 - 12 and F 10 - 260 - 12), respectively. However, no further improvement in the maximum load capacity was found for the double-threaded and fully threaded screws as assembled from 8 to 12 <b>screws.</b> Some specimens <b>fastened</b> with 12 <b>screws</b> failed with a split along the glue line where screws were arranged during the assembly. It might limit the improvement of a connection through increasing number of fasteners. In the case of initial stiffness of a beam–girder connection, an improvement of 50.4  % was found when the number of self-tapping screws used to assemble the glulam structure was increased from 8 to 12. It also was noticed that the initial stiffness of the connection was doubled for the 8 -mm screw with double-threaded sections (FD 8 - 300 - 12).
