25|$|Recklessness {{among the}} boatmen was common. Many {{accidents}} {{were due to}} excessive speed. Aqueduct #3 (Catoctin) had a sharp bend at the upstream end, had been {{the site of a}} number of collisions from boatmen <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast.</b> In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless boatmen in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.|$|E
25|$|Railway {{companies}} in England, the London and South Western operating from 1843 from Southampton then the Great Western in 1889 introduced ships from Weymouth to transport their passengers and freight from their trains to the Islands. The competition {{was high and}} was a contributing factor in the Stella (LSWR) <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> in fog and hitting the Casquets, with the Ibex (GWR) hitting Corbiere. Rivalry stopped as customers wanted safety over excessive speed.|$|E

500|$|Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood {{addressed}} the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood {{stressed the importance}} in American history {{of the events that}} were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. [...] For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: [...] "I believe we have been <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast,</b> and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning." [...] Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.|$|E

2500|$|Besides cutting travel time, the Cut-Off {{required}} fewer {{engines to}} pull eastbound freights {{up to the}} summit at Port Morris. For westbound freights, the challenge was keeping trains from <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>fast.</b> Initially, no speed limit existed on the Cut-Off, with engineers (both freight and passenger) being expected to exercise [...] "good judgment". By the 1920s, however, most freights were restricted to [...] or less, depending on the priority of the train {{and the type of}} locomotive and rail cars. By 1943, [...] rail had been installed on the Cut-Off, which permitted fast freights to run at [...] through the Erie Lackawanna years. After Conrail took over operations in 1976, the speed limit was decreased to 50mph.|$|E

According to our view, subjects with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) present more or less disabilities, delays and deviances, to perceive and integrate environmental world’s sensory events online and to produce realtime sensorymotor coupling and adequate verbal and nonverbal outputs, {{from the beginning of}} their life. In other words, the environmental world is <b>going</b> and changing <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> for persons with ASD. In the first paragraph, we present some biographical self-reports, clinical considerations and neuropsychological arguments, which open windows on the peculiar visual and visuo-motor world of autistic persons. In the second paragraph, we expose the available experimental results in favour of physical and biological motion integration disorders in autistic population, and we expose a first synthesis of our approach.

50|$|Know Your Speed: For this year, this {{challenge}} {{has been extensively}} overhauled, with the challenge now requiring the drivers to drive a mobile home down a long straight course, with a target speed of 30 km/h in the first section, 50 km/h in the second, and 70 km/h in the third section. The speedometer will be blacked out, however, forcing the drivers to use their judgement in finding the correct speed. Krystal {{is supposed to be}} first-up, but gets into an argument with Steven over her continued insistence on using her phone while at the wheel, and then when Andrew tells her that she's making a fuss over nothing, she storms off and refuses to attempt the challenge. Tyler's run proves much less dramatic, but he still drives well over the target speeds, <b>going</b> 15 km/h <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> in the first section and 20 km/h <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> {{in the second and third}} sections. Daniella goes 10 km/h <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> in the first section, despite her fears of driving at speed, but is on-target in the second section, and actually 10 km/h too slow in the third section. Mike is even more over-cautious, going around 10 km/h too slow in all three sections. Lou is the slowest of all, however, by 10 km/h in the first section, and 20 km/h in the second and third. Krystal, after making an implied threat to quit the show unless Andrew apologizes for what she claims to be overly vindictive behaviour towards her, finally relents and undertakes the challenge; when she does so, she speeds far more even than Tyler did, going double the speed limit in the first section, 40 km/h <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> in the second, and 30 km/h <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> in the third.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Oak carried about him, {{by way of}} watch, {{what may}} be called a small silver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and a small clock as to size. This {{instrument}} being several years older than Oak's grandfather, had the peculiarity of <b>going</b> either <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> or not at all. The smaller of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round on the pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to. The stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes, and he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations {{of the sun and}} stars, and by pressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours' windows, till he could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within. It may be mentioned that Oak's fob being difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers (which also lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side, compressing the mouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion required, and drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a well.|$|R
60|$|I slipped aside a {{panel in}} the curious old windows, and {{looked down into the}} court {{surrounded}} by the university buildings. I fancied the old times when students, with their scholastic caps and books, were momently passing and repassing. I thought of the stir there was here when the pope's bull against Luther came out, and of the pattering of feet and commotion there were in this court, when Luther sallied out to burn the pope's bull under the oak, just beyond the city wall near by. The students thought it good fun; students are always progressive; they admired the old boy for his spirit; they threw up caps and shouted, and went out to see the ceremony with a will. Philip Melanchthon wondered if brother Martin was not <b>going</b> a little <b>too</b> <b>fast,</b> but hoped it would be overruled, and that all would be for the best! So, coming out, I looked longingly beyond the city gate, and {{wanted to go to the}} place of the oak tree, where the ceremony was performed, but the party had gone on.|$|R
