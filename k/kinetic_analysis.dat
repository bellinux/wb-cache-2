5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{mechanism}} of actin filament initiation by Arp2/3 has been disputed. The question {{is where the}} complex binds the filament and nucleates a [...] "daughter" [...] filament. Historically two models have been proposed. [...] Recent results, and the balance of opinion in the field, favour the side branching model, in which the Arp2/3 complex binds {{to the side of}} a pre-existing ("mother") filament at a point different from the nucleation site. Although the field lacks a high-resolution crystal structure, data from electron microscopy, together with biochemical data on the , favour side branching. [...] In the alternative barbed end branching model, Arp2/3 only associates at the barbed end of growing filaments, allowing for the elongation of the original filament and the formation of a branched filament. This model, which is based on <b>kinetic</b> <b>analysis</b> and optical microscopy, is decreasingly favoured by the field.|$|E
