5|$|The {{two nations}} had last met at The Oval in the Fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series, during Australia's {{previous}} tour of England. On that occasion, England made a Test world record score of 903/7 declared, and Len Hutton made 364, an <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> world record. Australia batted in both innings with only nine men {{because of injuries}} sustained by Bradman and Jack Fingleton during Hutton's 13-hour marathon effort. They collapsed to the heaviest defeat in Test history, by an innings and 579 runs. It was Australia's last Test before World War II and they had not lost a Test since then.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{scored a}} Test century {{for the first}} time in his fifth Test match in 1993 against Australia. His score of 277 in that match is the fourth-highest maiden century in Test history. The 375 he made against England in 1994 was the highest <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> score for nine years, until Matthew Hayden surpassed it in 2003. Lara regained the world record in 2004 when he made an unbeaten 400, once again against England. It is also the only quadruple century in Test cricket. The unbeaten 153 he scored against Australia in 1999 was rated as the second-best Test innings of all time by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2001. He has scored more than 200 runs on nine occasions, the highest after Donald Bradman. Alongside Sir Donald Bradman, Virender Sehwag and Chris Gayle, he is one of four batsmen who have scored triple centuries on two occasions. Lara scored 34 centuries during his Test career, the highest number by a West Indian player. He is ranked third for the highest number of centuries in a career along with Sunil Gavaskar and Jacques Kallis, behind Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting.|$|E

25|$|In February and March 2004, Bangladesh toured of Zimbabwe. At the time, Zimbabwe {{were without}} {{many of their}} senior players, but still won the Test series 1–0 and the ODI series 2–1. The solitary ODI victory was Bangladesh's first {{international}} win since defeating Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup; Ashraful scored 51runs from 32balls in the match and was named man of the match. Ashraful returned to the team in December 2004 against the Indian cricket team and scored his second century, 158 not out, claiming {{the record for the}} highest <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> score by a Bangladeshi.

25|$|Hayden {{holds the}} record for the highest score made by an Australian batsman in Tests (380). His innings of 201 against India in Chennai remains the 2nd highest score by an Australian in India.

Upon his retirement, in January 2009, Hayden's Test average was 50.7; he had scored the second most runs in Test cricket by an opening batsman; and was equal 6th (with Jacques Kallis) on the all-time list for Test centuries.Hayden holds {{the record for}} the highest <b>individual</b> <b>test</b> score by an opening batsman in test history(380).|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his team's difficulties, wicket-keeper/batsman Andy Flower was at one point rated the best batsman in world cricket.

Murray Goodwin was also a world-class batsman; following his retirement from international cricket, he has scored heavily for Sussex. Another world-class batsman was David Houghton, who holds {{the record for the}} highest <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> score for Zimbabwe of 266 against Sri Lanka in 1994/95.

25|$|After {{losing the}} first series {{of his second}} {{captaincy}} period to world champions Australia, Lara secured success against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, before another poor run saw 3–0 defeats in 4-Test series against both South Africa and England. In the drawn fourth Test against England, Lara became the only man to regain the world record for highest <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> score by scoring 400 not out, once again in Antigua, bettering Matthew Hayden's 380 against Zimbabwe the previous year. The West Indies were then whitewashed 4–0 in England. Lara's last act as captain was to win the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, a one-day competition {{second only to the}} Cricket World Cup, at the Oval, London – a win that was a welcome surprise for the Caribbean which had just been hit by Hurricane Ivan.|$|E
25|$|Walsh won the toss and batted, {{and the two}} new openers {{were soon}} back in the pavilion, Caddick and Fraser picking up the wickets in their first spells, leaving the home side 12/2 and {{bringing}} Lara to the crease early in the day. By the close of play, he was still there, 164 not out, had added 179 with Jimmy Adams (59), and was already dominating his partnership with Keith Arthurton (47). These two added 187 for the fourth wicket as Lara despatched the bowling to {{all parts of the}} ground, his second century coming in just 131 balls. Chanderpaul (75*) joined him in the last session of the second day, as Lara progressed to 320, and they continued the next morning, adding a total of 219 before Lara was finally dismissed by Caddick for a new <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> batting record of 375, and Walsh promptly declared.|$|E
25|$|However, he {{did play}} in the Caribbean series in 1929–30, and {{it was here that}} he {{achieved}} his greatest fame. In the first Test at Bridgetown he made 152 and 51. In the next two games he failed completely, making 0 and 5 at Port of Spain and then 9 and 0 at Georgetown. In the fourth and final Test at Kingston, however, he became the first Test triple-centurion when he compiled a mammoth 325 out of England's equally imposing total of 849, beating R. E. Foster's <b>individual</b> <b>Test</b> score record of 287, which had stood for twenty-seven years. The theoretically timeless match was in fact abandoned as a draw after nine days, but Sandham had still had time to make 50 in the second innings; he had scored 592 runs in the series. His aggregate of 375 in the match stood as the Test record until Greg Chappell eclipsed it. He made the runs with a long-handled bat borrowed from his captain Freddie Calthorpe and a pair of ill-fitting boots borrowed from Patsy Hendren. At 39 years and 272 days, he is, by almost five years, the oldest player to break the individual scoring record in Tests.|$|E
