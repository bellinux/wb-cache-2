40|$|Integrating {{concurrent}} and {{object-oriented programming}} as been an active research topic {{since the late}} 1980 s. There is now a plethora of methods for achieving this integration. The majority of approaches have taken a sequential object-oriented language and made it concurrent. A few approaches have taken a concurrent language and made it object-oriented. The most important of this latter case is the Ada 95 language which is an extension to the object-based concurrent programming language Ada 83. Arguably, Ada 95 does not fully integrate its models of concurrency and object-oriented programming.

As it stands the language is highly encapsulated and highly <b>extensible.</b> Subsequent <b>papers</b> will exploit the mathematical structure to form extensions of the language with parameterized types and inheritance.

40|$|Recent IDEs {{have become}} more {{extensible}} tool platforms but do not concern themselves with how other tools running on them collaborate with each other. They compel developers to use proprietary representations or the classical abstract syntax tree (AST) to build source code tools. Although these representations contain sufficient information, they are neither portable nor <b>extensible.</b> This <b>paper</b> proposes a tool platform that manages commonly used, finedgrained, information about Java source code by using an XML representation. Our representation is suitable for developing tools which browse and manipulate actual source code since the original code is annotated with tags based on its structure and retained within the tags. Additionally, it exposes information resulting from global semantic analysis, which is never provided by the typical AST. Our proposed platform allows the developers to extend the representation {{for the purpose of}} sharing or exchanging various kinds of information about the source code, and also enables them to build new tools by using existing XML utilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} ωB- and ωS-regular {{languages}} satisfy the following separation-type theorem If L 1, L 2 are disjoint languages of ω-words both recognised by ωB- (resp. ωS) -automata then there exists an ω-regular language Lsep that contains L 1, and whose complement contains L 2. In particular, if a language and its complement are recognised by ωB- (resp. ωS) -automata then the language is ω-regular. The result is especially interesting because, as shown by Bojańczyk and Colcombet, ωB-regular languages are complements of ωS-regular languages. Therefore, the above theorem shows that these are two mutually dual classes that both have the separation property. Usually (e. g. in descriptive set theory or recursion theory) exactly one class from a pair C, Cc has the separation property. The proof technique reduces the separation property for ω-word languages to profinite languages using Ramsey’s theorem and topological methods. After that reduction, {{the analysis of the}} separation property in the profinite monoid is relatively simple. The whole construction is technically not complicated, moreover it seems to be quite <b>extensible.</b> The <b>paper</b> uses a framework for the analysis of B- and S-regular languages {{in the context of the}} profinite monoid that was proposed by Toruńczyk. 1...|$|R
40|$|AIPS is {{a system}} for {{graphically}} presenting information. It promotes {{a high degree of}} interactivity between a user and a knowledge base or knowlege-based system, and is designed to be utmost domain independent and <b>extensible.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes the concept of an Information Presentation System (IPS), the intimate relationship between IPS goals and knowledge representation issues, and some of the architecture of AIPS. I Information Presentation Interactive graphics is an indispensible technique for putting people in touch with a large knowledge base or knowledge-based system. Graphic output {{is the best way to}} communicate a substantial amount of information to a human user because it exploits the high-bandwidth human visual channel. Graphic input (i. e. user input which points at or otherwise indicates components of a graphic display) is an extremely economical way to describe something; it is much easier to designate an existing depiction than to generate some other descriptor. The descriptional economy of graphic input promotes a feeling of immediacy; the user has the sense of interacting directly with information rather than dealinq with an intermediary. For these reasons, interactive graphics can play an important role in larqe knowledge-based systems, whether at the interface to the end user or at the interface to the implementor or maintainer. That role is not diminished by progress in natura...|$|R
40|$|Policy-based Management {{has been}} the subject of {{extensive}} research over the last decade. More recently, the IETF has been investigating Policy-based Networking as a means for managing IP-based multi-service networks with quality of service guarantees. Policies are seen as a way to guide the behaviour of a network or distributed system through high-level, declarative directives. We mainly view policies as a means of extending the logic of a management system at runtime, so that it can be adaptive to changing or newly emerging requirements. We are interested in particular in the coexistence of "hard-wired" hierarchical management systems with policy logic in a fashion that the overall system becomes programmable and <b>extensible.</b> In this <b>paper</b> we consider generic issues behind hierarchical policy-based management systems and we present initial work on such a system for dimensioning and dynamic resource management in IP Differentiated Services networks...|$|R

An extremely useful approach to profile traffic is to extract and display to a network administrator the multi-dimensional hierarchical heavy hitters (HHHs) of a dataset. However, existing schemes for computing HHHs have several limitations: 1) they require significant computational overhead; 2) they do not scale to high dimensional data; and 3) they are not easily <b>extensible.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we introduce a fundamentally new approach for extracting HHHs based on generalized frequent item-set mining (FIM), which allows to process traffic data much more efficiently and scales to much higher dimensional data than present schemes.

40|$|Along with {{increased}} {{complexity of the}} models used for scientific activities and engineering come diverse and greater uncertainties. Today, effectively quantifying the uncertainties contained in a model {{appears to be more}} important than ever. Scientific fellows know how serious it is to calibrate their model in a robust way, and decision-makers describe how critical it is to keep the best effort to reduce the uncertainties about the model. Effectively accessing the uncertainties about the model requires mastering all the tasks involved in the numerical experiments, from optimizing the experimental design to managing the very time consuming aspect of model simulation and choosing the adequate indicators and analysis methods. In this paper, we present an open framework for organizing the complexity associated with numerical model simulation and analyses. Named mtk (Mexico Toolkit), the developed system aims at providing practitioners from different disciplines with a systematic and easy way to compare and to find the best method to effectively uncover and quantify the uncertainties contained in the model and further to evaluate their impact on the performance of the model.
