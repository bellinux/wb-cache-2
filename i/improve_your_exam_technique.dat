40|$|Here {{are some}} tips to help you stay calm during exams, {{so that you can}} reach your potential. 1. Start to prepare for <b>your</b> <b>exams</b> well in advance. Try to keep up with your uni work on a day to day basis if you can. Avoid relying on last minute cramming {{in the days leading up}} to an exam. 2. Put the exam in perspective. It is only an exam. The result is not a {{reflection}} of who you are as a person. If you invest too much of your self-worth in studying and exams it can create additional stress and anxiety. 3. Get a good night’s sleep beforehand. It’s important that you feel rested on the day of the exam. Even 4 - 5 hours may be enough. It’s hard to produce your best work in the exam if you are feeling exhausted. 4. Eat sensibly before the exam. Some people overeat when they are feeling anxious, while others stop eating at all. Eating a nutritious meal can help you feel physically comfortable and stay alert and focused for <b>your</b> <b>exam...</b>|$|R
