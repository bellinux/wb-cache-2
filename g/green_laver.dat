On {{the evening of}} the 29th, Kenyon was playing bowls with some friends when he was approached on the bowling <b>green</b> by <b>Lavers,</b> who shouted he (Kenyon) was wanted by [...] "the Queen's Shades." [...] Kenyon told Lavers to go away and said he would speak to him after the game had finished, but Lavers set upon Kenyon quite violently, with both men struggling to the ground. Bystanders came to the assistance of the Head Constable and assisted him in binding Lavers' hands and feet with rope. Such was his struggling that they kept him bound and conveyed him to the police station in a wheelbarrow. Lavers was charged in court with assault and sentenced to two months imprisonment.|$|R
40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} and phosphor& in Hakata Bay are the effluent from the sewage disposal plants and the bay sediments. The present paper deals with the utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus which are contained in the effluent from Fukuoka Eastern Sewage Disposal Plant and released from the sediment in Hakata Bay by an important laver in fishery, Porphyra yezoensis and its competitors such as <b>green</b> <b>lavers</b> Enteromorpha sp. andUlva pertusa and also a diatom Skeletonema costatum. 1. All lavers used in the experiment utilized NH_ 4 -N from the effluent and bay sediment rather than NO_ 3 -N in the standard medium. The weight increment of Enteromorpha sp. was the highest among the tested lavers corresponding to about twice that of F! yezoensis, but no difference was observed in absorption of N and P between both lavers. Those of U. pertusa were the lowest among the lavers used. 2. Although the growth of S. costatum decreases with lowering temperature, its weight gain and the absorbed amounts of N and P were much larger as {{compared with those of}} P. yezoensis even at 10 ℃, corresponding to 15, 6 and 12 times, respectively. 3. The growth of P. yezoensis was not affected by S. costatum coexisting in the same media, when the amounts of nutrients in the media were sufficient. 4. The growth of P. yezoensis and S. costatum was inhibited with the increase of NH_ 4 -N level in media more than 8 mg/l and 12 mg/l, respectively. However, S. costatum was more affected by the high level of NH_ 4 -N than P. yezoensis, resulting in the rapid decrease of cell number and the death of almost all cells at 32 mg/l after 4 days culture, whereas in the same medium P. yezoensis showed the growth ca. half that in the standard medium (NO_ 3 -N) after 3 days. 5. The toxicity of NH,-N to P. yezoensis in the effluent media was lower than that in the artificial media which contain NH_ 4 Cl as N-source, resulting in the almost same growth even at 14 mg/l of NH_ 4 -N with that in the standard media containing NaNO_ 3 as N-source. 博多湾のN,Pは主に下水処理場放流水や湾底泥から供給される. 本研究では,冬季における主要養殖対象藻類であるスサビノリを中心とし,その競合藻類であるアオノリとアナアオサならびに珪藻プランクトンスケレトネマによる放流水および湾底泥由来のN･Pの利用性について検討した. 1. スサビノリ,アオノリおよびアナアオサは,いずれもNO_ 3 -Nよりも放流水および湾底泥由来のNH_ 4 -Nをよく利用した. 藻体増重量はアオノリが最も高く,スサビノリの約 2 倍の値を示したが,両者のN･P取込量の差は殆ど見られなかった. アナアオサのそれらは三者の中でいずれも最低であった. 2. 10 ℃の低温においても 4 日間の培養によるスケレトネマの増重量,NおよびPの取込量は,スサビノリに比べてそれぞれ 15 倍, 6 倍および 12 倍の大きな値を示した. 3. スサビノリは,培地中の栄養塩が充分であれば,スケレトネマが共存し増殖しても,その生長を阻害されなかった. 4. スサビノリの生長は人工培地のNH_ 4 -N濃度が 8 mg/l以上で,またスケレトネマの増殖は 12 mg/l以上で阻害されたが,NH_ 4 -N濃度がさらに高まった場合,スケレトネマの増殖が急激に減少し, 32 mg/lでは死滅したのに対して,スサビノリは 32 mg/lでも正常培地の約 1 / 2 の生長を示した. 5. スサビノリに対するNH_ 4 -Nの毒性は,放流水添加培地ではNH_ 4 Cl添加培地に比べてかなり弱まり, 14 mg/lでもNO_ 3 塩をN源とする基準培地とほぼ同程度の生長が認められた...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the matrix {{interference}} for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of inorganic arsenic species in seaweed by ion chromatography (IC) combined with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The matrix of seaweed has {{a significant effect on}} the determination of inorganic arsenic species. In particular, the retention times of inorganic arsenic species in the in the standard solution were different from those in seaweed because of the matrix interference. Thus, it was not suitable to use the chromatographic method for the determination of the arsenic species in seaweed. We investigated an alternative method for the determination of inorganic arsenic species in seaweed. The method was applied for the seaweed samples such as laver, <b>green</b> <b>laver,</b> sea tangle and sea mustard. The sample extraction methods of the arsenic species were also investigated in this study...|$|E
