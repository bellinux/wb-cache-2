5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within {{the outer edge of}} the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from <b>its</b> <b>surface.</b> From <b>its</b> <b>surface,</b> Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is the largest of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. <b>Its</b> <b>surface</b> features include large craters and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on <b>its</b> <b>surface,</b> making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{over many}} {{millions}} of years created a relatively featureless plain. Thirty-five million years ago, sluggish streams migrated laterally over <b>its</b> <b>surface.</b> Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5000|$|This {{process is}} at first {{directed}} lateralward, <b>its</b> two <b>surfaces</b> looking upward and downward; it then {{appears as if}} twisted inward upon itself, and runs forward, <b>its</b> <b>surfaces</b> now looking medialward and lateralward.|$|R
5000|$|Telefon Bay (Site F) has all <b>its</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{dating from}} 1967, thus {{allowing}} accurate monitoring of colonisation by plants and animals.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a parametric analysis of power generation from thermoelectric generators (TEGs). The {{aim of the}} parametric analysis is to provide recommendations {{with respect to the}} applications of TEGs. To proceed, the one-dimensional steady-state solution of the heat diffusion equation is considered with various boundary conditions representing real encountered cases. Four configurations are tested. The first configuration corresponds to the TEG heated with constant temperature at <b>its</b> lower <b>surface</b> and cooled with a fluid at <b>its</b> upper <b>surface.</b> Thesecond configuration corresponds to the TEG heated with constant heat flux at <b>its</b> lower <b>surface</b> and cooled with a fluid at <b>its</b> upper <b>surface.</b> The third configuration corresponds to the TEG heated with constant heat flux at <b>its</b> lower <b>surface</b> and cooled by a constant temperature at <b>its</b> upper <b>surface.</b> The fourth configuration corresponds to the TEG heated by a fluid at <b>its</b> lower <b>surface</b> and cooled by a fluid at <b>its</b> upper <b>surface.</b> It was shown that the most promising configuration is the fourth one and temperature differences up to 70 °C can be achieved at 150 °C heat source. Finally, a new concept is implemented based on configuration four and tested experimentally...|$|R

5|$|The Neptunian moons {{are listed}} here by orbital period, from {{shortest}} to longest. Irregular (captured) moons {{are marked by}} color. Triton, the only Neptunian moon massive enough for <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> to have collapsed into a spheroid, is bolded.|$|E
5|$|The Uranian {{system has}} been studied up close only once, by the {{spacecraft}} Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Titania, which allowed mapping of about 40% of <b>its</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|The antibody's {{paratope}} {{interacts with}} the antigen's epitope. An antigen usually contains different epitopes along <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants.|$|E
5000|$|The capitate is {{the largest}} carpal bone found within the hand. The capitate is found within the distal row of carpal bones. The capitate lies {{directly}} adjacent to the metacarpal of the ring finger on <b>its</b> distal <b>surface,</b> has the hamate on <b>its</b> ulnar <b>surface</b> and trapezoid on <b>its</b> radial <b>surface,</b> and abuts the lunate and scaphoid proximally.|$|R

5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was a typeI fireball, i.e. {{an ordinary}} chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44kg, which was estimated {{on the basis}} of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. <b>Its</b> <b>surface</b> melted and solidified again after leaving, which means <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within {{the outer edge of}} the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from <b>its</b> <b>surface.</b> It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour, and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. <b>Its</b> <b>surface</b> features include large craters and high mountains—some of them are comparable to the size of the moon itself.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} be geologically active (the others being Jupiter's Io and Saturn's Enceladus). As a consequence, <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> is {{relatively}} young with few obvious impact craters, and a complex geological history revealed in intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains. Part of <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> has geysers erupting sublimated nitrogen gas, contributing to a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere less than 1/70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.|$|E
50|$|STRV 1A and STRV 1B are cube-shaped micro-satellites {{each with}} a mass of 50 kg. They were {{launched}} into orbit to test new solar cells and measure static charge on <b>its</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Concrete objects, such as bridges, emit energy {{based upon}} the {{absolute}} temperature of <b>its</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the surface temperatures are dependent upon the internal conditions of the concrete. These internal conditions can include physical conditions like: ...|$|R
5000|$|Adding {{another element}} may degrade image quality if <b>its</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are less than}} {{perfectly}} flat and parallel. Filters from reputable makers are very unlikely to cause any problems, but some [...] "bargain" [...] products are optically inferior.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on <b>its</b> <b>surface,</b> and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|Upsilon Andromedae d {{lies in the}} {{habitable}} zone of Upsilon Andromedae A {{as defined}} both by the ability for an Earthlike world to retain liquid water at <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> {{and based on the}} amount of ultraviolet radiation received from the star.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> bind to {{a specific}} foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
50|$|When {{cleaning}} equipment it is near impossible {{to remove all}} the loose molecules. It is almost certain that traces of the chemical used to clean the equipment will remain on <b>its</b> <b>surfaces,</b> forming a microscopically thin layer.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a seal stone had {{different}} colors on <b>its</b> <b>surfaces</b> or inside {{the stone and}} the sculptor {{needed to make a}} perfect combination of these colors with their sculpture. In ancient Chinese this is called qiao diao (巧雕; roughly, [...] "sculpture of cleverness").|$|R
5000|$|Lighting and shading : The {{way that}} light falls on an object and {{reflects}} off <b>its</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and the shadows that are cast by objects provide an effective cue {{for the brain}} to determine the shape of objects and their position in space.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens <b>its</b> <b>surface</b> using their hands.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's moons, Titania is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. <b>Its</b> <b>surface</b> shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. <b>Its</b> <b>surface</b> is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference {{is related to the}} smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for <b>its</b> <b>surface,</b> and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
