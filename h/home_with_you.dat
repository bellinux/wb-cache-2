500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a {{grand piano}} for guests at a listening party for Artpop in Berlin's Berghain nightclub. She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' But I do have a home. I have a <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with tears in their eyes, watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing but her voice and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 October 1939, {{while on}} a {{reconnaissance}} mission as an observer, the Bristol Blenheim aircraft he was in was shot at, pursued, and forced into an emergency landing in Germany. Fripp and the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Mike Casey, were captured, along with Aircraftsman 1st class J Nelson, all of whom emerged with bruises and scrapes. From 1939 until 1945, Fripp was a prisoner of war. [...] On 25 October Fripp {{wrote a letter to}} his wife from [...] Kriegsgefangenen-Mannschafts-Stammlager VII-A in Moosburg, Germany; Fripp assured his wife of his well-being and suggested that Germany might be a nice place to visit for their honeymoon. He and six other airmen were allowed to record thirty-second Christmas messages to their families, which were broadcast on shortwave radio from Berlin; Fripp sent greetings to his mother and told his wife, [...] "Although I shall not be at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in person, I shall be with you in spirit." [...] His wife was staying at his mother's home in Wimborne.|$|E
60|$|Lor. Come, {{thou art}} so {{suspicious}} upon an idle story! That woman I saw, I mean that little, crooked, ugly woman,--for t'other was a lie,--is no more thy wife,--As I'll go <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee,</b> and satisfy thee immediately, my dear friend.|$|R
40|$|We were {{thinking}} of home, yes! Of dear ones at home, When faint came the tap of the drum, And we listened again, for we hoped to be free, We hoped that our brave boys had come; There were tears in our eyes, as the drum beat once more, Our hearts seemed to thrill with sweetest joy, For the flag was in sight that would banish our pain, Restore to the mother her boy! CHORUS Hark! Hark! Hark! We hear them coming! Loved one, we’ll soon be <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee!</b> Oh! Ring the bells! Boom the guns! Shout hurrah! ‘Tis over, and all now are free! Hark! Hark! Hark! We hear them coming! Loved one, we’ll soon be <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee!</b> Hark! Hark! Hark! We hear them coming! Loved one, we’ll soon be <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee!</b> Hark! Hark! Hark! We hear them coming! Loved one, we’ll soon be <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee!</b> Oh! Ring the bells! Boom the guns! Shout hurrah! ‘Tis over, and all now are free! Oh! Ring the bells! Boom the guns! Shout hurrah! ‘Tis over, and all now are free! Oh! Ring the bells! Boom the guns! Shout hurrah! ‘Tis over, and all now are free! We had dreamed {{of the time when}} the war should be o’er, We felt that sweet peace hovered near, And we shouted as mortals ne’er shouted before, And gave the brave boys cheer on cheer! We’ll remember the boys who have opened the doors And said to the prisoner “go free!” That he might see the Union triumphant again And Freedom from sea to the sea...|$|R

[...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E

"My sister! {{my sweet}} sister! if a name [...] Dearer and purer were, {{it should be}} thine; [...] Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim [...] No tears, but {{tenderness}} to answer mine: [...] Go where I will, to me thou art the same-- [...] A loved regret which I would not resign. [...] There yet are two things in my destiny,-- [...] A world to roam through and a <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Erling," [...] said Glumm, {{with a face}} so cheerful, {{that had}} the {{expression}} been habitual, {{he never would have}} been styled the Gruff, [...] "I will go <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> and wait until thou art busked, after which we will go together to my house and have a bite and a horn of mead before setting out on this expedition. I thank the Stoutheart for suggesting it, for the business likes me well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly," [...] {{said the}} master. [...] "But shan't I walk on <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{and we can}} talk {{together}} after your wound is attended to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} have only kept us waiting five minutes longer!" [...] thought Aspel, but he only said--"Come along, Phil, I'll go <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I love you, mamma, {{and that it}} kills me to be sent away from you. You will take me <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> now;--will you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marty," [...] Grace interrupted. [...] "I want <b>you</b> to walk <b>home</b> <b>with</b> me--will <b>you?</b> Come along." [...] And without {{lingering}} longer {{she took}} hold of Marty's arm and led her away.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, dear father--excuse my {{interrupting}} you--Harry and I {{are very}} anxious to spend our first day at <b>home</b> entirely <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and Kate. Don't {{you think it would}} be more pleasant? and then, to-morrow--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then come <b>home</b> <b>with</b> me. <b>You</b> {{shall see}} no one, {{and you will}} look up when you are not faint and fasting. You young men don't stand up against these things like us old stagers.' ...|$|R
60|$|III. Then, lastly, wise work is CHEERFUL, as a child's work is. And now I {{want you}} to take one thought <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and let it stay with you.|$|E
6000|$|The fellow gave {{a coarse}} laugh. [...] "Ha! ha! {{do you think}} I'm to be bluffed by a boy? Get <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> before I hammer you for calling me a thief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Hold your hand,’ cries Jasper, ‘and don’t throw while I stand so near him, or I’ll kill you! Come, Durdles; let me walk <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to-night. Shall I {{carry your}} bundle?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did," [...] {{said the}} young girl quietly. [...] "That's why you acted toward me as you did the night <b>you</b> walked <b>home</b> <b>with</b> me. <b>You</b> would not have behaved in that way to any San Francisco young lady--and I'm not one of your--fast--MARRIED WOMEN." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} we can't desert Sophy," [...] she replied, {{avoiding}} his eyes. [...] "She nearly always goes <b>home</b> <b>with</b> me. <b>You</b> see, although she seems quite a frivolous little person, {{she is really}} very useful to me--keeps my accounts, and {{all that sort of}} thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then it's to be {{supposed}} that we're all pleased. You needn't bring the whole Pasmer family <b>home</b> to live <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{if you do}} marry them all." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tedham {{took the}} note, but he said, {{holding it in}} his hand, [...] "I would a million times rather you would let me go <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and see Mrs. March a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{have been}} through it all before, and you are only wasting breath,” he said. “I am going <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> when you have taken Santa Marta, but until then I stay here.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A man doesn't, perhaps. But I have.... I want them--like hunger. YOUR children, and <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Really, {{continually}} you! That's the trouble.... I can't have 'em, Master, and I can't have you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The hack came {{in sight}} over {{the rise of}} ground, with Simpson driving furiously, {{as he always did}} when he saw people. Louise threw her arms round her friend again.

6000|$|... "Nay, but I would counsel you to {{take the}} men <b>home</b> along <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> so that they might use their persuasions," [...] {{returned}} Leif; [...] "but, as you say, it is not a likely course to take, even in that way. What, then, do you think, is wisest to be done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We hope {{to go back}} as soon as you are in {{travelling}} condition. If <b>you</b> {{will come}} <b>home</b> <b>with</b> us, <b>you</b> will be at hand when Mr. Edmonstone is ready to forgive, as I am sure he soon will be. No one ever was so glad to forget his displeasure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, old fellow, {{you just}} run along home," [...] ran the talk. [...] "Go on home {{and tell them}} what's {{happened}} to me. <b>Home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> you wolf. Get along home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a moment," [...] he pleaded. [...] "On second thought, I don't believe it's a {{good thing}} for me to go <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> It will only make further trouble for--for us both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What you do, Swallow, that I shall do, for am I {{not your}} slave {{bought at a}} great price? I will go <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and serve you, yes, to my life's end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I shall," [...] said Daniel, {{clasping}} Sir Hugo's caressing {{arm with}} both his hands. [...] "But shan't I come <b>home</b> and be <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in the holidays?" ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{come next}} to my ninth argument, and serve it as Hanun served David's {{servants}} (2 Sam 10:4), you have cut off one half of its beard, and its garments to its buttocks, thinking to send it <b>home</b> <b>with</b> shame. <b>You</b> state it thus: 'That by denying communion <b>with</b> unbaptized believers, <b>you</b> take from them their privileges {{to which they are}} born.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't count {{too much}} on that," [...] smiled the purser. [...] "Nobody is very {{particular}} in Spanish possessions, and it's quite possible they lost your message or couldn't decipher the English name. We shall fill up here with tourists, and if <b>you</b> are going <b>home</b> <b>with</b> us <b>you</b> must let me know." ...|$|R
