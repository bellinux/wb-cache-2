5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler {{was supposed to have}} been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the spot}} date falls {{before the end}} of the month but the {{resultant}} <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is beyond the end of the target month then the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is defined by convention to be the last business day of the target month. For example, assuming all days are business days: if the spot date is 30 January, a one-month time to expiry implies <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> 30 February—however, this doesn’t exist and the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> becomes 28 February (in a non-leap year).|$|R
5000|$|For a {{trade with}} time to expiry of y months, {{the expiry date}} is found by first calculating the spot date, then moving forward y months from the spot <b>date</b> to the <b>delivery</b> <b>date.</b> If the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is a non-business day or a US holiday, move forward until an {{acceptable}} <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is found. Finally, calculate the expiry date using an [...] "inverse spot" [...] operation; e.g., find the expiry date for which the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> would be its spot. When finding the expiry <b>date</b> from the <b>delivery</b> <b>date,</b> there must be one clear business day and one weekday (not including 1 January) in any applicable non-USD/non-CAD, non-USD/non-TRY, non-USD/non-PHP, non-USD/non-RUB, non-USD/non-KZT and non-USD/non-PKR currency. If one leg of the currency pair is a non-deliverable currency, the expiry date must be a business day of that currency.|$|R

5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} boats were all laid down between late 1915 and early 1916. Later in 1916, the seventh boat of the class, , was laid down, {{after having been}} {{presented}} to the Navy as a gift by the Österreichischen Flottenverein, and an eighth, , {{as a replacement for}} , which had been lost in May. The seventh and eighth boats were constructed by CNT at the Pola Navy Yard. Shortages of labor and materials plagued subcontractors and, consequently, the <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> for the boats were not met. However, the first six boats had all entered service by the middle of 1917.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and <b>delivery</b> <b>dates.</b> Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{defining}} {{elements of the}} model adopted by the new administration is the establishment of energy auctions as the main procurement mechanism for distribution companies to acquire energy to serve their captive consumers.

25|$|The 27th {{and last}} Tamar Class lifeboat, {{allocated}} to The Mumbles, was launched 12 March 2013 in Devonport Dockyard and after sea trials was {{handed over to}} the RNLI on 21 May 2013. 10 lifeboat stations keep Tamars moored afloat, 13 launch them down slipways, and the remaining 4 form a Relief Fleet to cover when boats are unavailable for service. Most of the slipway stations required entirely new boathouses and slipways to accommodate the Tamar, but at Cromer and Angle the existing fairly modern boathouses were adapted and at Sennen Cove the capacious old boathouse was able to be modified to take the new boat. Towards the end of Tamar production, the boathouse building programme fell behind boat <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> and the last four boats went on station moored afloat pending boathouse completion, which was not finally achieved until October 2016, when the new St. Davids boathouse was opened.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Finnlines {{decided to}} further simplify {{the myriad of}} names under which it {{operated}} ships, merging Finnlink and Nordö-Link into the parent company. Finnlines also ordered five new large ro-pax ferries from the Italian shipyard Fincantieri. After numerous delays, the first vessel, MS Finnstar was delivered in August 2006 for the Helsinki–Travemünde service, MS Finnmaid followed later in the same year, while MS Finnlady, MS Europalink and MS Nordlink were delivered in February, March and July 2007, respectively. Coinciding with the delivery of MS Nordlink the old MS Malmö Link was sold. In August 2007 {{it was reported that}} Finnlines has ordered six new ice classed roro vessels from the Jinling Shipyard in China, with planned <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> in 2010 for the first two vessels and 2011 for the remaining four. In January 2007 the Italian Grimaldi Group became the largest owner of Finnlines and expressed interest in purchasing the entire company. However, a public tender offer made to the other owners in November 2006 resulted in Grimaldi gaining only 85,029 stocks, or 0.18% of the total. On 25 August 2016, the Grimaldi Group completed the acquisition of Finnlines, getting the control of 100 per cent of the company.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was remarkably}} adept at {{recognizing}} new writing talent and making innovative works {{appealing to the}} public. More importantly, he functioned {{as a catalyst for}} experimentation by bringing disparate authors together. While Johnson promoted his authors, he retreated into the background himself. His friend John Aikin explained that he had [...] "a decided aversion to all sorts of puffing and parade"; Johnson's unassuming character has left historians and literary critics sparse material from which to reconstruct his life. For 200 years, it was assumed that all of Johnson's business records and correspondence had been destroyed, but in the early 1990s, one of his [...] "letter books" [...] was discovered in an old desk. It contained copies of letters written to business associates as well as friends from 1795 to 1809. His letters to other publishers discuss [...] "paper, printing, engraving costs, <b>delivery</b> <b>dates,</b> breaches of copyright, binding charges and accounts" [...] whereas his letters to friends include missives to Priestley, Maria Edgeworth, Erasmus Darwin, Charlotte Smith, and others. This material has allowed scholars to theorize more concretely about Johnson's life and work.|$|E
500|$|While {{awaiting}} official approval, Dutch planning went ahead. A {{contract with}} Ferrostaal A.G.

Two months later, talks were held in Bremen and Berlin (on 13 and 31July, respectively) in which the Germans agreed to release plans and drawings that, although not specifically of the Scharnhorst-class, would reveal their ideas on battlecruiser design. Delivered on 21 August of that year, these showed various modern protection schemes {{that could be used}} in the new battlecruisers. On 4 October 1939, a German admiral previously appointed as a liaison between the two navies asserted that while Germany could not guarantee punctual <b>delivery</b> <b>dates,</b> it could assure the Netherlands that it would pressure the companies to meet the contractual dates and that the Kriegsmarine would not interfere with orders from the same companies.

500|$|All three {{ships were}} laid down on 30 October 1911, {{but this was}} just a {{ceremonial}} event as the design had not yet been finalized nor the contracts signed. A contract was finally signed on 13 April 1912 with Russud that specified <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> of 2 September 1915 for both Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperator Aleksander III. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was built to a larger design that added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months after her half-sisters. Despite the demanding schedule the ships suffered from a number of delays during construction. On 10 February 1914 changes were ordered by the Naval Ministry to incorporate the lessons learned from the full-scale armor trials conducted using the Chesma. This added almost [...] of weight to the ships and raised their cost by 220,000–250,000 rubles. Other delays were incurred after the war began as imported components took longer to reach the shipyards and factories switched over to war production. The construction of Imperator Aleksander III was deliberately delayed in order to accelerate the completion of her two sisters and some of her turrets were transferred to Imperatritsa Mariya as well.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E
