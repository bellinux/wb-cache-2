5|$|<b>His</b> <b>thinking</b> threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the {{judicial}} function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, List {{initially}} {{devised the}} idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the Armanenschaft, an idea which had developed into {{a key part of}} <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> by 1908. List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland. He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as kala.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus... was {{the most}} eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the {{atmosphere}} in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all <b>his</b> <b>thinking....</b> Toward {{the end of his}} life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works.... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{was born}} in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch, {{concerned}} about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the Sultan {{to send him}} back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was unable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together {{with two of the}} Sultan's vassals tasked with escorting him, boarded the Opten Noort from Tanjung Priok and returned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed that he was to be married to the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a woman he had barely met. Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his final exam– and have one last meeting with Sundari. Several weeks later he returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant ceremony. His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference throughout the seven-day event was due to <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> of Sundari.|$|E
5|$|The unit's leader, Geoffrey Barkas (1896–1979) {{served in}} the 1915 Gallipoli {{campaign}} {{and then in the}} later part of the Battle of the Somme in France, where he won a Military Cross. Between the wars, Barkas was a filmmaker, working as a writer, producer, and director. In 1937, Barkas joined Shell-Mex/BP under its publicity director Jack Beddington, who guided Barkas into military camouflage. In May 1940, he was rapidly drafted into the Royal Engineers by Beddington's brother Freddie, with a summary 10-day basic training course, followed by a camouflage course. He developed <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> in Northern Ireland in 1940, teaching, running demonstrations, and writing an instructional pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. <b>His</b> <b>thinking</b> changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Shafi and {{his other}} {{conservative}} friends like Maulvi Rafi-ud-Din, Abdul Aziz and Syed Ali Raza opposed the co-operation between All-India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, {{on the grounds that}} it would sacrifice the Muslim majority in provinces of Punjab and Bengal. He wanted to stress the separate Muslim entity and refused to give up <b>his</b> <b>thinkings,</b> which according to him was very blood of the Muslim nation.|$|R

5|$|Graham {{subsequently}} held {{a series}} of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and armoured units. Volunteering for overseas service, he transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) on 26 July 1941. He was subsequently posted to the 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment as the adjutant, followed by attendance at the Staff School. Promoted to captain in September 1942, Graham briefly served on the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division before being attached to the British Army. Serving with the British 7th Armoured Division, he saw action with them in the North Africa and Italy 1943–44. Coming ashore {{on the first day of}} the Allied landing at Salerno, he was wounded but remained on duty. During this period he gained valuable operational experience in armoured warfare; while his service in North Africa may also have shaped <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> about the use of tactical minefields which had been used extensively during the mobile infantry and armoured battles of 1941–42.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to Louisiana upon graduating. According to Ann Waldron, the young Carter was an outspoken white supremacist, like most Southerners of that time, yet {{he began to}} alter <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> when he {{returned to}} the South to live.|$|E
25|$|In those days, the British in Calcutta {{often made}} {{offensive}} remarks to the Indians {{in public places}} and insulted them openly. This behavior of the British {{as well as the}} outbreak of World War I began to influence <b>his</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|E

60|$|The husband {{came out}} of <b>his</b> <b>thinkings</b> with a slight start, and gazed wistfully at his wife, whose face was become very pale; then he hesitatingly rose, and glanced furtively at his hat, then at his wife--a sort of mute inquiry. Mrs. Cox {{swallowed}} once or twice, with her hand at her throat, then in place of speech she nodded her head. In a moment she was alone, and mumbling to herself.|$|R
25|$|Known {{for books}} like Beyond the Melting Pot which deal with race and ethnicity, Glazer was {{critical}} {{of some of the}} Great Society programs of the mid-1960s and is often considered neoconservative in <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> on domestic policy though he remained a Democrat.|$|E
25|$|Later, his {{encounters}} with the Indigenous peoples of the Americas made a deep impression. The ability of the Iroquois to live in harmony with nature while achieving a democratic decision-making process helped him refine <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> on how to organize society.|$|E
25|$|Schoenberg's approach, both {{in terms}} of harmony and development, {{has been one of the}} most {{influential}} of 20th-century musical thought. Many European and American composers from at least three generations have consciously extended <b>his</b> <b>thinking,</b> whereas others have passionately reacted against it.|$|E

25|$|While at the college, Gibbs was {{influenced}} by three professors who would affect <b>his</b> <b>thinking</b> as a missionary, educator and politician.

25|$|For many years, York {{employed}} a secretary, Arthur S. Bushing, {{who wrote the}} lectures and speeches York delivered. Bushing prepared York's correspondence as well. Like the works of Cowan and Skeyhill, words commonly ascribed to York, though doubtless representing <b>his</b> <b>thinking,</b> were often composed by professional writers.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, Ogilvy persuaded {{his agency}} {{to send him}} to the United States for a year, where he went to work for George Gallup's Audience Research Institute in New Jersey.
