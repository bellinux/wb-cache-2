5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sky for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap {{the majority of their}} work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a fish-eater), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water (similar {{to the modern}} grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet {{pointed out that the}} spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to R. E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E

500|$|Depending on {{how fast}} the winds from a {{waterspout}} are whipping, anything that is within about one yard of {{the surface of the}} water, including fish of different sizes, frogs, and even turtles, can be lifted into the air.

Even if the waterspout stops spinning, the fish in the cloud can be carried over land, buffeted up and down and around with the cloud’s winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere.

500|$|The player fishes {{in pursuit}} of fame as a {{fisherman}} named Billy. The game mechanics are [...] "three tightly-woven minigames in one": casting the fishing line, catching fish, and shooting {{the fish in the}} air. The player casts the line and tilts the device to avoid the fish as the hook sinks. Upon hooking a fish, the hook ascends and the player tilts the device to catch as many fish as possible en route to the surface. Above water, the fish are launched into the air, and the player taps the screen to shoot the <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sky to earn money before they fall into the water. The fish differ in characteristics including swim pattern and the number of shots required to cash in. The jellyfish shot detract from the total income. There are four stages, each with its own visual and audio theme and rare fish, and an endless mode where players can work towards the highest score. Earnings can be spent in a store towards persistent upgrades such as longer fishing line length, invulnerable drills, frivolous hats, bigger guns, chainsaw lures, a hair dryer and toaster (to zap inadvertent catches), fuel for the chainsaw, and a necktie for greater income. There is also a Fish-o-pedia in Billy's smartphone that gives gameplay hints and tracks stats such as fish caught, which is the progress for unlocking new levels. There are no in-app purchases.|$|E

500|$|My Name Is My Name was {{met with}} {{universal}} acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 27 reviews. Mike Powell of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "He's still a witty, quietly vicious rapper, capable of tearing apart spare street tracks like [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and [...] "Numbers on the Board" [...] while barely raising his voice. But set in the more commercial contexts of Kelly Rowland features and the-Dream's fluorescent R, he can sound like a <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> some pretty expensive water. Who Pusha was is gone, but who he is still sometimes unclear." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "With Pusha's pen at full force and his performance a proper combination of cold and tense, the album is as if Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury were atom-smashed into something more artful and unstable. My Name Is My Name is a remarkable and vital solo debut." [...] Jesse Cataldo, writing for Slant Magazine, said, [...] "Yet despite its pedigree, the album puts too much overall emphasis on guest spots and not enough on establishing a distinctive identity for the rapper. Full of retrograde lyrical conceits, seemingly at odds with its futuristic backdrops, My Name Is My Name {{is a reminder that}} Pusha T hasn't changed, and his stubborn reliance on maintaining his brand is probably not the wisest strategy in today's shifting hip-hop climate." [...] Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "A few poor production choices and uneven sequencing do slow the album, but it shows flashes of real brilliance. The best tracks here are produced by Kanye and Pharrell, and they're concentrated at the beginning and end. The smattering {{in the middle of the}} tracklist is handled by host of collaborators, not all of them effectively complimenting Pusha's rawness. While not the defining statement it could’ve been, My Name Is My Name shows different sides of Pusha T as he becomes a more multidimensional rapper." ...|$|E

500|$|To hunt fish, {{the eagle}} swoops {{down over the}} water and snatches the <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have {{structures}} on their toes called spicules {{that allow them to}} grasp fish. Osprey also have this adaptation. Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a [...] mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawn. This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird. It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to [...] of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.|$|E
