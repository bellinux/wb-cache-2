5|$|Hela and {{the rest}} of the fleet {{anchored}} off Helgoland on 811 September. During the day the ships conducted training with steam tactics. On 11 September the ships returned to Wilhelmshaven where on the following two days the ships replenished their coal supplies. On 14 September the final operation of the annual maneuvers began. The situation specified that the naval war had gone badly for Germany; only four battleships were still in service, along with Hela, Freya, and a division of torpedo boats. The ships were to be stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river to protect the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and access to Hamburg. On 15 September, the <b>hostile</b> force blockaded the Elbe, along with other rivers and harbors on the North Sea. The torpedo boats, which had been scattered in the previous engagement, were tracked and destroyed by the <b>hostile</b> force. The <b>hostile</b> battleship squadron steamed to the mouth of the Elbe, where Hela, Freya, and the remaining torpedo boats were stationed as lookouts. Nothing happened during the day of 16 September, but that night several German torpedo boats managed to destroy one of the blockading cruisers and badly damage another. The following day, Prinz Heinrich engaged Hela and Freya briefly before forcing the two ships to retreat. The weather began to storm so the operation was postponed until the following day. That morning, the <b>hostile</b> fleet forced its way into the Elbe, past the fortifications at the mouth of the river. The German flotilla made a desperate attack which resulted in the sinking of two of the <b>hostile</b> battleships. The <b>hostile</b> force, however, ultimately overwhelmed the outnumbered German ships and the exercise ended with their victory.|$|E

5000|$|When the Dharma Initiative {{arrived on}} the Island, they fought with the Island's natives, known to them as the <b>Hostiles</b> and to the {{survivors}} of Flight 815 as the [...] "Others". The [...] "Hostiles" [...] had been living on the Island long before the Initiative arrived. The Arrow Station was eventually given a mission to observe and formulate strategies to counter the <b>Hostiles.</b> When Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) {{arrived on the}} Island in 1970, there was still an open conflict between the <b>Hostiles</b> and the Dharma Initiative. At some point prior to 1974, a truce of some kind was brokered with the <b>Hostiles.</b> A series of protocols were put into place between the <b>Hostiles</b> and the Initiative. Several episodes mention {{that there was a}} [...] "line" [...] and that certain parts of the Island were considered to be the [...] "territory" [...] of each group. This conflict ended in 1992, when Linus joined the <b>Hostiles,</b> who killed the Initiative, an event which became known as [...] "The Purge". The bodies were buried in a mass grave.|$|R
