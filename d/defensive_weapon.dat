5|$|Blank pistol {{cartridges}} carrying CS in {{powder form}} have been released to the public.

5|$|Despite being {{originally}} {{intended as a}} <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon</b> for military personnel whose primary role is not fighting with small arms (such as vehicle drivers), most sales of the P90 have been to special forces and counter-terrorist groups who use it for offensive roles. The P90 first saw operational use in the 1991 Gulf War, where it {{was used by the}} Belgian special forces group.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> capable of {{producing}} enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons</b> and their {{interaction}} with preemption. In a complete information setting, where attacks only occur as a consequence of predatory incentives, a unilateral acquisition of <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons</b> always destabilizes. Under strategic risk, where players might launch preemptive strikes, <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons</b> can help sustain peace. However, this only happens when such defensive systems are much more effective against a sneak attack than in an open war. Otherwise, <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons</b> are likely to also be destabilizing. We contrast these results with the effect of signing defensive alliances, which unambiguously bolsters the prospects of peace in both strategic settings...|$|R

50|$|Bombers are not {{intended}} to attack other aircraft although most were fitted with <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons.</b> World War II saw {{the beginning of the}} widespread use of high speed bombers which dispensed with <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons</b> to be able to attain higher speed, such as with the de Havilland Mosquito, a philosophy that continued with many Cold War bombers.|$|R
5|$|Some organisms, such as sharks, {{are able}} to detect and respond to changes in {{electric}} fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, {{are able to}} generate voltages themselves {{to serve as a}} predatory or <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon.</b> The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.|$|E
5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigadeâ€”a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries. In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon</b> against attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads and from the flanks of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.|$|E
5|$|One unusual <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon</b> was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located on {{the north}} side of the {{airfield}} at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was a good chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E

5|$|There were 32 IDWSs {{available}} to the Marine Corps in June 2012. The system had not been fired in combat as V-22s were routinely escorted by helicopter gunships and close air support aircraft, allowing them to focus on their transport role; squadrons also often flew without the belly gun, as the added weight reduced its cargo-carrying capacity. The Osprey's speed means that it can outrun supporting conventional helicopters, thus requiring a self-defense capability on long-range missions, and operate independently. The infrared gun camera has proven valuable for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons are being studied to provide an all-quadrant <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon</b> system including nose guns, door guns, and nonlethal countermeasures {{to work with the}} current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they did}} not get as much media {{attention}} as the offense, the 49ers' defense {{led the league in}} fewest points allowed during the regular season (227). All four of the 49ers' starting defensive backs, Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Carlton Williamson, and Dwight Hicks, were selected to play in the Pro Bowl. Pro Bowl linebacker Keena Turner was also a major <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> recording 2 sacks and 4 interceptions for 51 yards. Defensive end Dwaine Board anchored the line, recording 10 sacks and a fumble recovery.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from being}} a tool, the sonic {{screwdriver}} can be used and considered as a <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> which is effective for a few types of assault weapons, but not designed to kill or injure living things {{as the only way}} it can really hurt or incapacitate a creature is by emitting painful bursts of sound, or, as of Day of the Moon by blasting a green wave of energy to incapacitate a target, though only the Eleventh and Twelfth's sonic has been shown to do the latter.|$|E

25|$|New England's defense ranked 5th in {{the league}} in fewest yards allowed (5,048). Pro Bowl linebacker Andre Tippett led the AFC with 16.5 sacks and {{recovered}} 3 fumbles. Pro Bowl linebacker Steve Nelson was also a big <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> excelling at pass coverage and run stopping. Also, the Patriots' secondary only gave up 14 touchdown passes during the season, second fewest {{in the league}}. Pro Bowl defensive back Raymond Clayborn recorded 6 interceptions for 80 return yards and 1 touchdown, while Pro Bowler Fred Marion had 7 interceptions for 189 return yards.|$|E
25|$|From a poor {{defensive}} {{position on}} the baseline, the lob {{can be used as}} either an offensive or <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an overhead smash, a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the frill and horns is problematic. The horns are rather short and the frill had such large fenestrae {{that it could not}} have offered much functional defense. Paul suggested that the beak was the main <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon.</b> It is possible that the frill was simply used to appear imposing or conceivably for thermoregulation. The frill may also have been brightly colored, to draw attention to its size or as part of a mating display. However, it is difficult to prove any sexual dimorphism. In 1933, Lull suggested that C. kaiseni, which bore long brow horns, was in fact the male of C. belli of which the females would have short ones. In 1927 C.M. Sternberg concluded that of the two skeletons he had mounted in the Canadian Museum of Nature, the smaller one, NMC 2245, was the male and the larger, NMC 2280, the female. However, today the two are referred to different species.|$|E

40|$|The {{defense of}} plants against herbivores and {{pathogens}} involves {{the participation of}} an enormous range of different metabolites, some of which act directly as <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons</b> against enemies (toxins or deterrents) and some of which act as components of the complex internal signaling network that insures that defense is timed to enemy attack. Recent work reveals a surprising trend: The same compounds may act as both weapons and signals of defense. For example, two groups of well-studied <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons,</b> glucosinolates and benzoxazinoids, trigger the accumulation of the protective polysaccharide callose as a barrier against aphids and pathogens. In the other direction, several hormones acting in defense signaling (and their precursors and products) exhibit activity as weapons against pathogens. Knowing which compounds are <b>defensive</b> <b>weapons,</b> which are <b>defensive</b> signals and which are both is vital for understanding the functioning of plant defense systems...|$|R
500|$|The obverse {{design is}} a Longacre {{version of the}} Great Seal of the United States. His design focuses on the shield, or escutcheon, as a <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> {{signifying}} strength and self-protection through unity. The {{upper part of the}} shield, or [...] "chief", symbolizes Congress, while the 13vertical stripes, or [...] "paleways", represent the states; consequently the entire escutcheon symbolizes the strength of the federal government through the unity of the states. The crossed arrows represent nonaggression, but imply readiness against attack. The laurel branches, taken from Greek tradition, symbolize victory. In heraldic engraving, vertical lines represent red, clear areas white and horizontal lines blue, thus the escutcheon is colored red, white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag. The reverse contains the denomination [...] "2CENTS" [...] within a somewhat ornate wheat wreath. [...] The rest of the coin is filled with the name of the country.|$|E
500|$|At the 1934 party, Tesla {{told reporters}} he had {{designed}} a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He {{would call it}} [...] "teleforce", but was usually referred to as his death ray. Tesla {{described it as a}} <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon</b> that would be put up along the border of a country to be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.|$|E
500|$|According to numismatic author Q. David Bowers, Longacre's obverse {{design is}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{patriotic}} motifs in American coinage". Based on the coat of arms from the Great Seal of the United States of America, Longacre's design focused on the shield, or escutcheon as a <b>defensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> symbolizing strength and self-protection through unity. The {{upper part of the}} shield, or [...] "chief", symbolizes Congress, while the 13vertical stripes, or [...] "paleways" [...] symbolize the states; consequently the entire escutcheon symbolizes the strength of the federal government through the unity of the states. The crossed arrows, whose ends are visible {{near the bottom of the}} shield, symbolize nonaggression, but imply readiness against attack. The laurel branches, taken from Greek tradition, symbolize victory. In heraldic engraving, vertical lines represent red, clear areas white and horizontal lines blue, thus the escutcheon is colored red, white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag. Bowers does not consider the reverse design an artistic work, but one which is purely mechanical, obtained by punching characters and devices into a steel hub.|$|E
