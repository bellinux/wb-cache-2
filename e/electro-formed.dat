50|$|The LMT is a bent Cassegrain {{optical system}} with a 50m-diameter {{reflecting}} primary surface (M1) formed by 180 segments, these are distributed in five concentric rings. The number of segments in the rings, {{from the center of}} the dish to the outside are: 12, 24 and 48 in the three outermost rings. Each segment is connected to the structure of the telescope through four actuators, allowing to have an active reflecting primary surface. As well, each segment is formed by eight precision <b>electro-formed</b> nickel sub-panels. The reflecting secondary surface (M2) has a 2.6m diameter, also built by nine <b>electro-formed</b> nickel sub-panels, and is attached to the telescope with an active hexapod that allows precise focus, lateral offsets and tilts. The hexapod is attached to the telescope through a metal tetrapod. Finally, the reflecting tertiary surface (M3) is almost flat, elliptical with a 1.6m major axis and delivers the light beam to the receivers.|$|E
5000|$|She draws her inspirations {{from the}} worlds of nature and history, using organic objects such as seed pods, leaves, insects and skeletons, that are {{collected}} largely from where she lives, in the Savernake Forest. She uses a Renaissance ceramicist technique, [...] "casting from life," [...] where the pieces are <b>electro-formed</b> and cast in gold and silver, thereby transforming these raw objects into exact replicas of wearable art. All the jewellery is produced in small workshops in England, further giving the brand an English identity.|$|E
40|$|Electrolytic Copper {{used in the}} shaped charge liner {{manufacturing}} can {{be produced}} from acid solution using electro-deposition technique. The intensity of the applied electric current controls {{the quality of the}} produced copper grade. The electric current intensity within the electrolytic acidic solution cell with the minimum oxygen and sulfur elements in the produced copper was optimized and found to be 30 – 40  A/Ft 2. The elemental composition of the obtained electrolytic copper was determined using high-end stationary vacuum spectrometer, while the oxygen was determined precisely using ELTRA ONH- 2000 apparatus. Besides, SEM was used to investigate the shape of the copper texture inside the deposited layers and to determine the average grain size. New relations have been obtained between the applied current intensity and both the oxygen and sulfur contents and the average grain size of the produced copper. Experimental result showed that when the applied current density increases to a certain limit, the oxygen and sulfur content in the electrolytic copper decreases. Performance of the produced copper liner was investigated by the static firing of a small caliber shaped charge containing an <b>electro-formed</b> copper liners, where the penetration depth of the optimized electrolytic liner was enhanced by 22. 7 % compared to that of baseline non-optimized liner...|$|E
40|$|The LFI radiometers use a pseudo-correlation design {{where the}} {{signal from the}} sky is {{continuously}} compared with a stable reference signal, provided by a cryogenic reference load system. The reference unit is composed by small pyramidal horns, one for each radiometer, 22 in total, facing small absorbing targets, made of a commercial resin ECCOSORB CR (TM), cooled to approximately 4. 5 K. Horns and targets are separated by a small gap to allow thermal decoupling. Target and horn design is optimized {{for each of the}} LFI bands, centered at 70, 44 and 30 GHz. Pyramidal horns are either machined inside the radiometer 20 K module or connected via external <b>electro-formed</b> bended waveguides. The requirement of high stability of the reference signal imposed a careful design for the radiometric and thermal properties of the loads. Materials used for the manufacturing have been characterized for thermal, RF and mechanical properties. We describe in this paper the design and the performance of the reference system.

40|$|Discover textile history, tradition, {{design and}} making at the Fashion and Textile Museum Festival of Textiles. A series of displays, talks and {{workshops}} brings together {{some of the}} best and brightest textile developers, artists and designers now working in the UK. Curated by Mary Schoeser, Diana Harrison and Linda Brassington, the Festival aims to illuminate contemporary practice and open minds {{to the ways in which}} textiles enrich lives. Textiles Surface and Structure is a display of work, designed and made on the BA Hons Textiles course at UCA Farnham. Led by artist and designer Sharon Ting, the course forms part of the only School of Crafts and Design in the UK and aims to fuse traditional skills with innovative materials-based textile design. The display in the Fashion Studio features work by Ting as well as that of final year students and recent graduates including Joanne Hayward, Janice Webb, Louise Anderson, Charlotte Stewart, Alice Howard-Graham, Christine Teeling, Ceri Buller, Ellie Rothero and Claire Hunsinger. Chemistry for Couture features the practice-based research of metal horticulturalist Jo Horton. The electro-chemically grown stitch and embellishment techniques developed by Horton are informed by the history of bespoke, handmade, metallic textiles for fashion since the 16 th century. At the centre of the display will be two outfits showing <b>electro-formed</b> embellishment created as part of Horton’s post graduate research at De Montfort University. Gesture in Cloth is an installation of works selected to represent a breadth of approach as taken by seven professionals. Curated by Linda Brassington, it reflects her current doctoral research exploring craft and the notion of making in textiles as an intervention with materials – a subtle balance between the artist’s hand and material properties. Featuring work by Louise Renae Anderson, Sally Greaves-Lord, Diana Harrison, Robert Moon, Ann Richards, Mary Restieaux and Brassington herself, visitors can observe the varying ways in which each artist has developed a growing personal language in fibre, thread and cloth, chemicals, dyes and pigments. In their different ways, each piece demonstrates a transformation of textile substance. Together, they form a collection of ideas in the making: gesture in cloth...|$|E
