50|$|The {{objectives}} as {{set out in}} 1873 reflected these arrangements. The School was {{to train}} teachers to teach cookery in ′Training Schools, School Board Schools, Poor Schools and similar institutions′ and to send out teachers, with equipment, to give lessons nationwide if suitable payments were made. The school also was to teach fee-paying ′persons desirous of acquiring a knowledge of the principles of Cookery′. The cookery taught at the School was, broadly, either Plain Cookery, intended to instruct pupil teachers who would disseminate these recipes to working class women and more particularly, to the next generation of them in schools, or High Class Cookery, intended to instruct both those intending to work in the households of the middle and upper-classes and the women in these classes who would be their employers. On occasion, celebrity chefs, such as Herman Senn, were invited to lecture.Plain cookery classes assumed no knowledge of cookery and the recipe cards with such classes went through every step in minute detail. Ingredients are set out at the start, costed to the nearest farthing. For instance, shepherds pie was costed in 1875 at 9 ¼ old pence (4p). The objective of Plain Cookery teaching was, according to Mrs Clarke ′to insure for the working-man a wholesome meal nicely prepared, which will supply the nourishment he requires to enable him to do a hard days work. The lassitude produced by bad food and hard work is a constant source of the craving for stimulants which drives the working-man to the public-house. This teaching will end to lessen this evil and improve the health of the people.′ One suspects that Mrs Clarke had little experience of the life led by ordinary Londoners at this time!Mrs Clarkes book of high class recipes was a more lavish production than the former book, with much <b>gold-blocking</b> on spine and cover. The recipes are often complicated and the majority have French names. She explained that the recipes ′are intended for the use of both ladies and cook.The emergence of a national cookery and domestic science school at this time is explainable by the changes in society in the late nineteenth century. Industrialisation had produced a large urban working-class, many of whom had not been taught cookery by their mothers and some of whom had only rudimentary cooking facilities in their homes. The spread of elementary schools gave an opportunity to educate working-class girls in basic cookery. At {{the other end of the}} social scale, more and more middle-class households were taking on live-in servants. These were the lower-middle classes, able often to afford just one servant, often a young girl, who had to do all the household tasks as well as cook. The servant was often a novice cook and her mistress was a novice servant-employer, so both could benefit from lessons at the School. The range of the Schools activities, and the different social classes catered for, is reflected in its revised list of fees of 1921. Most expensive was the Cordon Bleu course at £60. Other courses included: Household Management; Housekeeping; Ladies’ Short Cookery Course; Plain Cookery; Superior Household Cookery; Cooks Certificates In Plain And High Class Cookery; lessons in needlework, dressmaking, laundry, millinery, tailoring, and Odd Jobs Demonstrations.|$|E

He started the School of Animal Painting at 54 Baker Street, London, and acted as principal from 1894-1916. Some of his students were Cecil Aldin, Lionel Edwards, Alfred Munnings, Lady Helena Gleichen, Frederic Whiting and George E. Studdy. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1881-1921, and had his first Royal Academy painting bought by Queen Victoria. His 1936 book Animal Painting and Anatomy is still considered a useful reference source. He illustrated numerous books such as [...] "The Most Delectable History of Reynard The Fox" [...] edited by Joseph Jacobs and published by Macmillan in 1895. The cover, designed by A. A.
