The most frequently used anticancer agents are platins, antimetabolites (5 -fluorouracil, methotrexate) and taxanes. For several years now, in some indications, chemotherapy {{may be associated with}} targeted anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Prescription of chemotherapy and follow-up <b>in</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer requires particular attention due to comorbidities related to alcohol abuse and smoking and frequent denutrition. Management thus requires close cooperation between the ENT physician, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists...|$|R

Combined recordings of head and eye rotation using wireless motion sensors and electrooculography (EOG) {{were used as}} an initial step towards a method to quantify eye-head co-ordination deficits. Head rotation to the side during gaze fixation and sequential head and eye movements were studied on 20 asymptomatic control subjects and six subjects with chronic whiplash disorders. All included whiplash subjects reported eye disturbances according to a vision symptom questionnaire. Results. The trial-to-trial reproducibility was moderate to high for 24 of 28 variables (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 0. 44 to 0. 87).

40|$|AbstractAccumulating {{evidence}} indicates that {{a common set of}} genes and mechanisms regulates the developmental processes of a variety of triploblastic organisms despite large variation in their body plans. To what extent these same genes and mechanisms are also conserved among diploblasts, which arose earlier in metazoan evolution, is unclear. We have characterized a hydra homologue of the fork head/HNF- 3 class of winged-helix proteins, termedbudhead,whose expression patterns suggest a role(s) similar to that found in vertebrates. The vertebrateHNF- 3 β homologues are expressed early in embryogenesis in regions that have organizer properties, and later they have several roles, among them an important role <b>in</b> rostral <b>head</b> formation. <b>In</b> the adult hydra, where axial patterning processes are continuously active,budheadis expressed in {{the upper part of the}} head, which has organizer properties. It is also expressed during the formation of a new axis as part of the development of a bud, hydra's asexual form of reproduction.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} toxic {{effects of the}} {{organophosphate}} pesticide (OP) dichlorvos to the endangered Iberian toothcarp (Aphanius iberus). To this end, the lethal toxicity of dichlorvos based on 96 h-LC 50 bioassays was determined in saline water (50 g/L), and in vivo effects of dichlorvos on cholinesterase (ChE) activity were investigated in adult female and male specimens. The 96 h-LC 50 value determined by probit analysis was 3. 17 mg/L (95 % confidence limits: 1. 34 - 3. 97). The characterisation of the ChE using different substrates and specific inhibitors was also carried out <b>in</b> <b>head</b> and muscle tissues. Acetylthiocholine was the substrate preferred by both head and muscle ChE in males and females. Eserine sulphate and BW 284 C 51 significantly inhibited both head and muscle enzyme activity at low concentrations (μM range), and iso-OMPA had no significant effect. These results <b>indicate</b> that <b>in</b> the <b>head</b> and muscle the predominant ChE form is acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for both sexes. The kinetic parameters for ChE activity (Km and Vmax) were similar in both sexes. The 96 h-LC 50 value obtained for adult specimens of Iberian toothcarp was 3. 17 mg/L. ChE activity <b>in</b> <b>head</b> and body tissues of both sexes was significantly inhibited in all concentrations tested (0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L) after >in vivo> dichlorvos exposure. However, Iberian toothcarp was able to tolerate high concentrations of dichlorvos, and resist high levels of brain and muscle ChE inhibition without mortality. Both ChE inhibition and recovery followed a similar time-course pattern in response to sub-lethal exposure to dichlorvos (1 mg/L), and the enzyme activity {{did not return to}} control levels after 96 h in clean water. The results of this study show that ChE activity is a good biomarker of exposure to OP in the Iberian toothcarp adults. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The wells range in depth from 50 to 1, 027 feet below land surface and are drilled in Triassic-age shales and siltstones of the Brunswick Group and Lockatong Formation. The geophysical log {{data were collected}} to help describe the hydrogeologic framework {{in the area and}} to provide guidance in the reconstruction of the 28 monitor wells drilled during summer 1997.

Heatpulse-flowmeter measurements were used to determine vertical borehole flow under pumping and nonpumping conditions. The most productive fractures generally could be determined from heatpulse-flowmeter measurements under pumping conditions. Vertical borehole flow was measured under nonpumping conditions in most wells that had more than one water-bearing fracture.

Since then test drilling by use of rotary drilling equipment has been {{an integral part of}} that program. This report contains logs of all the test holes drilled in Holt County, Nebraska, under the program as well as those drilled by the Conservation and Survey Division with financial assistance from other government agencies. The map in this report (see figure 1) shows the location of all test holes drilled in Holt County, Nebraska, from 1944 to 2000. Present techniques of test-hole logging and sampling include use of drilling mud suitable to drilling conditions, timing by stopwatch of the drilling of each 5 -foot increment of depth, and removal of all cuttings from the test hole at intervals of 5 feet or less. During the drilling of the hole, cuttings from each interval are examined immediately; samples representing each 5 -foot interval and each recognizable change in material are retained. After samples are washed, they are described lithologically and the color is evaluated by comparison with standard color charts. The samples then are dried, stored, and cataloged. Beginning in September 1951, the test holes have been logged electrically (see sample Holt County e-Iog for # 54 -HP- 79) in figure 2. All samples are processed and kept on open file in the offices of Conservation and Survey Division, 113 Nebraska Hall, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska 68588 - 0517, 402 - 472 - 3471.

Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study using head injury patient data in Karyadi hospital as sample. A total of 99 samples that meet the criteria were divided into two groups.
