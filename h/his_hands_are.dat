5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as {{he carries}} his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> blue, {{to show his}} occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E
25|$|Stephen {{returns to}} Yvonne and {{explains}} that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> those of Rollo, {{and that he}} must turn himself in to the police. A panic-stricken Yvonne goes to Gogol's home, and finds him completely mad (after he has come home and shed his elaborate disguise). Gogol assumes that his statue has come to life, embraces her, and begins to strangle her. Reagan, Stephen and the police arrive, but are only able to open the observation window. Stephen produces a knife and throws it at Gogol, then finds his way in. Gogol dies as Stephen and Yvonne embrace.|$|E
500|$|Sculley {{allocated}} a $1million marketing {{budget to}} the PowerBook product line, {{in contrast to}} the $25million used to market the Macintosh Classic. Medica, Battat, and Selvin used most of the money to produce and air a television commercial that viewers would remember. Advertising agency Chiat/Day filmed retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sitting uncomfortably in a small airline coach seat yet comfortably typing on his PowerBook. The ad caption read: [...] "At least <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> comfortable." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{suggests that}} the Kaumodaki symbolizes the life-force (prana) from which all [...] "physical and mental powers" [...] arise. Vishnu's gada also stands for discipline, complemented by his lotus, that denotes praise. While the lotus and shankha in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> water symbols representing life and love, the gada and the chakra are fire symbols denoting pain and destruction and command adherence {{to the rules of}} society and nature. The Varaha Purana says the gada is to teach a lesson to irreligious rulers. Vishnu is also said to clear illusion by his gada.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} before Pontius Pilate. Jesus' hands are tied {{and he still}} wears the crown of thorns and {{in his right hand}} holds the reed. Pilate wears a turban and <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> spread open as he addresses those who have brought Jesus before him. One soldier opens Jesus' cloak. [...] On his right, another soldier prepares the towel he will give Pilate to wash his hands. The last of the soldiers carries a jug of water.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the space}} {{over the north}} east buttress, we see Jesus being mocked and {{ridiculed}} by five guards ("Christ aux outrages"). [...] He sits on a stool. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> bound and he is blindfolded. A soldier standing on the left holds a whip ready to start the flogging. Three soldiers stand behind Jesus and two have their hands raised ready as though to strike him. Another soldier kneels at Jesus' side taunting him and asking who has hit him.|$|E

2500|$|Pirone {{said he told}} Grant [...] "Stop resisting, you're under arrest, {{put your}} hands behind your back." [...] At that time Pirone said he heard Mehserle say, [...] "Put your hands behind your back, stop resisting, stop resisting, put your hands behind your back." [...] Then Mehserle said, [...] "I'm going to taze him, I'm going to taze him. I can't get his arms. He won't give me his arms. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> going for his waistband." [...] Then Mehserle popped up and said, [...] "Tony, Tony, get away, back up, back up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt {{proceeds}} to contrast {{in greater detail}} the realities of human nature with Bentham's benevolent attempts to manipulate it. Bentham would observe and attempt to alter {{the behavior of a}} criminal by placing him in a [...] "Panopticon, that is, a sort of circular prison, with open cells, like a glass bee-hive." [...] When the offender is freed from its restraints, however, Hazlitt questions whether it is at all likely he will maintain the altered behavior that had seemed so amenable to change. [...] "Will the convert to the great principle of Utility work when he was from under Mr. Bentham's eye, because he was forced to work when under it? ... Will he not steal, now that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> untied? ... The charm of criminal life ... consists in liberty, in hardship, in danger, and in the contempt of death, in one word, in extraordinary excitement".|$|E
2500|$|Jieun {{returns to}} sing the second verse of the song with interchanging scenes from the {{abandoned}} building, the misty rice field {{and in the back}} seat of the car. Yongguk proceeds to rap in the misty rice field but this time <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> tied up with ropes while sitting in a chair and blindfolded in the scene where he raps in front of a red wall. The video returns to the present where the woman has parked her car in a road near a rice field at night. When Jieun starts {{to sing the}} second chorus, the woman opens her car trunk in a straight-on view, revealing a captive man (Kim Him Chan) who had been blindfolded and tied up with rope. The woman takes a jug of gasoline in the trunk of her car and kisses the man. She then pours gasoline on the prisoner and backs up a distance from the car. The video ends with the woman igniting her lighter and throwing it in the pool of gasoline. [...] The video ends before the car explodes.|$|E

2500|$|Boubacar Bah, a 52-year-old tailor from Guinea, {{was left}} in an {{isolation}} cell for more than 13 hours after falling and suffering a head fracture before an ambulance was called. His family was not notified for five days of his injury. A video shows Bah in the medical unit, before medical personnel {{sent him to the}} isolation cell. In the tape, <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> handcuffed behind his back, he is face down, and he calls out repeatedly in his native language, Fulani: [...] "Help, they are killing me!" [...] Telephone and email records show that ten agency managers based in Newark and Washington discussed how to avoid the cost of his care and unwanted media attention. They considered sending Bah back to Guinea and reviewing his canceled work permit to see if {{it would be possible to}} get Medicaid or disability benefits. Eventually, they decided to release him to cousins in New York who objected that they had no way to care for Bah; however, days before this release was planned, Bah died.|$|E
2500|$|Now that Phantom, that toils on his knees, {{seems to}} sit on bended knee, and from both his {{shoulders}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> upraised and stretch, one this way, one that, a fathom's length. Over {{the middle of the}} head of the crooked Dragon, he has the tip of his right foot. Here too that Crown , which glorious Dionysus set to be memorial of the dead Ariadne, wheels beneath the back of the toil-spent Phantom. To the Phantom’s back the Crown is near, but by his head mark near at hand the head of Ophiuchus [...] Yonder, too, is the tiny Tortoise, which, while still beside his cradle, Hermes pierced for stings and bade it be called the Lyre : and he brought it into heaven and set {{it in front of the}} unknown Phantom. That Croucher on his Knees comes near the Lyre with his left knee, but the top of the Bird’s head wheels on the other side, and between the Bird’s head and the Phantom’s knee is enstarred the Lyre.|$|E
2500|$|Albrecht Dürer {{considered}} printmaking {{to be one}} of {{the most}} important art forms, possibly even equal to the art of painting. His technical skill is well demonstrated in St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. The influence of Dürer's training under Michael Wolgemut on the quality of Dürer's works can be seen in the vast amount of detail in the print. Dürer includes details ranging from the small trees surrounding the town to details of St. Michael’s face. [...] Dürer uses atmospheric perspective to create the illusion of space by depicting the mountains with less detail the farther away they are supposed to be. He creates different light and dark tones through his use of lines. In respect to the poses of the figures, especially Archangel Michael, Dürer broke with the traditional pose for a hero fighting against evil that was more elegant and instead put St. Michael in a pose that captures the magnitude of the task at hand. St. Michael’s eyebrows are furrowed with concentration and <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> on the sword, about to fiercely attack the dragon. All original woodcuts in the series were made on pear wood.|$|E

2500|$|Colbert's {{campaign}} touted him as South Carolina's native or {{favorite son}} candidate, running exclusively {{in that state}} and exclusively for that state's interests. [...] "I am from South Carolina and I am for South Carolina and I defy any other candidate to pander more {{to the people of}} South Carolina, those beautiful, beautiful people," [...] he said after his Colbert Report announcement. As such, he challenged Democratic candidate John Edwards'—himself a native South Carolinian—own prospective role. As Colbert began campaigning in South Carolina in late October, Edwards' spokesperson Teresa Wells teased Colbert about his sponsorship by Doritos nacho chips: [...] "As the candidate of Doritos, <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> stained by corporate corruption and nacho cheese. John Edwards has never taken a dime from taco chip lobbyists and America deserves a President who isn't in the pocket of the snack food special interests." [...] The Edwards team also released a press release responding to Colbert directly: [...] "Edwards was born in South Carolina, learned to walk in South Carolina, learned to talk to in South Carolina and will kick Stephen Colbert's New York City butt in South Carolina." [...] One commentator suggested the humorous response might aid Edwards' image by presenting him as a candidate who could [...] "make fun of himself". In addition, Edwards booked American film actor and celebrity Danny Glover to stump for him in South Carolina on the same day Colbert was making his appearance in the state; a chance at a [...] "perfect political salvo", in the opinion of one reporter, although one left underexploited.|$|E
