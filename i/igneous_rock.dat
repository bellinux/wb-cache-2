5|$|Thompson's Walls {{consists}} of two 19th-century farm cottages {{and a group of}} farm buildings, notable for being built entirely of hard, <b>igneous</b> <b>rock.</b> Andesite was quarried, and was used in the construction of Yetholm church.|$|E
5|$|Spectra {{taken of}} this crater during the Clementine mission {{were used to}} perform mineral mapping. The data {{indicated}} that the central peak {{is a type of}} rock called anorthosite, which is a slow-cooling form of <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> composed of plagioclase feldspar. By contrast the outer wall is troctolite, a rock composed of equal parts plagioclase and olivine.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E
5000|$|Ultrapotassic <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> are a {{class of}} rare, volumetrically minor and {{generally}} ultramafic or mafic silica-depleted <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Melilite also {{occurs in}} unusual silica-undersaturated <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b> Some of these rocks {{appear to have}} formed by {{reaction}} of magmas with limestone. Other <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> containing melilite crystallize from magma derived from the Earth's mantle and apparently uncontaminated by the Earth's crust. The presence of melilite is an essential constituent in some rare <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as olivine melilitite. Extremely rare <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> contain as much as 70% melilite, together with minerals such as pyroxene and perovskite.|$|R
50|$|The dating of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> determines when magma {{solidified}} into rock. Radiogenic isotopes {{are frequently}} {{used to determine}} the age of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most of Gyeongju {{lies in the}} Gyeongsang Basin, but a {{few areas}} of the city belong to the Pohang Basin, such as Eoil-ri and Beomgok-ri in Yangbuk-myeon, and part of Cheonbuk-myeon. The Gyeongsang Basin areas consist of Bulguksa {{intrusive}} rock penetrating layers of sedimentary rocks, mainly granite and porphyry. By contrast, the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era, which consist of <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> aqueous rock, porphyry, sandstone, and tuff.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has shown}} <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> from the Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) intrudes into the {{surrounding}} metamorphic schists; the intrusions {{take the form of}} a series of concentric ring dikes. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of andesite and basaltic lavas.|$|E
5|$|The defunct Loma Verde Mine, {{which is}} still visible in the RMD, {{produced}} {{a small amount of}} copper and gold between 1897 and 1907. Mining of <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> at 149 sites in the TMD sometimes produced ores of modest value in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most successful, the Copper King Mine (later renamed the Mile Wide Mine), yielded 34,000 tons of copper, gold, lead, zinc, and molybdenum ores, mostly during the war years of 1917, 1918, and 1941; it closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} {{of the many}} types of different <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> can provide us with important information about {{the conditions under which}} they formed. Two important variables used for the {{classification of}} <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks,</b> and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> and are called accessory minerals. Types of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.|$|R
50|$|Clastic <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> include {{pyroclastic}} volcanic rocks such as tuff, agglomerate and intrusive breccias, {{as well as}} some marginal eutaxitic and taxitic intrusive morphologies. <b>Igneous</b> clastic <b>rocks</b> {{are broken}} by flow, injection or explosive disruption of solid or semi-solid <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> or lavas.|$|R
50|$|The {{sub-family}} {{of rocks}} that form from volcanic lava are called <b>igneous</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> (to differentiate them from <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> that form from magma below the surface, called <b>igneous</b> plutonic <b>rocks).</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} parts of Van Cortlandt Park have a varied geology. The Northwest Woods and Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway have a steep terrain dotted with Fordham gneiss, a metamorphic rock that {{is very hard to}} weather. The Tibbetts Brook valley is set in Inwood marble, which weathers more easily. The east side of the park near Indian Field contains Yonkers granite, an <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> that mixed with Fordham gneiss as a hot magma before later cooling.|$|E
5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, {{one can see the}} solidified lava (<b>igneous</b> <b>rock)</b> most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
50|$|Igneous {{petrology}} {{focuses on}} the composition and texture of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten <b>rock</b> or magma). <b>Igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> include volcanic and plutonic rocks.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{minerals}} are mostly fine-grained, {{it is much}} more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> than between different types of intrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b> Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.|$|R
50|$|The range {{formed as}} a result of {{intrusion}} of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> and subsequent erosion of the surrounding less-resistant sedimentary rocks. The most abundant <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> are porphyritic, with phenocrysts of hornblende and plagioclase: these rocks are called diorite in some accounts but trachyte in at least one other source. Syenite, some containing the unusual mineral nosean, makes up a few percent of the <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> present. Some of the igneous intrusions have the shapes of laccoliths. Ages of these <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> fall in the interval 25 to 28 million years. The magmas were emplaced into sedimentary rocks with ages from Permian to Cretaceous.|$|R
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak can {{be divided}} into two {{geological}} zones: the Sunda Shield, which extends southwest from the Batang Lupar River (near Sri Aman) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak, and the geosyncline region, which extends northeast to the Batang Lupar River, forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak. The oldest rock type in southern Sarawak is schist formed during the Carboniferous and Lower Permian times, while the youngest <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> in this region, andesite, can be found at Sematan. Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late Cretaceous period. Other types of stone that can be found in central and northern Sarawak are shale, sandstone, and chert.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of the rock underneath the Everglades {{can be explained by}} the geologic history of the state. The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana. About 300 millionyears ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered the prevalent sedimentary rock with <b>igneous</b> <b>rock.</b> Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 millionyears ago. When Florida was part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler Jurassic Period, the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the Cretaceous Period, most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths. The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.|$|E
50|$|He {{also created}} {{classification}} schemes for <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> {{which accounted for}} their mineralogy, texture, and composition, and showed that <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> of different mineralogies could be formed from the same chemical composition, with different conditions of crystallization.|$|R
50|$|Volcanism is {{the process}} that takes place at {{divergent}} boundaries by which one tectonic plate separates from another creating a rift in which molten rock (magma) erupts {{onto the surface of}} the Earth. This molten rock magma then cools and crystallizes, forming <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b> If crystallization occurs at the Earth´s surface, extrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> are formed; if crystallization occurs within the Earth´s lithosphere, intrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> are formed which can then be brought to Earth´s surface by denudation.|$|R
50|$|Remember, granitoids are <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The town {{is built}} on <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> in the James Valley, {{sandwiched}} between steep cliffs. It is therefore rather long and thin. The walls of the valley are rough and steep, and rockfalls have been a problem, although now minimised by netting. A small stream, the Run, runs through the valley. The town is commonly divided into lower and upper parts, depending on the distance up James Valley. Being the island's main port (and with the Saint Helena Airport only receiving its first scheduled flight in October 2017) the town is still currently the main entrance to the island to visitors. Despite not being connected to Jamestown proper by road, Rupert's Valley, the next valley north, {{is also part of}} the town. It houses much of the island's infrastructure, such as its power station and associated fuel storage, and a one-ship wharf was completed in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
50|$|Cumulate <b>rocks</b> are <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> {{formed by}} the {{accumulation}} of crystals from a magma either by settling or floating.

25|$|Mount Cayley {{consists}} {{mostly of}} an <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> {{with a high}} iron content called dacite, although another <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> rhyodacite, with intermediate composition of dacite and rhyolite is also present.

50|$|The {{bedrock of}} the island {{consists}} of metamorphic and <b>igneous</b> Precambrian <b>rocks,</b> which {{are part of the}} Frontenac Terrane of the Central Metasedimentary Belt. This is consistent with a significant amount of the geology of Frontenac County.
