He obserses domestic production in the major industrialized countries fell faster than international trade contracted; if contraction of foreign trade had been {{the cause of the}} Depression, he argues, the opposite should have occurred. So, the decline in trade between 1929 and 1933 was a consequence of the Depression, not a cause. Most of the trade contraction took place between January 1930 and July 1932, before the introduction of the majority of protectionist measures, excepting limited American measures applied in the summer of 1930. It was the collapse of <b>international</b> <b>liquidity</b> that caused of the contraction of trade.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of the international monetary}} System prompted the nine members of the E. E. C. to establish a European Monetary System. The new statutes of the I. M.

Further, the increasing importance of the international capital markets fosters the unlimited expansion of <b>international</b> <b>liquidities.</b> it is in response to this context then that Europe seeks to create a zone of stability and to manage its own international tender in accordance with rules that it has set for itself. The author draws a positive conclusion as the System has operated without major problems so far. Nevertheless, difficulties remain: the international environment has not improved given the abrupt strengthening of the dollar and the increase in American interest rates. In addition, progress with regard to cooperation among the Nine remains slow and political change in France makes any prognosis respecting the future of the European Monetary System difficult. It was anticipated that the System would be Consolidated rapidly. It would in that event contribute more effectively to the stability of the international monetary System.
