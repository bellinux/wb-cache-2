5|$|An {{impression}} of the Great Seal of a state (or its coat of arms) has long been required on official documents ranging from deeds to legislative acts. It was the emblem that certified the authenticity of a given document or that {{the authority of the}} state was invested in said document. <b>Judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> upheld the need for a valid seal and/or coat of arms on notarized documents.|$|E
5|$|This passage {{was used}} in Britain by Lord Atkin in his dissenting {{judgement}} in the seminal case Liversidge v.

It also became a popular citation in United States legal opinions, appearing in 250 <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> in the Westlaw database , including two Supreme Court cases (TVA v. Hill and Zschernig v. Miller).|$|E

5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply both their practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early forensic science, a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E
5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several judicial officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with his advisers. Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Endecott was a zealous and {{somewhat}} hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist {{attitudes toward the}} Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony's early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short, and issued <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well {{with those of the}} Puritans. He notoriously defaced the English flag because he saw St George's Cross {{as a symbol of the}} papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.|$|E

5|$|There {{were other}} {{officials}} in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the mufti and the qadi. The mufti {{was the chief}} scholar among the ulama (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same mufti for many years {{at a time in}} contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its mufti replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the qadi from Palestine's local ulama, but his <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> had to be approved by the qadi of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who {{in the last years of}} his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi. An agha was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions.</b> Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E

40|$|Two {{hundred years}} elapsed before {{the nineteenth century}} logicians Boole, De Morgan, and others, finally succeeded in {{formally}} developing the 2 ̆ 2 calculus of reason-ing 2 ̆ 2 first suggested by the German mathematician, Leibniz. It is, perhaps, to the credit of the legal profession that less than one century has subsequently elapsed, and already some lawyers and legal writers, along with other scholars, are beginning to explore the relationship between modern logic and law. What is attempted here is to outline the bare bones of one tentative {{way of looking at}} the relationship between modern logic and the <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> process. From the useful vantage point of a Lasswellian social process framework of analysis, logic and <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> making are considered contextually within that total mani-fold of events that we call 2 ̆ 2 the world. 2 ̆ 2 Thus viewed, the <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> making process is just one constituent of the complex unfolding of events through time. We attempt to represent some of the complexities involved in each of these processes and the relationships between them by means of a series of diagrams. By suggesting that we begin with the world as our context, we make no claim to describing it in complete detail. To the contrary, the sketch presented here-we would emphasize the word 2 ̆ 2 sketch 2 ̆ 2 and the word 2 ̆ 2 tentative 2 ̆ 2 -is rough, incomplete, and subject to considerable improvement. But one of our purposes will be served if the outline points the way toward cumulative efforts to achieve a comprehensive description of the <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> process. In addition to this broad look at logic, <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> making, and the world, a more modest aim is to describe, in some detail and with reasonable clarity, one aspect of the relation between logic and <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> making...|$|R

25|$|Gorsuch is {{a proponent}} of originalism, {{the idea that the}} Constitution should be {{interpreted}} as perceived at the time of enactment, and of textualism, the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.

25|$|The Code did {{not merely}} embody {{contemporary}} custom or conserve ancient law.

The universal habit of writing, and perpetual recourse to written contract, further modified primitive custom and ancient precedent.|$|E
