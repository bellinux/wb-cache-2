5|$|Unknown to them, Lioba {{is indeed}} alive in Planet B. She is {{currently}} trying {{to rid the}} network of viruses. She <b>does</b> <b>this</b> {{with the help of}} Cerberus, a vicious antivirus programme designed to look like a cerberus who destroys viruses by ripping them to shreds.|$|E
5|$|When a {{virus infects}} a cell, the virus forces {{it to make}} {{thousands}} more viruses. It <b>does</b> <b>this</b> by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It <b>does</b> <b>this</b> by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

5|$|In his text, An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion, author Derek Hicks {{suggest that}} “through gumbo, traditions and values are transmitted.” This quote {{represents}} his larger claim that gumbo <b>does</b> <b>this</b> for African American culture, uniting {{a group of}} people by one very powerful dish. According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E
5|$|Jeff, {{eager to}} get away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight among the group, then leaves once more to get the test answers. Dr. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can restore order. He <b>does</b> <b>this</b> through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E

50|$|The formal negations are {{shall not}} and should not, {{contracted}} to shan't and shouldn't. The negation effectively applies to the main verb rather than the auxiliary: you should not <b>do</b> <b>this</b> implies not merely {{that there is no}} need to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> but that there is a need not to <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> The logical negation of I should is I don't ought to or I am not supposed to.|$|R

5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) <b>does</b> <b>this,</b> the mother brooding {{the eggs and}} guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, after {{slapping}} a meter maid, Jack (Sean Hayes) {{is ordered}} to work 40 {{hours of community}} service, picking up garbage, and while he <b>does</b> <b>this</b> is forced to wear an orange jumpsuit. While doing community service he visits Karen at Grace Adler Designs. While there, Jack goes through a trash bag and sees Soon-Yi Allen's phone bill. Jack shows Karen the bill which quickly results in the two prank calling Soon-Yi.|$|E
5|$|Porfiry Petrovich– The {{head of the}} Investigation Department {{in charge}} of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry <b>does</b> <b>this</b> through {{psychological}} games. Despite the lack of evidence, he becomes certain Raskolnikov is the murderer following several conversations with him, but gives him the chance to confess voluntarily. He attempts to confuse and to provoke the unstable Raskolnikov {{in an attempt to}} coerce him to confess. According to the creators of the TV series Columbo (William Link and Richard Levinson), the title character was based on Porfiry.|$|E

5000|$|Often people, {{especially}} computer engineers, {{focus on}} the machines. They think, [...] "By <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> the machine will run fast. By <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> the machine will run more effectively. By <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> the machine will something something something." [...] They are focusing on machines. But in fact {{we need to focus}} on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.|$|R
5|$|The series {{concerns}} Phineas's {{attempts to}} avoid boredom by finding {{something new to}} do for each day of his summer vacation. His sister's name is Candace Flynn, who tries to reveal their outrageous creations, but to no avail. He <b>does</b> <b>this</b> with his less-talkative stepbrother Ferb, and often with many other neighborhood children. The activities they devise usually involve outlandish contraptions, including roller coasters, haunted houses, roller rinks, and a backyard beach etc. which Phineas designs and Ferb builds.|$|E
5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It <b>does</b> <b>this</b> by down-regulating {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E
5|$|When a cell's DNA {{is damaged}} by a virus, {{and if the}} cell cannot repair itself, this often {{triggers}} apoptosis. One {{of the results of}} apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, <b>does</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

Sooner or later {{one or another of}} them will do something that no child, when he was a boy, would have dared--or dreamed of daring--to even so much as think of doing. The child, conveying by expression that the world, it is glad to say, is slowly but steadily growing in sense, and pity it is that old-fashioned folks can't bustle up and keep abreast of it, points out that firstly it has not <b>done</b> <b>this</b> thing, that for various reasons--a few only of which need be dwelt upon--it is impossible it could have <b>done</b> <b>this</b> thing; that secondly it has been expressly requested to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> thing, that wishful always to give satisfaction, it has--at sacrifice of all its own ideas--gone {{out of its way to}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> thing; that thirdly it can't help <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> thing, strive against fate as it will.|$|R
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. <b>Does</b> <b>this</b> imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seventeen, Cú Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster {{from the}} army of Connacht in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the {{invasion}} to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when {{he should have been}} watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labor pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He <b>does</b> <b>this</b> by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It <b>does</b> <b>this</b> by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E
