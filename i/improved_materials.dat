25|$|Between the wars, many {{aerospace}} innovations were in {{the field}} of manufacturing processes, rather than just an inherently stronger material, although these too benefited from <b>improved</b> <b>materials.</b> One of the R.R. alloys, R.R.53B, had added silicon which improved its fluidity when molten. This allowed its use for die casting as well as the previous sand casting, a means of making parts that were both far cheaper and also more accurate in shape and finish. Better control of their shape allowed designers to shape them more precisely to their tasks, leading to parts that were also thinner and lighter.|$|E
2500|$|The LMGs built made a 44% and 43% {{reduction}} of weight (for the cased telescoped and the caseless weapons, respectively). [...] Secondary goals {{have also been}} met: the LMG {{has the potential to}} improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a long-stroke gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; <b>improved</b> <b>materials</b> used in the chamber and barrel have reduced heat load on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249. [...] The standard LSAT machine gun weighs 9.4lb empty, compared to 17.6lb for a standard SAW. [...] Cased telescoped ammunition weighs 40% less than brass-cased ammo, so a 100-round ammunition belt weighs about 2lb for the LSAT, compared to 3.3lb for a brass-cased belt.|$|E

40|$|An <b>improved</b> <b>material</b> {{system has}} been {{developed}} for rocket engine combustion chambers for burning oxygen/ hydrogen mixtures or novel monopropellants, which are highly oxidizing at operating temperatures. The baseline for developing the <b>improved</b> <b>material</b> system is a prior iridium/rhenium system for chambers burning nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine mixtures, which are less oxidizing. The baseline combustion chamber comprises an outer layer of rhenium that provides structural support, plus an inner layer of iridium {{that acts as a}} barrier to oxidation of the rhenium. In the <b>improved</b> <b>material</b> system, the layer of iridium is thin and is coated with a thermal fatigue-resistant refractory oxide (specifically, hafnium oxide) that serves partly as a thermal barrier to decrease the temperature and thus the rate of oxidation of the rhenium. The oxide layer also acts as a barrier against the transport of oxidizing species {{to the surface of the}} iridium. Tests in which various oxygen/hydrogen mixtures were burned in iridium/rhenium combustion chambers lined with hafnium oxide showed that the operational lifetimes of combustion chambers of the <b>improved</b> <b>material</b> system are an order of magnitude greater than those of the baseline combustion chambers...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2015, the USAF {{revealed}} that the LRS-B's development was much further along than had been publicly acknowledged, and more than usual before a contract award. [...] Final requirements had been finalized since May 2013. [...] Both competitors had mature proposals with prototyping activities and wind tunnel tests along with subsystems, although no demonstrator had been built. [...] The designs are [...] "very different" [...] from each other with different teams on subsystems such as engines, electronic warfare suites, and communications systems; subcontractors will likely not be announced when the winner is picked. [...] The bomber seems similar to the B-2, but more advanced using <b>improved</b> <b>materials</b> for superior low observability, similar to or smaller in size, and will operate alone {{or as part of}} a strike package with other airborne assets. [...] Conducting of tests and risk reduction this early in the acquisition process is in part because the program has been handled by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office since 2011, which has more freedom in how it procures technologies. [...] To reduce risk, the aircraft's production rate will probably remain steady and fairly modest {{over the course of the}} aircraft's production. In late September 2015, the contract award was again delayed.|$|E

I soon found several methods by which the process might be simplified, and especially a modification of the ordinary electric current, which was very much more effective. Having made a certain amount of gold, I disposed of it for a sum which enabled me to buy <b>improved</b> <b>materials</b> and stronger batteries. In this way I enlarged my operations until at last I {{was in a position to}} build this house and to have a laboratory where I could carry out my work on a much larger scale.

40|$|Abstract. Rolled-piece end {{quality is}} one of key factors to decide {{material}} utilization ratio in cross wedge rolling (CWR). Good workpiece end quality can <b>improve</b> <b>material</b> utilization ratio effectively. In the paper, by adding the block wedge {{near the end of}} mould, it can block surface metal which flows faster in the axial direction and avoid the end concavity of rolled piece. The material loss will not be present and good end quality rolled piece will be produced. The results are significant for <b>improving</b> <b>material</b> utilization ratio and promoting applications of CWR...|$|R

50|$|Designers must, however, {{prevent the}} turbine blades and vanes from melting {{in a very}} high {{temperature}} and stress environment. Consequently, bleed air extracted from the compression system {{is often used to}} cool the turbine blades/vanes internally. Other solutions are <b>improved</b> <b>materials</b> and/or special insulating coatings. The discs must be specially shaped to withstand the huge stresses imposed by the rotating blades. They take the form of impulse, reaction, or combination impulse-reaction shapes. <b>Improved</b> <b>materials</b> help to keep disc weight down.|$|E

50|$|<b>Improved</b> <b>materials,</b> and the {{introduction}} of twin compressors such as in the Bristol Olympus and Pratt & Whitney JT3C engines, increased the overall pressure ratio and thus the thermodynamic efficiency of engines, but they also led to a poor propulsive efficiency, as pure turbojets have a high specific thrust/high velocity exhaust better suited to supersonic flight.|$|E

50|$|Significant {{technological}} {{advances in the}} U.S. prosthetic industry were largely absent in the {{years leading up to}} World War II.

25|$|At {{the present}} time, {{the price of}} the raw {{materials}} cadmium and tellurium are a negligible proportion of the cost of CdTe solar cells and other CdTe devices. However, tellurium is a relatively rare element (1–5 parts per billion in the Earth's crust; see Abundances of the elements (data page)). Through <b>improved</b> <b>material</b> efficiency and increased PV recycling systems, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. See Cadmium telluride photovoltaics for more information. Another study shows that CdTe PV recycling will add a significant secondary resource of Te which, in conjunction with <b>improved</b> <b>material</b> utilization, will enable a cumulative capacity of about 2 TW by 2050 and 10 TW {{by the end of the}} century.|$|R
