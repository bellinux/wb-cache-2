A 900-seat amphitheater faces the lake house allowing for comfortable seating for the over 60,000 people who visit every year. A proposal by the city to turn the lake house into a 125-seat restaurant and 200-seat banquet hall with an expanded dock with boat, cross-country ski, and <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> rentals failed to materialize {{due to a lack of}} interest from the private business sector.|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} in the {{development}} of ice skating came in 1742, when the first ice skating association was formed, the Edinburgh Skating Club. The first instructional book concerning ice skating was published in London in 1772. The book, written by a British artillery lieutenant, Robert Jones, describes basic figure skating forms such as circles and figure eights. The book was written solely for men, as women did not normally <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> in the late 18th century. It was with the publication of this manual that ice skating split into its two main disciplines, speed skating and figure skating.|$|E

25|$|Many {{athletic}} shoes {{are designed with}} specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across <b>ice.</b> <b>Skate</b> shoes have also been {{designed to provide a}} comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.|$|E
25|$|Reuben S. Decker {{inherited}} {{a portion of}} his grandfather's farm land and along with Hamilton A. Weed initially opened the Capitoline Skating pond, named in reverence to Capitoline Hill, one of the Seven Hills of Rome. The location of the grounds were in the Bedford area of Brooklyn, New York, an area now known as the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. The Grounds encompassed a city block bounded by Halsey Street, Marcy Street, Putnam Avenue, and Nostrand Avenue. The pond area was first conceived as an <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> park, which began in the Winter of 1862-1863. Designed to be a competitor to the nearby Union Grounds, where the first enclosed baseball field opened earlier in 1862. With the success that the Union Grounds experienced by charging admission, Decker and Weed chose to enclose the Capitoline Grounds as well.|$|E
25|$|The sticks that Fitzstephen {{refers to}} {{were used for}} movement, as the {{primitive}} bone-made ice skates did not have sharp gliding edges like modern ice skates. Adding edges to ice skates was invented by the Dutch in the 13th or 14th century. These ice skates were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern ice skates has remained largely the same. The only other major change in <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> design came soon after. Around {{the same time period}} as steel edges were added to ice skates, another Dutchman, a table maker’s apprentice, experimented with the height to width ratio of the metal blade of the ice skates, producing a design that remains almost unaltered to this day. The user of the skates no longer needed to use sticks for propulsion, and movement on skates was now freer and more stable.|$|E

500|$|Renoir, who {{was then}} 26 years old, painted Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne in the public park of Bois de Boulogne in Paris en plein air during the cold winter month of January 1868. [...] Newspaper {{accounts}} of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the Seine and <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> on rivers and streams. [...] Due to Renoir's dislike of cold temperatures, {{it is one of}} the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies. At the time of the painting, the park itself was relatively new, with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by Georges-Eugène Haussmann under the direction of Napoleon III.

500|$|The Fonteyn Kill and Vassar Lake {{have been}} used recreationally since Vassar College's {{establishment}} in the 1860s. Benson John Lossing recorded Vassar students in 1867 using Vassar Lake, then known as [...] "Mill Cove Lake", for rowing and boating in the summer months; a simple dock was built to allow access to the water. In the winter, the lake froze over and students at the college would <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> upon the surface. The shallowness of the lake became an obstacle to recreational use, and while it was suggested by Vassar's Miscellany News that the lake be dredged or removed entirely, neither of these options were employed and the lake {{is no longer a}} recreation site. By the 1920s, the Fonteyn Kill's source spring was being dammed in wintertime, flooding a nearby hollow to create an ice skating pond.|$|E

500|$|The Mullen {{family lived}} {{less than a}} block from Madison Square Garden, where Joe's father Tom was a {{longtime}} employee {{on the ice and}} maintenance staffs. Joe and his brothers often hung around the arena with their father, taking old sticks to play with. He began playing roller hockey at the age of five, playing in a concrete schoolyard and using a sanded down roll of electrical tape as a puck. The boys' schoolyard games served as a partial inspiration for New York Rangers' general manager, Emile Francis, to create the Metropolitan Junior Hockey Association in 1966. [...] Mullen did not learn to <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> until he was ten years old, but at the age of 14 joined the Metropolitan association as one of the league's youngest players. [...] Mullen played four seasons in the league between 1971 and 1975. He scored 71 goals in 1973–74, then 182 points in 40 games the following season.

2500|$|Snowboards are {{generally}} constructed of a hardwood core which is sandwiched between {{multiple layers of}} fibreglass. Some snowboards incorporate the use of more exotic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, aluminium (as a honeycomb core structure), and have incorporated piezo dampers. The front (or [...] "nose") of the board is upturned to help the board glide over uneven snow. The back (or [...] "tail") of the board is also upturned to enable backwards (or [...] "switch") riding. The base (the side of the board which contacts the ground) is made of Polyethylene plastic. [...] The two major types of base construction are extruded and sintered. [...] An extruded base is a basic, low-maintenance design which basically consists of the plastic base material melted into its form. [...] A sintered base uses the same material as an extruded base, but first grinds the material into a powder, then, using heat and pressure, molds the material into its desired form. [...] A sintered base is generally softer than its extruded counterpart, but has a porous structure which enables it to absorb wax. [...] This wax absorption (along with a properly done 'hot wax'), greatly reduces surface friction between the base and the snow, allowing the snowboard to travel on {{a thin layer of}} water. Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster, but require semi-regular maintenance and are easier to damage. The bottom edges of the snowboard are fitted with a thin strip of steel, just a couple of millimeters wide. [...] This steel edge allows the board to grab or 'dig into' hard snow and ice (like the blade of an <b>ice</b> <b>skate),</b> and also protects the boards internal structure. [...] The top of the board is typically a layer of acrylic with some form of graphic designed to attract attention, showcase artwork, or serve the purpose similar to that of any other form of printed media. Flite Snowboards, an early designer, pressed the first closed-molded boards from a garage in Newport, Rhode Island, in the mid-1980s. Snowboard topsheet graphics can be a highly personal statement and many riders spend many hours customizing the look of their boards. The top of some boards may even include thin inlays with other materials, and some are made entirely of epoxy-impregnated wood. [...] The base of the board may also feature graphics, often designed in a manner to make the board's manufacturer recognizable in photos.|$|E
