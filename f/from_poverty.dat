5|$|In 993, the Chola Emperor Rajaraja I invaded Sri Lanka, {{forcing the}} then Sri Lankan ruler Mahinda V {{to flee to}} the {{southern}} part of the country. The Mahavamsa describes the rule of Mahinda V as weak, and the country was suffering <b>from</b> <b>poverty</b> by this time. It further mentions that his army rose against him due to lack of wages. Taking advantage of this situation, Rajendra I son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura. They moved the capital to Polonnaruwa and subsequent Sri Lankan rulers who came into power after the Chola reign continued to use Polonnaruwa as the capital, thus ending the Anuradhapura Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering <b>from</b> <b>poverty</b> away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E

25|$|There {{is greater}} {{indication}} that education in prison helps prevent reincarceration. Many people inside prisons lack education.

People in prisons generally come <b>from</b> <b>poverty</b> creating a continuous cycle of poverty and incarceration.|$|E

25|$|Obtaining {{freedom was}} not a {{guarantee}} of escape <b>from</b> <b>poverty</b> or from many aspects of slave life.

Women ex-slaves largely dominated market places selling food and goods in urban areas like Salvador, while a significant percent of African-born men freed from slavery became employed as skilled artisans, including work as sculptors, carpenters, and jewelers.|$|E
25|$|Development {{economist}} Paul Collier {{from the}} University of Oxford reviewed {{the book for}} The Guardian.

Such process is not natural, but only happens when the elites are willing to cede power to the majority under certain circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Following Isaiah Berlin, Halsema {{distinguishes between}} {{positive}} and negative freedom. Negative freedom is, according to Halsema, the freedom of citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should {{protect the rights of}} citizens and not limit them. Positive freedom is the emancipation of citizens <b>from</b> <b>poverty</b> and discrimination. Halsema wants to apply this concept to welfare state and the environment where government should take more action.
