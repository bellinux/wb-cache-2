5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who {{believe that they have}} parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of Solvent Impregnated Resins was first shown in 1971 by Abraham Warshawsky. This first venture {{was aimed at}} the extraction of metals. Ever since then, SIRs have been mainly used for metal extraction, be it heavy metals or specifically radioactive metals. Much research on SIRs <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> J.L Cortina and e.g. N. Kabay, K. Jerabek or J. Serarols. However, lately investigations also go towards using SIRs for the separation of natural compounds, and even for separation of biotechnological products.|$|E
25|$|Lighting control tools {{might best}} be {{described}} as anything that changes the quality of the light. Historically this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play back stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|E

25|$|Though {{relatively}} few mutations are advantageous, {{those that are}} {{play an important role}} in evolutionary changes. Like neutral mutations, weakly selected advantageous mutations can be lost due to random genetic drift, but strongly selected advantageous mutations are more likely to be fixed. Knowing the DFE of advantageous mutations may lead to increased ability to predict the evolutionary dynamics. Theoretical work on the DFE for advantageous mutations <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> John H. Gillespie and H. Allen Orr. They proposed that the distribution for advantageous mutations should be exponential under a wide range of conditions, which, in general, has been supported by experimental studies, at least for strongly selected advantageous mutations.|$|E
25|$|No recent {{evaluation}} of conservation status <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the IUCN. Additionally, considering the current confusion as to number of species, {{as well as}} the wide distribution, conservation status should be reconsidered. All strains are probably endangered, but some (notably the super red and red-tailed golden) more critically than others. The Asian arowana's high value as aquarium fish has impacted its conservation. Its popularity has soared since the late 1970s, and hobbyists may pay thousands of U.S. dollars for one of these animals. Certain color varieties are more endangered than others, since the red and gold varieties are both less common, and in higher demand in the aquarium trade.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner in}} which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not made a {{sufficient}} knowledge of what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed {{in the minds of}} their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception.|$|E

25|$|Measurements of the {{preceding}} sort are of ambient air - that is, air where people might breathe it and not in workplaces. These measurements are usually reliable and available. A possibly trickier measurement is of where the pollution comes from, often a question addressed by emissions inventories. In BC and other Canadian jurisdictions facilities are required to report to Environment Canada {{on an annual basis}} their releases of toxic substances to the air. There is a natural tendency in self reporting to under-report, notwithstanding which the inventory resulting tracks releases in an interesting way. At the NPRI we can see a complex example in the historical report summary of Canfor's NPRI reporting in recent years. Criticisms of such reporting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> Scott Vaughan, Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment in his Fall 2009 report.|$|E
25|$|These {{first three}} (and {{subsequently}} more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the Russian Empire during the 1903–6 period {{as a tool}} for scapegoating Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since The Protocols are presented as merely a document, the front matter and back matter are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the Italian scholar, Cesare G. De Michelis in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as Apocrypha.|$|E
25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E

To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion! ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{journalist}} Kay Hymowitz called Sesame Street [...] "a {{triumph of}} appearance over substance" [...] and credited its success not with quality, but with [...] "a combination of savvy timing, sophisticated image making, and vigorous promotion". She held the show {{partly responsible for}} the declining verbal abilities of American students, and accused the show of affirming negative stereotypes about women. According to Hymowitz, the show's creators discouraged children's natural curiosity about the world. She criticized the show for, instead of transforming television, being [...] "devoured" [...] by it. She took issue with its use of cultural references, stating that the show taught young children to embrace the negative values of commercialism, celebrity, and anti-intellectualism. She insisted that by using television's production values, the producers of Sesame Street emphasized their [...] "jazzy medium" [...] more than the educational content they were supposed to convey. Hymowitz took issue with the show's educational claims, stating that Sesame Street diminished young children's readiness for reading by limiting their abilities to engage in analytical and creative thinking. She reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW [...] "hint at advocacy masquerading as social science".|$|E
