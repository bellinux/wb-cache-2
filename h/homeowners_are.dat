5|$|Cook County <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General {{had the authority to}} investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General has the power to investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E

25|$|Pooling many {{mortgages}} with uncorrelated default probabilities {{creates a}} bond with a much lower probability of total default, in which no <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> able to make their payments (see Copula). Although the risk neutral credit spread is theoretically identical between a mortgage ensemble and the average mortgage within it, the chance of catastrophic loss is reduced.|$|E

25|$|Sizerville State Park is a hub of {{environment}} education. The Environmental Education Building houses exhibits {{and information about}} the plant and wildlife found in the park. <b>Homeowners</b> <b>are</b> taught how to plant around their homes {{to make them more}} attractive to creatures like butterflies and squirrels. Sizerville State Park provides environmental education programs to youth groups, schools and teachers. Park rangers also lead guided tours of the park, providing hands on learning experiences for all.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Berkeley {{initiated}} a revolutionary pilot program where <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> {{able to add}} the cost of solar panels to their property tax assessment, and pay for {{them out of their}} electricity cost savings. In 2009, more than a dozen states passed legislation allowing property tax financing. In all, 27 states offer loans for solar projects (though after the conclusion of the pilot program, due to issues with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Berkeley no longer offers this financing mechanism).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Homeowners</b> <b>are</b> usually {{expected}} to put approximately 500hours of [...] "sweat equity" [...] {{into their own}} or other project homes, although this amount may vary by location, the number of wage-earning adults in each family, and the recipients' health issues. This sweat equity acts as the down payment on the home. Every hour spent earning this sweat equity must be approved and signed off on by an official Habitat for Humanity representative. Sweat equity has no monetary value and cannot be 'refunded'.|$|E

2500|$|In {{swimming}} pools, chloramines {{are formed}} by the reaction of free chlorine with organic substances, such as urine and sweat. Chloramines, compared to free chlorine, are both less effective as a sanitizer and, if not managed correctly, more irritating to the eyes of swimmers. Chloramines are also responsible for the reported [...] "chlorine" [...] smell of swimming pools. Some pool test kits designed for use by <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> not able to distinguish free chlorine and chloramines, which can be misleading and lead to non-optimal levels of chloramines in the pool water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brothers}} have maintained that their shows are not contrived or scripted. <b>Homeowners</b> <b>are</b> not provided with storylines or dialog and unforeseen construction challenges are real. Additionally, they invest {{their own money}} in the competition series. However, they concede that conversations may be re-shot and incidents may be reconstructed due to disruptions on set (e.g. a plane flying overhead), to highlight how protracted problems were resolved, or because the cameras did not capture the real-time shot. [...] Homeowners must apply to the show with a shortlist of homes or a home they plan to buy, though Drew provides additional options, and reserves the right to reject their selection if the home is unsafe.|$|E
2500|$|Mortgage {{payments}} from <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> deposited into a locally administered [...] "Fund for Humanity", {{the proceeds of}} which go toward future construction. In an effort to discourage predatory lenders from targeting Habitat homeowner families, mortgage agreements require the Habitat for Humanity affiliate the right of first refusal. Until the mortgage is paid in full, a Habitat home has no equity and can only be sold back to Habitat for Humanity. Should a homeowner family decide to sell their home {{during the period of}} their mortgage, the affiliate will buy it back at market value. Often affiliates will have a shared appreciation model that will allow the affiliate to recapture a portion of the equity in the home depending on the time the family lived in the home and paid on the mortgage.|$|E
5000|$|Loan modification: This is {{a process}} whereby a <b>homeowner's</b> {{mortgage}} <b>is</b> modified and both lender and <b>homeowner</b> <b>are</b> bound by the new terms. The most common modifications are lowering the interest rate and extending the term to up to 40 years. Reduction in the principal balance, however, is so rare that the Federal Reserve wrote in a report that they could find no evidence that lenders were reducing principal balances on mortgages.|$|R
50|$|Even in 2009, {{many homes}} and <b>homeowners</b> <b>were</b> still devastated. Some organizations, like the statewide Louisiana Disaster Relief Foundation or the neighborhood-based United Saints Recovery Project {{are still working}} to provide support to homeowners in {{rebuilding}} their homes.|$|R

2500|$|Energy-efficient {{appliances}} {{are another}} method for households to decrease energy use. [...] Low-income households have trouble realizing this gain energy efficiency. [...] Energy-efficient appliances require a large up-front investment, and savings {{will not be}} realized for many years. [...] Local grantees {{have the option to}} use Weatherization funds to support appliance purchases. [...] However, unlike weatherization programs, the gains in household budgets are often not worth the investment. [...] A 2010 study examined the households' purchasing habits in regard to high-efficiency appliances. [...] Using household-level data, this study determines that <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> significantly more likely to own energy efficient large appliances, such as refrigerators or washing machines. However, the results show that the cost of this problem is negligible compared to overall energy consumption. This finding is important considering the increasing efficiency standards for household appliances. [...] A higher standard may put simple appliances out of the price range of low income households, while not offering much energy relief for households that do own them.|$|E
50|$|In each episode, the <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> {{introduced}} to Neil and Jay who gain their trust and learn {{of their dreams}} for the ultimate home renovation. After {{a few days of}} work the <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> then presented with a fake space. As the <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> brought into the fake space Neil and Jay drag the joke out until they finally reveal that the space is a fake. The hosts, {{with the help of a}} professional design team, transform the fake into the dream space for the homeowners.|$|E

50|$|Still {{feeling the}} blow, {{this has led}} to a loss of equity (from {{inflated}} levels) for every homeowner in the country. With less equity <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> less likely to qualify for a loan that will refinance them out of a risky loan; with less equity less <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> able to qualify for home equity line of credits or a second mortgage in order to pay for financial emergencies.|$|E

50|$|A Shade Greener {{installs}} {{and maintains}} solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV) onto {{the roofs of}} domestic properties. The company keeps the Feed-in-Tariff and owns the panels, whilst the <b>homeowner</b> <b>is</b> allowed to use the free electricity that the solar PV produces. ASG installs systems that have 16 or 18 panels, which on suitable south-facing roofs generate at least 3000 kilowatt hours of energy per annum. The scheme benefits homeowners who would otherwise be unable to afford the cost of buying and installing the panels; however, investigations by journalists and consumer groups, including Which?, concluded that the financial benefit to <b>homeowners</b> <b>is</b> considerably less than {{if they were to}} borrow money to buy and install panels themselves.|$|R

An additional 3.5 million <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> in the foreclosure process or are so delinquent on payments {{that they will be}} soon. Roughly 13.5 million <b>homeowners</b> <b>are</b> underwater (in negative equity), meaning they owe more than their home is now worth, increasing the odds that millions more will lose their homes.
