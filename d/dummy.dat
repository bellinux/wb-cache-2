5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half <b>dummy</b> field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing <b>dummy</b> guns at Munassib.

5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now.

They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). <b>Dummy</b> tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
