5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
25|$|Chloramine can {{be removed}} from tap water by {{treatment}} with superchlorination (10ppm or more of <b>free</b> <b>chlorine,</b> such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool sanitizer) while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid). Hypochlorous acid from the <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> strips the ammonia from the chloramine, and the ammonia outgasses {{from the surface of}} the bulk water. This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of chloramine. Residual <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> can then be removed by exposure to bright sunlight for about 4 hours.|$|E
25|$|NH2Cl is {{commonly}} used in low concentrations as a secondary disinfectant in municipal water distribution systems {{as an alternative to}} chlorination. This application is increasing.

The {{time required for}} 99. 9 % inactivation of ten enteroviruses and two adenoviruses by 0. 5 mg/l <b>free</b> available <b>chlorine</b> at pH 7. 0 and 25 degrees C was prolonged approximately 4. 8 - 28. 8 times {{by the addition of}} 30 mg/l cyanuric acid. Comparative inactivation of poliovirus 1 by <b>free</b> available <b>chlorine</b> with or without cyanuric acid revealed the following. The inactivation rate by 1. 5 mg/l <b>free</b> available <b>chlorine</b> with 30 mg/l cyanuric acid or by 0. 5 mg/l <b>free</b> available <b>chlorine</b> with 1 mg/l cyanuric acid was slower than by 0. 5 mg/l <b>free</b> available <b>chlorine</b> alone. Temperature and pH did not affect the inhibitory influence of cyanuric acid on the disinfectant action of chlorine. In the swimming-pool and tap water, cyanuric acid delayed the virucidal effect of chlorine as much as in the 'clean' condition of chlorine-buffered distilled water. The available chlorine value should be increased to 1. 5 mg/l when cyanuric acid is used in swimming-pool water...|$|R

25|$|The use of {{chloramine}} {{is becoming}} more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> {{and it will not}} readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding ammonia to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience nitrification, as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, {{there is a danger}} of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E

25|$|The largest use {{of ozone}} {{is in the}} {{preparation}} of pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and many other commercially useful organic compounds, where it is used to sever carbon-carbon bonds. It can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources. Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine. Ozone has a very high oxidation potential. Ozone does not form organochlorine compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen bromate in source water with high bromide concentrations. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where electrical power is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of chlorine treatment on the infectivity of hepatitis A virus (HAV). Prodromal chimpanzee feces, shown to induce hepatitis in marmosets (Saguinus sp.), was clarified, and the virus was precipitated with 7 % polyethylene glycol 6000, harvested, and resuspended. The suspension was layered onto 5 to 30 % linear sucrose gradients and centrifuged; the fractions containing HAV were dialyzed, and a 1 : 500, 000 dilution of this preparation induced hepatitis and seroconversion in 2 of 4 marmosets. A 1 : 50 dilution of this preparation served as inoculum. Untreated inoculum induced overt hepatitis and seroconversion in 100 % (5 of 5) of marmosets inoculated intramuscularly. Inoculum treated for various periods (15, 30, or 60 min) with 0. 5, 1. 0, or 1. 5 mg of <b>free</b> residual <b>chlorine</b> per liter induced hepatitis in 14 % (2 of 14), 8 % (1 of 12), and 10 % (1 of 10) of marmosets, respectively, and induced seroconversion in 29, 33, and 10 % of the animals. Inoculum treated with 2. 0 or 2. 5 mg of <b>free</b> residual <b>chlorine</b> per liter was not infectious in marmosets as determined by absence of hepatitis and seroconversion in the 13 animals tested.

The organisms selected for study were Escherichia coli (LacZ 545), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 23355), and the amphipod Hyalella azteca. E. coli was shown to bind tightly (1. 6 X 10 (4) CFU per amphipod) to this macroinvertebrate and to resist repeated attempts to wash it off.
