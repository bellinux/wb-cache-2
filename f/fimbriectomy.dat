5000|$|<b>Fimbriectomy</b> {{is a very}} {{uncommon}} type of {{tubal ligation}} that is performed by removing the end (fimbria) of the fallopian tube leaving only the tubal segment attached to the uterus. After <b>fimbriectomy,</b> if the remaining tubal segment is long enough, {{the end of the}} tube can be opened and 'new' fimbria can be created by a procedure called a neofimbrioplasty. These [...] "new" [...] fimbria are not actually fimbria, but they are the cilia from the inside of the fallopian tube that have been exposed by everting the tubal lumen much like the petals of a rose are exposed once the rose blooms. These 'new' fimbria are much less effective at collecting (catching) an egg that has been released from the ovary than the real fimbria that had been removed during the <b>fimbriectomy</b> performed by the surgeon who did the original tubal ligation. During a neofimbrioplasty the tubal end is opened and folded back (marsupialized) so that the tubal end remains open and exposing the internal lining of the tube.|$|E

Posterior colpotomy has the added advantage {{that it can be}} conveniently performed under a combination of intravenous neuroleptanalgesia and local vaginal anesthesia.

40|$|Background: Tubal reanastomosis is a {{procedure}} to anastomose the cut {{ends of the}} fallopian tube. Laparotomy is {{the most frequently used}} microsurgical technique for this reversal, with results showing intrauterine pregnancies ranging from 50 to 80 % and a rate of ectopic pregnancy less than 5 % in these series. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the pregnancy rate and live birth rate achieved through laparotomy tubal reanastomosis. Methods: Data from 152 consecutive laparotomy tubal reanastomosis procedures done between January 2004 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon by laparotomy using microsurgical instruments. The main outcome measures were: total pregnancy rate and live birth rate. Results: Out of 152 women, who were willing for reversal operation, 4 had <b>fimbriectomy,</b> 8 had residual tube length < 4 cm. Remaining 140 patients underwent tubal reanastomosis. 2 patients died, 2 patient's husband died, 22 patients were lost to follow-up, and 9 are still in follow up period. Hence 105 patients were analyzed. Total pregnancy rate was 82. 8 % and live birth rate 73. 3 %. Conclusions: Tubal reanastomosis by laparotomy with microsurgical instruments results in a satisfactory pregnancy rate. [Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol 2016; 5 (7. 000) : 2180 - 2182...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was two-fold. Firstly it was to assess the {{suitability}} for tubal recanalization and factors predicting successful laparoscopic recanalization. Secondly, it was to analyze the fertility outcomes and factors affecting the pregnancy rate following laparoscopic tubal recanalization. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of prospectively followed-up 29 women at a tertiary care center seeking tubal sterilization reversal between May 2005 and February 2010 were included. Results: In 14 (48. 3 %) women unilateral tubes were suitable and in only 3 women (10. 3 %) bilateral tubes were suitable. All cases with laparoscopic tubal sterilization were suitable, whereas all cases with <b>fimbriectomy</b> were unsuitable for recanalization. In 6 (20. 7 %) cases salphingostomy was performed as an alternative procedure to tubal reanastomosis. The overall pregnancy rate was 58. 8 %. In cases with sterilization by Pomeroy′s method, 4 out of 10 (40 %) conceived, whereas for laparoscopic tubal ligation cases 6 out of 7 (85. 7 %) conceived (P= 0. 32). None of the patients with final tubal length < 5 cm conceived (P= 0. 03). Comparing the age at recanalization, in women ≤ 30 years, 71. 4 % conceived, as compared with 50 % when age of women was more than 30 years (P= 0. 37). Conclusions: The important factors determining the success of recanalization are technique of sterilization and the remaining length of the tube after recanalization. The gynecologist must use an effective technique of sterilization to minimize the failure rates, but at the same time, which causes minimal trauma, and aim at preserving the length of the tube so that reversal is more likely to be successful, should the patient′s circumstances change...|$|E
