50|$|The <b>Four</b> <b>Minute</b> Men idea {{became a}} useful tool in the {{propaganda}} campaign because it addressed a specific rhetorical situation. One of {{the challenges of the}} effort was the fragmented audience of the United States. Many different heritages were represented in the United States, and the president needed their support for the war. To address each groups specific needs, the director of the <b>Four</b> <b>Minute</b> Men, William McCormick Blair, delegated the duty of speaking to local men. Well known and respected community figures often volunteered for the <b>Four</b> <b>Minute</b> Men program. This gave the speeches a local voice. Also, the <b>four</b> <b>minute</b> men were given general topics and talking points to follow and rotated between theaters to help the speeches seem fresh, instead of generic propaganda speeches.|$|R

The local chairman would then appoint a number of speakers to cover the theaters in the city or community for which he is responsible for.|$|R
