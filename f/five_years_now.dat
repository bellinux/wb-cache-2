6000|$|I {{believe the}} {{difference}} {{began in the}} matter of a horse, with a twist in his temper, whom Pinecoffin sold to Nafferton and by whom Nafferton was nearly slain.

He hounded Pinecoffin from Mithankot to Jagadri, and from Gurgaon to Abbottabad up and across the Punjab, a large province and in places remarkably dry.

6000|$|But I am not thanking you, {{all this}} time, for the {{interesting}} {{remarks about the}} book I had last placed in your hands (The Wings of the Dove), which you so heroically flung upon paper even on the heaving deep--a feat to me very prodigious. I won't say your criticism was eminent for the time and place--I'll say, frankly, that it was eminent in itself, and all full of suggestion. The fact is, however, that one is so aware one's self, even to satiety, of the rights and wrongs of these matters--especially of the wrongs--that freshness of mind almost fails for discriminations, however benevolent, of others. Such {{is the price of}} having written many books and lived many years. The thing in question is, by a complicated accident which it would take too long to describe to you, too inordinately drawn out, and too inordinately rubbed in. The centre, moreover, isn't in the middle, or the middle, rather, isn't in the centre, but ever so much too near the end, so that what was to come after it is truncated. The book, in fine, has too big a head for its body. I am trying, all the while, to write one with the opposite disproportion--the body too big for its head. So I shall perhaps do if I live to 150. Don't therefore undermine me by general remarks. And dictating, please, has moreover nothing to do with it. The value of that process for me is in its help to do over and over, for which it is extremely adapted, and which is the only way I can do at all. It soon enough, accordingly, becomes, intellectually, absolutely identical with the act of writing--or has become so, after <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> with me; so that the difference is only material and illusory--only the difference, that is, that I walk up and down: which is so much to the good.--But I must stop walking now.

6000|$|Thus we {{see that}} Scott, when he began [...] "Waverley" [...] in 1805, brought to his labour no hard-and-fast theory {{of the art of}} fiction, but a kindly {{readiness}} to be pleased, and to find good in everything. He brought his wide knowledge of contemporary Scottish life [...] "from the peer to the ploughman;" [...] he brought his well-digested wealth of antiquarian lore, and the poetic skill which had just been busied with the [...] "Lay of the Last Minstrel," [...] and was still to be occupied, ere he finished his interrupted novel, with [...] "Marmion," [...] "The Lady of the Lake," [...] "Rokeby," [...] and [...] "The Lord of the Isles." [...] The comparative failure of the last-named no doubt strengthened his determination to try prose romance. He had never cared mach for his own poems, he says, Byron had outdone him in popularity, and the Muse--"the Good Demon" [...] who once deserted Herrick--came now less eagerly to his call. It is curiously difficult to disentangle the statements about the composition of [...] "Waverley." [...] Our first authority, of course, is Scott's own account, given in the General Preface to the Edition of 1829. Lockhart, however, remarks on the haste with which Sir Walter wrote the Introductions to the magnum opus; and the lapse of fifteen years, the effects of disease, and his habitual carelessness about his own works and mode of working may certainly to some extent have clouded his memory. [...] "About the year 1805," [...] as he says, he [...] "threw together about one third part of the first volume of 'Waverley.'" [...] It was advertised to be published, he goes on, by Ballantvne, with the second title, [...] "'T is Fifty Years since." [...] This, obviously, would have made 1755 the date of the events, just as the title [...] "'T is Sixty Years since" [...] in 1814 brought the date of the events to 1754. By inspecting the water-mark of the paper Lockhart discovered that 1805 was the period in which the first few chapters were composed; the rest of the paper was marked 1814. Scott next observes that the unfavourable opinion of a critical friend on the first seven chapters induced him to lay the manuscript aside. Who was this friend? Lockhart thinks it was Erskine. It is certain, from a letter of Ballantyne's at Abbotsford,--a letter printed by Lockhart, September 15, 1810,--that Ballantyne in 1810 saw at least the earlier portions of [...] "Waverley," [...] and it is clear enough that he had seen none of it before. If any friend did read it in 1805, it cannot have been Ballantyne, and may have been Erskine. But none of the paper bears a water-mark, between 1805 and 1813, so Scott must merely have taken it up, in 1810, as it had been for <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Now</b> Scott says that the success of [...] "The Lady of the Lake," [...] with its Highland pictures, induced him [...] "to attempt something of the same sort in prose." [...] This, as Lockhart notes, cannot refer to 1805, as the [...] "Lady of the Lake" [...] did not appear till 1810. But the good fortune of the [...] "Lady" [...] may very well have induced him in 1810 to reconsider his Highland prose romance. In 1808, as appears from an undated letter to Surtees of Mainsforth (Abbotsford Manuscripts), he was contemplating a poem on [...] "that wandering knight so fair," [...] Charles Edward, and on the adventures of his flight, on Lochiel, Flora Macdonald, the Kennedys, and the rest. Earlier still, on June 9, 1806, Scott wrote to Lady Abercorn that he had [...] "a great work in contemplation, a Highland romance of love, magic, and war." [...] "The Lady of the Lake" [...] took the place of that poem in his [...] "century of inventions," [...] and, stimulated by the popularity of his Highland romance in verse, he disinterred the last seven chapters of [...] "Waverley" [...] from their five years of repose. Very probably, as he himself hints, the exercise of fitting a conclusion to Strutt's [...] "Queenloo Hall" [...] may have helped to bring his fancy back to his own half-forgotten story of [...] "Waverley." [...] In 1811 Scott went to Abbotsford, and there, as he tells us, he lost sight of his [...] "Waverley" [...] fragment. Often looked for, it was never found, till the accident of a search for fishing-tackle led him to discover it in the drawer of an old bureau in a lumber-garret. This cabinet afterwards came into the possession of Mr. William Laidlaw, Scott's friend and amanuensis, and it is still, the Editor understands, in the hands of Miss Laidlaw. The fishing-tackle, Miss Laidlaw tells the Editor (mainly red hackles, tied on hair, not gut), still occupies the drawer, except a few flies which were given, as relics, to the late Mr. Thomas Tod Stoddart. In 1813, then, volume i. of [...] "Waverley" [...] was finished. Then Scott undertook some articles for Constable, and laid the novel aside. The printing, at last, must have been very speedy. Dining in Edinburgh, in June, 1814, Lockhart saw [...] "the hand of Walter Scott" [...] busy at its task. [...] "Page after page is finished, and thrown on the heap of manuscripts, and still it goes on unwearied." [...] The book was published on July 7, the press hardly keeping up with the activity of the author. Scott had written [...] "two volumes in three summer weeks" [...] and the printers had not shown less activity, while binders and stitchers must have worked extra tides.|$|E
