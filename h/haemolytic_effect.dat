The authors report on studies of the <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> of diaphenylsulfone (DDS) administered orally, in doses ranging from 25 mg to 300 mg daily for 21 days, to normal healthy men and to healthy Negro men with deficiency of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PD).

There was a direct relationship between the dose of diaphenylsulfone and the extent of haemolysis in both groups of men studied. Comparison of the <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> of diaphenylsulfone with those of the antimalarial drug primaquine revealed that, on a dose for weight basis, diaphenylsulfone is more haemolytic than primaquine in normal persons and less so in G- 6 -PD-deficient persons. A marked decrease in the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in red cells, comparable to the changes in levels of erythrocytic GSH known to occur during primaquine-induced haemolysis, occurred just before and early during the acute haemolytic episode that resulted from administration of diaphenylsulfone to G- 6 -PD-deficient subjects; in contrast, levels of erythrocytic GSH increased early during the course of diaphenylsulfone-induced haemolysis in normal men...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: The {{antimalarial}} combination drug artemether/lumefantrine {{has been}} shown to be effective against malaria parasite through its haemolytic action. This drug is sometimes co-administered with vitamin C in patients with malaria. Vitamin C is associated with antioxidant properties which would be expected to protect against <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> of this antimalarial drug. This study was designed to investigate in vitro effects of co-incubation of artemether/lumefantrine with vitamin C on the viscosity and elasticity of blood. Methods: Blood was collected from 12 healthy female volunteers with normal haemoglobin genotype (HbAA). A Bioprofiler was used to measure the viscosity and elasticity of untreated blood samples (control) and samples exposed to artemether/lumefantrine (0. 06 / 0. 36 mg/ml) alone and with low or high dose vitamin C (equivalent to adult doses of 100 or 500 mg). Results: artemether/lumefantrine significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced viscosity of blood from 4. 72 ± 0. 38 to 3. 78 ± 0. 17 mPa. s. Addition of vitamin C (500 mg) further reduced blood viscosity to 2. 67 ± 0. 05 mPa. s. The elasticity of blood was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced from 0. 33 ± 0. 04 mPa. s to 0. 24 ± 0. 03 mPa. s by the antimalarial drug, and further reduced to 0. 13 ± 0. 02 mPa. s in the presence of vitamin C (500 mg). Interpretation & conclusions: Co-incubation of blood with vitamin C and antimalarial combination drug potentiates the <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> of the latter on reducing blood viscosity and elasticity in vitro. This may possibly have implications in relation to haemolysis in patients receiving vitamin C supplementation with artemether/lumefantrine during malaria therapy...|$|R

No <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effect</b> was evident for cholic acid and UDCA. The <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effect</b> of the other bile acids was reduced by addition of HP-beta-CyD and was prevented at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 owing to complex formation.

Here, we report the recombinant production and characterization of two novel HDPs identified in human Apolipoprotein B (residues 887 - 922) by using a bioinformatics method recently developed by our group. We focused our attention on two variants of the identified HDP, here named r(P) ApoBL and r(P) ApoBS, 38 - and 26 -residue long, respectively. Both HDPs were found to be endowed with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity while they show neither toxic nor <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> towards eukaryotic cells.

SC 4 peptide-amphiphiles showed up to a 30 -fold increase in bactericidal activity against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus anthracis), including S. aureus strains resistant to conventional antibiotics, but little or no increase in bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Fatty acid conjugation improved endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) neutralization by 3 - to 6 -fold. Although acylation somewhat increased lysis of human erythrocytes, it did not increase lysis of endothelial cells, and the <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> occurred at concentrations 10 - to 100 -fold higher than those required for bacterial cell lysis. For insight into the mechanism of action of SC 4 peptide-amphiphiles, CD, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed in micelle and liposome models of eukaryotic and bacterial cell membranes. CD indicated that SC 4 peptide-amphiphiles had the strongest helical tendencies in liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes, and strong membrane integration of the SC 4 peptide-amphiphiles was observed using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy under these conditions; results that correlated with the increased bactericidal activities of SC 4 peptide-amphiphiles. NMR structural analysis in micelles demonstrated that the two-thirds of the peptide closest to the fatty acid tail exhibited a helical conformation, with the positively-charged side of the amphipathic helix interacting more with the model membrane surface. These results indicate that conjugation of a fatty acid chain to the SC 4 peptide enhances membrane interactions, stabilizes helical structure in the membrane-bound state and increases bactericidal potency...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{consider}} using dapsone in pregnant women for its antimalarial activity is becoming greater in areas where Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine is rapidly increasing. Dapsone {{in combination with other}} antimalarials might provide a valuable alternative for both treatment and prophylaxis. This review assesses the clinical pharmacology of dapsone and its adverse drug reactions in relation to haemolysis, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency, blood dyscrasias and methaemoglobinaemia. Studies are summarised reporting its use in leprosy, dermatological and other conditions, and malaria, in relation to maternal and infant outcomes. A total of 924 pregnancies were identified during which dapsone therapy was taken. Only limited data are available and this precludes a meaningful quantitative benefit-risk analysis. Mild degrees of haemolysis consistently occur with continued therapy, although adverse effects may be less likely with intermittent treatment, as most reported adverse effects have occurred with long-term use of dapsone. There are a number of gaps in knowledge where more data are needed. These include no data on pharmacokinetics in pregnancy and whether these are altered with co-administration of chlorproguanil. Potential complications in women with severe anaemia are unknown and there is no information on <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> in women or the fetus with G 6 PD deficiency. The use of dapsone in HIV-infected women in malarious areas could carry increased risks because of the immunosuppressive actions of the drug. Trials of dapsone therapy in pregnancy should be considered in malarious areas where there is good reason for its deployment. Controlled trials have provided data on maternal tolerance, and dapsone in combination with other antimalarial drugs can offer clear benefit in terms of improved birthweight. The use of dapsone combinations should be considered when no good alternative is available and the threat of malaria is the greater ris...|$|R
40|$|The immobilizing {{effect of}} normal guinea pig serum and some serum {{fractions}} on P. aurelia is correlated with their <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effect</b> on sensitized erythrocytes, {{indicating that the}} activity is due to complement. Complement fixation tests were used to compare P. aurelia and T. pyriformis antigens. Complement {{was found to be}} fixed by the external antigens of T. pyriformis but not by those of P. aurelia. Breis formed by macerating both species of ciliate fixed complement and cross-reactions between the two breis and the non-homologous antisera were shown to occur. No difference, as shown by complement fixation tests, was found between the internal antigens of two varieties of P. aurelia. The effect of complement on the immune reactions involving P. aurelia and T. pyriformis and their homologous antisera was examined and no lytic reaction at high dilutions of the antisera was found...|$|E
40|$|Substitutions on the {{benzene ring}} of nitrosobenzene {{did not have}} the same effect on {{oxidative}} haemolysis as substitutions on phenylhydrazine. We previously found that the <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effect</b> of arylhydrazines paralleled their oxidative conversion into ligands of ferrihaemoglobin. In contrast, although most substituted nitrosobenzenes that are ligands of ferrohaemoglobin caused haemolysis and most that are not ligands failed to cause nitrosoarenes appeared to be related more closely to the ease of their reduction to arylhydroxylamines than to their properties as ligands. We propose a mechanism of oxidative degradation whereby the cyclic formation of phenylhydroxylamine from nitrosobenzene within an erythrocyte leads to the accumulation of H 2 O 2, which then reacts with ferrohaemoglobin to initiate the oxidative cleavage of haem. The posulated active intermediate in this reaction is the same as that previously proposed in the oxidative degradation of haemoglobin by phenylhydrzine and in the coupled oxidation of ascorbic acid and haemoglobin...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme linked and radioimmune direct antiglobulin tests (DAGTs) {{were used}} to assess red cell bound IgG, IgA, and IgM in 585 {{patients}} referred to an immunohaematology reference centre. One hundred and fifty eight patients with {{less than or equal to}} 200 mol IgG and small amounts of IgA and IgM coating their red cells were studied in detail. The presence of autoimmune haemolysis was determined from the clinical, haematological, and biochemical findings; it occurred in at least 25 % of the 158 patients, the degree varying widely. There was a highly significant association between small increases in cell bound immunoglobulins and the presence of autoimmune haemolysis. Immunoglobulins of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes could produce autoimmune haemolysis when the classical agglutination DAGTs were negative; the IgA and IgM were usually found in association with IgG. The <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effect</b> was enhanced by the presence of complement and combinations of immunoglobulin classes on the red cells...|$|E

The number of exchange transfusions performed after the first 12 hours of life was significantly lower in the blue double light group. It is concluded that the application of blue double light may be a superior means of applying phototherapy in rhesus haemolytic disease...|$|R
40|$|Primaquine is {{the only}} drug {{consistently}} effective against mature gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum. The transmission blocking dose of primaquine previously recommended was 0. 75 mg/kg (adult dose 45 mg) but its deployment was limited because of concerns over <b>haemolytic</b> <b>effects</b> in patients with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency. G 6 PD deficiency is an inherited X-linked enzymatic defect that affects an estimated 400 million {{people around the world}} with high frequencies (15 - 20 %) in populations living in malarious areas. To reduce transmission in low transmission settings and facilitate elimination of P. falciparum, the World Health Organization now recommends adding a single dose of 0. 25 mg/kg (adult dose 15 mg) to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) without G 6 PD testing. Direct evidence of the safety of this low dose is lacking. Adverse events and haemoglobin variations after this treatment were assessed in both G 6 PD normal and deficient subjects in the context of targeted malaria elimination in a malaria endemic area on the North-Western Myanmar-Thailand border where prevalence of G 6 PD deficiency (Mahidol variant) approximates 15 %. The tolerability and safety of primaquine (single dose 0. 25 mg base/kg) combined with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) given three times at monthly intervals was assessed in 819 subjects. Haemoglobin concentrations were estimated over the six months preceding the ACT + primaquine rounds of mass drug administration. G 6 PD deficiency was assessed with a phenotypic test and genotyping was performed in male subjects with deficient phenotypes and in all females. Fractional haemoglobin changes in relation to G 6 PD phenotype and genotype and primaquine round were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. No adverse events related to primaquine were reported during the trial. Mean fractional haemoglobin changes after each primaquine treatment in G 6 PD deficient subjects (- 5. 0 %, - 4. 2 % and - 4. 7 %) were greater than in G 6 PD normal subjects (0. 3 %, - 0. 8 and - 1. 7 %) but were clinically insignificant. Fractional drops in haemoglobin concentration larger than 25 % following single dose primaquine were observed in 1. 8 % of the population but were asymptomatic. The single low dose (0. 25 mg/kg) of primaquine is clinically well tolerated and can be used safely without prior G 6 PD testing in populations with high prevalence of G 6 PD deficiency. The present evidence supports a broader use of low dose primaquine without G 6 PD testing for the treatment and elimination of falciparum malaria. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01872702...|$|R
40|$|The only {{currently}} available drug that effectively removes malaria hypnozoites {{from the human}} host is primaquine. The use of 8 ‑aminoquinolines is hampered by <b>haemolytic</b> side <b>effects</b> in glucose‑ 6 ‑phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficient individuals. Recently a number of qualitative and a quantitative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) format have been developed that provide {{an alternative to the}} current standard G 6 PD activity assays. The WHO has recently recom‑ mended routine testing of G 6 PD status prior to primaquine radical cure whenever possible. A workshop was held in the Philippines in early 2015 to discuss key challenges and knowledge gaps that hinder the introduction of routine G 6 PD testing. Two point‑of‑care (PoC) test formats for the measurement of G 6 PD activity are {{currently available}}: qualitative tests comparable to malaria RDT as well as biosensors that provide a quantitative reading. Qualitative G 6 PD PoC tests provide a binomial test result, are easy to use and some products are comparable in price to the widely used fluorescent spot test. Qualitative test results can accurately classify hemizygous males, heterozygous females, but may misclassify females with intermediate G 6 PD activity. Biosensors provide a more complex quantitative readout and are better suited to identify heterozygous females. While associated with higher costs per sample tested biosensors have the potential for broader use in other scenarios where knowledge of G 6 PD activity is relevant as well. The introduc‑ tion of routine G 6 PD testing is associated with additional costs on top of routine treatment that will vary by settin...|$|R
