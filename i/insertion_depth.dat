40|$|AbstractA {{commercial}} {{polymeric film}} (Parafilm M®, {{a blend of}} a hydrocarbon wax and a polyolefin) was evaluated as a model membrane for microneedle (MN) insertion studies. Polymeric MN arrays were inserted into Parafilm M® (PF) and also into excised neonatal porcine skin. Parafilm M® was folded before the insertions to closely approximate thickness of the excised skin. <b>Insertion</b> <b>depths</b> were evaluated using optical coherence tomography (OCT) using either a force applied by a Texture Analyser or {{by a group of}} human volunteers. The obtained <b>insertion</b> <b>depths</b> were, in general, slightly lower, especially for higher forces, for PF than for skin. However, this difference was not a large, being less than the 10 % of the needle length. Therefore, all these data indicate that this model membrane could be a good alternative to biological tissue for MN insertion studies. As an alternative method to OCT, light microscopy was used to evaluate the <b>insertion</b> <b>depths</b> of MN in the model membrane. This provided a rapid, simple method to compare different MN formulations. The use of Parafilm M®, in conjunction with a standardised force/time profile applied by a Texture Analyser, could provide the basis for a rapid MN quality control test suitable for in-process use. It could also be used as a comparative test of insertion efficiency between candidate MN formulations...|$|R

40|$|A wide {{spectrum}} of intracellular processes {{is dependent on the}} ability of cells to dynamically regulate membrane shape. Membrane bending by proteins is necessary for the generation of intracellular transport carriers and for the maintenance of otherwise intrinsically unstable regions of high membrane curvature in cell organelles. Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins curve membranes is therefore of primary importance. Here we suggest, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, a quantitative mechanism of lipid membrane bending by hydrophobic or amphipathic rodlike inclusions which simulate amphipathic α-helices—structures shown to sculpt membranes. Considering the lipid monolayer matrix as an anisotropic elastic material, we compute the intramembrane stresses and strains generated by the embedded inclusions, determine the resulting membrane shapes, and the accumulated elastic energy. We characterize the ability of an inclusion to bend membranes by an effective spontaneous curvature, and show that shallow rodlike inclusions are more effective in membrane shaping than are lipids having a high propensity for curvature. Our computations provide experimentally testable predictions on the protein amounts needed to generate intracellular membrane shapes for various <b>insertion</b> <b>depths</b> and membrane thicknesses.

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{discoveries of}} serious {{artifacts}} {{associated with the}} use of cell fixation in studies of the cellular uptake of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have prompted a reevaluation of the current understanding of peptide-mediated cellular delivery. Following a report on the differential cellular uptake of a number of penetratin analogs in unfixed cells, we here investigate their membrane translocation abilities in large and giant unilamellar vesicles (LUVs and GUVs, respectively). Surprisingly, in contrast to the behavior in living cells, all peptides readily entered the giant vesicles (> 1 μm) as proved by confocal microscopy, while none of them could cross the membranes of LUVs (100 nm). For determination of the location of the peptides in the LUVs, a new concept was introduced, based on sensitive resonance energy transfer (RET) measurements of the enhanced fluorescence of acceptor fluorophores present solely in the inner leaflet.

40|$|PURPOSE: In practice, {{the surgeon}} {{must rely on}} screw {{position}} (<b>insertion</b> <b>depth)</b> and tactile feedback from the screwdriver (insertion torque) to gauge compression. In this study, we identified the relationship between interfragmentary compression and these 2 factors. METHODS: The Acutrak Standard, Acutrak Mini, Synthes 3. 0, and Herbert-Whipple implants were tested using a polyurethane foam scaphoid model. A specialized testing jig simultaneously measured compression force, insertion torque, and <b>insertion</b> <b>depth</b> at half-screw-turn intervals until failure occurred. RESULTS: The peak compression occurs at an <b>insertion</b> <b>depth</b> of 2 ̆ 2123. 1 mm, 2 ̆ 2122. 8 mm, 0. 9 mm, and 1. 5 mm for the Acutrak Mini, Acutrak Standard, Herbert-Whipple, and Synthes screws respectively (<b>insertion</b> <b>depth</b> is positive when the screw is proud above the bone and negative when buried). The compression and insertion torque {{at a depth of}} 2 ̆ 2122 mm were found to be 113 1 18 N and 0. 348 1 0. 052 Nm for the Acutrak Standard, 104 1 15 N and 0. 175 1 0. 008 Nm for the Acutrak Mini, 78 1 9 N and 0. 245 1 0. 006 Nm for the Herbert-Whipple, and 67 1 2 N, 0. 233 1 0. 010 Nm for the Synthes headless compression screws. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 screws generated a sizable amount of compression (> 60 N) over a wide range of insertion depths. The compression at the commonly recommended <b>insertion</b> <b>depth</b> of 2 ̆ 2122 mm was not significantly different between screws; thus, implant selection should not be based on compression profile alone. Conically shaped screws (Acutrak) generated their peak compression when they were fully buried in the foam whereas the shanked screws (Synthes and Herbert-Whipple) reached peak compression before they were fully inserted. Because insertion torque correlated poorly with compression, surgeons should avoid using tactile judgment of torque as a proxy for compression.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of different implant materials on the primary stability of orthodontic mini-implants by measuring the resonance frequency. Twenty-five orthodontic mini-implants with a diameter of 2  mm were used. The first group contained stainless steel mini-implants with two different lengths (10 and 12  mm). The second group included titanium alloy mini-implants with two different lengths (10 and 12  mm) and stainless steel mini-implants 10  mm in length. The mini-implants were inserted into artificial bones with a 2 -mm-thick cortical layer and 40 or 20  lb/ft 3 trabecular bone density at insertion depths of 2, 4, and 6  mm. The resonance frequency of the mini-implants in the artificial bone was detected with the Implomates® device. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey honestly significant difference test (α =  0. 05). Greater <b>insertion</b> <b>depth</b> resulted in higher resonance frequency, whereas longer mini-implants showed lower resonance frequency values. However, resonance frequency was not influenced by the implant materials titanium alloy or stainless steel. Therefore, the primary stability of a mini-implant is influenced by <b>insertion</b> <b>depth</b> and not by implant material. <b>Insertion</b> <b>depth</b> is extremely important for primary implant stability and is critical for treatment success...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A wide {{spectrum}} of intracellular processes {{is dependent on the}} ability of cells to dynamically regulate membrane shape. Membrane bending by proteins is necessary for the generation of intracellular transport carriers and for the maintenance of otherwise intrinsically unstable regions of high membrane curvature in cell organelles. Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins curve membranes is therefore of primary importance. Here we suggest, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, a quantitative mechanism of lipid membrane bending by hydrophobic or amphipathic rodlike inclusions which simulate amphipathic a-helices—structures shown to sculpt membranes. Considering the lipid monolayer matrix as an anisotropic elastic material, we compute the intramembrane stresses and strains generated by the embedded inclusions, determine the resulting membrane shapes, and the accumulated elastic energy. We characterize the ability of an inclusion to bend membranes by an effective spontaneous curvature, and show that shallow rodlike inclusions are more effective in membrane shaping than are lipids having a high propensity for curvature. Our computations provide experimentally testable predictions on the protein amounts needed to generate intracellular membrane shapes for various <b>insertion</b> <b>depths</b> and membrane thicknesses. We also predict that the ability of N-BAR domains to produce membrane tubules in vivo can be ascribed solely to insertion of their amphipathic helices...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To {{study to}} what extent it is {{possible}} to achieve identical <b>insertion</b> <b>depths</b> and to maintain the same performance after cochlear reimplantation. STUDY DESIGN: Outcome research on a retrospective case series in a tertiary university referral center. METHODS: Data were collected for 12 adults and three children who underwent reimplantation during the last 3 years with a new HiRes 90 K device with HiFocus 1 J electrode owing to failure of the feed-through seal. Multislice computed tomography scans were used to compare positions of the original and newly placed electrode arrays. The speech-perception scores on a consonant-vowel-consonant word test before and after reimplantation were compared. RESULTS: All reimplantations were successfully performed by two experienced cochlear implantation surgeons, and no complications were observed. Postoperative imaging showed that the average displacement of the new implant was only 0. 59 mm. Reactivation of the implant gave immediate open set speech understanding in all patients, and speech perception rapidly returned to the previous level obtained with the original implant within weeks; it was even significantly better at the 3 -month follow-up. No relation was found between changes in performance and the amount of displacement of the electrode array. CONCLUSIONS: After cochlear reimplantation with the same device, electrode-array position can be accurately replicated and speech perception can be regained or even improved within weeks...|$|R
50|$|When {{finding the}} <b>insertion</b> point, the <b>depth</b> {{of the new}} node must also be recorded. This is {{implemented}} via a simple counter that gets incremented during each iteration of the lookup, effectively {{counting the number of}} edges between the root and the inserted node. If this node violates the α-height-balance property (defined above), a rebalance is required.|$|R
