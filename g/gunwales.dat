5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its <b>gunwales</b> below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the <b>gunwales</b> of each cutter.|$|E
25|$|The crane's {{innovation}} {{was in the}} use of {{a curved}} jib, made of riveted wrought iron platework to form a square-section box girder. This curved jib could reach further into the hold of a ship, clear of the deep <b>gunwales</b> alongside the quay.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>gunwale</b> side {{cut-outs}} normally {{seen on the}} Vosper, were built-up {{forward of}} the cabin, creating a flush forward deck. Normally, the Vosper required forward clearance {{in front of the}} Mk 7/8 tubes when torpedoes were fired over the <b>gunwale.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inboard of {{the sheer}} strake the heavier <b>gunwale</b> is {{similarly}} bent in along the line {{of the sheer}}. This part of the work is finished by fitting the breast hook and quarter knees. Swivel or crutch chocks are fitted as appropriate to the <b>gunwale,</b> the thwarts fitted down onto the rising and held in position by knees up to the <b>gunwale</b> and perhaps down onto the stringer. The structure of <b>gunwale,</b> rising, thwart and thwart knees greatly stiffens and strengthens the shell and turns it into a boat. There are several ways of fixing the rubbing strake but in a clinker boat, it is applied to the outside of the sheer strake.|$|R
50|$|Sørvágs Róðrarfelag is an {{association}} for Faroese rowing {{in the village}} of Sørvágur. SR was founded May 15, 1956. SR has two boats, they are called Dúgvan and Súlan. The boats are white, they have blue <b>gunwale</b> and a red stripe all around it below the blue <b>gunwale.</b>|$|R
25|$|Around November, Saint Lucia recaptured the brig Earl St. Vincent, {{which had}} been sailing from Dublin to Barbados, and a Swedish schooner. The French {{privateer}} Harmonie, of Martinique, had captured them three days earlier. Saint Lucia was unable to capture the privateer which escaped by throwing her guns overboard and sawing down her <b>gunwales.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to revive}} {{commerce}} raiding, the Imperial Navy equipped the impounded three-masted sailing ship Pass of Balmaha (1,571 tons) with two 105mm guns hidden behind hinged <b>gunwales,</b> several machine guns, and two carefully hidden 500 HP auxiliary engines. She was commissioned as the auxiliary cruiser Seeadler ("Sea Eagle"). As {{he was almost}} the only officer in the German Navy with extensive experience of large sailing ships, Luckner was appointed to command her.|$|E
25|$|Layman {{only had}} time to make changes to Ravens armament. He closed the two {{foremost}} ports and replaced their guns with a single 68-pounder carronade that he mounted on a traverse carriage (i.e., pivot-mounted) immediately before the foremast {{in a way that}} it could fire over the <b>gunwales.</b> Similarly, a second 68-pounder, also mounted on a traverse, replaced the two stern chasers. Should gunboats threaten a becalmed Raven, she could present a powerful response on any azimuth.|$|E

25|$|Surry was a square-rigged {{transport}} ship of 443 tons burthen. She had {{an overall}} length of 117ft. 6 ins., a breadth above the <b>gunwales</b> of 29ft. 6 ins, and a draught, when loaded, of 18ft. She was copper-sheathed, and had quarter galleries, with {{a bust of}} Minerva for a figurehead. When carrying prisoners and stores in 1816 she drew 16ft. 3 ins. forward and 17ft. 2 ins. aft, being down by the stern eleven inches. She carried a crew of thirty and was armed with fourteen cannons.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch and Moody {{oversaw the}} {{lowering}} of Boat 15 concurrently with Boat 13 and {{it reached the}} water only a minute later, at 1:41a.m. Fireman Frank Dymond {{was put in charge}} of what was the most heavily loaded boat at launching, with about 65 people aboard. It was so heavily loaded that the <b>gunwales</b> were reported to be far down in the water; one female passenger later said that when she leaned against the gunwale her hair trailed in the water. The boat {{was one of the last}} to be recovered by Carpathia, at about 7:30a.m.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the <b>gunwales</b> above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E

60|$|No {{word was}} spoken {{for at least}} a quarter of an hour, during which time, {{although}} they rose buoyantly on the water, the waves washed continually over the low-lying deck. As this deck was flush with the <b>gunwale,</b> or rather, had no <b>gunwale</b> at all, the water ran off it as it does off a whale's back.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{being in}} the majority, none of the loyalists put up a {{significant}} struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a 23-foot (7m) launch (so heavily loaded that the <b>gunwales</b> {{were only a few}} inches above the water). They were allowed four cutlasses, food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or marine chronometer. Most of these were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on Bounty for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.|$|E
25|$|Sōya {{was fully}} {{decommissioned}} in 1978. Her last mission was a farewell tour to communities she had served, including {{the port of}} Hakodate, and photographs exist from this period of well-wishers swarming the ship before her departure. In 1979 Sōya was moored alongside at the Museum of Maritime Science, Tokyo, and remains {{open to the public}} as a museum ship, open daily and generally closed only when typhoons threaten Tokyo. She remains in largely original condition. Her propellers have been removed and placed on deck but her interior is largely intact from Antarctic exploration days. However, as a result of modifications made in the 1950s her superstructure has changed considerably from her appearance during World War II. Gone are the tall funnel and aft crane assembly, while the addition of a helicopter landing deck and higher forward <b>gunwales</b> give her a beefier appearance than the cargo ship she started out as.|$|E
500|$|The {{battleship}} [...] {{had been}} {{designated as the}} aim point for Able and was painted red, with white gun barrels and <b>gunwales,</b> to make her stand out in the central cluster of target ships. There were eight ships within [...] of it. Had the bomb exploded over the Nevada [...] as planned, at least nine ships, including two battleships and an aircraft carrier, would likely have sunk. The actual detonation point, west-northwest of the target, was closer to the attack transport , in much less crowded water.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{of a solid}} surface runway {{began in}} late 1939 and in 1940 it was {{proposed}} to extend the existing runway to a length of 1,550yards (1,417m). The land reclamation commenced {{towards the end of}} 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the [...] "North Front", now RAF Gibraltar. The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities, loomed large in Admiralty thinking. So at 09:00 (UTC) on 9 September 1939, No. 202 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar, loaded to the <b>gunwales</b> with equipment.|$|E
500|$|Robinson volunteered in April for an {{even more}} {{dangerous}} mission, following the Turkish capture of [...] submarine HMS E15 which had stranded below the guns of Fort Dardanus near Kepez Point. All efforts to destroy this craft had so far failed and it was considered vital for naval morale {{that it was not}} salvaged by the enemy. Robinson took command of two picket boats from the battleships [...] and , each armed with two torpedoes mounted on the <b>gunwales</b> in dropping gear, and entered the Dardanelles under cover of darkness on 18 April. Caught in a blaze of searchlights, and under heavy fire from the Turkish artillery and machine guns, both boats miraculously arrived unscathed. A carelessly-directed Turkish searchlight briefly illuminated E15. The boat from HMS Majestic under the command of Lt Goodwin seized the opportunity and attacked. The first torpedo missed, and seconds later the boat was struck by a shell that blew away much of her stern, mortally wounding one of her crew and causing her irreparable damage. Undeterred, Goodwin went in again and scored a direct hit with his second torpedo, just forward of the conning tower, wrecking the submarine.|$|E
500|$|At 17:40, West Bridges engine {{broke down}} {{once again and}} her crew was unable to repair it. West Bridge, falling {{off the back of}} the convoy and adrift, {{signaled}} Marseillaise to request a tow. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, Montanan—still in the convoy, which was by now some [...] ahead of West Bridge—was hit by one of three torpedoes launched by German submarine [...] Montanan began to settle and was quickly abandoned. On West Bridge, Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks. Noma sailed back to West Bridge, ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights, and stood by. At nearly the same time, [...] approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship, scoring hits with both. The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold {{in the front of the}} ship, while the second hit amidships near the engine room. West Bridge immediately began listing to starboard, and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. He and two crewmen remained behind until they felt sure that everyone else had departed. By the time they left the stricken ship, water was up to the <b>gunwales</b> and lapping at the well deck.|$|E

500|$|Murray cod have {{soft skin}} and very fine scales that leave them {{vulnerable}} to infection from exotic disease organisms. The following exotic disease organisms all seriously affect wild Murray cod; {{all have been}} introduced by imports of exotic fish. Chilodenella is a single-celled, parasitic protozoa that infects the skin of Murray cod and has caused a number of serious kills of wild Murray cod. Saprolegnia is a fungus-like oomycete or [...] "water mould" [...] that frequently infects Murray cod eggs and the skin of Murray cod that have been roughly handled through poor catch and release technique. (It is essential that Murray cod intended for release only touch cool wet surfaces and are not put down on any hard, dry, rough or hot surfaces, e.g. boat <b>gunwales,</b> boat floors, dry grass, dry rocks, gravel banks, dry towels or mats, etc. Hands should also be wetted before touching them. They must not be hung vertically by the mouth or gill covers.) Wild Murray cod populations across their range suffer extremely severe infestations of Lernaea or [...] "anchor worm", a parasitic copepod vectored by introduced carp and that burrows into the skin of Murray cod. Lernaea puncture wounds are often secondarily infected by bacteria. Severe Lernaea infestations probably causes the death of many more adult Murray cod than commonly recognised. Ebner reports a young adult Murray cod seemingly killed by severe Lernaea infestation.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard and the Church of Scientology {{presented}} {{a number of}} different accounts of his time in the western Pacific. In 1963, Hubbard told Australian journalists that he had been [...] "the only anti-aircraft battery in Australia in 1941–42... There was me and a Thompson submachine gun... I was a mail officer and I was replaced, I think, by a Captain, a couple of commanders and about 15 junior officers." [...] Hubbard stated on another occasion that he had been [...] "one of the first officers back from the upper battle areas" [...] and that he had [...] "sent on my own authority, four cargo ships loaded to the <b>gunwales</b> with machine gun ammunition, rifle ammunition and quinine up to MacArthur." [...] When [...] "Melbourne found out ... there were enough troops in the area so the danger was over, so I went home. I wrote myself some orders and reported back to the US." [...] According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was landed on the island of Java [...] "in the closing days of February 1942" [...] to search for [...] "stockpiled weapons and fast, shallow-draft vessels." [...] He was cut off by invading Japanese [...] "and was only able to escape the island after scrambling into a rubber raft and paddling out to meet an Australian destroyer." [...] Another Church of Scientology account describes Hubbard as [...] "Senior Officer Present Ashore in Brisbane, Australia" [...] and asserts that [...] "his duties included counter-intelligence and the organization of relief for beleaguered American forces on Bataan. It was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on the island of Java, and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft. In a 1956 lecture to Scientologists, Hubbard said: ...|$|E
