50|$|In the experiment, a film {{canister}} {{is filled}} with water, an <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablet</b> (commonly Alka-Seltzer) is added and the canister tightly sealed.

50|$|In rocketry, a {{chemical}} reaction rapidly creates gas that is expelled {{in one direction}} from its container (the rocket engine); momentum forces the rocket in the opposite direction. The alka-seltzer rocket experiment demonstrates Newton's third law. The film canister rocket has a buildup of gas that wants {{to come out of}} the weakest spot making all the gas come out at once through the hole at the bottom. The gas comes out from the underside and pushes the rocket up. After it gets pushed up, air resistance slows it down and gravity pulls it down to earth. The film canister accelerates quickly because it has very little mass.The film canister rocket uses a solid fuel mixed with a liquid fuel to create a gas that escapes out of the bottom. The gas is carbon dioxide (CO2), the liquid is water (H2O), and the solid is an <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablet.</b> When the H2O is mixed with an <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablet,</b> it produces the gas CO2. The reaction time depends on the surface area of the tablet.|$|E

The first {{objective of}} the study was to compare and evaluate the taste-masking effect of different ratios of 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and mannitol on levocetirizine HCl using an inclusion complex and solid dispersion, respectively. The second objective was to study the possibility of preparing and evaluating <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablets</b> from the best-chosen taste-masked blends for the purpose of their use either as orodispersible tablets or as water-soluble <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablets,</b> according to patients’ will. Materials and methods: Prepared taste-masked blends were prepared and subjected to palatability, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry studies. Tablets containing different percentages of effervescent mixtures were prepared by direct compression on the selected taste-modified blends. Evaluation tests were conducted, including flowability and compressibility on the precompressed blends and hardness, friability, wetting time, effervescent time, in vitro, in vivo disintegration time, and in vitro dissolution study on the compressed tablets. Formulated tablets were evaluated and compared to marketed orodispersible tablets for mouth feel and palatability. Results: All prepared tablets showed convenient physical and palatability properties compared to the selected brand. The in vitro drug-release study revealed fast release of levocetirizine HCl within 5 minutes from all prepared tablets. Conclusion: Levocetirizine HCl <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablets</b> are likely to increase patient compliance with drug administration. Moreover, the use of these <b>effervescent</b> <b>tablets</b> in an orodispersible dosage form can improve oral drug bioavailability and act as an attractive pediatric dosage form.

At high relative humidity (85. 5 %) of storage, the reaction occurred prior to the dissolution due to moisture intake...|$|E
