500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There!' said Knight, 'where {{is there}} in England a {{spectacle}} to equal that? <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and watch them every night before I go home. Softly open the sash.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that all? Then, dearest, dearest, why we'll {{be engaged}} at once, {{to be sure}} we will, and down <b>I</b> <b>sit!</b> <b>There</b> it is, as easy as a glove!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{the judge}} answered, almost testily, shaking his sleeve with impatience. [...] "I'll have no putting off for trifles {{in the court}} where <b>I</b> <b>sit.</b> <b>There's</b> a capital case to come on this morning. When a man's neck's at stake--when {{a matter of life}} and death's at issue--I don't like to keep any one longer in {{suspense}} than I absolutely need. Delay would be cruel." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band's second album, called Ik wil meer (I Want More), {{contains}} the singles [...] "Nederland" [...] ("The Netherlands"), [...] "Zij zit daar en ik zit hier" [...] ("She <b>Is</b> <b>Sitting</b> <b>There</b> and <b>I</b> Am <b>Sitting</b> Here"), and [...] "Lachen en mooi zijn" [...] ("Smiling and Being Pretty"). Meanwhile, Vander linden {{developed a reputation}} as writer. Thanks to his success in the Studio Brussel radio programme Collage, he has frequently been asked to be a columnist and spoken-word performer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! there's {{not much}} to be told about the Firm, Uncle,' said the boy, plying his knife and fork.' It's a {{precious}} dark set of offices, and {{in the room where}} <b>I</b> <b>sit,</b> <b>there's</b> a high fender, and an iron safe, and some cards about ships that are going to sail, and an almanack, and some desks and stools, and an inkbottle, and some books, and some boxes, and a lot of cobwebs, and in one of 'em, just over my head, a shrivelled-up blue-bottle that looks as if it had hung there ever so long.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so this {{inhabitant}} of {{the second}} {{city in the world}} reposes himself and begins to snore, while <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> musing over things and wishing I was back in the West, where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hate you!" [...] cries I, {{and held}} her firm. [...] "You blind lass, can you not see a little in my wretched heart? Do you think when <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> reading in that fool-book that I have just burned, and be damned to it, I take ever the least thought of any {{stricken}} thing but just yourself? Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone. And what was I to do? You are here under my honour; would you punish me for that? Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?" ...|$|E
60|$|Our cook has {{specially}} interested me--a tall, slender, melancholy man, with a watery-blue eye, a patient, dejected visage, like {{an individual}} {{weary of the}} storms and commotions of life, and thoroughly impressed with the vanity of human wishes. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> hour after hour watching him, and {{it is evident that}} he performs all his duties in this frame of sad composure. Now I see him resignedly stuffing a turkey, anon compounding a sauce, or mournfully making little ripples in the crust of a tart; but all is done under an evident sense that it is of no use trying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where it {{was pointed}} out to me that <b>I</b> should <b>sit,</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> sat, though, for aught I care, the king Ithobal may take my place. The {{grandson}} of Pharaoh and of Solomon does not need to dispute for precedence with the savage ruler of savage tribes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{talked to}} the boss--to Zangiacomo, I mean. <b>I</b> had to <b>sit</b> <b>there.</b> That devil-woman {{sometimes}} wouldn't let me go away. I mean Mrs. Zangiacomo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wrong, mother! {{how could}} I help it? Was <b>I</b> going to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and hear him talk of Frank's {{presumption}} {{as if he}} were a chimney-sweep?" ...|$|R
60|$|So, still sauntering on, to {{the spring}} under the willows--musical as soft clinking glasses-pouring a {{sizeable}} stream, thick as my neck, pure and clear, out from its vent where the bank arches over like a great brown shaggy eyebrow or mouth-roof--gurgling, gurgling ceaselessly--meaning, saying something, of course (if one could only translate it)--always gurgling there, the whole year through--never giving out--oceans of mint, blackberries in summer--choice of light and shade--just the place for my July sun-baths and water-baths too--but mainly the inimitable soft sound-gurgles of it, as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> hot afternoons. How they and all grow into me, day after day--everything in keeping--the wild, just-palpable perfume, and the dappled leaf-shadows, and all the natural-medicinal, elemental-moral influences of the spot.|$|E
60|$|I see myself, a dark, ill-dressed youth, {{with the}} bruise Lord Redcar gave me still {{blue and yellow}} beneath my jaw; and young Verrall sits cornerwise to me, better grown, better dressed, fair and quiet, two years my senior indeed, but looking no older than I because of his light complexion; and {{opposite}} me is Nettie, with dark eyes upon my face, graver and more beautiful than I had ever seen her in the former time. Her dress is still that white one she had worn when I came upon her in the park, and still about her dainty neck she wears her string of pearls and that little coin of gold. She is so much the same, she is so changed; a girl then and now a woman--and all my agony and all the marvel of the Change between! Over {{the end of the}} green table about which we sit, a spotless cloth is spread, it bears a pleasant lunch spread out with a simple equipage. Behind me is the liberal sunshine of the green and various garden. I see it all. Again <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> eating awkwardly, this paper lies upon the table and Verrall talks of the Change.|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet I {{know that}} it must come," [...] says poor Clive, telling me the story as he hangs on my arm, and we pace through the Park. [...] "The Colonel and I are walking on a mine, and that poor little wife of mine is perpetually flinging little shells to fire it. I {{sometimes}} wish it were blown up, and I were done for, Pen. I don't think my widow would break her heart about me. No; I {{have no right to}} say that; it's a shame to say that; she tries her very best to please me, poor little dear. It's the fault of my temper, perhaps, that she can't. But they neither understand me, don't you see? the Colonel can't help thinking I am a degraded being, because I am fond of painting. Still, dear old boy, he patronises Ridley; a man of genius, whom those sentries ought to salute, by Jove, sir, when he passes. Ridley patronised by an old officer of Indian dragoons, {{a little bit of a}} Rosey, and a fellow who is not fit to lay his palette for him! I want sometimes to ask J. J.'s pardon, after the Colonel has been talking to him in his confounded condescending way, uttering some awful bosh about the fine arts. Rosey follows him, and trips round J. J.'s studio, and pretends to admire, and says, 'How soft; how sweet!' recalling some of mamma-in-law's dreadful expressions, which make me shudder when I hear them. If my poor old father had a confidant into whose arm he could hook his own, and whom he could pester with his family griefs as I do you, the dear old boy would have his dreary story to tell too. I hate banks, bankers, Bundelcund, indigo, cotton, and the whole business. I go to that confounded board, and never hear one syllable that the fellows are talking about. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> because he wishes me to sit there; don't you think he sees that my heart is out of the business; that I would rather be at home in my painting-room? We don't understand each other, but we feel each other, as it were by instinct. Each thinks in his own way, but knows what the other is thinking. We fight mute battles, don't you see, and, our thoughts, though we don't express them, are perceptible to one another, and come out from our eyes, or pass out from us somehow, and meet, and fight, and strike, and wound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Felix, {{how cold}} you are! Your face is like marble. Now if <b>I</b> was to <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> in this weather, wouldn't they be {{at me like}} wild cats?' ...|$|R
60|$|As for me, <b>I</b> {{continued}} to <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> very wet and weary, {{and a good}} deal anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my success.|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I to say? I don't {{want to give}} offence, and I am heartily {{sorry that}} you and your {{daughter}} should be under any misapprehension. But as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> here <b>there</b> was no engagement between us;--nor, if I must speak out, Lady Augustus, could your daughter have thought that there was an engagement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Objection? I've {{spent my}} life in caf√©s! They're warm in winter and you get your lamplight for nothing," [...] she explained. [...] "Mamma and I have sat in them for hours, many a time, with a consommation of three sous, to save fire and candles at home. We've lived in places we couldn't sit in, {{if you want to}} know--where there was only really room if we were in bed. Mamma's money's sent out from England and {{sometimes}} it usedn't to come. Once it didn't come for months--for months and months. I don't know how we lived. There wasn't any to come; there wasn't any to get home. That isn't amusing when you're away in a foreign town without any friends. Mamma used to borrow, but people wouldn't always lend. You needn't be afraid--she won't borrow of you. We're rather better now--something has been done in England; I don't understand what. It's only fivepence a year, but it has been settled; it comes regularly; it used to come only when we had written and begged and waited. But it made no difference--mamma was always up to her ears in books. They served her for food and drink. When she had nothing to eat she began a novel in ten volumes--the old-fashioned ones; they lasted longest. She knows every cabinet de lecture in every town; the little, cheap, shabby ones, I mean, in the back streets, where they have odd volumes and only ask a sou and the books are so old that they smell like close rooms. She takes them to the caf√©s--the little, cheap, shabby caf√©s too--and she reads there all the evening. That's very well for her, but it doesn't feed me. I don't like a diet of dirty old novels. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> beside her with nothing to do, not even a stocking to mend; she doesn't think that comme il faut. I don't know what the people take me for. However, we've never been spoken to: any one can see mamma's a great lady. As for me I daresay I might be anything dreadful. If you're going to be an actress you must get used to being looked at. There were people in England who used to ask us to stay; some of them were our cousins--or mamma says they were. I've never been very clear about our cousins and I don't think they were at all clear about us. Some of them are dead; the others don't ask us any more. You should hear mamma on the subject of our visits in England. It's very convenient when your cousins are dead--that explains everything. Mamma has delightful phrases: 'My family is almost extinct.' Then your family may have been anything you like. Ours of course was magnificent. We did stay in a place once where there was a deer-park, and also private theatricals. I played in them; I was only fifteen years old, but I was very big and I thought I was in heaven. I'll go anywhere you like; you needn't be afraid; we've been in places! I've learned a great deal that way--sitting beside mamma and watching people, their faces, their types, their movements. There's a great deal goes on in caf√©s: people come to them to talk things over, their private affairs, their complications; they have important meetings. Oh I've observed scenes between men and women--very quiet, terribly quiet, but awful, pathetic, tragic! Once I saw a woman do something that I'm going to do some day when I'm great--if I can get the situation. I'll {{tell you what it is}} sometime--I'll do it for you. Oh it is the book of life!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Good Lord (Run Old Jeremiah)" [...] by Austin Coleman with Joe Washington Brown, from 1934, was {{a frenzied}} and raucous ring shout {{recorded}} by John and Alan Lomax {{in a church}} in Jennings, Louisiana, with the singer declaiming [...] "Im going to rock, you gonna rock ... <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and rock, <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and rock, yeah yeah yeah." [...] Music historian Robert Palmer wrote that [...] "the rhythmic singing, the hard-driving beat, the bluesy melody, and the improvised, stream-of-consciousness words ... all anticipate key aspects of rock n roll as it would emerge some 20 years later." ...|$|E
5000|$|Conroy {{lived in}} Beaufort with wife Cassandra until his death. In 2007, he commented {{that she was}} a much happier writer than he was: [...] "I'll hear her cackle with {{laughter}} at some funny line she's written. I've never cackled with laughter at a single line I've ever written. None of it has given me pleasure. She writes with pleasure and joy, and <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> in gloom and darkness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I am," [...] Jeanne answered. [...] "I {{suppose you}} three will play cards, {{and it does}} not {{interest}} me to watch you. There is nothing which interests me here at all except the gardens and the sea. I am going down to the beach, and then <b>I</b> shall <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> behind the hollyhocks until it is bedtime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least--leave it open: {{it shall}} be as you may feel, and you needn't even send me word. I only will mention that to-day, of all days, <b>I</b> shall {{otherwise}} <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> {{playing the}} black men, all {{sweating}} for fear somebody I knew {{would find it}} out. And I thinks to myself some about this marrying business, and how {{it seems to be}} the same kind of a game as that Mrs. Delilah played. She give her old man a hair cut, and everybody knows what a man's head looks like after a woman cuts his hair. And then when the Pharisees came around to guy him he was so 'shamed that he went to work and kicked the whole house down on top of the whole outfit. 'Them married men,' thinks I, 'lose all their spirit and instinct for riot and foolishness. They won't drink, they won't buck the tiger, they won't even fight. What do they want to go and stay married for?' I asks myself.|$|R
5000|$|In a January 2007 interview, Goldman {{admitted}} that he is having difficulty coming up with ideas for the story: [...] MPM: I hear you're working on a sequel to The Princess Bride called Buttercup's Baby.William Goldman: I desperately want to write it, and <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and nothing happens and I get pissed at myself. I got lucky with The Princess Bride the first time, and I'd love to get lucky again.|$|E
5000|$|That {{afternoon}} Felicity {{finds the}} Baron in her garden, when she accuses him of having [...] "no respect for our privacy". [...] "There's {{a corner of}} my vineyard," [...] he replies, [...] "which has a wall that was once part of an abbey. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> late at night, always alone." [...] The arrival of Senator Dorr breaks the mood and the Baron confronts him with his suspicions about Eugene La Salle's true identity, obtained by Captain Muller from Ada, Wilf Jonas' mother. Again the Baron has the last word, indirectly implicating Phillip in an espionage plot.|$|E
5000|$|John Lee Hooker {{recorded}} the song as [...] "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" [...] in 1966. Hooker transformed Milburn's song [...] "into {{a vehicle for}} himself". He used the storyline and chorus (but altered the order), but [...] "edited the verse down to its essentials, filled in the gaps with narrative and dialogue, and set the whole thing to a rocking cross between South Side shuffle and signature boogie". [...] Part of Hooker's narrative included: And then <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> drinkin', gettin' high, mellow, knocked out, feelin' goodAbout that time I looked on the wall, at the old clock on the wallAbout {{that time it was}} ten-thirty then, I looked down the bar at the bartender, he said'What do you want, Johnny?', one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be right," [...] Maraton admitted. [...] "At {{the same}} time, {{one thing is}} very clear. You did not offer me the {{slightest}} official support. It is true that I {{did not ask for}} it. I prefer, as I have told you all along, my independence. It will be my object to continue without direct association with any party. If I can find a place in the house allotted to Independent Members, <b>I</b> shall <b>sit</b> <b>there.</b> If not, <b>I</b> shall <b>sit</b> with the Unionists." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that is too}} much!" [...] O'Sullivan said. [...] "That ledge is {{so narrow}} that <b>I</b> could hardly <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> even holding on by the bars; and as to {{stopping}} there half an hour, I would almost as soon be on the rack." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Low was not {{quick to}} answer, {{but he did}} answer at last. [...] "That is true, though I have never told you so. Indeed, it is hardly true to say that I hope it. I have my dreams, and {{sometimes}} dare to tell myself that they may possibly become waking facts. But if ever <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> on a Treasury bench <b>I</b> shall <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> by special invitation, having been summoned to take a high place because of my professional success. It is but a dream after all, and I would not have you repeat what I have said to any one. I had no intention to talk about myself." ...|$|R

5000|$|At this point, the {{exercise}} was suspended, Blue's ships were [...] "re-floated", {{and the rules}} of engagement were changed; this was later justified by General Peter Pace as follows: [...] "You kill me in the first day and <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> for the next 13 days doing nothing, or you put me back to life and you get 13 more days' worth of experiment out of me. Which is a better way to do it?" [...] After the reset, both sides were ordered to follow predetermined plans of action. After the war game was restarted, its participants were forced to follow a script drafted to ensure a Blue Force victory. Among other rules imposed by this script, Red Force was ordered to turn on their anti-aircraft radar {{in order for them to}} be destroyed, and was not allowed to shoot down any of the aircraft bringing Blue Force troops ashore. Van Riper also claimed that exercise officials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against Blue Force, and that they also ordered Red Force not to use certain weapons systems against Blue Force and even ordered the location of Red Force units to be revealed.|$|E
5000|$|Describing {{his career}} Miller stated [...] "It's all {{been built on}} arcane references, {{precision}} of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but I've been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years {{and you know that}} blows my mind that I've stuck with it. That's my favorite part of showbiz, hangin' in knowing that something good is coming along. ...When I was starting, I thought I'd have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where I'd have to lay around for it to be visited on me. SNL was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three 'Updates' up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. [...] "I don't ever wanna get self-important. I'm a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid." ...|$|E
5000|$|For me that's {{the closest}} that I've {{got to a}} little bit of film. And it was very {{pleasing}} for me to watch the ideas I'd thought of actually working beautifully. Watching it on the screen. It really was a treat, that one. I think that's the first time ever with anything I've done <b>I</b> can actually <b>sit</b> back and say [...] "I liked that". That's the only thing. Everything else <b>I</b> can <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> going [...] "Oh look at that, that's out of place". So I'm very pleased with that one, artistically.|$|R
500|$|... "There's a {{delay in}} the screen above me, so {{if you listen to}} the music and watch the screen, they don't sync up. I think that confuses people. But I'm singing every song. I'm singing my ass off. [...] There are times during the show, when I'm dancing so much, where I get out of breath, and we have a signal where I'm dying and they'll help me out. Believe me, I'd give {{anything}} to do a show where <b>I</b> just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and sing".|$|R
2500|$|... "Any good album title has {{multiple}} meanings, and I like choosing titles where I find myself repeating it, {{almost like a}} mantra.
