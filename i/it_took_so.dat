5|$|The {{ship was}} built by the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard. Her keel was laid down on 30 January 1899, and the {{completed}} hull was launched on 7 November 1901 {{in the presence of}} the King and Queen of Italy, government officials, and the whole Italian Mediterranean squadron. Fitting out work lasted for the next four years, and she was completed on 1 September 1905. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long primarily because of non-delivery of material, particularly the heavy armor. After she entered active service, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. The Squadron was usually only activated for seven months of the year in peacetime, which was occupied with training maneuvers, and the rest of the year the ships were placed in reserve. In 1907, the Mediterranean Squadron consisted of Benedetto Brin, her sister , and three of the s. The ships participated in the annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti. Benedetto Brin remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time the fourth Regina Elena-class ship was completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six.|$|E

25|$|The first {{cases of}} 1p36 {{deletion}} syndrome were {{described in the}} 1980s. However, since many of these individuals also had other chromosomal imbalances, symptoms varied widely. The reason <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long to recognize the condition as a distinct chromosome deletion syndrome is that the deletions causing the disorder {{are too small to}} be detected in a routine chromosomal analysis. FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) and DNA-based technology known as MLPA (multiple ligation probe amplification) used in testing have aided in diagnosing an increasing number of cases since the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|All eight capital {{ships of}} the 1909–1910 Naval Programme {{had the same}} {{arrangement}} of masts and funnels; only the two battlecruisers had their foremast and forward funnel positions exchanged at considerable expense. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is amazing that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which {{was caused by the}} DNO's insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements.

After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".|$|E
500|$|One of the {{few things}} {{retained}} from earlier ships was the position of the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K.

500|$|Another stunt {{scene was}} filmed for Episode 6; the charity ball scene was filmed {{over two days}} at a Masonic Lodge and {{concluded}} with a fight between Jenny and Natalie (played by Lorelei King). The shots of Jenny spraying Natalie with a fire extinguisher were limited to two takes because <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long to re-apply King's make up. The table that Ripley and King's stunt doubles fall through had its legs weakened, and the glasses on the table were replaced with sugar glass. The Brief Encounter fantasy was filmed at a steam railway near Rochdale. Nigel Cole used the scene {{as an opportunity to}} make his mark as a television director. Most of the scene was filmed by Cole and the main crew. Establishing shots were filmed by Langan and the second unit, due to time constraints.

[...] Rhimes also explains why <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long to produce this episode: [...] The script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed {{regardless of whether it}} involved musical performances. Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of [...] "The Story" [...] is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. The episode served to improve the relationship between Mark and Arizona.

500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long. When I got back, it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E

500|$|Several {{references}} to popular culture, including a meta-reference to The Simpsons, {{are included in}} [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution". The three The Itchy & Scratchy cartoons that are shown {{at the beginning of}} the episode as Krusty is hosting his show are all parodies of films released in 2010: the first one, titled The Cat's Speech, is a parody of The King's Speech; the second one, titled The Social Petwork, parodies The Social Network in that the storyline is partially explained through the use of screens containing nothing but text; and the final one, titled Black and Blue Swan, references Black Swan. [...] After the three cartoons are shown, Krusty points out that [...] "It’s like those parodies were written when the movies came out, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> long to animate them that we look dated and hacky!" [...] This is a reference to the long time it takes to produce an episode of The Simpsons—hence why cultural references on the show can often be seen as dated. Pop culture allusions at the television museum include a brief appearance by the main characters of the animated series King of the Hill as cardboard cutouts being taken down in a process similar to the opening of the show, an exhibit devoted to the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, and the showing of one of Homer's favorite television shows, Fatso Flanagan, which is a knockoff of the sitcom The Honeymooners.|$|E
2500|$|A common claim {{among those}} arguing that President Obama {{was not born}} in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama {{released}} his [...] "long form" [...] birth certificate.

Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory.
