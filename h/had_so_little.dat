5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

25|$|Injury on {{a winter}} tour of India ended Gover's run of success: in 1938, apart from a week in late May and early June when he {{achieved}} his best figures of 14 for 85 against Worcestershire, Gover was clearly unfit (despite periods of rest) and <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> venom his haul of wickets fell from 201 to just 86. Though he recovered somewhat in 1939 with increased fitness, it was already evident Gover would struggle to regain the speed and venom of his two great years. However, when county cricket resumed after World War II in 1946 Gover, at 38, bowled so well under unfavourable conditions that {{he played in the}} Third Test against India. With his strong physique it was surprising he was not chosen for either the 1936/1937 or 1946/1947 Ashes tours. He decided 1947 would be his last year in county cricket, but Gover was still regarded as the best fast bowler in England, and there were calls for him to be selected for the last Test when Harold Butler withdrew and Alec Bedser was out of form.|$|E

500|$|Hull and {{two other}} pilots, South African Pilot Officer Jack Falkson and Naval Lieutenant Tony Lydekker, volunteered to be {{detached}} to an improvised airstrip at Bodø, a port about [...] south-west of Narvik, on 26 May 1940 to cover Allied troops who were retreating north for evacuation under Operation Alphabet. Arriving to find the airfield extremely muddy, the pilots had great difficulty moving their aircraft to drier ground to refuel from four-gallon (18-l) tin cans. A He111 was spotted overhead while this was in progress, prompting the three pilots to scramble having only partially refuelled. Falkson's plane crashed after mud clung to its wheels, and while Lydekker took off successfully, he <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> fuel that Hull almost immediately ordered him to land to add more.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{graphic design}} and images, a common feature of grunge bands {{was the use}} of [...] "lo-fi" [...] (low fidelity) and {{deliberately}} unconventional album covers, for example presenting intentionally murky or miscolored photography, collage or distressed lettering. Early grunge [...] "lbum covers and concert flyers appeared Xeroxed not in allegiance to some DIY aesthetic" [...] but because of [...] "economic necessity", as [...] "bands <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> money". This was already a common feature of punk rock design, but could be extended in the grunge period due to the increasing use of Macintosh computers for desktop publishing and digital image processing. The style was sometimes called 'grunge typography' when used outside music. A famous example of 'grunge'-style experimental design was Ray Gun magazine, art directed by David Carson.|$|E
500|$|The English {{translation}} for Secret of Mana {{was completed}} in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American localization was initially advertised as Final Fantasy Adventure 2. Critics {{have suggested that the}} translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator Ted Woolsey, {{a large portion of the}} game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> time for translation, commenting that it [...] "nearly killed me". The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like [...] "shuffling a novel". Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{was still}} serving as Air Member for Supply when Australia {{declared}} war in September 1939. On 9January 1940 {{he was appointed}} acting Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), following {{the resignation of the}} incumbent, Air Vice-Marshal Goble. Anderson remained in the position until 10February, when Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, seconded from the Royal Air Force, arrived to take over. The Australian government at this stage <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> faith in the leadership of its Air Force that it had briefly considered offering temporary command of the service to a Royal Australian Navy officer, Second Naval Member Commodore Maitland Boucher, before deciding against such a [...] "monumental slight to the senior ranks of the RAAF" [...] and settling on Anderson. After relinquishing his temporary position as CAS, Anderson briefly reverted to his previous role as Air Member for Supply before taking over as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in March 1940; he was succeeded in November by Air Vice-Marshal Henry Wrigley. The next month, Anderson took over from Air Commodore Cole as Air Officer Commanding Central Area, with responsibility for air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance for most of New South Wales; he remained at this post until it was disbanded in August the following year.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

2500|$|The East Room, {{along with}} the rest of the White House, was burned in 1814 during the Burning of Washington in the War of 1812. The {{interior}} was gutted, and most of the exterior sandstone walls remained standing. The north facade of the White House was the most damaged. But because the East Room <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>little</b> furniture in it, the section of the north facade fronting the East Room was the least damaged. Latrobe helped to reconstruct the White House. [...] In 1814 and 1815, the rebuilt East Room received new door frames and inlaid mahogany doors that remain in the room today. New plaster work in the form of a gilded cornice-line frieze of anthemion (a flowerlike, traditional Greek decorative pattern) was installed, and the walls plastered (and left unpainted) as well.|$|E

He threw himself into another round of concert tours. Several of his 1910 recordings for Columbia in London are available on a CD on the Temple label. These include traditional tunes as well as his own works, presenting a unique window into early twentieth century fiddle playing and probably back to the 1850s.|$|E

2500|$|Others, such as Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel, {{felt the}} verdict was fair because the {{prosecution}} {{did not have enough}} evidence to establish guilt or meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
