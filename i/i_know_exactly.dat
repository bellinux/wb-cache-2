25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

In his victory speech, Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together. Nixon said: [...] "I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President, congratulating me for winning the election.

500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and her then-boyfriend Stephen Bray. The singer had initially written the song for her friend Mark Kamins' protégée, Chyne, and recorded a demo which Kamins intended to modify later. However, Madonna {{believed that the}} song would be more suitable for her film Desperately Seeking Susan, and recorded it with Bray for the film's soundtrack. When Kamins {{found out he was}} furious that Madonna did not inform him that she would use the song for the film. The singer retorted: [...] "I'm tough, I'm ambitious and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what I want. If that makes me a bitch, that's okay." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ultimately did not appear on the soundtrack album of the film, but was released on the 1985 worldwide re-issue of Madonna's second studio album, Like a Virgin. During an interview with Time, Madonna said that she wrote the song while watching a Latin boy across her balcony. Describing the song as [...] "dorky", Madonna further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|Bree then invites Reverend Sykes to dinner, {{who tries}} to {{convince}} Andrew to enroll in Christian counselling. He refuses, saying [...] "I'm not confused. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> who I am." [...] This deeply upsets Bree, who tells him he has to change or {{he will not be}} with her in heaven; Andrew is shocked and agrees to meet the reverend. In his final scene of the season, after swearing the reverend to secrecy, Andrew states that, not only that he does not believe in God and lied to his parents about being gay {{to get out of the}} camp. This confuses the reverend, who asks him whether he is heterosexual or not: Andrew replies, [...] "Look, I love vanilla ice cream, okay? But every now and then I’m probably gonna be in the mood for chocolate." [...] He then says he will get revenge on Bree for rejecting him by pretending to be a model son and then doing something so awful it is [...] "going to really destroy her".|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} of Tykwer's films since 1997's Winter Sleepers, the musical score for Perfume was {{composed}} by Tykwer {{and two of his}} friends Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil. The score was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic and State choir Latvija under the direction of conductor Simon Rattle. Tykwer began composing the score with Klimek and Heil the very day he started working on the screenplay. Tykwer said, [...] "I feel like I understand very much about the structure and the motivations of the characters when I'm writing the script, but I really do understand the atmosphere and the emotional and the more abstract part of the film when I'm investigating the music, and when I'm planning the music for it. ... When I then come to the shooting, having worked for three years on the music and three years on the script, I really feel like <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> the two worlds and how to combine them." [...] By the time it came to shooting the film, a substantial portion of music had been composed. Tykwer hired a small orchestra and recorded them performing the score. Tykwer played the recorded music on set so people could explore the atmosphere and the acoustic world of the film while they were acting in it. The music was also used instead of temp music during editing.|$|E
2500|$|Lopez {{was drawn}} to the [...] "contagious" [...] melodies of Michael Jackson's album Off the Wall (1979), which led her to summon the record's mixer and engineer, Bruce Swedien, to work on This Is Me... Then. Lopez felt that Jackson's [...] "clear and spacious" [...] records made her feel a [...] "certain way". She said, [...] "It has such a {{beautiful}} quality on it, and every time I looked at a record , it would be engineered and mixed by Bruce Swedien. I was like, 'Who is this guy? I want this guy.' So I tracked him down and he was like, 'I want to do something with her. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what she needs. I'm coming in.' And it made a huge difference." [...] Lopez worked closely with longtime producer Cory Rooney on the album. Discussing the process, Rooney stated, [...] "This is by far the best record that I've ever worked on or done [...] In the beginning of the recording [...] she said it's important that she makes a record that is a few notches above everything else she did. She wanted to show growth musically and vocally." [...] Other producers Lopez worked with primarily were Troy Oliver, Loren Hill and Dan Shea. She had previously collaborated with Oliver and Shea on J.Lo (2001).|$|E
