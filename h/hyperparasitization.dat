40|$|Hyperparasitism by virgin female Encarsia tricolor was {{studied by}} direct {{observation}} of its behaviour when contacting two secondary host species (Encarsia formosa and E. tricolor) at different host stages (first and second larval stage, third larval stage, and pupal stage). The searching and hyperparasitism behavioural sequence of E. tricolor was {{independent of the}} host stage of the whitefly (Aleyrodes proletella), and was similar to several related primary parasitoid species. In experiments with equal numbers of secondary hosts, encounter frequencies were equal for both secondary host species in all developmental stages observed. However, rates of hyperparastism were different according to host stage and host species. Hosts in the late larval stages were most preferred for <b>hyperparasitization</b> and the heterospecific E. formosa was more preferred as a secondary host than the conspecific, E. tricolor, in particular from the prepupal stage onwards. The window of vulnerability, i. e., {{the duration of the}} period in which a secondary host is susceptible to hyperparasitism, was largely determined by the occurrence and rate of melanization after the onset of pupation. The duration of a successful <b>hyperparasitization</b> event was longer than one that failed. Superparasitism occurred only once in all cases. The potential effect of autoparasitoids on biological control programs and the consequences for selection and release of an effective, yet ecologically safe agent are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Seven accessions of Leucaena Benth, {{supported}} {{significantly different}} population densities of Heteropsylla cubana Crawford. The highest populations {{occurred on the}} I [...] Ieucocephala (Lamb.) De Wit accessions K 8, K 527, and K 784, the I [...] diversifolia (Schlecht.) Benth, accession K 156, and the L. leucocephala X I [...] diversifolia accession K 743. The lowest psyllid densities occurred on the L. pallida Britton and Rose accession K 376. Accessions K 8, K 527, and K 636 were the most severely damaged. Accessions K 743 and K 156 were often slightly damaged and only occasionally moderately damaged. Only slight damage was observed on accessions K 784 and K 376. Parasitism of H. cubana by Psyllaephagus yaseeni Noyes was low (1. 9 %), probably due to <b>hyperparasitization</b> levels averaging 39. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|During {{the years}} 1988 - 1992 an {{outbreak}} of the pale tussock moth, Calliteara pudibunda (L.), took place in northwest Italy (Pied-mont and Liguria) in different sites of beech and mixed broadleaf woods in the western Alps, from 700 to 1, 300 m of height. This outstanding outbreak (the first recorded below the 48 th parallel) was monitored during 1990 - 1993, checking pupal densities and rearing parasitoids. In pupae, ichneumonids reached a maximum parasitization rate of 34 % and tachinids accounted for up to 19 %, whereas in larvae a rather low parasitization rate was equally divided between Diptera (Tachinidae) and Hymenoptera (Ich-neumonidae, Braconidae, Eulophidae). Two cases of <b>hyperparasitization</b> were found of the ichneumonid Goedartia alboguttata (Gravenhorst) by Euceros kiushuensis Uchida in the beechwood of Calizzano in Liguria. Very few cases of oophagous parasitiza-tion by Trichogramma spp. could be detected. Insect, bird and mammal predators were rather ineffective {{on the number of}} larvae, pupae and adults of the pale tussock moth. Viral, microbial and fungal agents of larval and pupal mortality were determined. The end of the outbreak was caused by cytoplasmic and nuclear polyhedroses, at least in three of the four investigated areas. The pres-ence of the pale tussock moth in the following years was limited to few larvae seen sporadically in the forests and no pupae could be found...|$|E
