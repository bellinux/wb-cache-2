2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|E
6000|$|The goggle-eyed gentleman {{withdrew his}} eyes <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> {{as if the}} back of the {{carriage}} were a hundred miles off, and said, with a lofty look of compassion for my insignificance: ...|$|E
60|$|During my {{audience}} with the jeddak another party entered the chamber <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> so that I did not see their faces until Kulan Tith stepped past me to greet them, commanding me to follow and be presented.|$|E
50|$|All tracks {{except for}} the title track also {{appeared}} as B-sides on singles <b>from</b> the Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan record.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was thrown}} in. I was {{standing}} by the bank, and something <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> picked <b>me</b> up like a feather and hurled me in. I heard nothing, and I saw nothing. But I know what it was, for all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not pray to the Prince yourself, Merapi----" [...] I began, when <b>from</b> {{the shadows}} <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> I {{heard the voice}} of Seti, who had entered by the private door bearing some {{writings}} in his hand, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{snapped the}} catch back, and flung up the sash. An icy wind {{swept into the}} room, bearing {{particles}} of snow. I scrambled on to the window-sill, and a crash <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> told of the falling of the door.|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. Before I could speak {{he was at}} the gate again, confronting the mob of savages that swayed against the fence, and the street was filled with running figures. A voice of command that I knew well came <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> It was Colonel Clark's.|$|E
60|$|I {{broke out}} of all social bounds, and rushed {{at the door of}} the room which I thought to contain the {{incredible}} creature. I burst it open; the room was pitch dark. But from in front of me came a small sad yelp, and <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> a double shriek.|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I? I was at {{the main}} rigging, looking {{to see if any}} more rain threatened. He must have left the wheel and crept <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> I was holding on to a stay with one hand. He gripped my hand free <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> and threw <b>me</b> over. It's too bad you didn't know, or else you would have staid aboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert said <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> (again poking <b>me),</b> [...] "Massive and concrete." [...] So I said boldly, as if I had {{originated}} it, {{and must}} beg to insist upon it, [...] "Massive and concrete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said a loud, {{consequential}} man <b>from</b> immediately <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> {{speaking with}} a broad western burr, [...] "vrom what I've zeen of this young Gloucester lad, I doan't think Harrison could have stood bevore him for ten rounds when he vas in his prime. I vas {{coming up in the}} Bristol coach yesterday, and the guard {{he told me that he}} had vifteen thousand pound in hard gold in the boot that had been zent up to back our man." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{came to a}} {{place where}} five {{corridors}} diverged from a common point. I had hastened along one of them for some little distance when suddenly the faint light of the torch disappeared <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> I paused to listen for sounds of the party behind me, but the silence was as utter as the silence of the tomb.|$|E
60|$|Most {{of these}} details I noted later, for I was given but {{little time to}} {{speculate}} on the wonders of my new discovery. I had seen that the eggs {{were in the process}} of hatching, and as I stood watching the hideous little monsters break from their shells I failed to note the approach of a score of full-grown Martians <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I had now {{arrived at}} that {{particular}} point of my walk where four roads met--the road to Hampstead, along which I had returned, the road to Finchley, the road to West End, and the road back to London. I had mechanically turned in this latter direction, and was strolling along the lonely high-road--idly wondering, I remember, what the Cumberland young ladies would look like--when, in one moment, every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop by {{the touch of a}} hand laid lightly and suddenly on my shoulder <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|As I {{was almost}} upon it the thing retreated before me, but a sound <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> caused <b>me</b> to wheel {{in time to}} see three pairs of eyes rushing at me from the rear. With a cry of rage I turned to meet the cowardly beasts, but as I {{advanced}} they retreated as had their fellow. Another glance over my shoulder discovered the first eyes sneaking on me again. And again I charged, only to see the eyes retreat before me and hear the muffled rush of the three at my back.|$|R
60|$|IT was broad {{day when}} I awoke {{and found myself}} tossing at the {{south-west}} end of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>behind</b> the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs.|$|R
2500|$|On occasion, White {{also plays}} other instruments, {{such as a}} Black Gibson F-4 {{mandolin}} ("Little Ghost"), piano (on most tracks <b>from</b> Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as [...] "The Air Near My Fingers" [...] and [...] "I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on [...] "The Nurse"), drums and tambourine. For The White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On the album Broken Boy Soldiers, both he and Benson are credited with playing the album's synths and organ.|$|R
60|$|Across, {{the heavy}} {{mountain}} crouched {{along the side}} of the lake, the upper half brilliantly white, belonging to the sky, the lower half dark and grim. So, then, that is where heaven and earth are divided. <b>From</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> on the left, the headland swept down out of a great, pale-grey, arid height, through a rush of russet and crimson, to the olive smoke and the water of the level earth. And between, like a blade of the sky cleaving the earth asunder, went the pale-blue lake, cleaving mountain from mountain with the triumph of the sky.|$|E
6000|$|Putting down my papers I {{ran from}} the room and at a single glance saw that [...] "the half-clad fellow" [...] {{was none other than}} Ralph himself. In my delight I lost my head, and forgetting {{everything}} except that my betrothed was there before me, I sprang from the stoep and, flying up the little slope, I fell into his open arms. For a few seconds there was silence, then <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> rose a dreadful shriek followed by cries for help. Freeing myself from Ralph's embrace, I looked round to see my great-grandmother hobbling towards us with uplifted stick. Ralph put his eye-glass in his eye and looked at her.|$|E
60|$|As I {{came back}} {{to the top of the}} steps I could see the bright sunlight, rising <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> turning the rocks across the bay to {{glittering}} gold. And yet I felt somehow disturbed. It was all too bright; as it sometimes is before the coming of a storm. As I paused to watch it, I felt a soft hand on my shoulder; and, turning, found Margaret close to me; Margaret as bright and radiant as the morning glory of the sun! It was my own Margaret this time! My old Margaret, without alloy of any other; and I felt that, at least, this last and fatal day was well begun.|$|E
60|$|From Ripley until I {{came through}} Pyrford I {{was in the}} valley of the Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out <b>from</b> Pyrford Church <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and then came the {{silhouette}} of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red.|$|R
60|$|Well, if I {{had been}} heavy with thought before, {{you can think}} how I felt after my strange talk with the man among the fagots. What came home to me even more than his words was his shivering, broken voice, his {{twitching}} face, and his eyes glancing swiftly to right and left, and opening in horror whenever a branch cracked upon a tree. It {{was clear that he}} was in the last extremity of terror, and it is possible that he had cause, for shortly after I had left him I heard a distant gunshot and a shouting <b>from</b> somewhere <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> It may have been some sportsman halloaing to his dogs, but I never again heard of or saw the man who had given me my warning.|$|R
60|$|As I have said, I had {{the will}} and the fearlessness, and I racked my sea- cuny brains for the wit. A palace eunuch, {{tickling}} my neck with a feather <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> gave <b>me</b> my start. I had already drawn attention by my aloofness and imperviousness to the attacks of the ki-sang, so that many were looking on at the eunuch's baiting of me. I gave no sign, made no move, until I had located him and distanced him. Then, like a shot, without turning head or body, merely by my arm I fetched him an open, back-handed slap. My knuckles landed flat on his cheek and jaw. There was a crack like a spar parting in a gale. He was bowled clean over, landing in a heap on the floor a dozen feet away.|$|R
6000|$|Only {{then did}} I {{understand}} {{how difficult is}} this fox chase, for one may cut again and again at the creature and never strike him once. He is small, and turns quickly from a blow. At every cut I heard those shouts of encouragement <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and they spurred me to yet another effort. And then at last the supreme moment of my triumph arrived. In {{the very act of}} turning I caught him fair with such another back-handed cut as that with which I killed the aide-de-camp of the Emperor of Russia. He flew into two pieces, his head one way and his tail another. I looked back and waved the blood-stained sabre in the air. For the moment I was exalted--superb! ...|$|E
60|$|While I {{was still}} {{standing}} gazing at lessening Tokimata, I heard a cry <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and, turning, ducked {{just in time to}} escape being unceremoniously somersaulted into the water by a hawser stretched from bank to bank at a level singularly suited to such a trick. The rope was the stationary half of a ferry to which I had neglected to make timely obeisance. It marked, indeed, an incipient stage in the art of suspension bridges, the ferryboat itself supporting a part of the weight, while the ferryman pulled it and himself across. We met several more {{in the course of the}} next few minutes, before which we all bowed down into the bottom of the boat, while the hawser scraped, grumbling impotently, overhead.|$|E
60|$|And {{now we must}} {{endeavour}} to {{find some}} additional proof of the general character and composition of water; and for this purpose I will keep you a little longer, so that at our next meeting we may be better prepared for the subject. We have the power of arranging the zinc which you have seen acting upon the water by the assistance of an acid, {{in such a manner}} as to cause all the power to be evolved in the place where we require it I have behind me a voltaic pile, and I am just about to shew you, {{at the end of this}} lecture, its character and power, that you may see what we shall have to deal with when next we meet. I hold here the extremities of the wires which transport the power <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> and which I shall cause to act on the water.|$|E
500|$|While Jack was {{the lead}} vocalist, Meg did sing lead vocals on four of the band's songs: [...] "In the Cold, Cold Night" [...] (from Elephant), [...] "Passive Manipulation" [...] (<b>from</b> Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan), [...] "Who's a Big Baby?" [...] (released on the [...] "Blue Orchid" [...] single), and [...] "St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air)" [...] (from Icky Thump). She also {{accompanied}} Jack on the songs [...] "Your Southern Can Is Mine" [...] from their album De Stijl, [...] "Hotel Yorba" [...] and [...] "This Protector" [...] from their album White Blood Cells, on [...] "You Don't Know What Love Is [...] "(You Just Do as You're Told)" [...] and [...] "Rag & Bone" [...] from their album Icky Thump, [...] "Rated X" [...] and also sang alongside Jack and Holly Golightly on the song [...] "It's True That We Love One Another", from the album Elephant.|$|R
60|$|Grasping {{the sill}} I pulled myself up to a sitting posture without {{looking into the}} building, and gazed down at the baffled animal beneath me. My exultation was short-lived, however, for {{scarcely}} had I gained a secure seat upon the sill than a huge hand grasped me by the neck <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> and dragged <b>me</b> violently into the room. Here I was thrown upon my back, and beheld standing over me a colossal ape-like creature, white and hairless except for an enormous shock of bristly hair upon its head.|$|R
6000|$|And {{behind the}} woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without {{anything}} on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung {{on to their}} mother's gown, and peeped out <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> her at <b>me,</b> bashful, the way they always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting {{the same way the}} little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand--and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|Turning my eyes a moment, I {{noticed a}} fan-shaped flicker {{swinging}} like a comet across the dusky waste {{far down the}} straight-ruled track, and when a man I knew held up his watch beneath a lamp, I had almost come to a decision. If the sergeant had shown any sign of weakness it is perhaps possible that decision might have been reversed; but Mackay stood as though cast in iron, and equally unyielding. I would at least have no blood shed on my account, and would not leave my friends to bear {{the consequences of their}} unthinking generosity. Meanwhile, stock-rider and teamster were waiting in strained attention, and there was still almost a minute left to pass when a light hand touched my shoulder, and Lucille Haldane, appearing <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> said: [...] "You must do something. Go forward and speak to them immediately." [...] She was trembling with eagerness, but the station agent stood on my other side, and he was woodenly stolid.|$|E
60|$|After {{the first}} wild efforts I felt calm like. I knew the shore was but {{half a mile}} ahead, and that the wind would set me dead upon it. I {{loosened}} my tarpaulin coat and shook it off, and I found that with mother's belt I could keep easily enough afloat, though I was half drowned with the waves as they swept in <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> My mother's dream cheered me up, for, according to that, {{it did not seem}} as I was to be drowned, whatever was to come afterwards. I drifted past the wreck within a hundred yards or so. They were still burning blue lights; but the sea made a clean sweep over her, and I saw that in a very few minutes she would go to pieces. Many times as the seas broke over me I quite gave up hope of reaching shore; but I was a fair swimmer, and the bottles buoyed me up, and I struggled on.|$|E
6000|$|... (A lighted torch in {{the hand}} [...] Is no {{unpleasant}} object here--one's breath [...] Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours [...] 25 [...] As the thin clouds that travel near the moon.) [...] You see that crevice there? [...] My torch extinguished by these water-drops, [...] And marking that the moonlight came from thence, [...] I stept in to it, meaning to sit there; [...] 30 [...] But scarcely had I measured twenty paces-- [...] My body bending forward, yea, o'erbalanced [...] Almost beyond recoil, on the dim brink [...] Of a huge chasm I stept. The shadowy moonshine [...] Filling the void so counterfeited substance, [...] 35 [...] That my foot hung aslant adown the edge. [...] Was it my own fear? [...] Fear too hath its instincts![860:1] [...] (And yet such dens as these are wildly told of, [...] And there are beings that live, yet not for the eye) [...] An arm of frost above and <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> [...] 40 [...] Pluck'd up and snatched me backward. Merciful Heaven! [...] You smile! alas, even smiles look ghastly here! [...] My lord, I pray you, go yourself and view it.|$|E
5000|$|Though Jack usually sang lead vocals, Meg {{occasionally}} sang as well, {{the first}} time being backup on the record [...] "Your Southern Can is Mine" [...] from De Stijl. She sang lead on four Stripes' songs: [...] "In the Cold, Cold Night", from the album Elephant, [...] "Passive Manipulation" [...] <b>from</b> Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan, [...] "Who's a Big Baby", the B-side to [...] "Blue Orchid," [...] and [...] "St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air)" [...] from Icky Thump. She also sang the popular Christmas song [...] "Silent Night" [...] on the single Candy Cane Children. Both Meg and Jack share vocal duties on the tracks [...] "Hotel Yorba" [...] and [...] "This Protector" [...] from White Blood Cells, [...] "Rated X" [...] from the [...] "Hotel Yorba" [...] single, [...] "Well It's True That We Love One Another" [...] on Elephant, and [...] "Rag and Bone" [...] from Icky Thump. Andrew Katchen with Billboard magazine called her vocals [...] "delicate and sweet." ...|$|R
5000|$|White {{began with}} a red Ludwig Classic Maple kit that had a red and white {{peppermint}} swirl on the resonant heads of the toms and bass drum. [...] On the Icky Thump tour, the bass drum head design was switched to a button. While recording From the Basement: The White Stripes, the design was switched to an image of White's hand holding the apple <b>from</b> the Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan cover. Beginning in 2006, [...] she also used a pair of Paiste 14" [...] Signature Medium Hi-Hats, a 19" [...] Signature Power Crash, and a 22" [...] 2002 Ride. Meg also used Remo and Ludwig drumheads, various percussion instruments and Vater drumsticks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} the voyage to Tahiti myself. Five years ago I was a nervous wreck when I sailed from San Francisco. Twenty-one days later, when I landed at the Society Islands, at Tahiti, I was a new man. Weeks on the water, without a word <b>from</b> the world <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> had worked a miracle. On the upper deck of the {{comfortable}} little ship I forgot my troubles through pure joy of existence. All day long I rested body and brain. With evening the blood-red sun plunged into a molten sea. Then blue sky suddenly changed to violet, and deepening shadow brought out the stars--the Southern Cross. I began {{to feel like a}} different person." ...|$|R
