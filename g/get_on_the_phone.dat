"The {{plight of}} the Karen people, who were forced into slave labour in the {{rainforest}} to build pipelines for oil companies (some of them British), was a tale of human suffering {{that needed to be}} told by any branch of the media that was interested.

Afterwards– and not for the first time– {{it seemed to me that}} we at The Guardian should be using our resources ourselves.

2500|$|Cosby {{was asked}} {{directly}} about Buress's comments {{and the resulting}} fallout in two November 2014 interviews, which were originally intended to be about a new art exhibit at the Smithsonian that featured his private collection of African American art. In an NPR interview on November 15, 2014, reporter Scott Simon said: [...] "This question gives me no pleasure, Mr. Cosby, {{but there have been}} serious allegations raised about you in recent days." [...] Cosby became silent, leading to an awkward radio exchange in which Simon verbally described Cosby's actions to listeners: [...] "you're shaking your head no." [...] Simon continued asking Cosby to comment on the allegations before finally wrapping up the interview with no further communication from Cosby. In a November 6, 2014, interview with Associated Press reporter Brett Zongker, Cosby appeared visibly rattled by unexpected Buress questions and told Zongker, [...] "No, no, we don't answer that." [...] In the proceeding minutes, Cosby repeatedly attempted to get Zongker to confirm that the AP would edit out the Buress questions, implying that Zongker's [...] "integrity" [...] and ability to be a [...] "serious reporter" [...] would be compromised if that portion of the interview was not [...] "scuttled". When Zongker failed to guarantee this request, Cosby turned to his off-camera publicist David Brokaw and told him to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with Zongker's editors [...] "immediately". When the interview was first released on November 10, the Buress questions had indeed been omitted. However, after the allegations continued to gain new traction, including a new accusation from Janice Dickinson, the AP decided to release footage of the full exchange on November 19.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{his first}} actions was to replace Ron Cooper with John L. Smith as {{football}} coach, {{in an attempt to}} boost fan support before the move to the new Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. [...] One of his notable accomplishments was bringing Rick Pitino, who had brought the rival University of Kentucky's basketball team to one NCAA championship, one NCAA Runner-up, and three Final Fours, to the University of Louisville on March 21, 2001. [...] Pitino was going to take the basketball coaching job at University of Michigan, but told the media, [...] "I can't <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and tell Tom no.

Once the others have downed their expensive drinks, Dick politely informs them that Skullcrusher takes a psychotically, violently dim view of competing forgers, and unless they pay him £5,000 {{by the end of}} the night, he will come down there and crush their skulls. The group, suddenly realising why he is called the Skullcrusher, initially panics, before they discover that the pub has its annual quiz that evening, with a £5,000 prize. They settle the £200 entry fee with gold teeth, which they violently extract from each other's mouths.|$|R

Whilst trying to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to Louis, Charlie collapses.

5000|$|According to Mike Gordon in The Phish Book: [...] "My fiance Cilla Foster was {{responsible}} for our first tour. In 1988 she was waitressing in Telluride for a guy named Warren Stickney. I didn't know her very well at the time, but one day she called and said Stickney wanted us to come play in his bar. We'd never played further away from home than New Hampshire at the time, but Stickney promised to book a monthlong tour across the country. It took another six months to <b>get</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> again, but I finally spoke with him about a week before {{we were supposed to}} hit the road. He said something like, 'I don't know if I can get you any other gigs, but you can play my place and I'll pay you a thousand bucks.' I couldn't <b>get</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> after that, so the six of us - including Paul Languedoc and Tim Rogers, who was doing lights - decided to go for it anyway.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Arnold, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, {{learned of}} the {{escalation}} from a live feed where the remaining holdouts were talking of murder and asking to speak to Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore. Fiore was informed of the request as her flight touched down at the Portland International Airport in Portland, Oregon.

5000|$|When Begelman and McNall relayed Fox's ruling to Cimino, he exploded. [...] "I've been cutting for six months. There's {{nothing more}} to take out!" [...] he shouted. The {{producers}} responded that {{there had to be}} a way to tell the story in 120 minutes. Cimino answered, [...] "Fine! You want it shorter, you got it." [...] A few days later, Cimino delivered a new version of the film in which all of the action scenes were cut out. [...] "In the script a big wedding scene in the mountains is followed by an attack on the wedding party." [...] wrote McNall. [...] "In what we saw the wedding was followed by a scene at a hospital, where all the people in nice clothes were being treated for their wounds. He just cut out the battle." [...] Begelman did not wait till the film ended to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and immediately called Cimino. Cimino said that his contract allowed him final cut in a 120-minute film and what he gave them qualified.|$|E
5000|$|... "Grind" [...] {{seems to}} address the various rumors that {{surrounded}} the band at the time. The opening lines, [...] "In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised/Not to plan my funeral before the body dies", seem to be addressing the rumors that the band had broken up and the many rumors of vocalist Layne Staley's death that had occurred frequently around this time. In the liner notes of 1999's Music Bank box set collection, guitarist Jerry Cantrell said of the song:That was pretty much {{at the height of}} publicity about canceled tours, heroin, amputations, everything, thus it was another [...] "FUCK YOU for saying something about my life" [...] song. Any single rumor you can imagine, I've heard. I've been dead a few times, Layne's been dead countless times and lost limbs. I <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> every time I hear a new one, [...] "Hey Layne, radio in New York says you lost two more fingers." [...] "Oh really? Cool." [...] I'd spoof The Six Million Dollar Man; [...] "Since technology's moved on it only cost us 2 million to put Layne back together and we got better parts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vakoch {{suggests}} that the detection of extraterrestrials in a standard SETI scenario may be less clear-cut that usually assumed: [...] "I think the assumption that one day {{someone is going to}} announce that we’ve discovered extraterrestrial intelligence, and now the world knows, is a fallacy, because there’s going to be much more ambiguity in the process." [...] “Unlike Hollywood movies, where you get a quick 'yes or no' about a possible signal from aliens,” Vakoch told Universe Today, “the real SETI confirmation process takes some time. It’s easy to think that all {{we need to do is}} <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with an astronomer at another location, and we’re all set. But even when colleagues at other facilities are willing to observe, they may face technical limitations.” He also assumes it may take some time to decode any message: [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say," he told ABC News. “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told Science Friday, adding that [...] "in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E
50|$|On shore {{leave in}} a foreign town, members of the Hammersley crew are near a bar when it is blown up by a suicide bomber, {{rattling}} them all.

50|$|Tony becomes hysterical, blaming Anne {{and saying}} {{he is not going}} to go to prison. Anne tells him to call the police, as she won't let them hurt him. She <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and asks them to let Tony call his {{grandmother}}. When he talks to his grandmother she asks if it's true that he took Anne, and said she'll be praying for him. Tony tells his grandmother that he's going to kill Anne, and then himself. He points the gun at Anne's chest as Anne picks up <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and tells <b>the</b> police not to shoot, as they are coming out. She tells Tony they can't shoot, or they'd end up shooting her, too. As they exit the house, he has his arm wrapped around her; she turns around and tells him to put the gun down. As he does, Anne runs to Officer Timbrook. Tony begins screaming for Anne as the FBI and police rush towards him. He begs them not to shoot, as he is <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. While Officer Timbrook is hugging Anne, he shows her the teddy bear that she left behind, returning it to Anne. Tony is put in the back of a police car, still screaming her name. Anne and Officer Timbrook walk up to the window as Anne throws at the window the wedding ring Tony gave to her.|$|R
50|$|In Hollywood, {{director}} Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), {{movie star}} Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) gathers {{them in his}} office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project. Shields cannot <b>get</b> financing <b>on</b> his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem. Pebbel asks the three to allow him to <b>get</b> Shields <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> before they give their final answer.|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{back on the}} {{ground-breaking}} broadcast, Hal Holbrook recalls [...] "I was {{an actor}} clearly not afraid of controversy [...] [...] [...] Anything {{that would make the}} audience think was worthwhile," [...] although he turned down the role when it initially was offered to him. [...] "I wasn't worried about whether the character was a gay person or not; the reason I turned it down, frankly, is I read the script and I didn't think much happened in it. I just thought it was kind of tame." [...] After he discussed the script with Carol Rossen, who was to become his second wife, she responded, [...] "You're going to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and call Hollywood and tell them {{you want to do this}} part before they give it to somebody else," [...] and Holbrook did just that. He felt an emotional connection to the character in the film because at the time he had separated from his first wife and he hadn't told his two young children about the split. [...] "It was very easy and natural for me to translate the emotional turmoil I personally was feeling into the turmoil Doug was feeling." [...] The film remains important to him because it meant so much to so many people. [...] "That's a good reason for being an actor, when you can do something decent that touches people's hearts and their minds, so you feel like you actually accomplished something," [...] he says.|$|E

Unfortunately, Calvin’s game are so complex that only he can understand {{what to do and}} he can’t understand why the others are reluctant to play with him. Sharon is 13 years old and is really excited about going on a ski trip with her school. When they arrive she is in such a rush to get on the lift that she impulsively pushes ahead of the other kids. She doesn’t really understand why they are angry with her. Charlie Brown (real name) always tries his best to be optimistic and make friends but, due to his low opinion of himself and past experiences of failure, he fails. A woman you know at the office is a very nice person but she tends to always stand a little too close (both to the men and women) and makes you somewhat uncomfortable. You are speaking with someone on the phone and they only want to tell you their news, neglecting to ask about what is happening in your life. All of the above are examples of unsuccessful social interactions. But when do they become actual problems? This depends upon 2 factors. First, we must take into account where the child is developmentally. We might expect that a 3 year old child would grab a toy from another child without asking. This would not cause most people to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and start schedulling therapy appointments. However, if you have an 8 year old child who is consistently grabbing the video controller from his playmates and they are consistently getting angry and don’t want to play with him, then this constitutes a problem.
