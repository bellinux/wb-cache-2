Among these have been feature stories by the Multi-National Force: Iraq public affairs office, on married soldiers who deploy together. The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September–October 2007 issue. This story was intended to display the versatility of sustainment brigades overall. Another story was written for defenselink.mil, the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how they react to the desert climate of the country, having to cope with sandstorms and other issues.|$|E

25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> individual worker {{as well as}} environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance {{is a result of}} the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E

25|$|Land reform {{measures}} were passed in 1919 and 1925 {{under pressure from}} an impoverished peasantry. They were partially implemented, but resulted in the parcellation of only 20% of the great agricultural estates. Poland endured numerous economic calamities and disruptions in the early 1920s, including waves of workers' strikes such as the 1923 Kraków riot. The German–Polish customs war, initiated by Germany in 1925, {{was one of the}} most damaging external factors that put a strain on Poland's economy. On the other hand, there were also signs of progress and stabilization, for example a critical reform of finances carried out by the competent government of Władysław Grabski, which lasted almost two years. Certain other achievements of the democratic period <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> management of governmental and civic institutions necessary to the functioning of the reunited state and nation were too easily overlooked.

500|$|The most {{critical}} factors in flowering and fruit set are physiological, <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{age of the}} plant and whether it already has developing fruit. The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key in fruit set and development. Ethylene promotes the production of female flowers. When a plant already has a fruit developing, subsequent female flowers on the plant {{are less likely to}} mature, a phenomenon called [...] "first-fruit dominance", and male flowers are more frequent, an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the plant stem. Ethephon, a plant growth regulator product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant, can be used to increase fruit and seed production.|$|E

His duties grew significantly, and included all Army boards, formal schools, training centers, and mobilization camps, as well as special activities <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> four combat arms (Infantry, Field Artillery, Cavalry, and Coast Artillery).

[...] However, when compared to [...] "sluttish time" [...] they are [...] "unswept stone besmeared". [...] The same technique occurs in the second quatrain.

[...] The plaintiff was entitled to damages because the defendant had committed a conversion. The manure had not {{become a part of the}} real estate, as the defendant had argued.
