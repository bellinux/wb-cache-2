40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{understand}} the structural fire performance of two-way post-tensioned <b>flat</b> <b>slabs,</b> particularly their deformations and load-carrying mechanisms in fire, and to explore the behaviour of post-tensioned high-strength self-compacting concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> with unbonded tendons in fire. Design/methodology/approach: Four tests of post-tensioned high-strength self-compacting concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> were conducted under fire conditions. Numerical modelling using the commercial package ABAQUS was conducted to help interpret the test results. Findings: Two of the specimens with lower moisture contents demonstrated excellent fire resistance performance, while the others with slightly higher moisture contents experienced severe concrete spalling. Originality/value: The test results were discussed in respect of thermal profiles, deflections, crack patterns and concrete spalling. The performance of post-tensioned high-strength self-compacting concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> with unbonded tendons under fire conditions was better understood...|$|R

Fire tests of four scale specimens of two-way posttensioned concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> were performed and analysed.

Different degrees of concrete spalling observed at the soffit had significant effects on the temperature distribution and stress redistribution.

40|$|Abstract Punching shear is a {{possible}} type of failure that occurs in reinforced concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs,</b> which can develop with an ultimate load below flexural capacity. Several researchers have studied the punching resistance of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> over recent years. Although they have made great advances, there are codes that show different approaches to a singular design. Some codes show that there exist contradictions, even in the simplest situations, such as concentric loads. Most codes prescribe empirical expressions based in a theoretical model to analyze punching strength, but for <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> with holes around the column and shear reinforcement there are divergences between codes, justifying research in this area. This paper presents an experimental analysis of nine square reinforced concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> under concentric loading (width: 1800 mm; thickness: 130 mm). The main variables used in the tests were: a) two square openings (150 mm) adjacent to the smallest side of the column and b) the use of shear reinforcement containing 3 layers, with 6 or 8 elements in each layer and radially distributed around the column. The research concludes that openings adjacent to the column affect punching shear strength, while the correct use of the shear reinforcement can minimize and even compensate this loss...|$|R
25|$|Initially, it was {{proposed}} to use Insitu concrete flat slabs {{in the basement}} with a composite steel frame above podium level all on a 9m x 9m grid. However, as the top five floors had been prelet to KPMG, construction needed to be accelerated and water tightness on the upper levels needed to be achieved quicker. As a result, the plan was changed and the steel frame was started at basement level. However, the basement floors and column finishes were required to be concrete. A hybrid concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> and concrete encased steel column solution was used to achieve this as it allows the steelwork to continue for the upper floors with temporary bracing in the lower levels. As the concrete floors for the basement construction catch up, the temporary bracing is removed or built in.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} design of reinforced concrete <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> for punching shear. <b>Flat</b> <b>slabs</b> are two way spanning slabs without downstand beams that are directly supported by columns. The thickness of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> is typically governed by considerations of either deflection control or punching shear {{for which there is}} still no widely accepted theoretical treatment. The research seeks to develop {{a better understanding of the}} effects of in-plane restraint and flexural continuity on the punching resistance of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs.</b> The overriding aim is to determine whether flexural continuity is sufficient to explain the satisfactory performance of existing <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> which appear punching shear deficient when assessed against test data from isolated punching shear specimens. The influence of slab continuity on punching resistance is assessed through analysis of test data, nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) and fib MC 2010 Level of Approximation (LoA) IV which is based on the Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) of Muttoni. The CSCT relates shear resistance to the width of the so-called ‘critical shear crack’ which depends on slab rotation. MC 2010 has four LoA of which I to III are intended for design. Punching resistance is normally determined from tests on isolated slab-column specimens which are intended to simulate behaviour within the elastic line of contraflexure for radial moments, although the benefits of continuity on punching shear strength is well known. MC 2010 LoA IV, which uses nonlinear finite element analysis to determine the slab rotation, is used to investigate and develop a better understanding of the influence of continuity on the punching shear resistance of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> at edge and internal columns. The FE model is calibrated against relevant test data from both isolated and continuous specimens. Parametric studies are presented which show the superseded UK design code BS 8110 to require significantly less punching shear reinforcement than EC 2 (2004) and MC 2010 LoA II which give reasonable strength predictions for isolated internal column punching specimens. Despite this, slabs designed to BS 8110 have performed satisfactorily for many years. MC 2010 LoA IV is used to show that punching resistance at internal columns can be increased significantly by restraint from the surrounding slab. The increase in punching resistance due to continuity is shown to be sufficient to explain the satisfactory performance of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> designed to BS 8110 at internal columns. However, the strength increase is variable and, in the case of uniformly loaded slabs, already largely included in BS 8110 and EC 2. The research also considers the influence of slab continuity on punching resistance at edge columns. Parametric studies are developed to examine the influence of shear force eccentricity, flexural reinforcement distribution between support and span, and modelling assumptions on the punching resistance of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> at edge columns. Relating the punching resistance at edge columns to the elastic unbalanced moment as done in MC 2010 LoA II and III is shown to be overly conservative for continuous slabs. The ACI 318 and EC 2 practice of making the design punching resistance independent of the unbalanced moment is reviewed and shown to be reasonable particularly for continuous slabs. MC 2010 LoA IV is shown to be a powerful tool for assessment, however the predictions for the method are very sensitive to the modelling assumptions and boundary conditions. Open Acces...|$|R
