5|$|Contested between 9 and 19 March 1995, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> the venue, and {{the only}} major world {{championship}} to be contested in Northern Ontario. The Nordic combined individual took place on 9 March, and was won by Fred Børre Lundberg ahead of Jari Mantila. The following day saw Japan win ahead of Norway and Finland in the Nordic combined team event. In ski jumping, the individual normal hill event took place on 12 March, which saw a double Japanese victory with Takanobu Okabe winning ahead of Hiroya Saito. The team event in the large hill on 16 March saw Finland win ahead of Germany and Japan. In the large hill individual event on 18 March, Tommy Ingebrigtsen set a new hill record and won ahead of Andreas Goldberger.|$|E

25|$|Many of the prostanoids are know {{to mediate}} local {{symptoms}} of inflammation: vasoconstriction or vasodilation, coagulation, pain, and fever. Inhibition of COX-1 and/or the inducible COX-2 isoforms, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin. Prostanoids also activate the PPARγ {{members of the}} steroid/thyroid family of nuclear hormone receptors, and directly influence gene transcription.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} {{superconductivity}} {{is accompanied by}} abrupt changes in various physical properties, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> a phase transition. For example, the electronic heat capacity {{is proportional to the}} temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as e−α/T for some constant, α. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the energy gap.|$|E

25|$|Even {{congenital}} GH deficiency {{does not}} usually impair length growth {{until after the}} first few months of life. From late in the first year until mid teens, poor growth and/or shortness <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> childhood GH deficiency. Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism, but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical. It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and puberty may be several years delayed. When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated, adult heights can be as short as 48-65inches (122–165cm).|$|E
25|$|Blending <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> Champagne wine, {{with most}} Champagnes being the {{assembled}} product of several vineyards and vintages. In Champagne {{there are over}} 19,000 vineyard owners, only 5,000 of which are owned by Champagne producers. The rest sell their grapes to the various Champagne houses, negociants and co-operatives. The grapes, most commonly Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot meunier, are used to make several base wines that are assembled together to make Champagne. Each grape adds its own unique imprint to the result. Chardonnay is prized for its finesse and aging ability. Pinot noir adds body and fruit while Pinot meunier contributes substantially to the aroma, adding fruit and floral notes. The majority of Champagnes produced are non-vintage (or rather, multi-vintage) blends. Vintage Champagne, often a house's most prestigious and expensive wine, is also produced, but only in years when the producers feel that the grapes have the complexity and richness to warrant it.|$|E
25|$|The Buffalo parks {{system has}} over 20 parks with several parks {{accessible}} from {{any part of}} the city. The Olmsted Park and Parkway System <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Constructed in 1868 by Frederick Law Olmsted and his partner Calvert Vaux, the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted-designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy (BOPC), a non-profit, for public benefit corporation which serves as the city's parks department. It is the first non-governmental organization of its kind to serve in such a capacity in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Pathologically, {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases such}} as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are all characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, cognitive decline, motor impairments, and sensory loss. Collectively these diseases fall within a broad category referred to as proteinopathies, due to the common assemblage of misfolded or aggregated intracellular or extracellular proteins. According to the prevailing amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, the aggregation of amyloid-beta (a peptide normally produced in and cleared from the healthy young brain) into extracellular plaques drives the neuronal loss and brain atrophy that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> Alzheimer's dementia. Although {{the full extent of}} the glymphatic system's involvement in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear, researchers have demonstrated through experiments with genetically modified mice that the proper function of the glymphatic clearance system was necessary to remove soluble amyloid-beta from the brain interstitium. In mice that lack the AQP4 gene, amyloid-beta clearance is reduced by approximately 55 percent.|$|E

[...] Spottiswoode did not return to direct the next film; he said the producers asked him, but he was too tired. Apparently, Brosnan and Hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto the set one day. The matter was quickly resolved though and Brosnan apologised to Hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was late for that reason.|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger reflected, [...] "He was only on the show for a season and not featured all that much in that season, but Kevin Durand always made an impression as Keamy.
