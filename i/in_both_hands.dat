25|$|A drum kit — {{also called}} a drum set, trap set, or simply drums — is a {{collection}} of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones - most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1). In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used.|$|E
25|$|About 20 toccatas by Pachelbel survive, {{including}} several brief pieces {{referred to as}} toccatinas in the Perreault catalogue. They are characterized by consistent use of pedal point: for the most part, Pachelbel's toccatas consist of relatively fast passagework <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> over sustained pedal notes. Although a similar technique is employed in toccatas by Froberger and Frescobaldi's pedal toccatas, Pachelbel distinguishes himself from these composers by having no sections with imitative counterpoint–in fact, unlike most toccatas from the early and middle Baroque periods, Pachelbel's contributions to the genre are not sectional, unless rhapsodic introductory passages in a few pieces (most notably the E minor toccata) are counted as separate sections. Furthermore, no other Baroque composer used pedal point with such consistency in toccatas.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which tools are integrated into the body schema are not fully understood. However, studies with long-term training have shown interesting phenomena. When wielding tools <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> in a crossed posture, behavioral effects reverse {{in a similar way}} to when only hands are crossed. Thus, sensory stimuli are delivered the same way be it to the hands directly or indirectly via the tools. These studies suggest the mind incorporates the tools into the same or similar areas as it does the adjacent hands. Recent research into the short term plasticity of the body schema used individuals without any prior training with tools. These results, derived from the relation between afterimages and body schema, show that tools are incorporated into the body schema within seconds, regardless of length of training, though the results do not extend to other species besides humans.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} an etrog that is stolen or {{withered}} is invalid. If the larger {{part of it}} is covered with scars, or if its nipple is removed, if it is peeled, split, perforated, so that any part is missing, it is invalid. If only its lesser part is covered with scars, if its stalk was missing, or if it is perforated but nothing of it is missing, it is valid. A dark-colored etrog is invalid. If it is green as a leek, Rabbi Meir declares it valid and Rabbi Judah declares it invalid. Rabbi Meir taught that the minimum size of an etrog is that of a nut. Rabbi Judah taught that it is that of an egg. Rabbi Judah taught that the maximum size is such that two can be held in one hand. Rabbi Jose said even one that can be hold only <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pageantry {{following}} the statues {{and the introduction}} of Eros continued to portray scenes that showed the sequence of Greek civilisation through its art. The scenes started with the Minoan civilisation. The first float featured the iconic image of Minoan civilization: that of the fertility goddess clad in a bodice exposing her breasts and clutching serpents <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands.</b> The subsequent floats then featured scenes of bull-jumping, dolphins, and other elements that harkened back to the images in the frescoes of Phaestos. The scenes then proceeded to the more stark art of the Mycenean civilisation, followed by representations of the Classical period. A chariot carrying an actor portraying Alexander the Great introduced images from the Hellenistic period, which in turn were followed by representations of Byzantine art, the Greek War of Independence, and lastly of 20th century elements of Greek culture, such as the popular shadow-theatre figure Karagiozis, who {{is said to be a}} humorous and self-deprecating depiction (and parody) of Greek mentality.|$|E

25|$|The central {{standing}} 'foreground' {{figure is}} shown affectionately holding <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> a blue bird (thus {{the title of}} the painting). The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with the unmistakable coloration of the rare Scarlet ibis (L'Ibis rouge), a rich symbol for both exoticism and fashion. Costume designers for Parisian cabarets such as Le Lido, Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge and haute couture houses in Paris during the 1910s used the feathers of the scarlet Ibis in their shows and collections. The Ibis is a bird to which the ancient Egyptians paid religious worship and attributed to it a 'virgin purity'. A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a porthole {{to the right of the}} reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a sundial, perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his Nude of 1910.|$|E
25|$|Hatra in contrast, had {{numerous}} stone statues representing deities or local rulers {{and their family}} members. The local upper class donated the statues of the temples to the city, where they were found by the excavations. Many of these works are precisely dated by inscriptions of the donor and provide a good chronological framework. There is also sometimes even the mention of a sculptor's name, such as Aba or Schabaz. In addition to works in the classical Greco-Hellenistic tradition (especially of classical deities) they show the people sitting or standing, facing front and dressed in Parthian fashion with rich regalia. The men wear shoes, pants and a tunic over it. Over the tunic some men wear a kind of jacket. Often you can see {{on the left side}} a dagger, a sword on his right hip. Kings wear a tiara with a diadem or tiara with the image of an eagle. The right hand is usually raised in a gesture of adoration to the top, the left hand holds a sword or a palm branch. Other statues carry <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> a statue of God. There is striking attention to detail. The patterns of the substances, weapons and jewelry are reproduced exactly.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of 1935 Robey {{accepted}} his first Shakespearean role, as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1, which surprised the press and worried fans who thought that he might retire the Prime Minister of Mirth. The theatrical press were sceptical of a music hall performer taking on such a distinguished role; Carroll, the play's producer, vehemently defended his casting choice. Carroll later admitted taking a gamble on employing Robey but wrote that the comedian [...] "has unlimited courage in challenging criticism and risking his reputation on a venture of this kind; he takes both his past and his future <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> and is faced with the alternative of dashing them into the depths or lifting them to a height hitherto undreamt of." [...] Carroll further opined that [...] " [...] has never failed in anything he has undertaken. He {{is one of the}} most intelligent and capable of actors." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{triangular}} {{positioning of}} three figures became {{something of a}} vogue in prints of the mid-1790s. [...] The [...] "Three Beauties of the Kansei Era" [...] normally refer to the three who appear in this print; on occasion, Utamaro replaced Toyohina with Kikumoto O-Han. [...] Utamaro placed the three beauties in the same composition {{three or four years}} later in a print called Three Beauties, in which Hisa holds a teacup saucer in her left hand rather than a handkerchief, and Kita holds her fan <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] To Eiji Yoshida, the figures in this print lack the personalities that were the charm of the earlier. [...] Yoshida thought less of the further undifferentiated personalities of a later print with the same triangular composition, Three Beauties Holding Bags of Snacks, published by Yamaguchiya. [...] As testimony to their popularity, the three models often appeared in the works of other artists, and Utamaro continued to use them in other prints, individually or in pairs.|$|E
500|$|King is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately. Other bowlers in his time could sometimes get the ball to swing, but King w{{as one of the}} first to do so at will with an old or new ball. He made use of a lethal delivery which he called the [...] "angler", a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher, to confuse the English batsmen. He would come in with the ball clasped above his head <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> as would a baseball pitcher. He was famous for his late swing—in and out—and would produce the in-swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder. He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or [...] of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen. After a tour to Philadelphia by an Australian side in 1896, George Giffen said [...] "the Philadelphians really have some high-class players, but it was the fact of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that upset our batsmen." ...|$|E
