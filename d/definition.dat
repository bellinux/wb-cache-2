5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic <b>definition,</b> some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence <b>definition</b> includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by <b>definition,</b> concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, the <b>definition</b> has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the <b>definition</b> should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this change {{is that the new}} <b>definition</b> makes the <b>definition</b> of the kilogram dependent on the definitions of the second and the metre.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow <b>definition</b> of atheist was the common usage <b>definition</b> of that word, and admitting that the broad <b>definition</b> of agnostic was the common usage <b>definition</b> of that word, promoted broadening the <b>definition</b> of atheist and narrowing the <b>definition</b> of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism {{as a third}} alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

Legal <b>definitions</b> are a tool enabling to make terms and legal texts more precise and unambiguous.

The following types of <b>definitions</b> will be compared: (i) parity <b>definitions</b> (1. classic <b>definitions,</b> 2. limited classic <b>definitions,</b> 3. non-classic <b>definitions</b> and within that category especially incomplete, complete, complete blank and partial <b>definitions,</b> 4. aggregative <b>definitions),</b> (ii) non-parity <b>definitions</b> (1. iconographic <b>definitions</b> and 2. conditional <b>definitions).</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Quotas on high <b>definition</b> content — {{a minimum}} of 1040 hours per year — were imposed by the Australian {{government}} in July 2003 on broadcasters in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The same requirement was extended in April 2005 to stations in Darwin, regional New South Wales and regional Queensland, and in January 2006 in Mildura. As of 13 July 2007 commercial television networks in Australia were permitted to provide a separate standard <b>definition</b> and high <b>definition</b> channel. As of January 2009, they were permitted 2 standard <b>definition</b> channels {{in addition to the}} high <b>definition</b> channel — the networks planned to launch these via Freeview (Australia). However, in August 2015, the government finally lifted the SD Primary Channel mandate, allowing broadcasters to simulcast their respective main channel programmes in high <b>definition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>definition</b> of the ampere is {{undergoing}} a major overhaul—the current <b>definition,</b> which is difficult to realise with high precision in practice, is being replaced by a <b>definition</b> that is more intuitive and that is easier to realise.|$|E
5|$|The <b>definition</b> of the {{kilogram}} {{is undergoing}} a fundamental change—the current <b>definition</b> defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the new <b>definition</b> relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the Planck constant.|$|E

5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the <b>definition.</b> Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a completely different <b>definition,</b> including all theropods more closely related to Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent <b>definition</b> is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, when {{constructing}} {{systems of}} <b>definitions,</b> authors should use good practices that avoid producing viciously circular <b>definitions.</b> In many learner's dictionaries, circular <b>definitions</b> are greatly reduced by writing <b>definitions</b> using only {{the words in}} a constrained defining vocabulary.|$|R

5|$|All other {{commercial}} stations have 1080i high <b>definition</b> services which, since 2015, simulcast their main channel from standard <b>definition.</b> Prior to this, HD broadcasts are shown as a multichannel providing some differing content {{from the main}} SD channel. For instance, ABC Television has a 720p high <b>definition</b> service, which used to run as ABC-HD (simulcasting ABC1), but now operates as ABC News 24. Currently, SBS Television, the Nine Network and its regional station NBN Television, Network Ten, and WIN Television broadcast a 1080i high <b>definition</b> simulcast of their respective main channel. The Seven Network also has a relaunched HD channel, yet it isn't implemented as the primary channel's HD simulcast across all metropolitan stations to allow the games of the Australian Football League be broadcast in HD. Only the Melbourne and Adelaide stations received its channel on its purpose; Sydney, Perth and Brisbane stations, meanwhile, continues to air digital multichannel 7mate in high <b>definition</b> through 7HD, with the former downgraded to standard <b>definition</b> by default.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed <b>definition</b> of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current <b>definition.</b> Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the <b>definition</b> of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current <b>definition</b> of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
40|$|Text <b>definitions</b> for {{entities}} within bio-ontologies are {{a cornerstone}} {{of the effort to}} gain a consensus in understanding and usage of those ontologies. Writing these <b>definitions</b> is, however, a considerable effort and there is often a lag between specification of the entities in the ontology and the development of the text-based <b>definitions.</b> As well as these text <b>definitions,</b> there can also be logical descriptions and <b>definitions</b> of an ontology's entities. The goal of natural language generation (NLG) from ontologies is to take the logical description of entities and generate fluent natural language. We should be able to use NLG to automatically provide text-based <b>definitions</b> from an ontology that has logical descriptions of its entities and thus avoid the bottleneck of authoring these <b>definitions</b> by hand. In this paper we present some early work in using NLG to provide such text <b>definitions</b> for the Experimental factor Ontology (EFO). We present our results, discuss issues in generating text <b>definitions,</b> and highlight some future work. ...|$|R
