40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's {{thesis is}} to {{implement}} and evaluate a method for estimating the indicated engine torque. The method is developed by IAV GmbH, Fraunhofer-Institut and Audi AG. The determination of the indicated torque is based on high resolution engine speed measurements. The engine speed is measured with a hall sensor, which receives the signal from the transmitterwheel mounted on the crankshaft. A transmitterwheel compensation is done {{to compensate for the}} partition defects that arises in the production and thus enable a more precise calculation of the angular velocity. The crankshaft angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration are estimated and the helpvariable effective torque is calculated using these signals as input. Through a relationship between effective torque and the <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> is extracted from a map. The indicated torque is then calculated from the pressure. The method is validated with data from an engine test bed. Because of the low obtainable sample rate at the test bed, 4 MHz, quantisation errors arises at engine speeds over 1000 rpm. Therefore the model is validated for low engine speeds and the result is promising...|$|E

The creature of the solution consists in the realization the process of the combustion at the constant of the volume combustion chambers. It is realized with a piston stand during the period of combustion process. This permits on maximum pressure increasing and average <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure.</b> Advantages of this solution are self-evident.

The novel design of the engine is In order to reduce the thermal loads on the piston and the negative effects of thermal shocks, the novel construction based design was proposed, where during the time when the thermal loads are the most severe, the mechanical loads are isolated from the inertial loads and the inertial loads are non existent. Besides the reduction of the thermal loads additional gains in overall efficiency were obtained {{as the result of the}} combustion process with the piston stopped.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of comparative analysis of influence of different methods of TDC determination for the calculation errors of mean <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP). Lemag method based on zero point of first order derivative, used in PREMET pressure analyzers, was compared to the method based on a polynomial model of the compression process. Comparisons were made on the operating measurement data obtained on the low speed marine engine RTA 96 C which forms the main propulsion of the vessel and the medium speed engine MAN L 28 / 32 A. Measurements were made with onboard combustion PREMET analyzer. It was found that the method based on zero point of first order derivative can give the deviations of position of TDC in excess of 2 °CA which is caused by disturbances associated with the measurement of pressure and interference associated with the generation of the angular axis. These errors are related to the accuracy of the methods of determining of the first derivative and the availability of a sufficient range of pure compression after TDC. The best results of determining the TDC position was obtained from the original method based on a polynomial model of the compression process. It should be emphasized that the proposed method enables individual adjustment of TDC for each cylinder and can be used even when the combustion begins before TDC. The conducted research proved the existence of significant influence of indicator graph TDC location on the mean <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> calculation errors...|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} biological fuel {{which has}} higher density and viscosity {{as compared to}} mineral diesel. However, the simple approach to reduce the viscosity of biodiesel is to blend the mineral diesel with biodiesel. While the use of alcohol additives (ethanol and methanol) in the biodiesel blends fuel is to make lesser viscosity of the blend fuel. Different fuel properties produce different combustion characteristics of the blend fuels. Combustion studies on mineral diesel, B 20 (biodiesel 20 % + diesel 80 %) and B 20 blend fuels with alcohol additives (B 20 E 5 and B 20 M 5) were carried out using a Mitsubishi 4 D 68 multi-cylinder diesel engine. The combustion characteristics of an indirect injection diesel engine were examined by means of cyclic variation of peak cylinder pressure and mean <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP). In-cylinder pressure was investigated for the various pressure crank angle history in this study. Statistical analysis of combustion characteristics for diesel engine {{have been carried out}} on three different engine loads; 20 %, 40 % and 60 % at a constant engine speed of 2500 rpm using a combustion data of 200 cycles. The results show that at lower load, mineral diesel dominated the maximum peak cylinder pressure compared to other test fuels. However at higher load, B 20, B 20 E 5 and B 20 have surpassed mineral diesel for the maximum peak cylinder. It also remarked the variations of peak cylinder pressure of the test fuels influence most the mean <b>indicated</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP) at three different engine loads...|$|E
