40|$|The Westerschelde estuary in the South-West of the Netherlands {{displays}} two mean-dering {{flood and}} ebb channels separated by shoals. The system of flood, <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> and shoal between two channel crossings form a morphological cell. The {{stability of the}} serial cell system formed by the Westerschelde {{is important for the}} navigation route to the port of Antwerp. Wang and Winterwerp (2001) proposed a simplified model to predict the evolution of the flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> They suggest that the cell will re-main stable if dredging-dumping activities do not exceed a certain limit. Hibma et al. (2003) modelled successfully morphological cells with the process-based model Delft 3 D. This report investigates the stability of morphological cells in estuaries by comparing stability results of the process-based model Delft 3 D to the simplified model of Wang and Winterwerp (2001). Settings of Hibma et al. (2003) are used to generate an equilibrium state suitable for stability analysis. Sediment is then dumped continuously in the flood or <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> at various rates to assess stability. The cell geometry, flow and sediment transport char-acteristics are used to review the applicability of assumptions underlying the simplified model. Results of the two models are confronted to gain further insight into the cell behaviour. Results are applied to the Westerschelde estuary to discuss the safety of the current dredging-dumping strategy. The study shows that the behaviour of the cell can be described in terms of channel dominance. It suggests that the current dredging-dumping strategy in the Westerschelde is generally safe. It also highlights the need for more understanding and control of the outcome of a Delft 3 D simulation. ...|$|E
40|$|The fairway {{connecting}} Holwerd and Nes {{forms the}} main transport route between Friesland and Ameland (the Dutch Wadden Sea). It consists of several tidal channels that funnel {{the majority of}} the tidal currents propagating through the tidal basin. Over the past decades, several channel bends have expanded leading to a fairway length-increase of about 1 km, and the channel in front of Holwerd has become subject to sedimentation. Since 1990 this channel was dredged and the volume of dredged material has increased exponentially. A relation between dredging activities, channel migration and frequent delays of the ferry has been suggested. The main goal of this thesis is therefore to explain the difference in evolution between the non-natural (intervened) and natural tidal meanders in the Ameland basin. To achieve this goal, the evolution of geographic channel dimensions are analyzed by assessing bathymetric data and the outcome is linked to the physics by means of hydrodynamic modeling. Channels have been classified based on their locations and dimensions. Three meandering stages have been identified that describe the basic channel behavior. The first meandering stage is the developed meander, characterized by a clear sinusoidal shape and with flood chutes. In this stage, the depth at a cross-over is approximately two times smaller than at the channel section with a maximum curvature (the channel top), where the width profile is funnel shaped. The developed, variable meander has similar characteristics, but differs by a lower correlation in width and depth, and closer to the tidal watershed the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> location varies more in time. The third stage is the undeveloped meander, which is characterized by small and relatively straight channels, the absence of flood chutes, and a rather constant width- and depth-profile along the channel. In this study, the channels are evaluated that have similar meandering features and distance from the Ameland inlet as the dredged channels. In general, the examined channels showed a width reduction that dominates over the bed level decrease. An irregularity in the width and/or depth profile is an indicator {{for the development of a}} bifurcation or flood chute. Numerical modeling of the tidal currents revealed a correlation between the depth averaged velocity and the funnel shaped channel top. From the depth averaged velocities it is found that flow accelerates around the channel tops, where flood dominance prevails and flood chutes (are able to) develop. During ebb, a similar acceleration occurs towards the point of inflection, where ebb dominance prevails. Increasing meanders correspond to a shift towards ebb dominance in both natural and non-natural channels. By evaluating the secondary flow velocities along the channels, an eastward shift of the cross-over location is observed. Whether the shift corresponds to the channel migration, or that it strengthens the potential for channel splitting is not proven. However, an indication is found that a correlation exists between the distance between channel tops and the cross-over location shift. When the meanders develop, the distance between the tops increases, enabling a larger area over which the direction of the secondary flow can change. Furthermore, the orientation of the currents over the tidal flats and the angle under which they flow into the channel seems to be correlated. Also the importance of flood chutes to the meandering development is brought forward. The development of a chute increases the flow area and reduces the flow velocities in the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> adjacent to the flood chute, which thereafter becomes shallower. After a flood chute is established, and it obtained a more west-east orientation, the flood currents over the tidal flat are deflected towards the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> As a consequence flow velocities increase in the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel,</b> resulting in a westward migration of the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> Comparing the natural and non-natural channels, the meandering extent (average sinuosity) is approximately 10 % larger for the non-natural channels. This sinuosity also increases over time in the natural channels, but to a lesser extent. By dredging, the irregularities in width and depth are flattened out and the flow through the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> was maintained. This resulted in the non-natural development of the eastern Kikkertgat-bend and the stagnation of the flood chute development. Therefore it is concluded that a non-natural tidal meander in the Ameland basin is distinguished by developing meanders, where the flood chutes are not restricting the development of the meandering ebb channels.

This paper describes the diagnostic textures, sedimentary structures, and geometry of an ebb-tidal delta in a mesotidal setting at North Edisto Inlet, South Carolina. Bedforms and surface textures at North Edisto Inlet reflect ypical ebb-tidal delta circulation patterns. The main <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> {{is dominated by}} large ebb-oriented bedforms, and channel sediments become finer grained in the seaward irection. At the inlet throat, the coarsest available sediment forms a lag deposit. Marginal flood channels adjacent to the barrier islands are dominated by flood-oriented bedforms composed of medium-grained sand. Channel-margin l ear bars, flanked by bedforms with opposing orientations, develop where flood channels approach the main <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> The extensive swash platform is dominated by wave energy, which effectively sorts swash platform sediments. Ebb-tidal delta stratigraphy is dominated by sequences deposited by shifting tidal channels and by the migration of swash bars on the swash platform. Proximally, the ebb-tidal delta sequence is dominated by relatively thick tidal-channel deposits which fine upward and have a sharp, disconformable ower contact. Main ebb-channel deposits up to 20 m thick flank the active channel. These deposits are composed primarily of well-sorted, planar-bedded, fine-grained sand.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} the morphological integrityof the multiple channel system (MCS) of the Western Scheldt estuary. The tidal flats and surrounding <b>ebb</b> and flood <b>channels</b> form morphological cells, and the entire MCS can be schematized as a chain of such cells. The major <b>ebb</b> and flood <b>channels</b> have lost their one time function to feed and drain large tidal basins along the estuary. It is hypothesized that the MCS is now self-preserving {{as a result of the}} large gross sediment transport rates through these channels and the asymmetry of the channel system. From a stability analysis and computation of the gross sediment transports through the channels, the local and overall capacity of the estuary could be established to accommodate for the dumping of sediments dredged in the fairways of the estuary to safeguard navigation. This capacity compared favorably with the experience of the managing authorities. The scheme is used to evaluate a series of managing scenarios.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this study is}} to apply a {{two-dimensional}} (2 -D) coupled flow-wave-sediment modeling system to simulate the development and growth of idealized barrier island tidal inlets. The idealized systems are drawn from nine U. S. coastal inlets representing Pacific Coast, Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast geographical and climatological environments. A morphological factor is used to effectively model 100 years of inlet evolution and the resulting morphological state is gauged in terms of the driving hydrodynamic processes. Overall, the model performs within the range of established theoretically predicted inlet cross-sectional area. The model compares favorably to theoretical models of maximum inlet currents, which serve as a measure of inlet stability. Major morphological differences are linked to inlet geometry and tidal forcing. Narrower inlets develop channels that are more aligned with the inlet axis while wider inlets develop channels that appear as immature braided channel networks similar to tidal flats in regions with abundant sediment supply. Ebb shoals with strong tidal forcing extend further from shore and spread laterally, promoting multi-lobe development bisected by <b>ebb</b> shoal <b>channels.</b> <b>Ebb</b> shoals with moderate tidal forcing form crescent bars bracketing a single shore-normal channel.

40|$|Contemporary {{sediment}} transport, suspended sediment flux, {{rates of}} intertidal sedimentation, and Holocene sedimentation history are assessed for Hamford Water, a small meso-tidal inlet and saltmarsh embayment in Essex, UK. Sediment transport rates are calculated using semi-empirical equations; suspended sediment flux {{is computed by}} integration of suspended sediment concentration and velocity across the inlet throat; intertidal sedimentation rates are assessed from monitoring of discrete markers on saltmarsh and mudflat; and Holocene sedimentation is estimated from radiocarbon dating of buried organic layers, sampled using a vibrocorer. Results show a tidal regime typical of ebb-dominated inlets: moderate, ebb-dominant flow (== 1 m S·l) in the central <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> is matched by similar flood-dominant marginal channel flows. The sediment dynamics are not influenced by any fluvial input; there is negligible fresh water input. The net direction of sediment transport is predominantly ebb-orientated. Coarse sand transport pathways are circulatory and dependent on longshore drift. Sand (D = 0. 25 mm) enters at the margins and is expelled in the central <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> Negligible sand is transported further landward than the mouth; intertidal sedimentation relies mainly on levels of suspended sediment. Rates of intertidal sedimentation are spatially variable: tidal creek sedimentation is greater than saltmarsh, with a mean rate of 4. 2 mm yr"l.

40|$|Following the {{diversion}} of the Kaituna River from Maketū Estuary, out to sea at Te Tumu in 1956, the local community has continually voiced concerns over the estuary’s increased sedimentation rates and decreasing ecological health. These concerns led to the partial re-opening of Fords Cut in 1996. However, this has only resulted in a slight improvement in water quality, and no measurable reduction in sedimentation. The Bay of Plenty Regional Council is currently investigating {{a number of different}} re-diversion options to partially or fully restore the flow of the Kaituna River into Maketū Estuary, with the aim of restoring the estuary’s health. However, a consequence of re-diversion is the possible reduction in discharge through the inlet at Te Tumu. Significantly reducing the discharge would likely cause a large amount of sedimentation in, and around the cut, which could ultimately lead to the closure of the channel. In order to predict the geomorphic response to the proposed options of lowering the Ford’s Cut Culverts to RL - 1. 6 m (Option J), or reopening Papahikahawai Channel (Option N) a coupled 2 -dimensional, wave, hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was developed. Despite being unable to calibrate the hydrodynamic model due to the highly variable nature of the ADCP data collected, the coupled model was entirely calibrated through the sediment transport model. Comparisons between five transects extracted from a survey conducted in 2008 and from the model results of a simulation run over the same time period, showed predicted bed levels to match on average within 0. 35 m. Bed levels inside the river were predicted almost exactly, however, the error increased over the ebb delta, although, the same overall shape was still recreated. Through simulations of average and low river flows, and average and twice the average wave height conditions the morphological response of the Te Tumu Cut to various potential re-diversion options were found. Simulations of Option J showed that the majority of increased water entering the estuary through Ford’s Cut occurred during the incoming tide. This therefore increased the flood tidal volume and sediment transport capacity entering the cut, and caused the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> to become shorter by approximately 20 metres. Similarly, reopening Papahikahawai Channel with one-way flapgated culverts caused an increase in the flood tidal volume entering the Cut. However, unlike Option J there was no corresponding increase in sedimentation around the river mouth. This was attributed to dredging required to install the flapgates, resulting in a loss of sediment from the system and the inlet not yet reaching a new equilibrium. When Papahikahawai Channel is reopened without flapgated culverts both the peak flood tidal discharge and peak ebb discharge increased. The increased ebb flows resulted in a small increase in size of the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> through the delta, with the increase in size varying between the different river flow and wave condition simulations. The effect of adding parallel twin jetty structures to the Te Tumu Cut was also assessed at a preliminary level. Model simulations showed jetties spaced either 45 or 35 metres apart would aid in increasing the navigability through the river mouth. The 35 metre spaced jetties produced a more uniform and deeper channel compared to the 45 metre spaced option. However, further investigation is required to determine the ideal jetty configuration and long term effects on the surrounding coastlines...|$|E
40|$|Dredging and dumping in {{the lower}} Oka estuary (southeastern Bay of Biscay) during 1973 – 2003 have {{modified}} its pattern of sedimentary transport and morphology. An analysis of these activities through time and morphodynamic response of the estuarine system is presented. The relationships between both processes have been established. A Geographical Information System (GIS) {{has been used to}} create a temporal cartographic series of the changing patterns of estuarine sedimentary environments, identify the anthropogenic changes generated and observe the consequent responses of the estuarine system. The GIS {{has proven to be a}} very useful tool to monitor and evaluate the natural and human induced morphological evolution of the lower Oka estuary during the last 50 years. In the absence of dredging and dumping (1957 – 1973), the estuary had a distinct pattern of flood and ebb channels. Flood channels are deeper than ebb channels at their mouth, and progressively becomes shallower in the direction of the flooding tide. On the other hand, ebb channels form a seaward extension of the fluvial main channel. Both types of channels are prone to be evasive and braiding was common. During the period of study, the channels showed low natural variability relative to their location and spatial extension. The dredging and dumping carried out between 1973 and 2003 altered the natural flood/ebb channel distribution and modified sedimentary dynamics. Dredging caused the isolation of meanders of the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel,</b> the rapid infilling of the new dredged areas, and affected the flood channels thus producing the necessity for regular dredging, approximately every 5 years. Observation of the natural response of the estuarine system after the dredging and dumping makes it possible to state that, at present, the lower Oka estuary is not in a state of morphodynamic equilibrium and has a tendency to lose its capacity gradually. Dredging and dumping have accelerated this process and have increasingly unbalanced sedimentary regime...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the general}} aspects of oolitic depositional systems are well documented, seascape-scale (≈ 103 – 106 m 2) {{patterns}} of oolitic shoals {{and the details}} of processes acting on them are not well understood or quantified. To begin to fill this basic gap in understanding, this paper describes the morphology and hydrodynamics of Lily Bank, a Modern tidally dominated Bahamian ooid shoal. In this study, integrating remote sensing imagery with quantitative, geo-located bathymetrical, hydrological and granulometric data in a Geographic Information System documents geomorphic and sedimentological patterns and facilitates interpreting these patterns {{in the context of}} the processes operating in this system. The results of these analyses reveal that parabolic bars up to several kilometres in wavelength and several metres in height form a common morphologic motif, although there is considerable variation on that general theme. The seascape-scale configuration of bars and superimposed sedimentary structures is closely linked to spatial patterns of tidal movements, and includes the presence of mutually evasive flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>channels.</b> Sedimentologically, bars are neither homogenous nor random bodies; instead, granulometric parameters such as sorting and percentage mud vary systematically, as shaped by hydro-geomorphic controls. The best sorted, coarsest ooids are on bar crests, whereas the finest grains are found in the lower energy, deeper interior and flanking regions. In short, results clearly document hydrodynamic-bathymetrical influences on these ooid shoals and their granulometry, linkages akin to siliciclastic analogues. Sedimentological, hydrodynamic and geomorphic observations are consistent with a conceptual model for the formation of parabolic bars in which initial irregularities in non-parabolic bars are enhanced through their effect of focusing flow. Constricted flow leads to higher flow velocities, tidal flow velocity asymmetries, differential net sediment transport and growth of bathymetrical highs. This bathymetrical divergence creates separate paths for flood- and ebb-tides, facilitating emergence of better-developed parabolic forms. The resultant parabolic geometries and component bedforms appear to be either in dynamic equilibrium with both ebb- and flood-tide flows, or evolving toward that state. In exploring patterns and processes within carbonate shoals, this study illustrates some of the first documented insights on quantitative details of morphology and dynamics and in the links between geomorphic framework and grain-size and sorting in an oolitic carbonate system. Assuming a continuity of processes between ancient and modern, the insights from this shoal provide information on possible facies geometries and on the characteristics of grains and depositional porosity of analogous facies within ancient ooid shoals...|$|R
40|$|Situated in a monsoon-prone humid {{tropical}} region, Vietnam {{is affected}} by both oceanic and continental climates causing disasters to the country like riverine flooding and storm induced damage. The coastal districts of Vietnam have {{a population of about}} 18 million habitants, account for nearly one fourth of the total population of the country and locate about 50 % of the major towns and cities of Vietnam. Most of the people currently living in the coastal zone have their livelihood mainly relying on marine resources and they are also the most vulnerable to sea-related natural disasters, such as storms and floods. The natural disasters occurring in the coastal strip in the central part of Vietnam, caused by meteorological and oceanographical factors, are intensified by human interventions, like the damming of rivers for various purposes or the extensive deforestation for the creation of agricultural lands. With more than 1, 000 km of coastline, the central coast of Vietnam has more than sixty inlets and river mouths discharging into the South China Sea. These systems {{play a vital role in}} social-economic activities in the region. The steep rivers with abundant natural but temporally unevenly distributed flows make the low-lying coastal plains in the region prone to inundation by flooding, while the river is almost dry during the rest of the year. Specific topographical features and hydrological characteristics of the region produce a particularly high seasonal geomorphological variation of tidal inlets and river mouths, from narrowing, shoaling or entirely closing in the dry season to widening or breaching in the flood period. Frequent disasters set back development efforts in this poorest region of Vietnam and trap people in a cycle of poverty. Stabilising inlets at the central coast of Vietnam therefore is recognised as one of the priority tasks to mitigate potential risks caused by natural disasters, especially by floods and storms on low-lying coastal plains, and to promote a safe and stable condition for social-economic development in the region. To carry out this task, Vietnam needs both substantial financial and human resources, particularly knowledge and experience in coastal engineering, which is not trivial for a developing country. Additionally, strong seasonal variation of inlets and estuaries contribute to the complexity of problems and raise a necessity to implement a strategy for inlet and river mouth stabilisation under the constraints of a shortage of resources and knowledge. This thesis focuses on tidal inlets and estuaries in a wave-dominated, micro-tidal environment under the influence of episodic river flooding in the central coast of Vietnam. Natural behaviour and morphological stability of tidal inlets, which significantly interact with channel migration, entrance shoaling or closure have been identified and analysed based on field observations, historical satellite images, topographical maps and bathymetrical data. Based on the regional natural settings and hydrodynamic-morphological features, tidal inlets along the central coast of Vietnam can be divided into two main categories, namely, (1) barrier lagoon inlets and (2) wave dominated estuary inlets. A conceptual model for channel evolution and seasonal opening/closure of tidal inlets is proposed which describes the cyclic evolution of a typical tidal inlet at the central coast of Vietnam. In the conceptual model, the inlet entrance is forced both by the alongshore current which deposits sediment in the inlet channel and by the ebb tidal and river generated currents which erode sediment from the inlet channel. The interpretation of the Escoffier diagram is extended conceptually to explain the seasonal variation of both open equilibrium and closure. The variation is regulated by the seasonal variation of river flow and littoral drift. The conceptual model indicates the two major processes which dominate in the dry and the flood season leading to a deviation from the stable and unstable equilibrium points in the Escoffier diagram. This supports our understanding of seasonal variation of coastal inlets and estuaries in a region that experiences monsoons and storms causing a large fluctuation in littoral drift and ebb flow at the central coast of Vietnam. To get deeper insight into the underlying processes and cross-sectional stability of an schematised tidal inlet, regulated by tides only and regulated by both tides and waves, the process-based morphodynamic modelling system Delft- 3 D has been applied. In the model the tidal period, amplitude, basin area and initial inlet dimensions were changed systematically to create different hydrodynamic environments for inlet evolution. The model successfully reproduces the evolution of the channel flow area towards equilibrium for a tidal inlet and is able to describe the main behaviour of an inlet in response to a range of tide and wave conditions and geometries. The model results are in good agreement with empirical relationships (O'Brien, 1969; Jarrett, 1976) and the analytical solution (DiLorenzo, 1988) of Escoffier's diagram. To investigate location stability of inlet channels, seven experiments were designed to cover 3 different stability ranges (poor, fair to good stability). Reliable model results increase the understanding of the processes underlying the migration and closure of a tidal inlet. It is found that tidal inlet behaviour and location stability is linked to the number of channels on the ebb delta, the curvature if there is only one channel, type of bar on the ebb delta, the migration of the updrift barrier island, the distance between the inlet throat and the outer of margin of entrance bar. The model results demonstrate that the process-based model is able to reproduce the morphological evolution of a tidal inlet fairly consistent with the Bruun et al. (1978) empirical criteria for location stability. A typical example of a tidal inlet migrating due to oblique waves which includes features such as <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> migration, shifting and diminishing, and the bypassing of ebb shoals from the updrift to the downdrift barriers is investigated and discussed in detail. In another case inlet closure due to prolongation of the <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> and infilling with littoral-drift material in the foreshore is also observed. Furthermore, the model results indicate that Escoffier's closure curve is solely applicable to the stability of the channel gorge and thus insufficient to explain the closure of a tidal inlet due to littoral sand infilling into the main <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> In this study solutions are developed for the stabilisation of tidal inlets at the central coast of Vietnam. The solutions are based on the natural behaviour and evolution of two different types of tidal inlets in the region, namely 1) barrier lagoon inlets and 2) inlets formed at the mouth of wave dominated estuaries. For each type of inlet, both short-term and long-term solutions as well as structural and non-structural solutions are taken into account. The solution for the stabilisation of inlets at the central coast of Vietnam is to restrict and/or response to problems. To verify proposed solutions for the stabilisation of inlets along the central coast of Vietnam, process-based modelling is employed to simulate the evolution of a schematised tidal inlet that is stabilised by two jetties and by using river flow to flush the inlet channel. The simulation results show that the inlet after stabilisation by jetties remains open but the inlet channel is highly variable due to the accumulation and erosion of sediment in between two jetties. A sedimentation and erosion pattern is found which is related to the distance in between the two jetties and the strength of the tidal power. An optimum distance between the two jetties that takes into account the effectiveness of the jetties and the structural safety during a major flood event need further study. For inlets that are stabilised by using river flow to flush the inlet, a set of simulation scenarios in which different flushing discharges and flushing durations was designed. For a limited number of simulation scenarios, the model results show that with the same amount of flushing volume, the scenario that has a longer flushing duration and a sufficient flushing discharge is more efficient than the scenario that uses a high flushing discharge over a short duration. This means that the flushing efficiency is closely related to the flushing duration rather than the flushing discharge. Moreover, the flushing moment (at the beginning of the ebb phase or at the beginning of the flood phase) will also contribute to the efficiency of the solution but needs more study.

Historical change in the geomorphology, hydrodynamics, and surficial sediment of the tidal delta system of Tauranga Harbour are investigated with the general aim of analysing The general aims of this thesis are: firstly to analyse historical changes to inlet delta system geomorphology using historical hydrographic charts, secondly, to conduct hydrodynamic numerical modelling using historical bathymetries to access changes in peak spring flow and potential net tidal sediment transport, and thirdly, to analyse historical changes in surficial sediment and bedforms. Geomorphic change was investigated through plotting difference in bathymetry graphs and conducting cross sections taken from digisitied bathymetries obtained from historical hydrographic charts from 1852, 1879, 1901, 1927, 1954 and a modern bathymetry from 2006. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical modelling was conducted to investigate the changes in peak tidal current flow and potential net sediment transport between 1852 and 2006. Changes in surficial sediment patterns were determined through completing a side scan sonar survey with associated sediment samples for ground truthing of grain size and underwater videography to gather surficial shell coverage information. This was used to produce a surficial sediment coverage map which was compared to historical studies Major geomorphological findings include that the shipping channel appears to have induced minor change in the geomorphology of the FTD but such changes {{are similar to those}} identified in the historical bathymetries of 1852, 1879, 1901, 1927, 1954 prior to dredging. Significant changes have occurred on the ETD, with the majority of the ETD showing scour of 1 m while the terminal lobe has extended seawards. This is associated with historical (since 1852) narrowing of the inlet from Panepane Point to Mt Maunganui by ~ 900 m. Hydrodynamic numerical modelling has shown a significant increase in potential net tidal sediment transport in the Cutter Channel due to dredging, while the Maunganui Roads Channel shows a reduction of net potential tidal sediment transport that is associated with the dredging of this channel. The area surrounding Panepane Point undergoes significant increases and decreases in net potential tidal sediment transport both before and after dredging Investigation of the surficial sediment patterns over the FTD and ETD from sidescan sonar and bottom samples show that between 1983 and 2007 there has been a northwards extension of the area of major shell (greater than 50 %) converge in the main <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> as well as reduction in major shell converge in flood tidal delta ebb shield region.

40|$|In 1999, Flanders and The Netherlands {{agreed to}} set up a common {{strategy}} for managing the Scheldt River in its estuarine reach. In 2002, both parties signed a memorandum of understanding in which was defined a ‘Long Term Vision’ strategy and its objectives. One of these is the preservation in the Western Scheldt of a dynamic and complex flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> network, the so-called ‘multi-channel system’. The present trend, a continuation of past natural morphological evolutions combined with human interference (poldering, dredging and other river works) may jeopardise this objective. An expert team appointed by the Port of Antwerp proposed the idea of morphological dredging for curbing this negative trend, aiming at steering the estuarine morphology. In a first phase, sediment from dredging works could be used to reshape sandbars where needed. One case study is discussed in this paper, the aim being to reconstruct the eroded tip of a sandbar at a bifurcation so that the flood and ebb flows would be perseved, a condition to maintain the multi-channel system in the reach. The strategy would not only cut back on the ongoing degradation of the ecological and morphological values of the estuary, but it could also possibly help reducing the quantity of material to be dredged on the crossings by increasing the scouring or self-dredging capacity of the flow. A diffuser-type device was used to disperse the dredged material in a controlled way in shallow water along the sandbar edges. In 2002 - 2003, the new disposal strategy has been investigated by Flanders Hydraulics Research as a pilot project (Plaat van Walsoorden). The research programme combined three tools: field measurements, physical scale models and 3 D numerical models. The results of the research work confirmed the feasibility of the idea. However, the Port of Antwerp Experts concluded that a real life (in situ) disposal test was required to give final proof of the feasibility of this new disposal strategy. At the end of 2004, 500, 000 m³ of sand was disposed at the seaward tip of the shoal of Walsoorden using a diffuser. The main idea was to modify the morphology of this sandbar by disposing dredged material very precisely. The amount of 500, 000 m³ was chosen because it is large enough to see an effect of the disposed sediment, while it is small enough to be reversible if something would go wrong. To evaluate the success of this in situ test, an extensive monitoring programme was set up, including bathymetric surveys, ecological monitoring, sediment tracing tests and sediment transport measurements. After one year of monitoring the disposed sediments, it can be concluded that the experiment is very successful. The morphological monitoring showed that almost 80 % of the disposed sediments is still on the disposal location after one year. The ecological monitoring did not reveal any significant negativeimpact, neither in the intertidal areas, nor in the subtidal areas. This in situ test confirmed the feasibility of the proposed disposal strategy. An estimated volume of 4 to 5 million m³ could be disposed here to reach the proposed objectives, representing {{more than half of the}} volume dredged yearly in the Western Scheldt...|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sedimentation processes within Buffalo Bay, particularly within and adjacent to the Whitianga tidal inlet, in order to ascertain reasons for the shoaling at both the inlet, and the identified shallow zone around Pandora Rock. Comparison of historic bathymetries suggests the ebb delta and <b>ebb</b> discharge <b>channel</b> of the Whitianga tidal inlet are rapidly accreting and the <b>ebb</b> tidal discharge <b>channel</b> is gradually migrating northeast towards Whakapenui Point. Accretion rates of up to 25 cm y- 1 were calculated in the ebb delta and inlet discharge channel area between 1979 and 1995 and aerial photo comparisons suggest the ebb delta area had increased by 400 % between 1990 and 2002. Results of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport modelling suggest the rapid accretion in the ebb delta vicinity is likely to be caused by a combination of catchment estuary inputs, which are deposited on the ebb tide as the ebb flow decelerates over the ebb delta, and inputs that have been moved south along Buffalo Beach by flood currents and an eddy that forms landward of the ebb tidal discharge. Residual tidal velocities further suggest a deposition zone in the ebb delta vicinity resulting from opposing currents and the deceleration of currents. Hydrodynamic modelling results indicate the isolated shallow zone around Pandora rock appears to be caused by a transient eddy in the southern section of Buffalo Bay. The eddy is formed by the ebb tidal discharge from the inlet. Accretion probably occurs in the centre of the eddy which moves north as the ebb tide progresses. Results obtained from a current meter and sediment trap deployed in northern Buffalo Bay suggest suspended sediment transport is minimal in northern Buffalo Bay, only occurring with large wave activity. Results of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport modelling further demonstrate that this area experiences low flow velocities, and has little interaction with the rest of Buffalo Bay. The minimal sediment input to this area, combined with the occasional erosion of the seafloor, primarily by wave activity, is thought to have resulted in long term erosion of northwestern Buffalo Bay between 1938 and 1979. Although the beach and nearshore is eroding, it is likely the addition of sediment would act to stabilise this section of eroding beach. Renourishment material could be provided by the ebb delta, the southern tip of Buffalo Bay or the isolated sandbar northeast of the inlet entrance...|$|R
40|$|The Whitianga {{tidal inlet}} lies within Mercury Bay, on the {{northeast}} coast of New Zealand. The Whitianga Estuary harbours many recreational and commercial vessels. Terrestrial sediment inputs into the Whitianga Estuary catchment are high, due to the erodible tertiary sediments and the steep nature of the catchment, which suffers intense rainfall that results in high sediment influxes, much of which becomes deposited within the estuary. In recent years active shoals have appeared in Buffalo Bay and the inlet channel has noticeably shallowed, both of which inhibit {{the use of the}} inlet by boat traffic. The past and present bathymetry of Buffalo Bay is compared to establish changes in morphology and zones of accretion and erosion within Buffalo Bay. The outcomes of this research contribute to a larger research programme which aims to use numerical model simulations to identify sediment transport pathways and patterns within Buffalo Bay. This research will particularly provide information which can be used to calibrate a sediment transport model.

40|$|The Lai Giang inlet {{located in}} Binh Dinh {{province}} incorporates various {{features of the}} estuaries in the Central part of Vietnam. Belonging to the micro-tidal and wave-dominant coast and influenced by the monsoon regime, the inlet has a seasonal character. During the dry season, as the river flow diminishes, the wave action causes high level of sedimentation and closes up the inlet eventually. In flood season, as the river discharge is high, the channel is scoured and the inlet begins to migrate. The high sedimentation level and migration of the Lai Giang inlet has been a serious problem of Binh Dinh province for a long time, {{because it is the}} only exit for the floodway. It is an anchorage and also the connection between the sea and the aquaculture area of Hoai Nhon district. The high level of sedimentation at the entrance of the inlet prevents river flood from flowing smoothly, thus leading to overflow in lowlands and navigation issues. In recent decades, the exploitation and protection of Lai Giang area have been studied in various forms of scientific researches and projects by different scientists and local professional agencies. However, the studies have only focused on hydraulics, hydrology and on adjusting the flow of Lai Giang river. There are only general and basic studies on the entrance of the inlet. The main objective of this research is to understand the morphological behaviour of Lai Giang inlet. The specific interest is focused on the main factors which are the tidal characteristic, the wave climate and the river flow during the flood season, and the interaction between all these factors that influence the morphological changes. The study starts with the collecting and analysing all the documentations {{to come up with a}} conceptual model of the Lai Giang inlet to explain how the sedimentation and the migration processes happen. Then, the Delft 3 D modelling software, which can model (tidal) flow, waves and sediment transport, has been applied to confirm the hypothesis and gain further knowledge. According to the data analysis, the conceptual model as well as the descriptive and quantitative result of the model, we can make the following main conclusions: 1. The wave climate in this area has seasonal characteristic and is dominated by two main directions; Northeast and Southeast in winter and summer monsoon, respectively. 2. During the summer monsoon, the longshore sediment transport moves towards the north, bypasses the entrance of the inlet and gradually builds up on the down-drift spit due to the Southeast Wave. 3. During winter monsoon, the Northeast wave intensifies the southward longshore sediment transport leading to the large amount of sedimentation in front of the inlet. At the same time, the significant river flow flushes away the sediment deposits at the main <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> located nearer to the up-drift spit. Thus the sedimentation could not take place at the up-drift spit. The sediment displacement at the up-drift and down-drift spit made the inlet migrate to the north gradually. Finally, the possibility to stabilize the inlet is discussed to give the optimum solution for this area.

40|$|In 1999, Flanders and the Netherlands {{agreed to}} set up a common {{strategy}} for managing the Scheldt estuary. In 2002, both parties signed a memorandum of understanding in which was defined a “Long Term Vision” strategy and its objectives. One of these is the preservation in the Western Scheldt of a dynamic flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>channel</b> network, the so-called “multi-channel system”. The present trend, a continuation of past natural morphological evolutions combined with human interference (land reclamation and polder building, dredging and other river works) may jeopardise this objective. An expert team appointed by the Antwerp Port Authority stated the need for morphological management, aiming at steering the estuarine morphology. In a first phase, sediment from dredging works could be used to reshape eroded sandbars where needed, in order for the flood and ebb flows to continue maintaining the multiple channels. Since 2002, this new disposal strategy is being investigated as a pilot project on the Walsoorden sandbar in the Western Scheldt. An extended research was conducted in 2002 and 2003, combining several tools: desk studies with maps on the historical morphological changes, field measurements, physical scale model tests and numerical models. As a result of the research work executed at Flanders Hydraulics Research, it was concluded that none of the results contradicted the feasibility of the new disposal strategy at the Walsoorden sandbar, although final judgement would only be possible after the execution of an in situ disposal test. At the end of 2004, 500. 000 m 3 of sand was disposed during one month with a diffuser in relatively shallow water at the seaward end of the Walsoorden sandbar. The experiment was thoroughly monitored, morphological as well as ecological. One year after the execution of the in situ disposal test, it was concluded that from morphological viewpoint the test was a success. The ecological monitoring revealed no significant negative changes in trends due to the disposal test. In 2006 a new disposal test was executed, using the traditional dumping (“clapping”) technique with hopper dredgers. Due to practical limitations, the disposal (again 500. 000 m 3) was spread over 3 months. The new experiment was again thoroughly monitored. Due to larger currents in the disposal area, a higher percentage of the material was transported towards the Walsoorden sandbar. This morphological evolution was seen as positive within the objectives of the disposal strategy. From ecological viewpoint again no significant negative changes in trends have been identified. Due to the success of both in situ tests, the strategy of morphological disposal will be included in the dredging and disposal operations for the future deepening of the navigation channel. This new disposal strategy will introduce benefits for both the economy (deepening and maintenance of the fairway) and the ecology (keeping the sediment in the estuary, creating new valuable areas without endangering the multiple channel system). Therefore further research work has been carried out in 2007 - 2008 on how to embed this strategy in the future dredging and disposal policy and the possible use of the strategy on other locations. During execution (planned to start in 2009) an intensive monitoring programme will monitor the morphological and ecological effects of the disposed sediments, allowing adjusting the strategy if necessary. However, this is only part of a morphological management of the estuary, which would also have to include morphological dredging and modifying the hard bordering at some locations...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{behaviour}} of the tide-dominated Western Scheldt is {{in general}} well known. Its multichannel-system consists of ebb and flood channels, separated by intertidal areas; the tidal flats. The estuary shows a dynamic behaviour of erosion and sedimentation of the tidal flats. A large flow slide {{occurred at the}} tidal flat of Walsoorden in July 2014. A flow slide occurs when the slope is sufficient steep and a trigger starts the process of liquefaction or breaching. In {{a few hours a}} huge amount of sediment slides away, causing loss of surface and endangering safety. During this flow slide approximately 800, 000 m 3 of sediment flowed to the navigation channel, leaving a large gap in the tidal flat. This flow slide {{is one of the largest}} known in this part of the Western Scheldt. A measurement campaign was initiated to measure the bathymetry around the tidal flat, starting a few months before the flow slide. After the event monthly measurements were taken to monitor the development of the area. Dunes were formed on top of the accumulation of sediment, which travelled in flood (eastern) direction. A large part of the sediment accumulation was transported as bed load in flood direction, which is unexpected since the Zuidergat channel is known as an <b>ebb</b> <b>channel.</b> The sediment volume in the channel is decreasing, suggesting suspended load transport. The channel dominance is determined based on three characteristics: the water level, velocities and sediment transport. Based on water level data flood dominant behaviour is expected, while velocity and sediment transport data result in ebb dominance. Based on the bathymetry measurements, the volume changes in the channel and in the gap were determined. Those showed an exponential change in time. The erosion rate in the channel was faster than the sedimentation rate in the gap. The recovery time of the system is estimated through extrapolation of this data. The recovery time for the channel is thus shorter than the recovery time for the gap, 9 months and 1. 5 to 2 years respectively. An existing Delft 3 D model schematisation of the Western Scheldt was used to calculate the morphological development. The model was setup around the tidal flat of Walsoorden. The boundary conditions were generated by a model schematization which describes the full Scheldt estuary; the validation was performed with observations of water level and velocity along the tidal flat. The morphological changes determined by the model are different from the bathymetric changes found in the measurements. In the model the sediment accretion smoothens out; the sediment is deposited on the sides of the accumulation. Most of the sediment from the channel is transported in ebb direction. The model shows almost no sedimentation in the gap, which is contradictive with the measurements. The sensitivity of the model was tested to investigate the differences between the observations and the model. A varying sediment diameter in the model had effect on the amount of transported sediment only, not on the residual direction. The used model is a 2 DH model, neglecting the secondary circulations. The sensitivity of these processes was tested using a 3 D model. From this model it was found that the secondary circulations were not of significant importance concerning the areal development after the flow slide. Finally, a non-cohesive sediment fraction was implemented in the model. This showed sedimentation in the gap. Therefore, it is suggested that the sediment settling in the gap is a combination of cohesive and non-cohesive sediment, which is supported by the observations.

40|$|After {{decades of}} coastal erosion in the north-west {{area of the}} Island of Texel, the shore-normal `Eierlandse Dam` had been built in 1995. The dam, {{situated}} in the outer delta of the Eierlandse Gat tidal inlet, resulted in a remarkable short-term morphological development of the adjacent coast. Four years following completion of the dam, large sedimentation rates were measured {{on both sides of}} the dam. On the updrift (south) side, sedimentation was predicted as a result of the blocked alongshore sediment transport. However, on the downdrift (north) side of the dam, no sedimentation was predicted. Today, almost two decades later, it remains unclear which processes contributed to the sediment accumulation on the north side of the dam. The increased functionalities and capabilities of the present-day modelling software enable a re-evaluation of the morphological processes around the dam in particular, and gain insights in the complex short-term morphodynamics in this area. To capture the driving mechanism(s) of the net sediment transport towards the northern area of the Eierlandse dam, the state-of-the-art process-based computational model Delft 3 D is applied. To investigate the influence of various conditions and processes on the morphological development around the dam, simulations are performed with various boundary conditions, model processes and formulations. After calibration of the model, one-year morphological predictions show large similarities with the observed bed level development at both sides of the dam. The ebb tidal currents seem responsible for the large amounts of sedimentation at the north side of the dam, predominantly during spring tides when flow velocities and tidal excursion increase. The <b>ebb</b> tidal <b>channel</b> `Robbengat` is located along the northern tip of the Island of Texel and curves from the inlet around the Eierlandse dam. The Robbengat channel has been eroding by strong ebb tidal currents since 1985. The eroded sediments of the channel are transported by the flow towards the outer delta. Before the channel curves, the flow is partly deflected towards the northern area of the Eierlandse dam. The flow enters a shallow area and decelerates, resulting in deposition of sediment. This conclusion rejects the conclusions drawn by previous studies regarding the same area, where complex hydrodynamics such as eddy forming and spiral flow in the channel bend were drawn as possible causes of the sedimentation.

40|$|Dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{of short}} tidal systems with ebb deltas, inlets, and basins is poorly understood. Observations suggest {{the possibility of}} equilibrium with sediment import balancing export, while individual channels and shoals at the local scale remain dynamic. Our objectives are to ascertain (1) whether tidal systems under entirely steady forcing can attain this state and (2) under what conditions cyclic channel-shoal migration occurs. We present experiments of tidal systems developing from an initial breach in the coast. We periodically tilted the entire flume to obtain reversing tidal currents and sediment transports. The surface area of the back-barrier basin with an inlet channel with erodible boundaries continued to enlarge while sediment mobility decreased. Experiments with fixed inlet boundaries remained smaller and much more dynamic and had cyclically migrating <b>ebb</b> and flood <b>channels.</b> The same cyclicity with {{a period of about}} 80 tides is observed in shifting dominance of the two channels of the inlet and in the shifting channels in the basin. Experiments with stepwise sea level rises resulted in more rapid channel and bar shifting, increased channel dimensions and basin size. We conclude that cyclic migration of channels is coupled between inlet and basin but the ebb delta did not show such cyclicity. Furthermore, tidal basins with erodible boundaries slowly enlarge by margin erosion toward a system where sediment mobility is at the threshold for motion, as in braided gravel-bed rivers. Consequently, in nature dimensions of tidal systems are partly determined by naturally formed cohesive and vegetated margins and geological context...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploratory}} {{research into the}} maintenance of the Slijkgat, by analysing the morphological behaviour of the Slijkgat and the Haringvliet. The Slijkgat is the approach channel for the fishery harbour of Stellendam. The delta area west of the Haringvliet Dam started to accrete after the construction of the dam around 1970, therefore maintenance dredging became necessary. Recently it was decided to deepen the channel over a width of 100 m from - 5. 00 NAP to - 5. 50 NAP and to maintain this depth. Based on the Stakeholder Agreement for Maasvlakte 2 the municipality of Rotterdam will become responsible for this deepening and maintenance. The responsibility for the implementation is transferred to Project Organisation Maasvlakte 2 of the Port of Rotterdam. This study investigates the possibilities for maintaining the Slijkgat; the possible maintenance scenarios are based on future morphological developments. These future developments are derived from a historical morphological analysis. This analysis is based on bed level measurements and Delft 3 D Flow calculations. Data sets of 1986, 1992, 1998 and 2003 were used and these data were compared. From this analysis it can be concluded that the sediment volume in the total study area is approximately stable, but that the sediment volume is shifted within the area. The Inner Area has become shallower, while the Outer Area has eroded. The Delft 3 D Flow calculations show that the amount of water that is discharged through the Slijkgat has increased in the period 1986 - 2003. In the future the Slijkgat will most likely remain open as a result of river discharges. The dimensions of the cross-sectional area of the Slijkgat depend on these high river discharges, since these move sediment from the channel. As a result the Slijkgat is in a dynamic equilibrium since these high river discharges only occur a few times per year. The rest of the year the Slijkgat is accreting. The past ten years <b>ebb</b> and flood <b>channels</b> have developed in the Slijkgat. As a result the bed level in the Slijkgat is varying. Although the dimensions of the cross-sections increase in general due to the increase of tidal volume, some locations will remain around - 4. 5 to - 5 m NAP due to <b>ebb</b> and flood <b>channels.</b> To utilise the system dynamics, the dependency of the cross-sections on river discharge is used as base for the scenarios. During high river discharge current velocities are high in the Slijkgat and sediment is transported, which makes that the channel dimensions increase. This principle is used for the formulation of different scenarios, which are all evaluated based on the increase of current velocities in the Slijkgat. In general it can be concluded that velocities in the Slijkgat can increase by opening the sluices during a shorter period. For the shallow areas near the sluices these effects are significant. Where the Slijkgat meets the Outer Area velocities decrease and the effects of the change in discharge regime is less noticeable. A permanent change in closing policy can reduce the maintenance activities at the locations closest to the sluices. A new closing policy that will be implemented is 'de Kier'; the sluices will opened during high water and salt water will enter the fresh water reservoir. If this new policy is implemented current velocities will increase in the Slijkgat, since the total amount of water will increase. Furthermore discharging though only the southern or the northern sluices does not make a difference for the current velocities. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Tidal sand {{bars and}} tidal sand ridges are {{extensively}} {{developed in the}} macrotidal Gulf of Khambhat, offshore western India. The inner and outer regions of the gulf are characterised by the development distinct tidal sand bodies with discrete geometries and dimensions. The outer gulf ridges are long, narrow, curvilinear and several metres high (similar to 20 m). They are asymmetric in cross-section and migratory in nature, forming 'ribbon' like sand bodies separated by tidal channels. Active dunes on these ridges indicate the presence of sand and their orientation parallel to palaeo-shorelines supports a tidal origin. In contrast to the outer gulf tidal sand ridges, sand bars associated with macrotidal estuaries flanking the Gulf of Khambhat typically have an elongate to diamond shape and are only hundreds of metres in width and a few kilometres length. These tidal sand bars occur in the estuary mouths and within the tidally influenced fluvial reaches of the rivers flowing into the gulf. The height of these sand bars is in the range similar to 1 - 3 m. Due to high tidal ranges and bi-directional flow the sand bars do not develop significant height and are formed between the mutually evasive <b>ebb</b> and flow <b>channels.</b> Their bi-directional foresets {{and the presence of}} abundant mud drapes associated with the dunes within in-channel sand bars indicate a tidal origin. The Gulf of Khambhat acquired the present configuration in the last few thousand years since the Pleistocene sea-level lowstand (last glacial maximum, similar to 18 Ka) when the entire continental shelf was subaerially exposed and rivers down-cut into the coastal plain. With increasing sea-level rise, the exposed shelf was drowned, flooding parts of the Modern western Indian peninsula, and large tidal sand ridges formed in the outer gulf. After the fall of sea-level at 2 ka the gulf acquired the Modern configuration with multiple estuaries on both coastlines, rivers supplied the embayment with sandy sediment, and tidal sand bars formed in the Modern estuaries. Quantitative data gathered from the Modern Gulf of Khambhat indicates that for the P 50 case, a vertical drill hole will encounter tidal sand bodies (ridges and bars combined) of approximate dimensions 1700 m long, 470 m wide and 1. 5 m high, with a spacing of 400 m. In subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs, where data is sparse and only limited amount of core is available, this quantitative dataset can be useful to constrain subsurface geocellular models. Also, the overall geometry, distribution and aspect ratio of the tidal sand ridges and tidal sand bars can be used to identify ancient counterparts through seismic geomorphology or in core.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Intertidal flats are {{important}} coastal margin environments linking the terrestrial and marine ecosystems. This dissertation studies the thermodynamic processes of tidal flats over tidal, fortnightly, and seasonal timescales through in situ field observations, remotely sensed measurements, and a numerical model of cross-flat tidal heat and mass transport. First, seasonal variation of sediment-water heat exchange is modeled at both sites using a numerical cross-shore model of tidal flat heat and mass fluxes. The model uses a convective {{heat transfer coefficient}} to evaluate sediment-water heat fluxes. The model accurately predicts water and sediment temperatures observed at both sites and estimates that exchange of heat between the sediment and water can be as great as 20 % of the incoming forcing solar shortwave radiation. Seasonal variations in the net heat flux show that the tidal flats act as a net source of heat {{during the summer months}} and a net sink during the winter. This pattern is explained by the phasing of the exposure periods and daytime solar radiation whereby maximum flat exposure during the summer occurs during the daytime whereas flat exposure during the winter months occurs at night allowing significant cooling of the flats. The model is most sensitive to the choice of thermal conductivity indicating the importance of accurately determining tidal flat sediment thermal properties. Next, tidal time-scales are examined by focusing on heating at {{the leading edge of the}} flooding front. Field observations indicate that during the summer under clear sky conditions, the leading edge of the flood front is nearly 5 °C warmer than the sediment it inundates. Model results show that this process is related to the absorption of solar radiation in a thin film of water occurring at the front edge. This result only occurs under conditions where the light extinction coefficient is large enough to fully absorb all shortwave radiation in the water column and prevent its transmission to the sediment bed and is consistent with the qualitative observations of high turbidity at the leading edge of the front. Finally, tidal time-scale processes on the ebb tide are studied using novel remote sensing technique to determine surface fluxes in an incised intertidal <b>channel.</b> <b>Ebb</b> flows through incised channels off the flat continue throughout the low tide period and are difficult to measure as water depths are below 10 cm. A infrared imaging technique is used to determine surface velocities during these low depth periods. Flows off the flats exhibit two distinct dynamic regimes: ebb-tide flow and post-ebb discharge. Ebb-tidal flow occurs during the receding tide when downstream water elevations control the upstream flow velocities (M 1 profiles). The post-ebb discharge continues throughout the low tide period and obeys uniform open-channel flow dynamics. Calculations of total volume fluxes and the use of the tidal heat flux model support the hypothesis that remnant water from the flat surface is the source of these discharges...|$|R

The oldest unit is the Zemorrian to early Saucesian Smuggler Cove formation, a bathyal tuffaceous mudstone with some thin- to thick-bedded tuff layers deposited on the middle to upper continental slope {{during a period of}} explosive silicic volcanism in the Western Cascade arc. Uppermost Smuggler Cove strata are coarser grained, grading upward to arkosic turbidite sandstone and mudstone and thick bloturbated silty sandstone deposited on the outer shelf during marine regression. This regression heralded the progradation of the overlying shallow-marine Bewley Creek formation (informal) depositional system. The Bewley Creek formation (informal) is proposed in this study for a sequence of pumiceous, volcaniclastic-rich lower Miocene feldspathic litharenites and lithic arkoses deposited during the Pillarlan-stage near the mouth of an ancestral Columbia River. The unit grades from bioturbated silty sandstone to fine-grained hummocky cross-stratified and coarser grained channelized sandstones deposited within, or peripheral to a wave-dominated delta or <b>ebb</b> tidal-delta <b>channel</b> complex. Progradatlon of the Bewley Creek formation may have been caused, in part, by increased volcaniclastic sedimentation attending a pulse of explosive volcanism in the adjacent Western Cascade arc. Reduced volcanic activity, possibly coupled with basin subsidence or eustatic sea level rise, resulted in deposition of mudstones of the Sutton Creek member (informal; proposed) of the Nye Mudstone. The Saucesian Sutton Creek member consists of bathyal, laminated, carbonaceous, and moderately tuffaceous mudstone deposited in an upper continental slope basin. The upper part of the unit contains common lithic to arkosic turbidite sandstone interbeds within nested channel-fill deposits. These strata represent a channelized shelf-slope break environment adjacent to the shallow-marine Angora Peak member of the Astoria Formation depositlonal system. Subsequent marine regression resulted in progradation of the Pillarian- to Newportian-stage arkosic-micaceous sandstone-rich Angora Peak member into the Tillamook embayment. Grainsize analysis, sandstone petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and heavy mineral analyses suggest these lower to middle Miocene mollusk-bearing, fine- to medium-grained sandstones were predominantly deposited near the mouth of an ancestral Columbia River. They accumulated on a high-energy Inner shelf within or down drift of a wave-dominated delta or ebb-tidal delta complex, evidenced by paleocurrent analyses, hummocky cross-stratification and trough cross-stratified submarine channel-fill sequences. The Angora Peak member disconformably overlies Zemorrian mudstones of the Smuggler Cove formation at Cape Kiwanda suggesting local uplift and erosion in that area, followed by Newportian stage transgression in the Tillamook embayment. Exotic cobbles and boulders of two mica granite and sedimentary quartzite at Cape Kiwanda were probably derived from the Idaho Batholith and Precambrian sandstone terrains in Montana, transported via an ancestral Columbia River and longshore current to the shelf possibly bound within tree root bundles. The Netarts Bay member (informal) of the Astoria Formation Is proposed In this study for a late Sauceslan package of fine-grained to pebbly amalgamated and interbedded turbidite, grainflow, and fluldized flow friable thick-bedded lithic arkoses. These massive sandstones contain large penecontemporaneously emplaced channel wall-blocks and naller slltstone rip-ups. These lower to middle Miocene strata were deposited in a submarine canyon head and channel complex offshore of the shallow-marine Angora Peak member depositlonal system. Netarts Bay strata cut Into the underlying Angora Peak shelf strata, and cut and Interfinger with bathyal slope mudstones of the Cannon Beach member of the Astoria Formation. The overlying lower Cannon Beach member Is composed of laminated bathyal mudstones with rare turbidite sandstone interbeds deposited in a coarse clastic-starved slope environment. Upper Cannon Beach member strata In the Tillamook area are characterized by micaceous arkosic and lithic arkosic turbidite sandstones that underlie and occur within nested channel-fill sequences. Bloturbated carbonaceous cross-bedded sandstone In the upper Cannon Beach member records shallowing of the Tillamook embayment to a channelized upper slope to shelf environment. The Tillamook embayment was uplifted and dissected prior to the arrival of six to ten Intracanyon subaerial and submarine lava flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. These middle Miocene flows, delineatedon the basis of geochemical composition and magnetic polarity, Include (in stratigraphic order) the Grouse Creek (R 2 low MgO-low T 102), Winterwater (N 2 low MgO-low Ti 02), and Sentinel Bluffs (high MgO) units of the Grande Ronde Basalt, and the Ginkgo unit of the Frenchman Springs member of the Wanapum Basalt. Orientation of Grande Ponde Basalt foreset-bedded pillow palagonite complexes and lava delta sequences indicate that these Columbia River Basalt units flowed westward into the Tillainook embayment, possibly through a saddle in the ancestral Oregon Coast Range. Marine transgression and deposition of hummocky cross-stratified arkosic marine strata of the Sandstone of Whale Cove followed emplacement of the last Grande Ronde flows. This was succeeded by a regression, as Indicated by the overlying subaerial plagioclase-phyric Ginkgo Unit flow of the Frenchman Springs Basalt. Locally, Winterwater and Sentinel Bluffs unit basalt occur as brecciated peperitic sills and dikes. These were emplaced through the process of "auto-invasion" when dense lava injected downward Into semi-lithifled Tertiary strata under the influence of both a pressure head augmented by flashing steam, and steam blasting. The thesis area is crossed by a complex network of high-angle northwest- and northeast-tending normal and reverse faults, and both low and high-angle east-trending reverse and thrust faults. These faults may have developed through a north-south compressional tectonic regime, a dextral shear couple, or a combination of these two tectonic regimes. Many faults cut Columbia River Basalt units and are thus middle Miocene or younger in age. Tertiary strata including the Columbia River Basalts are also folded within a broad westward-plunging syncline which suggests a middle Miocene or younger compressional event. Source rock analyses indicate that the mudstones of the Cannon Beach member, Sutton Creek member, and Smuggler Cove formation contain type III kerogen capable of generating natural gas only. Although these rocks have thermally innature vitrinite reflectance values, they contain sufficiently high total organic carbon content to be considered potential lean source rocks. Arkosic sandstones of the Angora Peak and Netarts Bay members have fair to good reservoir rock characteristics, and may represent reservoirs offshore for matured hydrocarbons generated from deeply buried source rocks...|$|R
