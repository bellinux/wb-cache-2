40|$|Abstract—Mechanical {{properties}} are {{the attributes of}} a metal to withstand several forces and tensions. Specifically, ultimate tensile strength is the force a material can resist until it breaks. The only way to examine this mechanical property is the employment of <b>destructive</b> <b>inspections</b> that renders the casting invalid with the subsequent cost increment. In a previous work we showed that modelling the foundry process as a probabilistic constellation of interrelated variables allows Bayesian networks to infer causal relationships. In other words, they may guess {{the value of a}} variable (for instance, the value of ultimate tensile strength). Against this background, we present here the first ultimate tensile strength prediction system that, upon the basis of a Bayesian network, is able to foresee the values of this property in order to correct it before the casting is made. Further, we have tested the accuracy and error rate of the system with data of a real foundry. I...|$|R
40|$|Non <b>Destructive</b> <b>Inspections</b> (NDI) plays a {{vital role}} in {{aircraft}} industry as it determines the structural integrity of aircraft surface and material characterization. The existing NDI methods are time consuming, we propose a new NDI approach using Digital Image Processing that has the potential to substantially decrease the inspection time. Automatic Marking of cracks have been achieved through application of Thresholding, Gabor Filter and Non Subsampled Contourlet transform. For a novel method of NDI, the aircraft imagery is analyzed by three methods i. e Neural Networks, Contourlet Transform (CT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). With the help of Contourlet Transform the two dimensional (2 -D) spectrum is divided into fine slices, using iterated directional filterbanks. Next, directional energy components for each block of the decomposed subband outputs are computed. These energy values are used to distinguish between the crack and scratch images using the Dot Product classifier. In next approach, the air-craft imagery is decomposed into high and low frequency components using DCT and the first order moment is determined to form feature vectors. A correlation based approach is then used for distinction between crack and scratch surfaces. A comparative examination between the tw...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{dedicated}} to macroscopic-like defect localization in composite materials {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed method is based on non intrusive measurements of the sample temperature resulting from a local periodic low energy heating. In such an approach, the low temperature increases of the investigated material avoid damages which can occur with usual flash techniques. Since thermal waves propagation is modified due to the heterogeneity induced by the defect, analysis of both modulus and phase lag spatial distributions provides relevant knowledge. Up to now, macroscopic-like defect detection based on local periodic heating has not been widely investigated. Thus, differences between the global approach and the local approach have to be pointed out in order to verify the local method’s attractiveness. A mathematical model based on complex temperature is developed and provides a relevant predictive tool. In several configurations interest of local periodic heating is highlighted. For example, while several defects {{are included in the}} sample, the method capability to distinguish one from each other is shown considering a scanning approach. In order to validate these results, an experimental device has been developed. Several non <b>destructive</b> <b>inspections</b> are performed and defect detection is achieved using an infra-red camera providing observations of the sample surface. ...|$|R

Virtual Prototyping/Manufacturing {{simulation}} codes (systems), {{dedicated to}} foundry industry, include the models {{based on the}} physical rules and on corresponding equations, as well as are based on empirical relationships from research works in real conditions, are applied in the practice. The access of foundryman–technologist (as user) into internal structure of these algorithms, calculated by numerical way, is usually impossible. During preparatory stage (pre–processing) he defines technological geometry of casting– mould system and selects the necessary parameters from material and technological database, which quality will be important in simulating calculations. But although the best set of input data, the user is totally responsible for correct execution of this stage, without guarantee that the virtual result of simulation, which is the ground for quality prognosis of casting, will be optimal. Among the working algorithms of systems mentioned above and responsible also for quality of prognosis, the algorithm to calculate the intensity and location of shrinkage discontinuities is very important. These discontinuities are the crucial shortcoming, that foudryman has to struggle {{with the aid of}} adequate technological procedures.
