5000|$|A {{significant}} portion of the McCoy AFB base facilities were transferred to the United States Navy between 1974 and 1975, primarily base <b>housing,</b> <b>base</b> exchange, commissary, medical clinic, base chapel, and morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities, becoming the Naval Training Center Orlando McCoy Annex. From 1975 to 1999, the Annex supported various tenant command activities at the Annex that included the Army Reserve aviation units, other units of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Naval Reserve, U.S. Army Reserve, Florida Army National Guard, and the U.S. Air Force Liaison Office of the Florida Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Administrative support and housing area for both McCoy Annex activities and primary command and tenant command activities at the nearby Naval Training Center Orlando were also maintained.|$|E
5000|$|Historic Dodgertown was {{originally}} {{built as a}} Navy <b>housing</b> <b>base</b> {{for all of the}} members of the Navy and Marines that trained at the US Naval Air Station during World War II that was located directly across the street. When Branch Rickey began looking for a permanent spring training site in 1948 he was introduced to a large area of land in Vero Beach, Florida by Bud Holman, a local businessman, as the perfect place to host a fully contained training camp for the Major League club as well as the other 26 minor league teams. The Dodgers and the city of Vero Beach ended up coming to an initial five-year lease agreement that included the naming of the property as [...] "Dodger Town". A stadium was completed in 1953.|$|E
50|$|On 1 June 1953 Ramstein Air Station was opened. Ramstein was the {{location}} of headquarters, Twelfth Air Force, and supported family <b>housing,</b> <b>base</b> exchange, commissary, dependents' schools and other administrative offices for the WAFs (Women's Air Force). The barracks that were built at Ramstein AS were used to house WAFs and single women that worked as U.S. Government Employees at both Ramstein AS and Landstuhl AB. On 27 April 1953, Headquarters, Twelfth Air Force was activated on Ramstein Air Base, having moved from its joint facilities with HQ USAFE at Wiesbaden AB. What was not generally known at the time, and not made public until {{after the end of}} the Cold War in 1993, was the desire to have HQ Twelfth Air Force in close proximity to the Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC) - Kindsbach, AKA 'Kindsbach Cave' - the site of NATO's underground combat operations center.|$|E

50|$|Two {{immiscible}} liquids {{of different}} densities are fed to the separate inlets and are rapidly mixed in the annular {{space between the}} spinning rotor and stationary housing. The mixed phases are directed {{toward the center of}} the rotor by radial vanes in the <b>housing</b> <b>base.</b> As the liquids enter the central opening of the rotor, they are accelerated toward the wall. The mixed phases are rapidly accelerated to rotor speed and separation begins as the liquids are displaced upward. A system of weirs at the top of the rotor allow each phase to exit the rotor where it lands in a collector ring and exits the stage. Flow from between stages is by gravity with no need for inter-stage pumps. The centrifugal contactors thus acts as a mixer, centrifuge and pump. Centrifugal contactors are typical referred to by the diameter of their rotor. Thus, a 5-inch centrifugal contactor is one having a 5-inch diameter rotor.|$|E
50|$|The Housing First {{methodology}} {{was initially}} developed in 1988 in Los Angeles, California, to address {{an increase in}} family homelessness. The basic methodology helps homeless families to relocate from shelters and transitional housing directly into permanent rental housing in the community at-large as quickly as possible, with home-based case management support for a traditional period of time. In other words, the services traditionally being provided in transitional housing were instead provided to families after they had been assisted in relocating to permanent housing at rents they could afford. This was a major innovation in the field at the time. The basic premise was that families were more responsive to interventions and support from a stable permanent <b>housing</b> <b>base</b> than while still homeless. In the 2009 HEARTH Act, the Housing First approach to ending homelessness was codified into law. Housing First programs for families differ dramatically from Housing First for the chronically homeless, as children are involved. Beyond Shelter's leadership promoted this new approach across {{the country for the}} next 20 years, working collaboratively with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.|$|E
50|$|Base {{development}} proceeded rapidly {{once the}} mopping up was completed. Although initially delayed {{by the large}} number of mines, soldiers from the 805th Engineer Aviation Battalion, 1892nd Engineer Aviation Battalion, the 1902nd and the 1903rd Engineer Aviation Battalions, and several other engineering units quickly repaired the enemy airfields and began the construction of new runways, along with a series of interlinking taxiways, revetments, maintenance facilities along with a containment facility for personnel. The coral foundation of the island and the rubble of the town of Ie facilitated the work. There was ample room for dispersal area, and the sloping ground on the sides and ends of the central plateau provided space for <b>housing</b> <b>base</b> personnel. Japanese civilians were evacuated to Tokashiki in the Kerama Islands. Engineers discovered a large limestone basin on the north coast which produced 100,000 gallons of fresh water. Under these conditions work proceeded rapidly and by 10 May one fighter group was based on the island. By the middle of the month three runways were ready for operational use along with taxiways. In addition, radar and air warning facilities installed, although much construction work remained.|$|E

5000|$|As {{described}} by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, Rapid Re-Housing is {{a subset of the}} Housing First approach to end homelessness. Rapid Re-Housing programs are based upon the [...] "Housing First" [...] approach and the strong evidence base that stable housing promotes improved social and/or economic well-being. Experienced practitioners know that outcomes of services interventions are most successful from a stable permanent <b>housing</b> <b>base.</b> While many Housing First programs provide rental assistance, or help clients to access rent subsidies, the key difference between Rapid Re-Housing and Housing First programs is that Rapid Re-Housing always provides a short-term rent subsidy, the subsidy is time-limited and ends within 3-6 months generally, and services end when the subsidy ends. As with the Housing First approach, the goals are to help people obtain housing quickly, increase self-sufficiency, and remain housed. The Core Components of rapid re-housing â housing identification, rent and move-in assistance, and case management and services - are based upon Housing First principles. While Housing First programs often serve many different target populations, including youth, families with children, and the chronically homeless, Rapid Re-Housing programs generally target people with low to moderate services needs. Housing First is much broader in its approach, with program designs developed to be flexible and responsive to the complexity of human needs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Development {{of devices}} for the {{automatic}} {{control of the}} state of the elements that are components of cars has been presented in this article. In spite of the diversity-controlled parts authors have identified the essential elements of each of the positions. Each unit is composed of a <b>housing</b> <b>base</b> plate- with a notch adapted to the controlled element skeleton- part responsible for the determination of controlled parts [1], electronic control system detail, visual signaling allowing for rapid assessment of the inspection. A noticeable fact is related to the necessity of proper selection of industrial sensor technology for specific applications. The premises, existence of which can cancel the interop control in favor of the final inspection was been shown by the authors. Considering the most popular industrial sensor systems, with respect to the following criteria measuring range, resolution, sensitivity, also an important factor in the selection [2] of the actuators and control subsystem has been discussed. Also the general algorithm of the automatic process control with the methodology of Poka-Yoke has been presented...|$|E

40|$|The suburb 2 Ì 7 s {{contribution}} to natural resource depletion, {{reliance on the}} automobile, and disregard for social connections {{has been well documented}} in the last 10 - 20 years. While these depictions are often accurate, many suburbs have successfully addressed these issues by providing walkable streets and accessible communal corridors. Innovative precedents such as Village Homes, in Davis, CA, Eichler Homes, in CA, and Skinny Homes, in Portland, OR, and others, provide examples of successful suburban developments that incorporate renewable energy solutions, passive design features, and limit the development of native landscapes. This thesis aims to design a framework {{to be used in the}} redevelopment of existing suburban communities. Using an existing low-density suburban community in Simi Valley, CA, as a site, I have explored compact infill housing as a method of densifying the neighborhood and broadening the <b>housing</b> <b>base.</b> Prefabrication and deconstructable building components ensure minimal waste and a flexible housing system that can adapt to mimic the evolution of a family. Accessible open space serves to draw the community together and provide usable outdoor spaces. In this way the suburban community can begin to operate in a more efficient manner and adequately address the needs of a broader range of residents...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo fiber-optic accelerometer designs are presented. The first accelerometer was constructed using two flexural disks between {{which is a}} center spindle. Six uniformly spaced screws fasten the disk assembly to a circular, hollow base housing fiber-optic couplers and splices and providing fiber access. The disk edge is elastically restrained. A flat spirally wound coil of optical fiber is bonded to on surface of each disk. Disk surface strains, caused by acceleration, are detected in a push-pull fashion by fiber coils comprising the legs of a Mach-Zender optical interferometer. This sensor demonstrated an acceleration sensitivity og 2. 3 +/- 0. 1. rad g over a bandwidth of 150 - 475 Hz. The resonance frequency was q. 22 +/- 0. 05 kHz. The second accelerometer design described exploits the benefits of using a disk material having a significantly slower sound speed that aluminum, in general, a slower sound speed increases the acceleration sensitivity and decrease the resonance frequency. One polycarbonate disk with a simply supported edge condition is fastened between an aluminum cap and an aluminum <b>housing</b> <b>base</b> secured with six uniformly spaced screws. On flat fiber coil in each Mach-Zender interferometer leg was bonded to each disk surface. This sensor demonstrated an accelerometer sensitivity of 56. 0 +/- 4. 0 rad/g over a bandwidth of 30 - 950 Hz. The resonance frequency was 1. 7 +/- 0. 05 kHz. Both sensors are compatible with the symmetric #x# demodulator developed at the Naval Postgraduate School. The second sensor and demodulator have been integrated and constitute a sensor system, but testing has not been completed. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
