50|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} that the EU's activities have been too focused on security and not on justice. For example, the EU created the European Arrest Warrant but no common rights for defendants arrested under it. With the strengthened powers under Lisbon, the second Barroso Commission created a dedicated commissioner for justice (previously combined with security under one portfolio) who is obliging member states to provide reports on their implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, the Commission is putting forward proposals for common rights for defendants (such as interpretation), minimum standards for prison conditions and ensure that victims of crime are taken care of properly wherever {{they are in the}} EU. This is intended to create a common <b>judicial</b> <b>area</b> where each system can be sure of trusting each other.|$|E

50|$|The 1940 {{extension}} and remodeling substantially reconfigured the interior, {{but for the}} most part used matching details and materials. The axially designed lobbies were changed to a 'C' shape to provide access to the additional area. On the first floor, the larger lobby surrounded the old postal workroom on three sides. A new postal window wall replaced the original window and screen wall. New workroom space filled the addition. On the second and third floors, new corridors extended northward to the new office and <b>judicial</b> <b>areas.</b> The east corridor led to a new fire escape. A small light-well was created at the upper levels to preserve natural lighting for the courtroom through its three large windows and to the postal workroom below was lit through skylights. The smaller windows at the courtroom were converted to passageways for judges and witnesses. The original vaults and toilet rooms were removed and new ones constructed. The stairway was extended to the roof and included a new penthouse. Woodwork, doors, and stone matched the 1916 construction. The new terrazzo, which replaced the original at the lobby and was used for the corridor extensions on the upper floors, was a substantially different mix design. A darker and redder matrix of Tennessee Medium Pink, and Chesapeake Green marble was used. Existing wood floors were covered with linoleum. The new restrooms were finished with ceramic mosaic tile floors, glazed tile wainscot, new plumbing fixtures, and painted metal partitions.|$|R
5000|$|First {{suggested}} by William Somner in the 17th century, {{it seems that}} the derivation of the word from the Old English rāp (rope) has been made practically certain. The suggestion that ropes were used to mark out territory, was well countered by J.H. Round, asking [...] "do those who advance such views realize the size of the districts they have to deal with?" [...] However, Heinrich Brunner explained the application of 'rope' to an administrative district by the old German custom of defining the limits of the 'peace' of popular open-air courts by stakes and ropes, the ropes then giving a name first to the court and then afterwards to the area of its jurisdiction, and produced a case where reep, the Dutch cognate of rāp, is applied to such a <b>judicial</b> <b>area.</b> The parish of Rope, in Cheshire is one place name in England derived from the word rāp.|$|E

5000|$|In 43 AD {{the emperor}} Claudius annexed Lycia. Cassius Dio wrote that Claudius ‘reduced the Lycians to {{servitude}} {{because they had}} revolted and slain some Romans and he incorporated them in the prefecture of Pamphylia." [...] He also provided some details of the investigation of this affair conducted in the senate. Suetonius wrote that Claudius [...] "deprived the Lycians of their independence because of deadly intestine feuds." [...] In an inscription found at Perge which has been dated to late 45/early 46 BC the Lycians, who described themselves as 'faithful allies’, praised Claudius for freeing them from disturbances, lawlessness and brigandage and {{for the restoration of}} the ancestral laws. It makes a reference to the transfer of power from the multitude to the councillors, selected from among the best. Therefore, it seems that {{there might have been a}} revolutionary popular uprising which could have overturned the established order. The annexation of Lycia seems to fit the common reason for annexing Roman client states or allies in this period: the loss on stability due to internal strife or, in some cases, the weakening or end of a ruling dynasty. The restoration of ancestral law was probably linked to the Roman practice of respecting and guaranteeing the ancestral laws, customs and privileges of city-states or leagues of city-states it made alliance agreements with in the eastern Mediterranean. Lycia was annexed, but the Lycian League was retained as so were self-governance regarding most local matters according to local traditional laws and the League's authority over local courts. The treaty concluded by Caesar in 46 BC had already established a framework for the distinction of <b>judicial</b> <b>areas</b> under the competence of the Lycian League and those under the Roman praetor peregrino (chief justice for foreigners) and could be used to define the assignment of legal areas between the Roman provincial governor and the League. The Romans re-established stability in Lycia and retained friendly relations with the Lycians and Lycian rights to their traditional laws, customs and privileges.|$|R
