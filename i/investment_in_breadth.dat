40|$|Abstract: We {{develop a}} model of stock prices {{in which there are}} both {{differences}} of opinion among investors as well as short-sales constraints. The key insight that emerges is that breadth of ownership is a valuation indicator. When breadth is low i. e., when few investors have long positions in the stock this signals that the short-sales constraint is binding tightly, implying that prices are high relative to fundamentals and that expected returns are therefore low. Thus reductions <b>in</b> <b>breadth</b> should forecast lower returns, while increases <b>in</b> <b>breadth</b> should forecast higher returns. Using quarterly data on mutual fund holdings over the period 1979 - 1998, we find evidence supportive of this prediction: stocks whose change <b>in</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>in</b> the prior quarter places them in the lowest decile of the sample underperform those in the top change-in-breadth decile by 6. 38 % in the first twelve months after portfolio formation. After adjusting for size, book-tomarket and momentum, the corresponding figure is 4. 95 %...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{data were}} used to {{evaluate}} whether parental psychological control would {{have a negative impact}} on identity formation. Perceived psychological control and 4 identity dimensions (i. e., commitment making, exploration <b>in</b> <b>breadth,</b> identification with commitment, and exploration in depth) were assessed 5 times in a college sample. Associations between psychological control and identity (i. e., negative associations with both commitment dimensions and a positive association with exploration <b>in</b> <b>breadth)</b> were stable across time. Further, the developmental pathways of these constructs appeared to be correlated: Increases in psychological control were associated with simultaneous decreases in both commitment dimensions. Finally, reciprocal effects were found: Psychological control inhibited progress in both commitment dimensions, whereas exploration <b>in</b> <b>breadth</b> led to increased psychological control. The authors have provided suggestions for helping emerging adults to approach the task of identity formation. status: publishe...|$|R

The greenish-blue median band is about 25 mm <b>in</b> <b>breadth,</b> with its proximal boundary sharp and almost straight, the distal indistinct. The dark brown basal part is about 18 mm <b>in</b> <b>breadth</b> and has only in the distal third a dark blue gloss. In {{the apex of the}} forewing are placed two small, distinct white spots and one very indistinct light one. At the costal margin of the forewing there is a small white spot. At the inner angle of the hindwing there are only traces of small reddish spots. The under surface is dark mahogany brown, on the hindwing somewhat lighter about the veins, the light markings are in shape almost like those of deidamia, but are much less developed (narrower) and of the submarginal brick-red spots of the hindwing only slight traces are present.|$|R
