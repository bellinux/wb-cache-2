40|$|One {{essential}} requirement {{for a modern}} Smart Grid is continuous monitoring of the grid variables. This task is efficiently achieved using self-powered electronic devices deployed throughout the grid network. Within {{the vicinity of the}} grid power lines, the high voltages of these lines can provide a source of energy for such loads using capacitive coupling. This is known as Electric-Field Energy Harvesting (EFEH). However, the reported strategies that use this principle have not explored how to maximise their power transfer, which is essential for practical systems since the available energy from EFEH is invariably quite small. In this paper, a novel approach for optimum energy harvesting is proposed using the parasitic capacitance of medium-voltage power line insulators. A followon power electronic conversion system is then used to maintain the load conditions that maximise the extracted energy. The system performance has been analysed using theoretical studies and computer simulations to identify the operating conditions that maximise the extracted energy. Results obtained so far suggest that up to 100 mW can be harvested from 22 kV grid feeders, using only the capacitive coupling that exists between the line insulator harvester and the <b>feeder</b> <b>conductor...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has the {{responsibility}} of distributing electricity to the consumers in Sri Lanka except few areas which belong to the Lanka Electric Company (LECO). When considering about the distribution network, distribution transformers play the major role. Protection of transformers is therefore very much important. Transformer failure rate and the distribution network reliability are major concerns of the CEB. Distribution transformer failure rate is high in theCEB network and also the fuse usage is unacceptably high. Present CEB fuse selection practice and practical situation at the field have been analyzed to find out better solution for above problems. Theory behind distribution transformer fuse selection has been discussed in detail. K type expulsion fuses are the recommended primary side fuses by the CEB. The study has proposed several changes to the existing fuse selection practice recommended by the CEB. The present distribution transformer protection scheme do not provide over load protection. It has been identified that nearly 13 % transformers had failed annually due to over load within the Southern Province. The study revealed that lower capacity of transformers such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA have the higher probability of getting overloaded. Furthermore, 15 % of distribution transformers installed in the Southern Province {{have at least one}} phase overloaded. A Primary side K type fuse does not provide overload protection to the distribution transformer. Hence, secondary side fuse should provide the over load protection but above findings tell that the expected task cannot be achieved by the present system. The study has proposed three options to solve this problem. Introduction of a primary fuse which is having special Time Current Characteristic (TCC) curve is the first option. The fuse type is called “SloFast” and it has a duel TCC curve. The SloFast fuse TCC curve behaves very much parallel to the transformer damage curve at some low level of current unlike K type fuse TCC curve, which intersects transformer damage curve at some low level of current. The second option is adding a main secondary fuse in between the transformer secondary terminal and the feeder fusses. So that the feeder fuse does the overload protection of the <b>feeder</b> <b>conductor</b> and the main secondary fuse does the overload protection of distribution transformer. The third option is limitation of the number of outgoing feeders from a transformer. This is very important for the distribution transformers having low capacities such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA, because the probability of getting overloaded is high with the present feeder arrangement. It is recommended the maximum number of feeders for each distribution transformer capacit...|$|E
40|$|O dimensionamento de condutores de energia elétrica não leva em consideração critérios de racionalização do uso de energia elétrica. O estudo abrangeu uma avaliação sobre o dimensionamento de condutores alimentadores de energia elétrica de motores conectados diretamente a transformadores utilizados na eletrificação rural. No dimensionamento dos condutores alimentadores, indica-se que, além do atendimento à norma técnica (dimensionamento em função da capacidade de corrente do condutor e da queda de tensão admissível), também sejam considerados: (i) o número de horas de funcionamento; (ii) as características elétricas e preço de condutores; (iii) as características da instalação, como comprimento do ramal e potência do motor. Provou-se que, em algumas situações, é vantajoso aumentar a bitola do condutor além daquela exigida pela norma técnica, a fim de se economizarem energia e gastos pela menor perda no alimentador e maior rendimento do motor elétrico The <b>feeder</b> <b>conductors</b> sizing {{does not}} take into account {{criterion}} for rational use of electricity. This study is about <b>feeder</b> <b>conductors</b> sizing evaluation for motors connected directly to transformers used in rural electrification. In the <b>feeder</b> <b>conductors</b> sizing indicate that besides the attendance of the technical standard (i. e. sizing as a function of the feeder current capacity and the allowable voltage drop) is also to be considered: (i) the number of working hours, (ii) the feeder's electrical characteristic and price, (iii) the installation characteristics as length and engine's rate. According to the above, in some situations it may be advantageous to increase the gauge of the conductor. It was proven that in some situations it is advantageous to increase the conductor gauge beyond that required by the standards in order to save energy and expenses by the lower feeder losses and by the electric motor higher efficienc...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) {{as a means}} of transportation over conventionally fueled vehicles introduces new challenges to the existing infrastructure of the electrical transmission and distribution system. PHEV battery charging can represent a significant power demand that has the potential to overload electrical distribution components. This study examines the impacts of PHEV charging on household service transformers, distribution conductors and voltage levels of a Central California residential distribution system. The system is simulated using ETAP power system analysis software. Transformers are the most vulnerable to overloads, especially if PHEV charging occurs in clusters. Main <b>feeder</b> <b>conductors</b> will be overloaded if a large amount of high power, quick charging occurs. Branch conductors will not be affected by PHEV charging. Based on current PHEV market projections for the region this study shows that significant equipment overloads are not likely to occur until well after 2017...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{variable}} system loads on distribution feeders {{which are}} varied {{time to time}} the distribution system operation becomes more difficult where load density is higher. Power loss in a distribution network is high due to low voltage and high current. Distribution companies (DISCOs) have an economic enticement to reduce losses in the distribution network. This enticement is the cost difference between the real and standard losses. If real losses are more than the standard losses then DISCOs are penalized, otherwise they obtain profit. Thus loss minimization problem is an important and well researched topic, many researchers proposed different approaches, they are vary with each other by selection of tool for loss minimization and also in problem formulation. The commonly employed methods of loss reduction are capacitor placement, <b>feeder</b> reconfiguration, <b>conductor</b> grading, Distributed Generation (DG) allocation etc. In this paper so many published researched articles are discussed so that further more research can be obtained in this area...|$|R

An acceptable voltage profile is maintained along the entire feeder of the network while obtaining an objective of minimizing the total cost, which consists of capital investment and cost of feeder losses, etc. Node numbering scheme and node connection sequence selection have been proposed to determine the node current and voltage drop for each individual node and termination end of each feeder branches and power loss of each segment of the <b>feeder.</b> If the <b>conductor</b> size available fail to satisfy the user defined constraints the designer can rerun the program after making the relevant changes to the inventory database.
