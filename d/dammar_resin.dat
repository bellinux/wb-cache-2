40|$|The terpenoid {{composition}} of well-preserved fresh and oxidized fossil resins (ambers) from Early Paleogene lignite-bearing sequences of India {{have been examined}} using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for determining their botanical origin. The samples were collected from two sedimentary basins viz. Barmer (Akli Formation) and Bikaner-Nagaur (Palana Formation), western India. The total extracts of the studied ambers are represented by hydronaphthalenes; sesquiterpenoids and significant occurrence of diterpenoids. Such terpenoid distribution is typical for gymnosperm, especially conifer derived sources. The diterpenoids are comprised of majorly abietane, phyllocladane, kaurane, pimarane/isopimarane and podocarpane class compounds. Tertracyclic diterpenoids such as 18 -norkauranes, ent- 16 beta(H) -kaurane and 16 alpha(H) -phyllocladane and a rearranged tricyclic diterpenoid, rosane are detected in the fossil resins from Barmer Basin. The occurrence of tetracyclic diterpenoids and rosane together with 8, 13 -dimethyl- 16 -norpodocarpa- 6 -ene suggests that Podocarpaceae family is the possible source of the ambers. However, chemotaxonomic assignment at family level for the fossil resin from Bikaner-Nagaur Basin is difficult due {{to the absence of}} source specific diterpenoids. Previous reports had documented the occurrence of angiosperm-derived <b>dammar</b> <b>resins</b> from Early Paleogene sediments of India (Dutta et al., 2009; Rust et al., 2010).

40|$|Triterpenoid resins, such as <b>dammar</b> <b>resin</b> and mastic resin, {{are natural}} {{products}} used as protective varnishes on paintings. <b>Dammar</b> <b>resin</b> {{consists of a}} large amount of triterpenoid molecules including two triterpenic acids: oleanolic acid and ursolic acid. Similarly, mastic resin is a complex blend of terpenoids but containing oleanolic acid. In this paper, high-mass-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has been used to characterize the fragmentation patterns of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid. The hypothesized fragmentation pathways for these triterpenic acids have also been discussed. In order to distinguish between these two structural isomers, principal component analysis (PCA) has been adopted. This multivariate statistical analysis technique permits to identify the characteristic fragments and discriminates between very similar mass spectra. In addition, <b>dammar</b> <b>resin</b> and mastic resin have been characterized. A selection of characteristic peaks from ursolic and oleanolic acids mass spectra has been used to build a dataset for a multivariate analysis to compare triterpenoid resins and triterpenic acids. The results of PCA have revealed that mastic resin is strictly related to oleanolic acid, whereas <b>dammar</b> <b>resin</b> is differentiated by ursolic acid fragments.

The last two decades have seen considerable progress in elucidating plant terpenoid biosynthetic pathways at the gene and enzyme levels. However, the biosynthetic evolution of these natural products remains poorly understood. We have addressed this knowledge gap by demonstrating the geological preservation of a bioactive angiosperm metabolite. Specifically, we report the presence of 20, 24 -epoxy- 25 hydroxy dammaran- 3 -ol, an oxidative product of dammarenediol, from 54 Ma old dipterocarp-derived <b>dammar</b> <b>resins.</b> Other dammarane-type triterpenoids such as 20, 24 -epoxy- 25 -hydroxydammaran- 3 -one and hexakisnor-dammaran- 3, 20 -dione were also present in the solvent extracts of the fossilized resins. Dammarenediol is the main precursor of several ginsenosides which have many pharmacological effects. It's occurrence in early Eocene sediments unequivocally demonstrates that plants from this period had produced the enzyme dammarenediol cyclase that catalyzes the cyclization of 2, 3 -oxidosqualene into dammarenediol.

40|$|Problem statement: Dammar is {{a natural}} resin that used anciently in varnish production. The use of <b>dammar</b> natural <b>resin</b> in coating is limited by {{undesirable}} properties for application in coating where it is considered very brittle. Due to dammar's brittle nature, an aged dammar coating can be easily scratched or abraded. Approach: <b>Dammar</b> natural <b>resin</b> could be modified into Silicone-Dammar by using a solvent {{in order to improve}} the coatings mechanical properties. The modified Silicone-Dammar (SD) was coated on aluminum q-panel and adhesion was evaluated using cross hatch test, impact test and pull off test, while the hardness of coating was investigated by nano-indentation test. Results: Results from cross hatch test, impact test and pull off test show that coating material with 15 % wt. of dammar (SD 15) was the optimum composition which exhibits good adhesion of modified Silicone-Dammar to the metal substrate.

Demonstration is here provided via the interdisciplinary investigation of the original technique used by Giovanni del Biondo in the polyptych Annunciation and Saints (1385 ca), Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence, Italy. The exquisite surface appearance makes this panel painting remarkable compared to artworks by coeval artists. Imaging techniques (UV, IR and IR false color), non-invasive single spot techniques (XRF and FORS spectrometry) and analytical investigations on eight selected micro-samples (ATR-FTIR, GC/MS and Py/GC–MS, ESEM-EDS) were combined to retrieve the palette and identify organic binding media and a superficial coating layer. Stratigraphic and micro-chemical data confirmed the use of a relatively simple egg-tempera technique applied on a ground made of gypsum mixed with animal glue, without complex stratigraphic superimposition of preparation and pictorial layers. Various pigments were identified, among which is the precious lapis lazuli. While Py/GC–MS highlight that the coating is made of <b>dammar</b> <b>resin</b> and honey mixed with animal glue, the results allow us to state that the painting was not intentionally varnished by Giovanni del Biondo.

The maceral study reveals that studied lignites are rich in huminite (ay. 63 %) with sub-ordinate amount of liptinite (ay. 19 %) and low inertinite (ay. 3 %), along with low to moderately high associated mineral matters (ay. 15 %). The overall petrographic composition points to a lagoonal condition {{for the formation of}} these lignites. The mean huminite reflectance values (R-r: 0. 28 - 0. 34 %, ay. 0. 31 %) as well as low Rock-Eval T-max (av. 417 degrees C) values for the seams, suggest brown coal or lignitic stage/rank for the studied lignites. The palynological assemblages, dominated by tropical angiospermic pollen, suggest prevalence of warm humid tropical climate during the deposition of these lignites. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of lignites ranges between 26 and 58 wt. %, whereas the TOC content of the associated carbonaceous shales is around 4 wt. %. The Hydrogen Index (HI) ranging from 23 to 452 mg HC/g TOC indicates that the lignite sequence has the potential to produce mixed oil and gaseous hydrocarbons on maturation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{inorganic}} (NO 2 and O 3) and volatile organic acid (acetic acid) pollutants {{on the degradation of}} dammar varnish in museum environments. The impact of indoor pollutants on human health and the conservation of stone and metal artefacts has been well studied and documented. However, knowledge is lacking on how environmental pollutants in museum environments can affect the conservation of artifacts containing organic materials. In particular, there are no data on how volatile organic acids can degrade organic materials (with the exception of cellulose-based objects). Model paint varnish samples based on <b>dammar</b> <b>resin</b> were thus investigated, by Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Dammar is a natural triterpenoid resin, commonly used as a paint varnish. Samples were subjected to accelerated ageing by different levels of pollutants (NO 2 and O 3 and acetic acid) over a range of relative humidity (RH) conditions and then analysed. The results revealed that as the dose of pollutant increased, so did the degree of oxidation and cross-linking of the resin. Most interestingly, it was shown {{for the first time that}} exposure to acetic acid vapour resulted in the production of an oxidised and cross-linked resin, comparable to the resin obtained under exposure to NO 2 and O 3. These conclusions were supported by the analyses of model varnishes exposed for about two years in selected museum environments, where levels of pollutants had been previously measured. Exposures were performed both within and outside selected microclimate frames for paintings. Results showed that varnishes placed within the microclimate frames were not always better preserved than those exposed outside the frames. For some sites, the results highlighted the protective effects of the frames from outdoor generated pollutants, such as NO 2 and O 3. For other sites, the results showed that the microclimate frames acted as traps for the volatile organic acids emitted by the wooden components of the mc-frames, which damage the varnish.

Because of difficulties presented by both the structure and the stereochemistry of such molecules the approaches have necessarily been limited to three main courses of attack, the acid-catalysed cyclisation of aqualene (XII), the combination of two decalin derivatives to provide rings AB and DE of the pentacyclic system, and the combination of a of a tricyclic ABC moiety with a monocyclic unit to provide ring E. The main body of this Thesis is divided into two sections (A and B). In the first a detailed investigation la made into a previously reported route from elemadienolic acid (I) to a possible ABC tricyclic intermediate (I→IX) with particular emphasis being placed on yields and reproducibility. It is shown that the route has several undesirable features and a superior alternative is offered (X→XI→IX). In connection with this work two potential monocyclic ring E precursors have been synthesised (XIIIa and XIVa) and an attempted electrolytic coupling of (XIIIa) and (IX) has been carried out. The second section represents a continuation of the work of Littlehailes and is devoted to the synthesis of a hydroxylated bicyclic AB unit (XV) which could be utilised in alkylating the decalone (XVI) with the aim of constructing a pentacyclic triterpene of the amyrin series. Section A. The tricyclic intermediate (IX) was first isolated by the route illustrated (I→IX) in quantities sufficient for little more than characterisation purposes. More recently Ryback has made a preliminary investigation into the practical utilisation of such a route with special regard to the isolation of (IX) in large enough quantities for use in further synthetic operations. However his results were not conclusive and it was decided to reinvestigate some of the operations involved. As supplies of tirucallenediol (II) were at hand it was decided to look first at its conversion into isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa). It was found that although diacetylation went in high yield, the yield from the semi-hydrolysis of the diacetate (III) was not reproducible and was often poor necessitating a laborious fractional recrystallisation and recycling procedure in order to obtain quantities of the monoacetate (IV). The formation of the methanesulphonyl derivative (V), its reduction with lithium aluminium hydride to give tirucallenyl acetate (VI) and the subsequent acid isomerisation to isutirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) all went in high yield. Oxidation of (VIIa) with t -butyl chromate gave a reproducible 50 % conversion to the αβ-unsaturated ketone (VIIIa). The cleavage of the &Delta 13 (17) double bond in the unsaturated ketone (VIIIa) was attempted by ozonolysis, osmium tetroxide and lead tetraacetate, alkaline peroxide and the Lemieux periodate/permanganate oxidation. Only ozone caused fission to occur giving the tricyclic keto acid (IX) in poor yield. A summary of the results of these experiments and a discussion of the implications is presented. The demonstration that at least two stages in this route were unsatisfactory, the difficulty of isolating elemadienonic acid (XVII) in a high degree of purity, and the many stages involved in the conversion of elemadienolic acid (I) to the tricyclic intermediate (IX), instigated the search for an alternative source of (IX). This was afforded by the isolation of the epimeric mixture of dammarene diols (XI a and b) and the related ketones (X a and b) from <b>Dammar</b> <b>resin.</b> Reduction of the ketone content of the mixture to alcohol by lithium aluminium hydride followed by acetylation, hydrogenation and acid-catalysed dehydration gave a further mixture which contained isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) and isocuphenyl acetate (VIIb). Oxidation of this mixture with t -butyl chromate followed by ozonolysis of the resultant αβ-unsaturated ketones (VIII a and b) gave the tricyclic intermediate (IX), in the manner already described for isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) alone. The tricyclic intermediate (IX) could now be effectively and efficiently isolated from a natural source as the end product of a route containing only four major operations. Two cyclohexane keto-esters (XIIIb) and (XIVb) were synthesised for the purpose of coupling with the tricyclic intermediate (IX). Each was derived from dimedone. In one case, dimedone was converted into the enol-chloride (XVIII) which was hydrogenated to the cyclohexanone (XIX), and carbethoxylated to give the keto-ester (XIVb). In the second case, dimedone was alkylated first with methyl iodide and then ethyl bromoacetate to give (XXI). Eliminating one of the ketone groups via the thioketal and reduction with Raney nickel gave the keto-ester (XIIIb). It was attempted to electrolytically couple the tricyclic intermediate (IX) with the monocyclic keto-acid (XIIIa) but only the bis -cyclohexyl ethane derivative (XXII) could be isolated. Both isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) and isoeuphenyl acetate (VIIb) were converted into the 1, 5 -diketones (XXIIIa) and (XXIIIb) in good yields with osmium tetroxide and lead tetraacetate. Attempts to recyclise the 1, 5 -diketones by a pinacolic reduction succeeded, albeit in poor yield, when the forcing conditions of molten sodium in xylene were employed. An attempted Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the 1, 5 -diketone (XXIIIa), however, was unsuccessful. In anticipation of the products to be obtained from the coupling of the monocyclic and tricyclic intermediates (XIIIa) and (IX) attempts were made to hydroxylate and fission the Δ 13 (18) double bond in δ-amyrin acetate (XXIV), but these proved unsuccessful. The δ-amyrin acetate (XXIV) was obtained from β-amyrin (XXVa) by successive acetylation, selenium dioxide dehydrogenation and partial re-hydrogenation. β-Amyrin (XXVa) was itself isolated as its benzoate from the fractional crystallisation of a mixture of &alpha- and β-amyrin benzoates, (XXVI) and (XXVb). Also included in this section is a discussion of further methods of converting the tricyclic intermediate (IX) into a pentacyclic triterpene. Section B. The base catalysed condensation of ethyl 2 -oxo- 3 -carbethoxy-butyrate and ethyl vinyl ketone gave the 1, 3 -diketone (XXVIII), which after acid-catalysed cyclisation and esterification gave the αβ-unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) in high overall yield. As difficulties were both anticipated and realised in the alkylation of (XXIX), a second monocyclic keto-ester (XXX) was synthesised in order to make comparative studies of their alkylation. The keto-ester (XXX) was synthesised in high yield via the base-catalysed condensation of ethyl α-methyl-β-oxoadipate and methyl vinyl ketone, ring-closure and esterification. Unsuccessful attempts were made to convert the unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) into a bicyclic precursor (XL) for rings A and B by a Robinson ring extension and by a Michael addition with acrylonitrile. However, the discovery (see below) that the substance (XXIX) could be alkylated suggested that the same result might be indirectly achieved by alkylating it with a β-halobutan- 3 -one ketal and then splitting the ketal and cyclising the resultant 1, 5 -diketone. With the object of preparing a β-halobutan- 3 -one ketal several vain attempts were made to add methanol in the presence of mercuric chloride/boron trifluoride etherate catalyst to several related ω-substituted but- 1 -ynes (XXXI a, b and c). Finally the object was realised by converting ethyl acetoacetate into its ketal derivative (XXXIIa), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to the ketal alcohol (XXXIIb), this in turn giving the toluene- p -sulphonate (XXXIIc) and iodide (XXXIId). A wide variety of conditions were employed in attempts to alkylate the monocyclic keto-esters (XXIX and XXX) with both the β-ketal toluene- p -sulphonate (XXXIIc) and iodie (XXXIId) but as no alkylated product was ever isolated it appeared that the β-ketal detivatives (XXXIIc) and (XXXIId) were either too unstable or too inactive to accomplish substitution. However, the monocyclic intermediates (XXIX) and (XXX) were alkylated in several ways. The unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) was alkylated with methyl iodide and potassium t -butoxide, and the homologous keto-ester (XXX) was alkylated by ethyl bromoacetate using sodium triphenylmethide as base. Both (XXIX) and (XXX) were alkylated with 1, 3 -dichlorobut- 2 -ene in the presence of sodium t -amyloxide but no bicyclic ring closure compounds could be obtained on treatment of the chlorocrotyl derivatives (XXXIII) and (XXXIV) with concentrated sulphuric acid. In fact the latter regressed to the keto-ester (XXX) and the former isomerised to give a solid crystalline product which could not be identified. Finally, ring extension was achieved by first reducing the olefinic bond in the monocyclic αβ-unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) with lithium in liquid ammonia and condensing the resultant saturated keto-ester (XXXV) with the methiodide of 1 -diethylaminobutan- 3 -one using sodamide as base. The octalone (XXXVI) was isolated and a gem -dimethyl group was introduced to give (XXXVII). A description of the continuation of this work is given and also included is a variation involving the preparation of the diester (XXXVIII) by a base-catalysed ring closure of the 1, 5 -diketone (XXXIX), itself derived from the base-catalysed condensation of ethyl β-oxoadipate and methyl vinyl ketone. Ways in which this latter compound can be utilised are also presented. </p...|$|E
