5000|$|According to Spanish and Portuguese {{versions}} of European Union spirits regulations, aguardiente and aguardente are generic Spanish and Portuguese terms, respectively, {{for some of}} the distilled spirits that are fermented and distilled exclusively from their specified raw materials, contain no added alcohol or flavouring substances, and if sweetened, only [...] "to round off the final taste of the product". However, aguardiente and aguardente are not legal denominations on their own. Instead, different categories of aguardientes (spirits in the English version) are established according to raw materials. In the Spanish version, wine spirit (brandy) is aguardiente de vino, <b>fruit</b> <b>spirit</b> is aguardiente de fruta, grain spirit (other than whisky and neutral grain spirit) is aguardiente de cereales, etc. Many aguardentes have a protected designation of origin, for example: Aguardente de Vinho Douro (wine spirit of Douro), Aguardente Bagaceira Bairrada (grape marc of Bairrada), Aguardente de pêra da Lousã (pear spirit of Lousã), Aguardiente de sidra de Asturias (cider spirit of Asturias) or Aguardiente de hierbas de Galicia (herbal spirit of Galicia).|$|E

40|$|In 2004 and 2007 twelve {{countries}} {{joined the}} European Union (EU), bringing about {{significant changes in}} the field of European agriculture. One of the major changes was the transformation of the agri-food trade of these countries. This paper analyses the effects of EU enlargement on the competitiveness of fruit spirits in six Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), especially regarding geographical indications, by using the theory of revealed comparative advantages. Although the majority of the studied CEEC fruit spirits was both competitive and had a comparative advantage in the EU- 15 beverages market in the period 2001 - 2011, during this time the competitiveness in terms of quality and price of fruit spirits in the region declined. The results indicate that these countries are losing their market positions in their traditional <b>fruit</b> <b>spirit</b> sector in the EU- 15 beverages market {{in spite of the fact}} that the majority of these products have a geographical indication. These changes are in line with the overall trend of an increasing trade deficit in the overall beverages, spirits and vinegar market of the six CEECs with the EU- 15 after 2003. By contrast, the well-known grappa of Italy is shown to be competitive in terms of both price and quality during this period. It is clear that such products with geographical indications can be competitive in European markets...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} produce and {{characterize}} a liquor of tangerine peel with three alcoholic bases (grain alcohol, sugar cane spirit and tangerine spirit). The physical and chemical analyses were performed relative to volatile acidity, dry extract, density and alcohol degree. The density in all samples was 1. 13 g mL - 1, volatile acidity 48. 54 g 100 mL - 1 for the treatment with grain alcohol, 28. 43 g 100 mL - 1 with spirit sugar cane and 22. 09 g 100 mL - 1 for the tangerine spirit treatment. The dry extract ranged from 431 g L - 1 for grain alcohol treatment, 446. 26 g L - 1 for sugar cane spirit treatment and 443. 84 g L - 1 for the tangerine spirit treatment, the alcohol degree ranged from 18. 84, 20. 01 and 19. 67 °GL among the treatments. We accomplished an acceptance test through sensory analysis of the following attributes: alcoholic taste, fruit flavor, sweetness and overall impression. The liquor based on grain alcohol produced the highest mean regarding all attributes (6. 32, 6. 66, 6. 34 e 6. 26 for taste alcoholic, fruit flavor, sweetness and overall impression, respectively), but without significant difference among the treatments. In conclusion, the tangerine peel liquor made using the own <b>fruit</b> <b>spirit</b> is a viable alternative for the total use of the fruit and can {{be a source of}} income for small farmers.

40|$|Palinka is a {{traditional}} Hungarian <b>fruit</b> <b>spirit</b> prepared exclusively by the distillation of fruit mash or fruit pulp. As an alcoholproduct, it {{is subject to the}} Act CXXVII of 2003 on Excise Duties and Special Regulations on the Distribution of Excise Goods amended severaltimes. The present government of Hungary pledged to grant the right of free palinka distillation again in the previous election campaign. As of 27 September 2010, the excise duty of subcontract-distillation was repealed, and the previously non-existent “official” home distillation wasintroduced, which resulted in explicit revenue losses for the state budget. The modification of the law mentions distillate instead of the wordpalinka. The difference between the two notions will be discussed in the present study. Presumably, lawmakers did not consider the fact that atthe time of Hungary’s EU accession we entered into an agreement stipulating that the tax on subcontract-distillation should not be lower than 50 % of the tax on alcohol products. Having been unable to agree on a solution to the problems in question, Brussels launched an infringementprocedure against Hungary. Finally, Hungary was convicted; therefore, tax exemption or palinka distillation shall be ceased. This regulationcame into force on 01 January 2015. The reactions of those who used the services of subcontract distillation were negative; turnover plungedby approximately 85 % compared to the year of 2014.

40|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>spirits</b> {{contain a}} large array of {{volatile}} compounds among which {{the important role}} from toxicological aspect besides ethanol has methanol, aliphatic esters and fusel alcohols. This study evaluates the content of ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, isopropyl alcohol (2 -propanol), n-propyl alcohol (propan-l-ol), isobutyl alcohol (2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol), n-butyl alcohol (1 -butanol), isoamyl alcohol (3 -methyl- 1 -butanol) and n-amyl alcohol (pentan- 1 -ol) in different grapes and plum brandies industrially produced at Republic of Macedonia. Gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID) was applied for the characterization of all investigated volatile compounds. The obtained results revealed that the highest methanol content was present in the samples of plum brandy, which is mainly due to the higher content of pectin in the raw material. The most important higher alcohols of grape and plum brandies were found to be: n-propyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol. In all the analyzed samples of grape and plum brandies, the most abundant was isoamyl alcohol which content ranged from 50. 3 to 290. 7 mg/ 100 mL a. a. Comparing the results with {{the data from the}} literature, it can be concluded that the concentrations of all investigated volatile compounds in the samples of grape and plum brandies are commonly acceptable.
