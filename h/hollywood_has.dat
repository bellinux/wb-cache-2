25|$|<b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> been hitting two {{extremes}} – either a Biblical de Mille spectacular or a Baby Doll.

25|$|After {{years of}} serious {{decline in the}} 1980s, many Hollywood {{landmarks}} were threatened with demolition. Columbia Square, at {{the northwest corner of}} Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, is part of the ongoing rebirth of Hollywood. The Art Deco-style studio complex completed in 1938, which was once the Hollywood headquarters for CBS, became home to a new generation of broadcasters when cable television networks MTV, Comedy Central, BET and Spike TV consolidated their offices here in 2014 as part of a $420-million office, residential and retail complex.

Reubens later stated a strong possibility of a Pee-wee's Playhouse movie on an NPR interview with Terry Gross on December 27, 2004. A third Pee-wee movie was also suggested.

However, some viewers were outraged during the first series when a decision was made to make the contestants use one of Hollywood's recipes for scones instead of one of Berry's. Her work on the show with <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> led to The Guardian suggesting that it is the best reality TV judging partnership ever. In September 2016, Love Productions announced that a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4 instead of the BBC from 2017 had been agreed. Co-hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins announced that they would not be continuing with Bake Off on its new network. Berry announced she was also leaving Bake Off on the same day that fellow judge Paul Hollywood announced he would be staying with the show.|$|E
25|$|Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who {{was sent}} on the Royal Navy's {{expedition}} to the South Pacific to find the mutineers {{and bring them to}} trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> portrayed Bligh as being. The 14 men from Bounty who were captured by Edwards' men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on Pandoras quarterdeck. Yet, when Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. And finally Captain Edwards did also give orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges the armourer's mate went into the cell to knock off the prisoners' irons. But before he could finish the job, the ship sank very quickly. Eventually four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the wrecking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cage before jumping off the sinking vessel.|$|E

His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> {{offered him a}} thousand dollars per week to write film scripts. Barton hesitates, worried that moving to California would separate him from [...] "the common man", his focus as a writer. He accepts the offer, however, and checks into the Hotel Earle, a large and unusually deserted building. His room is sparse and draped in subdued colors; its only decoration is a small painting of {{a woman on the}} beach, arm raised to block the sun.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian rated it {{third on}} {{its list of}} [...] "The top 10 films of 2009 you {{probably}} won't have seen". The reviewer, David Parkinson, praised this work as [...] "the most beautiful children's film of the year". He elaborated by saying, [...] "Everything about this poignant account...is exquisite. The photography and period design are impeccable, while the script deftly acquaints younger viewers with the good that can still emerge from the harsher realities of life.". He ended his review with: [...] "This {{is the kind of}} family entertainment that <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> long forgotten how to make." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Coens {{stress that the}} {{labyrinth}} of deception and difficulty Barton endures {{is not based on}} their own experience. Although Joel has said that artists tend to [...] "meet up with Philistines", he added: [...] "Barton Fink is quite far from our own experience. Our professional life in <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair". Ethan has suggested that Lipnick– like the men on which he is based– is in some ways a product of his time. [...] "I don't know that that kind of character exists anymore. Hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that now".|$|E

500|$|However, {{the filmmakers}} {{point out that}} Barton Fink {{is not meant to}} {{represent}} the Coens themselves. [...] "Our life in <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> been particularly easy", they once said. [...] "The film isn't a personal comment". Still, universal themes of the creative process are explored throughout the movie. During the picnic scene, for example, Mayhew asks Barton: [...] "Ain't writin' peace?" [...] Barton pauses, then says: [...] "No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain." [...] Such exchanges led critic William Rodney Allen to call Barton Fink [...] "an autobiography {{of the life of the}} Coens' minds, not of literal fact". Allen's comment is itself a reference to the phrase [...] "life of the mind", used repeatedly in the movie in wildly differing contexts.|$|E
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{called it}} a {{restoration}} of [...] "originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. ... It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic." [...] James Berardinelli stated [...] "The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain."

500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film's {{take on a}} classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers {{as well as the}} {{performance}} of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality" [...] and one that [...] "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as [...] "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed to get right until now" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat." [...] Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.|$|E
500|$|Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice {{wrote in}} a {{positive}} review that [...] "this [...] pushes right past competent into mostly legitimately enjoyable" [...] but added that [...] "the movie is still dumb as catbutt. It's an honest and accomplished dumbness, however, where the stupidest stuff seems to be there because the movie would be less fun without it." [...] The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy was critical about the film's use of 3D and accurate reflection of the franchise's comic book and cartoon origins, but predicted it would still earn better than its predecessor, [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of [...] "B-", calling it [...] "well-executed technocratic action fluff" [...] and commented: [...] "In its dehumanized and trivial way, it's a triumph of razor-sharp, hyper-violent style over formulaic substance ... <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> now evolved {{to the point that}} it can deliver these kinds of thrills with maximum brute force and keep the impact so light that the result can still be regarded as a 'harmless' diversion for 14-year-olds." [...] Glen Heath Jr. of Slant Magazine gave it two out of four stars, criticizing the film's [...] "cut-happy style" [...] and plot, but lauding the action sequences and Chu's direction as [...] "poetry in high-speed motion." [...] Writing for Indiewire's The Playlist Blog, Todd Gilchrist gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] and wrote: [...] "As one might expect, there are more than a handful of loose ends once justice has been served, but there’s something to be said for a film which aims to please in a sincere and straightforward way, without attempting to be the biggest ever. 'Retaliation' is no masterpiece, but it’s a movie whose fun doesn’t feel like a four-letter word" ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker {{called it}} the best {{historical}} drama about the Holocaust, a movie that [...] "will take its place in cultural history and remain there." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as Spielberg's best, [...] "brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen." [...] Ebert named it one of his ten favorite films of 1993. Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's [...] "narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness." [...] He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise, and calls {{the scene in the}} shower at Auschwitz [...] "the most terrifying sequence ever filmed." [...] In his 2013 movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a four-star rating, calling it a [...] "staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller," [...] saying [...] "this looks and feels like nothing <b>Hollywood</b> <b>has</b> ever made before". He also described it as [...] "Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date". James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a [...] "major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust." [...] In his review for the New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized [...] "were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement." [...] Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the [...] "visual brilliance" [...] of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as [...] "realistic" [...] and [...] "stunning". He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe. The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.|$|E
