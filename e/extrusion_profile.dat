40|$|Aluminum alloy extrusions with {{variations}} in profiles and Fe-rich particles were produced using different extrusion dies and iron contents. A microstructural {{examination of the}} extrusion surface shows that the <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> and iron content have a great effect on the size and number of Fe-rich particles, grain size, texture, and fraction of high-angle grain boundaries due to varying localized plastic deformation and temperature in the extrudate.

40|$|Purpose: Seam welds {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the billet’s {{material}} {{is divided into}} separate metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in seam welds may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in seam welds on an aluminum <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> type which has seam weld zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing seam weld region, only a slight change was observed in seam weld region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of seam weld regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem. Therefore, the problem is an insufficient pressure problem and this caused poor metal feeding. In the other hand, micro hardness tests are realized on seam weld region, main region and defective region’s surround of specimen’s section. After the micro hardness tests important differences are shown among these regions’ strength. Hardness values of seam weld region were lower than the main material’s hardness values, but higher than the defective region’s. Practical implications: In application, seam welds occur on hollow profiles produced by aluminum extrusion.

To achieve this, it is studied on an <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> type which has seam weld and transverse weld regions. Design/methodology/approach: Producing <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> has been performed by a press, which has a capacity of 1460 tones, in a real producing and carried out by changing the exit temperature and ram speed, which are the important parameters. Exit temperature TE, is chosen as 440, 475, 500, 520 and 560 °C. Extrusion speed is also taken {{in the base of}} ram speed VR, and production is carried out at the speeds of 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 mm/s. Therefore the effects of extrusion parameters on macrostructure properties have been investigated. Findings: It is seen clearly that some differences are occurred from the viewpoint of structural features between the regions, when the experimental results are observed without regarding the extrusion parameters. In addition, it was observed commonly the structure of the material had a change through re-crystallization with increasing temperatures. This situation decreases the significance of seam weld regions. But insignificancy of seam weld region is designed as possible as can be from the viewpoint of decorative. However, when the macro structural figures have been investigated as the ram speed increases more significance on seam welds occurs. Research limitations/implications: Also some macrostructural differences in extrusion welds may occur for between having the other important extrusion parameters such as pressure and extrusion ratio. Therefore, effect of the other parameters can be investigated in future. Practical implications: In application, extrusion welds occur on both solid and hollow profiles. Moreover, extrusion temperature and speed often changes. This study shows that these parameters effect to macrostructure of extrusion welds.

40|$|Synopsis [...] A {{characteristic}} {{deficiency of}} aerosol foams, such as shave creams, is {{the increase in}} foam wetness as the can empties. This change in foam density can be minimized with solubility and other theoretical considerations. A characteristic <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> for a given formulation {{can be made by}} plotting propellant content against per cent product in the can. The per cent of product extruded as a satisfactory foam varies between formulations. To study the problem, a ternary graph showing propellant solubilities in fatty acid-amine com-positions where the water content of the total system is 80 % was prepared. A product with a perfectly uniform foam is realized by formulating a soap solution that is clear with propellant included but where the propellant has a limited solubility in the soap. Propellant may then be added above this amount to form a reserve layer which will maintain a constant propellant percentage dissolved in the solution during extrusion. The graph defines compositions of soap solutions that fulfill these requirements. Proper operation of this concept requires the can not be shaken before use.

Analysis of microstructure showed that tin particles had been deposited in the coloured film. The coloured films, about 10 mu m thick, were uniform, dense and firmly attached to the substrate. After the coloured samples were maintained at 400 AC for 1 h, or quenched from 300 AC to room temperature, the coloured films did not change, demonstrating excellent thermostability and thermal shock resistance.

40|$|During hot {{extrusion}} a extrusion billet s {{cross section}} is reduced, altering the metals micro- structure. As the billet is {{passing through the}} extrusion die the strain rate and temperature increases, resulting in a with a highly deformed <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> with a high subgrain density, giving a great driving force for recrystallisation. The extruded profile recrystallises almost imme- diately after the extrusion die [1, 2]. However, recrystallisation after extrusion of non-dispersoid containing alloys like AA 6063 is not fully understood. Such alloys tend to undergo uncontrolled grain growth in the surface area [2, 3]. This master project aims to give {{a better understanding of}} the recrystallisation process occurring under extrusion by investigating the subgrain size evolution during transient changing strain rates. Using torsion to deform the metal, the deformation starts with a high (1 st) strain rate allowing the steady-state microstructure of the high strain rate to be developed, then immediately changing the strain rate to a lower (2 nd) strain rate, effectively simulating the passing through the extrusion die. The objective was to identify the strain region in which the subgrain size is in a transient state between the 1 st and the 2 nd steady-state microstructure, referred to as the metals deformation memory. AA 6063 s deformation memory at 375 °C was found to be in the higher strain region of shear strains between 0. 18 − 0. 26 (equivalent to strains between 0. 10 − 0. 15). In the investigated strain region it was found little texture evolution. Investigations of the texture found that the samples texture intensity increased with recovery due to annihilation of the orientation gradients.

40|$|Extrusion is {{a process}} in which a billet of most {{commonly}} aluminium is pushed through a die aperture of a desired cross sectional shape to produce lengths of extrudate. The type of streaking being investigated is due to differing thermomechanical conditions created due to changing cross sectional thicknesses of an <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile.</b> These differing thermomechanical conditions then may cause possible issues of differing distributions of intermetallics or grain orientations. At the start of this research many possible reasons for streaking were presented in literature but no single mechanism identified as being the primary cause. Therefore it needed to be identified what the mechanism for causing streaking on the product being investigated was due to. In addition the evolution of streaking after different etch durations needed to be examined as this type of finding has not been reported in literature. The streaking observed therefore might not be the same for all levels of material removal. To conduct this research on streaking, samples were submitted to differing chemical etch durations which produced different levels of material removal. The chemical etch differs {{in and out of the}} streak region and the different durations thus allow possible different types of streaking to be observed at different levels of material removal. In addition to chemical etching an electro-etching experiment was conducted so that primarily the grain boundaries were etched out to examine if these features play an insignificant, minor or major role in the streaking phenomenon. In summary there are two features that are etched on the surface of an extrudate, these are grain boundary grooves and etch pits. It was established through a thorough investigation that etch pits are the primary factor for streaking to occur with the grain boundary grooves being an insignificant factor for the extrusion product examined. For the top surface layers a glossy streak appeared and as more material was removed two dull parallel bands and then a single dull band streak appeared. The dull streaking was due to more pitting in the streak region and the glossy streaking due to less pitting and less densely distributed die lines. Overall the streaking observed most commonly in the manufacturing environment is the dull gloss streaks which occur after a longer etch duration and larger volume of surface material removal. Therefore the streaking phenomenon is mainly a subsurface issue but only to a small depth. Therefore if abrasive blasting in conjunction with a short etch duration is used the issue of streaking created by etching can be resolved...|$|E
