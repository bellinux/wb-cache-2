50|$|Every adult (other than married women) {{can change}} their {{domicile}} by leaving {{the jurisdiction of}} the prior domicile with an intention of permanently residing somewhere else. This is referred to as a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> A <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> can be abandoned if a new <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is acquired or if the domicile of origin revives.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} settle {{permanently}} {{has been held}} to arise only when one can become a permanent resident of the jurisdiction for immigration purposes. For example, suppose that A came from England to Canada on a visa to work for an employer in Ontario. While there, his son B is born. A likes Canada enough to have his status changed to that of landed immigrant. When B comes of age, he decides to leave Ontario for good, but dies before settling permanently elsewhere. B's domicile of origin is England, because of A's initial inability to settle permanently in Ontario. When A obtains permission to land, Ontario becomes his <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> and B (provided {{he is still a}} minor) automatically acquires it as a domicile of dependency. When B attains the age of majority, Ontario becomes his <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> until he decides to leave for good, at which time it reverts back to the domicile of origin. His new <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> would only occur once {{he had been able to}} settle permanently in a new jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|However, {{it is more}} {{difficult}} to abandon a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> than to acquire it. In the case of abandonment, both the above conditions must be fulfilled simultaneously as they are interrelated, whereas they are discrete in the latter case of acquisition.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom {{contains}} three jurisdictions: England and Wales; Scotland; and Northern Ireland. All UK jurisdictions {{distinguish between}} {{domicile of origin}} (decided by the domicile of their father, or if parents unmarried their mother), <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> (when a person has exercised a legal option to change their domicile as can be done when attaining majority) and domicile of dependence (applicable to those legally dependent on another such as some incapable persons, children or women married before 1974) but in general only one place can be a person's domicile {{at any one time}} thus preventing the creation of differing simultaneous domiciles for different purposes; the three types of domicile can enable a voluntary change when a person reaches a relevant age. If a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> lapses and is not replaced the domicile of origin reasserts itself. The concept of domicile is not rooted in statute thus the basic matter of an individual's domicile is not decided by any single statute but rather by case law in combination with applicable international law and statutes following in accord.|$|E
50|$|In {{the common}} law, {{marriage}} {{can produce a}} common domicile for the spouses with the wife taking the domicile of the husband. This rule {{is derived from the}} proposition that a dependent wife will follow her husband in all aspects of her life. Although this provides a convenient law which is usually easy to identify (since the requirements for change of domicile depend on demonstrating an intention to reside indefinitely in the state of choice, the domicile of the husband is difficult to change) it may produce a result in which a person is domiciled in one state but the matrimonial home and all other features of the parties' lives may be in a second state. This problem is aggravated by the rules relating to the revival of the domicile of origin when a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is abandoned. For example, a husband with a domicile of origin in Japan establishes a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in China where he marries a woman with a French domicile. When the relationship breaks down, he abandons his home in China and goes to live in Singapore. Immediately upon his leaving China, his Japanese domicile revives and his wife's domicile also changes to that of Japan even though she might never have set foot in that country. To avoid both the patriarchal implications and potentially unfortunate legal consequences implicit in the domicile of dependence, many states have amended their laws to permit women to retain their domcile of origin upon marriage, or to establish a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> independently of the husband during the subsistence of the marriage. In cases where the spouses have different domiciles, the choice of law rule must refer to both lex domicilii.|$|E

5000|$|The {{judgement}} to {{the preliminary}} issue {{to determine the}} domicile of Owen Davies was handed down on 12 July 2011 by Mr Charles Hollander QC and ruled against Adrian Davies and his associate Mark Simeon Jones (both barristers of 3 Doctor Johnson's Buildings, London). The Judge concluded that the evidence never came close to establishing a Belgian <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> as alleged by the so-called Family Defendants and determined that [...] "Owen never lost his domicile of origin, and remained domiciled in England", and is further reported in the Stratford Herald on 14 July 2011.|$|E
5000|$|To {{establish}} a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> {{it is necessary}} to have a clear factual base in one state and that must be accompanied by an animus semper manendi (intention to reside indefinitely).

50|$|One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} cases on this topic is the Canadian Supreme Court case of Schwebel v Ungar 1964 48 DLR (2d) 644 in which a Jewish husband and wife, domiciled in Hungary, married in Hungary. While they were emigrating to Israel, they found themselves in Italy and the husband divorced his wife by get. Under the laws of Hungary (their lex domicilii) and Italy, the religious form of divorce was invalid, but it was recognised as effective by the law of Israel where they acquired a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Subsequently, the wife moved to Canada and, without abandoning her Israeli domicile, went through a second ceremony of marriage. The second husband petitioned for nullity alleging that the marriage was bigamous. The Supreme Court held the marriage to be valid. The main question was the wife's capacity to marry which, under Canadian law, is determined by her lex domicilii, i.e. the law of Israel {{at the time of the}} second ceremony. The incidental question was the validity of the divorce which was to be determined either by their lex domicilii at the relevant time or by Italian law as the lex loci actus. The judgment seems to suggest that the court decided both questions by reference to the law of Israel as the law governing the main question.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of domicilium as a {{criterion}} in choice of law and jurisdiction in South African law with special reference to private-law status. In {{this area of the}} law adherence to the status theory has, in the recent past, resulted in {{the use of}} domicile as an exclusive ratio jurisdictionis. This has impacted negatively on choice of law issues in status matters: since domicile constituted the sole jurisdictional criterion, little attention was devoted to choice of law. Even though the lex domicilii was, in actual fact, applied to choice of law issues concerning private-law status, it happened only {{as a result of the}} assumption of jurisdiction by the forum domicilii. With the emergence of alternative jurisdictional criteria, such as ordinary residence, choice of law issues will have to be addressed from a conflict of laws perspective, since the jurisdictional criteria will no longer ensure the application of the appropriate lex causae. In this regard recognition of the functional diversification of jurisdictional and conflicts connecting factors is crucial: different principles and policies underlie the fields of jurisdiction and choice of law and this must be borne in mind when a connecting factor is selected. In view of the prominence of domicilium as a connecting factor, problem areas in regard to the interpretation and ascertainment of domicile, especially the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> is investigated within the context of the Domicile Act 3 of 1992 and with a view to future reform. It is submitted that the subjective animus requirement for the acquisition of a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> remains uncertain and undefined. Since domicile constitutes such an important connecting factor in issues pertaining to private-law status, as well as other non-status matters, it is essential that it should be readily and easily ascertainable. In this regard certain concrete proposals for future reform are advanced. Ultimately the domicile of an individual should indicate the community to which he/she truly belongs: only then will domicile constitute a conflicts connecting factor which satisfies the demands of conflicts justice.

40|$|In {{the public}} debate sparked by the {{corporate}} scandals of the last years, Delaware has been strikingly absent. In contrast to the high profile activity of Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock exchanges, federal prosecutors, and even state law enforcement officials, Delaware has been largely mute: no legislation; no rule-making; no criminal investigations; few headlines. In this Article, we use Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s relative passivity during this latest episode of corporate law-making {{as a starting point}} in the analysis of the shape of American corporate federalism and Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s place within it. We argue that Delaware long ago opted for what we will call a 2 ̆ 2 classical 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 219 th-century 2 ̆ 2 common law model of corporate law-making. In Delaware, corporate law is largely judge-made; judicial opinions are filled with quasi-deterministic reasoning; statutory law is comparatively narrow and rarely subject of partisan disputes; the judiciary as well is relatively non-partisan and has claim to technical expertise; and the law is enforced through litigation brought by private parties. We view these traits through the lens of the institutional and political landscape in which Delaware must operate. This landscape is characterized by a federalist system in which Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory powers co-exist with, and can be constrained by, the powers of the federal government. In this system, Delaware is faced with the threat that populist pressures will lead to a federal preemption of Delaware corporate law and thus eradicate the huge profits Delaware derives from being the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for public-traded U. S. corporations. By creating and enhancing an apolitical gloss over Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s corporate law, the various traits we identify help shield Delaware against this threat. At the same time, the scope of Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s corporate law is designed to minimize conflicts by assuring that Delaware has the requisite personal jurisdiction over defendants to enforce its law effectively and that the prevailing conflict rules point to substantive Delaware law as applicable to a corporate law dispute. But this classical model of law making carries with it intrinsic limitations. Specifically, legal change is slow, standard-based and incremental. Faced with the recent corporate scandals, calls for action, and Sturm und Drang, Delaware reacted accordingly: Basically, it does nothing until cases are brought. Any more pro-active response by Delaware actors would have threatened to undermine the political legitimacy achieved by Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the classical common law model. But because the classical common law style, together with jurisdictional and conflict rules, constrain Delaware, federal law is needed to complement Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s. In that respect, the relation between federal law and Delaware law is symbiotic, rather than antagonistic: Delaware is happy to have federal law pick up the slack and thereby reduce the likelihood that ineffective regulation produces a populist backlash...|$|E
40|$|The Lehane matter wound its {{way through}} the Cape Provincial Division of the High Court and reached the Supreme Court of Appeal. Mr Dunne, the Irish debtor who had taken up {{residence}} in the United States of America, ran an international web of companies, including Lagoon Beach Hotel, which operated a Cape Town hotel. He filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States and soon was also bankrupted by the Irish High Court. The Irish official assignee, Lehane, applied to the Cape court for recognition and assistance, and succeeded at every stage of the South African proceedings. Initially, Steyn J recognised Lehane as the foreign trustee as though a sequestration order had been granted against Mr Dunne in terms of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936, thus diverging from the approach taken by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Singularis Holdings Ltd v PricewaterhouseCoopers (Bermuda). Subsequently, Yekiso J's approach to applying the Insolvency Act without derogating from its generality opens up the possibility of applying section 21 of the Insolvency Act to significant effect against Mrs Dunne's South African property. Yet the territorialist restriction in Yekiso J's order that only creditors with causes of action which arose in South Africa were entitled to claim against the insolvent estate excluded many foreign creditors, even those from the Republic of Ireland (Eire). Of the many issues raised by the Lagoon Beach Hotel company, two chosen for discussion in this case note are the possible application of the automatic stay under section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code 1978 to the South African proceedings, and the standing of Lehane because of the litigants' dispute whether Mr Dunne was domiciled in the United States or Ireland. Yekiso J and subsequently Leach JA held that the American automatic stay did not govern the South African proceedings. Significantly, the American and the Irish trustees were co-operating with respect to proceedings in Ireland and South Africa that involved Mr Dunne. And Leach JA deftly deferred to the Irish court the decision regarding the application of the American automatic stay and its relevance to the Irish proceedings. As for the disputed domicile of Mr Dunne, Yekiso J and Leach JA both considered that Mr Dunne had retained his Irish domicile. Leach JA, though, went on to discuss the assistance that might cautiously be accorded to Lehane if Mr Dunne were domiciled elsewhere than in Ireland. Even then, the relevance of domicile could not be gainsaid. Comparison with the relevant judgments of the Irish courts shows that they also regarded Mr Dunne as having retained his Irish domicile and not having acquired a new <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in the United States. In the comments, it is pointed out that trustees appointed in countries other than the insolvent's domicile may still be recognised by South African courts. The insolvent's submitting to the jurisdiction of a court that is not the court of his domicile is discussed; on its facts, the cited authority does not bear out the relevant principle. Further, the possibility of recognising non-domiciliary trustees in exceptional circumstances and for exceptional convenience is explored. The cases cited in support of this principle are shown to yield differing results. ...|$|E
