5|$|Filmmakers have mimicked it many times, such as Lee Marvin's {{character}} splashing scalding {{coffee in}} the face of Gloria Grahame in The Big Heat. Cagney himself was offered grapefruit in almost every restaurant he visited for years after, and Clarke claimed <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> ruined her career because of typecasting.|$|E

5|$|Chile, {{facing the}} Pacific Ocean, {{has a large}} British presence. Over 50,000 British {{immigrants}} settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially {{in the city of}} Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe.|$|E

50|$|The Death of a Lumberjack {{is one of}} {{director}} Gilles Carle's better films, admired in Quebec, although <b>it’s</b> <b>virtually</b> unknown {{in the rest of}} Canada. It won Canadian Film Awards for Supporting Actor (Lamothe) and Musical Score.|$|R
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E

25|$|Flicking is not {{universal}} amongst bassoonists; some American players, principally on the East Coast, use it sparingly, if at all. The rest use <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> 100% of the time—it {{has become}} in essence {{part of the}} fingering.|$|E
25|$|Elaborate {{constraints}} {{placed on}} women's figures {{over the years}} were not universal. Corsetry made <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to work, so simpler functional garments were worn by women who worked inside or outside the home. Support for the breasts was often provided by a simple tie under the breast line, in the bodice.|$|E
25|$|One sees a {{hyperbola}} whenever catching {{sight of}} {{a portion of a}} circle cut by one's lens plane.

25|$|The {{butterfly}} effect {{can also be}} demonstrated by very simple systems. For example, the randomness of the outcomes of throwing dice depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to throw a dice {{exactly the same way}} twice.|$|E
25|$|After President Bill Clinton visited Vietnam in 2000, <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> {{marked the}} new era of Vietnam. Vietnam has become an {{increasingly}} attractive destination of economic development. Throughout that time, Vietnam has played more {{significant role in the}} world's stage. Its economic reforms successfully changed Vietnam and making Vietnam more relevant in the ASEAN and international stage. Also, due to Vietnam's importance, many powers turn to be favoring Vietnam for their circumstances.|$|E

25|$|In 1889, {{the sisters}} {{accepted}} {{a gift of}} land southeast of the city for a larger hospital, St. Raphael’s, and the new facility opened on May 30, 1890. However, {{the failure of the}} city to extend roads and bridges to the area made <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> inaccessible. The hospital never held more than seven patients at a time. Ten years later, a new hospital was constructed adjacent to the original building in 1900.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} for Spanish rulers of Honduras was the {{activity}} of the English along the northern Caribbean coast. These activities began in the late 16th century and continued into the 19th century. In the early years, Dutch as well as English corsairs (pirates) attacked the Caribbean coast, but as time passed the threat came almost exclusively from the English. In 1643 one English expedition destroyed the town of Trujillo, the major port for Honduras, leaving <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> abandoned for over a century.|$|E
25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, {{in a sunny}} position. It is drought tolerant, and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, so should be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> impossible to strike stem cuttings, and heel cuttings have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and has an excellent success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|E
50|$|The {{other factor}} is string availability: <b>it's</b> <b>virtually</b> {{impossible}} to find such strings on sale in some regions, and prices for such rare imported goods may go up to 400-500%. Note that as of 1/26/2017, 14 years after the bridge was released to the public, you cannot buy these strings anywhere. Without the ability to replace strings, these bridges are essentially useless.|$|R

25|$|At {{the heart}} of Gwalior is Gwalior Fort of the Tomara dynasty. This {{formidable}} structure was reputed {{to be one of}} the most structurally sound forts of India, having been improved by Raja Man Singh Tomar where a previous structure existed. It occupies an isolated rock outcrop. The hill is steepened to make <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> unscalable and is surrounded by high walls which enclose buildings from several periods. The old town of Gwalior lies at the eastern base of the fortress. Lashkar, founded by Daulat Rao Scindia, formerly a separate town that originated as a military camp, lies to the south, and Morar, also a formerly separate town, lies to the east. Gwalior, Lashkar and Morar are part of the Gwalior Municipal Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Some of the dialects had until {{recently}} extensions across {{the borders of}} other standard language areas. In most cases the heavy influence of the standard language has broken the dialect continuum. Examples are the Gronings dialect spoken in Groningen {{as well as the}} closely related varieties in adjacent East Frisia (Germany). South Guelderish (Zuid-Gelders) is a dialect spoken in Gelderland (Netherlands) and in closely related varieties in adjacent parts of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). Limburgish (Limburgs) is spoken in Limburg (Belgium) as well as in Limburg (Netherlands) and extends across the German border. West Flemish (Westvlaams) is spoken in West Flanders, the western part of Zeelandic Flanders and also in French Flanders, where <b>it</b> <b>virtually</b> became extinct to make way for French.|$|E
