5|$|Researchers {{have noted}} that fires appear in cycles {{associated}} {{with those of the}} hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer {{due to the lack of}} lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive. A longer <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of charcoal have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 BCE.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evaluate {{the effect}} of {{different}} veneering techniques, Y-TZP core thicknesses, and <b>firing</b> <b>cycles</b> with different heat rates and holding times on the mechanical properties of veneering porcelain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biaxial flexural strength and Thermal shock resistance tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain. Core material, Y-TZP and two porcelain veneers, IPS e. max Ceram and VITA VM 9, were used in this study. Vita YZ zirconia blocks were sectioned and sintered to provide slabs of 1. 65, 3. 25, and 6. 50 mm in thickness. Two techniques were used to fabricate VITA VM 9 and e. max Ceram porcelain veneer porcelain discs, Hand Layered, mixing powder with manufacturer’s molding liquid, condensed in a mold, and Pressed, pressing powder uniaxially in a mold. A layer of carbon paint {{was applied to the}} zirconia to allow removal of the porcelain discs. For thermal shock test the veneering porcelain fired on the Y-TZP core with a wash layer. After the veneer discs were fabricated, they were sintered: (1) According to the manufacturer’s instructions; (2) Two different cycles with slower heat rate and longer holding than the recommended value. Biaxial flexural strength was determined using a universal mechanical tester. Thermal shock tests were performed using a Pober thermal shock device. Statistical analysis was conducted for all tests using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test at p= 0. 05. RESULTS: There was significant effect from changes of YZ Core thickness, <b>firing</b> <b>cycle,</b> and veneer technique on the mechanical properties of porcelain veneer. The veneering technique had the largest impact on the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain followed by <b>firing</b> <b>cycle,</b> followed by YZ core thickness. In using different <b>firing</b> <b>cycles</b> with different heat rates and holding times, slowing the heating rate had more influence on the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain. In measuring the surface temperature of the Y-TZP/VITA VM 9 assembly, the specimen surface temperature was coincidental with the furnace programmed <b>firing</b> <b>cycle</b> using a slower heating rate <b>firing</b> <b>cycle.</b> CONCLUSIONS Veneering technique, slower heat rate <b>firing</b> <b>cycle,</b> and Y-TZP core thickness have significant impact on veneering porcelain mechanical properties. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

5000|$|A common {{belief is}} that the closed-bolt design of Autocockers makes them {{inherently}} more accurate than open-bolt markers.

5000|$|Other {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that the 20th century change in the <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> is a result of climate change. A 1993 study by Bergeron & Archambault said: [...] "post-'Little Ice Age' climate change has profoundly decreased the frequency of fires in the northwestern Québec boreal forest" [...] Critics have also highlighted that small fires are virtually unreported in areas without aggressive fire suppression policies, where detection often relies on reports from settlements or commercial aircraft, leading to incorrect average fire size data for those regions.|$|E
50|$|Another hypothesis, {{called the}} <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> hypothesis, argues that {{periodic}} flowering followed by {{death of the}} adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in the habitat, thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow. This argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load, and also a large target for lightning strikes, increasing the likelihood of wildfire.

Roughness and hardness measurements as well as tensile and flexural mechanical tests were performed to study the mechanical response of the alloy while X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, STEM) techniques and microanalysis (EDX) were used to investigate sample microstructure. Results evidenced {{a difference in the}} mechanical response of tensile samples built in orthogonal directions. In terms of microstructure, samples not submitted to the <b>firing</b> <b>cycle</b> show a single phase acicular α’ (hcp) structure typical of metal parts subject to high cooling rates.

50|$|However, {{both have}} been disputed for {{different}} reasons. The predator satiation hypothesis does not explain why the flowering cycle is 10 times longer than the lifespan of the local rodents, something not predicted. The bamboo <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> hypothesis is considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable; they argue that fires only result from humans {{and there is no}} natural fire in India. This notion is considered wrong based on distribution of lightning strike data during the dry season throughout India. However, another argument against this is the lack of precedent for any living organism to harness something as unpredictable as lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part of natural evolutionary progress.|$|E

50|$|Fire {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} factors shaping the composition and development of boreal forest stands (Rowe 1955); it is the dominant stand-renewing disturbance through much of the Canadian boreal forest (Amiro et al. 2001). The fire history that characterizes an ecosystem is its fire regime, which has 3 elements: (1) fire type and intensity (e.g., crown fires, severe surface fires, and light surface fires), (2) size of typical fires of significance, and (3) frequency or return intervals for specific land units (Heinselman 1981). The average time within a fire regime to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem is its fire rotation (Heinselman 1973) or <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> (Van Wagner 1978). However, as Heinselman (1981) noted, each physiographic site tends to have its own return interval, so that some areas are skipped for long periods, while others might burn two-times or more often during a nominal fire rotation.|$|E
30|$|La Mauricie National Park (LMNP) is a 536 km 2 {{area at the}} {{transition}} of hardwood and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus Douglas ex D. Don) stands of the Mixedwood Plains and the forests of the Eastern Boreal Shield ecozones, approximately 200 km NE of Montreal, Quebec (Figure 1). The park region has a complex fire history and {{is characterized by a}} mosaic of conifer, mixedwood, and deciduous forest vegetation. Eastern white pine is found in low numbers scattered throughout the park region with a few remaining stands along waterways. Red oak (Quercus rubra L.) is rare but occurs in association with maple (Acer L.) forests and mainly on hilltops in southern sections of the park. White pine and red oak are both recognized to be fire-adapted and to rely on potentially short <b>fire</b> <b>cycles</b> of < 100 years (Cwyner 1977, Loope and Anderton 1998, Dey and Guyette 2000). Boreal forests at higher elevations have moderately long <b>fire</b> <b>cycles</b> of 100 yr to 200 yr (Bergeron et al. 2004 b) within a mosaic of very long <b>fire</b> <b>cycles</b> in the eastern hardwood forest (Talon et al. 2005). The relatively short <b>fire</b> <b>cycles</b> near Quebec water bodies. as determined from tree-ring studies has, at times, been an enigma to ecologists. Bergeron (1991) suggested that this could be due to potentially unique lightning ignition patterns near lakes. Alternatively, historians and anthropologists propose that {{this may be due to}} human land use patterns along river and lake travel routes (Lewis and Ferguson 1988, Loope and Anderton 1998, Dods 2004).|$|R

50|$|Forest Biorefinery and Biomass Utilization: The FPL is well-placed {{to pursue}} {{research}} opportunities {{to improve the}} economics of producing transportation fuel, bioenergy, and chemicals from woody biomass. Development of profitable biorefineries helps {{lower the cost of}} forest management, improves forest health, advances sustainable forest management practices, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, and decreases production of greenhouse gases. Decades of fire suppression have disrupted the natural <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> of U.S. forests, resulting in an estimated 8.4 billion dry tons of material that needs to be removed from the National Forests to improve their resiliency. This material is available for production of wood products, chemicals, and energy, yet profitable uses for the material are needed to reduce the costs of forest management. Business concepts that focus on converting wood resources into liquid fuels and chemical feedstock are becoming cost competitive. As international concerns over global warming and greenhouse gas generation rise, governmental support for biofuels is increasing and likely reduces investment risks. Fuels derived from biomass are generally regarded as greenhouse gas neutral because the amount of carbon dioxide released on combustion equals the amount adsorbed from the atmosphere and sequestered by the plant through photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The terpenoid {{compounds}} in big sagebrush {{are thought to}} ward off herbivores. These oils, at high concentrations, are toxic to the symbiotic bacteria in the rumen of some ruminants like deer and cattle. Pronghorn are the only large herbivore to browse sagebrush extensively. Damage to sagebrush plants caused by grazing herbivores results in the release of volatile chemicals, which are used to signal a warning to nearby plants, {{so that they can}} increase the production of repellent chemical compounds. This plant-to-plant communication can take place at distances of up to 60 cm.Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing, invasive plant species, wildfires, and climate change. The cattle industry burns large areas of sagebrush habitat to make way for grazing animals. Due to large periods of time where sagebrush was the primary shrub, many species have become adapted to this habitat. The burning of the shrubs leads to habitat loss of many species and can be very detrimental to the ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, the destruction of native grasses and forbs by grazing and fire creates conditions where invasive plants colonize the area. The invasive species which has destroyed the largest amount of sagebrush habitat is cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). Since its accidental introduction in the 1890s, cheatgrass has radically altered the native shrub ecosystem by replacing indigenous vegetation, and by creating a <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> that is too frequent to allow sagebrush to re-establish itself. Sagebrush is not fire-tolerant and relies on wind-blown seeds from outside the burned area for re-establishment. Some tree species have also been encroaching on big sagebrush habitat. For example, in the Warner Mountains in California white fir (Abies concolor) has been out-competing big sagebrush.|$|E
30|$|Each {{landscape}} {{is characterized by}} a relative proportion of trees originating from various fire periods. To define the <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> for each landscape, we associated an age to each fire period (ex. 1920 [*]=[*] 80  years in 2000) and calculated a weighted mean, which corresponds to the <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> (Bergeron et al. 2001). <b>Fire</b> <b>cycle</b> mapping was compared to species distribution to determine whether the shortest <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> was associated with fire-prone species, such as Pinus banksiana (Dix & Swan 1971). Considering the small difference in fire cycles of adjacent landscapes, we grouped these landscapes to form three main fire cycles (Additional file 1 : Appendix 3). These fire cycles were subsequently used to characterize the age structure of each landscape by considering the negative exponential proposed by Van Wagner (1978) (Additional file 1 : Appendix 2). For example, the <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> for landscape 9 is 146  years. This <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is similar to that of}} other landscapes (e.g. 6 and 5). We classified these landscapes together in the same main <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> of 140  years (Additional file 1 : Appendix 3 b).|$|E

30|$|The natural {{variability}} of each <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> was determined {{on the basis}} of contemporary and Holocene studies (Additional file 1 : Appendix  3). For the three main fire cycles (110, 140, 180  years), the natural variability extends from approximately 50 to 350  years. This is a very long time range, and we estimate that it reflects total contemporary and Holocene <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> variability.

30|$|The third <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> (180  years) is {{associated}} to landscapes {{characterized by a}} relatively high proportion of stands of the 1850 period (Table 1, Additional file 1 : Appendix 3 b) and the scarcity of Pinus banksiana. Four landscapes compose this third cycle. They are homogeneous, {{with the exception of}} Landscape 1, which is distinguished by its large proportion of organic deposits and the abundance of forest stands originating from the 1850 period (Table 1). This landscape also has a long temporal <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> (446  years) (Cyr et al. 2005) and a relatively high proportion of forests more than 100  years old (Additional file 1 : Appendix  6). However, considering the length of the historical <b>fire</b> <b>cycle</b> (146  years) reported by Bergeron et al.
