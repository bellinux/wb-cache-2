5|$|Ambohimanga {{has been}} viewed by many Merina since the late 19th century as the {{embodiment}} of an ideal social order blessed by the ancestors. The significance attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to a sense that Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles (andriana) believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction (hasina) to serve as the national capital and imbue national leaders with the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country.

5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries.

A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance <b>in</b> <b>promoting</b> emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
