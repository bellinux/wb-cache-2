Taking the French-based international photographic bureau Magnum as a model, Jesper Høm, Gregers Nielsen and others set up Delta Photos, a group designed to support journalistic photography.|$|E

5|$|Although the Eskaya {{had been}} known to {{people living in the}} {{vicinity}} of Bohol’s southeast highlands prior to World War II, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s that they came to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies. Local journalists and researchers have since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there is still no broad consensus on the subject.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations {{to avoid the}} lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow {{and they would be}} assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Swiss Air Force began in 1914with the {{establishment}} of an ad hoc force consisting of a handful of men in outdated and largely civilian aircraft. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s that an effective air force was established at great cost, capable of inflicting several embarrassing defeats on the Nazi Luftwaffe in the course of an initially vigorous defence of neutral Swiss airspace. The Swiss Air Force as an autonomous military service was created in October 1936. After World War II it was renamed the Swiss Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Command (Schweizerische Flugwaffe Kommando der Flieger und Fliegerabwehrtruppen) and in 1996became a separate service independent from the Army, under its present name Schweizer Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s {{with the development of}} Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E
5|$|The verdict (8 November 2013) and {{sentence}} (6 December 2013) {{were both}} {{delivered at the}} Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a court-martial) was Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried with it a mandatory life sentence, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> judge advocate's and court-martial board's power {{to decide on the}} minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E

5|$|Until 1907, it was policy not {{to award}} the VC posthumously. Between 1857 and 1901, nine notices were {{published}} in the London Gazette for soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, medals were sent to the next of kin of the three mentioned for the Boer War {{and at the same time}} the first three official posthumous awards, again for the Boer War, were gazetted. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. As a result of the change of policy, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general revision of the warrant issued in 1920 that a clause was inserted to explicitly allow posthumous awards.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{won their}} first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back Ricky Bell {{recorded}} 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Bell's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record, tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII, while the Eagles' Wilbert Montgomery {{was held to}} 35 yards on 12 attempts. The Buccaneers' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown, and a Neil O'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10–0 lead. Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4-yard line and led to Bell's second touchdown run, giving the Buccaneers a 17–0 second-quarter lead. Trying to extend that lead before halftime, Doug Williams hurried a pass that {{wound up in the}} hands of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11-yard line. This set up Ron Jaworski's touchdown pass to Charles Smith. After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17–10 on a Tony Franklin field goal, a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles' rally. A 9-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers' scoring. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together a long drive, ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael. The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game. The Buccaneers' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery. At one point, when Leroy Harris was gang-tackled following a short reception, the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing. The Buccaneers' hard-hitting play intimidated the Eagles' receivers into dropping 10 passes. Going into the matchup, the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience. Jaworski was the third-rated quarterback in the NFC, while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks. The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals, McKay of USC and Dick Vermeil of UCLA. The game was the Buccaneers' first on national television. Word of the upset spread as far as Iran, where the hostages were surprised to learn of the Buccaneers' contention for the Super Bowl.|$|E
