40|$|In {{traditional}} trade models, whether {{based on}} technological differences or on relative factor endowments, merchandise composition and <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> {{are derived from}} closed-economy conditions. But nowadays {{one of the basic}} assumptions <b>of</b> traditional <b>trade</b> models, i. e. that production processes are integrated within just one country, is being increasingly violated as previously integrated productive activities are segmented and spread over an international network of production sites: as a result, an increasingly large share <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> flows is made up of intermediate and unfinished goods being transferred from one country to another in order to be processed. In this paper we submit that such new configuration of production processes has important effects on at least three dimensions of economic research. First, we show that international disintegration of production processes leads to a lessening of the power of comparative advantages when it comes to explaining both merchandise composition and <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> while it is the concept of absolute advantage to become increasingly relevant; second, we show that empirical measures of revealed comparative advantages are inherently misleading if they do not account for differences in the stage-of-processing <b>of</b> <b>traded</b> goods; third, we estimate a simple model of aggregate demand accounting for international trade in intermediates: results of estimation lend support to our prior that participation of a country in the process of international fragmentation of production plays a specific and significant role in determining its year-over-year change in GDP.

5000|$|There {{are three}} ports on the Slovenian coast. The traffic is mostly international. The major is the Port of Koper, built in 1957. It is a feeder port. It is about [...] closer to {{destinations}} {{east of the}} Suez than the ports of Northern Europe, and the land transport from Koper by road and by railway to the main industrial centres in Central Europe is approximately 500 km shorter than from Northern European ports. It is multimodal {{and one of the}} most modern in this part of the world, but its development is hindered by the lack of sufficient depth. From it, there are reliable and regular shipping container lines to all major world ports. The port has been rapidly growing and in 2011, more than 17 million tonnes (16,7 million long tons, 18,7 million short tons) of cargo passed through it. It is the largest Northern Adriatic port in terms of container transport. In 2011, almost 590,000 TEUs passed through it. There is a skewed balance in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> flows in the Port of Koper where import flows clearly outweigh export flows. The majority of maritime passenger traffic in Slovenia takes place in Koper, where a passenger terminal was completed in 2005. It has recorded about 100,000 passengers in 2011, and has been visited by the largest passenger ships, such as the MS Voyager of the Seas. The two smaller ports used for the international passenger transport are located in Izola and Piran. The Port of Piran is also used for the international transport of salt, whereas the Port of Izola is used for fish disembarkation. Passenger transport in Slovenia takes place mainly with Italy and Croatia. The only shipping company of Slovenia is Splošna plovba. It operates 28 ships with 1,025,000 tonnes of tonnage. It transports freight and is active only in foreign ports.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) <b>Direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade</b> Statistics (DOTS) database contains data {{on the value of}} merchandise exports and imports between each country and all its trading partners. Total bilateral and multilateral exports and imports are aggregated at national or regional group level. For each reporting country or group, all the trading partners are listed. The corresponding monetary values of total imports and total exports are then provided as time series for each country/trading partner pair. All exports are valued free on board (f. o. b.). Imports are usually reported cost including insurance and freight (c. i. f.), although a small number of countries report imports f. o. b. Along with data from reporting countries, estimates are provided by partner countries for non-reporting countries or for those that are slow to report. The period for which data are available varies from country to country, but most countries data extend from the 1980 s to the present. The <b>Direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade</b> pre- 1980 data is found in the DOTS Historical database which runs from 1948 to 1980. There can be inconsistencies between exports to a partner and the partner's recorded imports from a particular country, i. e. the exports from Country A to B do not always equal the imports of Country B from A. This is due to the different ways countries report their trade, i. e. differences in classification concepts and detail, time of recording, valuation, and coverage, as well as processing errors. This database was first provided by UK Data Service in December 2003. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IMF <b>Direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade</b> Statistics holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This study {{attempts}} {{to show that}} competitive advantage alone does not determine the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in kraft liner.

Future demand in the E. E. C. for foreign kraft liner was deduced from estimates of corrugated production related to a basic economic indicator in each member country. The competitive advantage of each supplying area [...] British Columbia, Eastern Canada, Sweden, Finland and the Southern United States [...] was obtained by analyzing production and transportation costs to the E. E. C. The competitive advantage of each supplying area [...] defined as {{the difference between the}} CIF price and total cost (production plus transportation costs) [...] was calculated in order to see if it explained fully past and actual <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> As the U.

The relation between probability, of repeated exports (export loyalty) and sales abroad of U. S. subsidiaries in the pulp and paper industry were shown by use of a Markov chain process.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} essays on topics related to market microstructure. In the first essay, we analyze algorithmic trading in the Korean Index Futures market. We document that short-term traders consistently anticipate the order flow of large traders that build large positions {{within a short}} period of time. We study trade-by-trade data around 36, 164 trades by large traders among the largest 1 % <b>of</b> all active <b>trades</b> during 66 trading days in 2009 from the Korean Index Futures market. We find that large traders manage their orders first by executing small, positively correlated trades, which are followed by a single large trade. While the small trades are executed, short-term traders gradually increase their inventories in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the forthcoming large trade. After the execution <b>of</b> the large <b>trade,</b> short-term traders unload their inventories to other traders. We find that short-term traders correctly anticipate the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> large <b>trades</b> 56. 06 % of the time. Furthermore, the aggregate positions of short-term traders are statistically significant predictors for the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> large <b>trades</b> that will arrive within 120 seconds. In the second essay, we explore market microstructure invariance in the Korean stock market. We define the number of buy-sell “switching points” {{based on the number of}} times that individual traders change the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> their <b>trading.</b> Based on the hypothesis that switching points take place in business time, market microstructure invariance predicts that the aggregate number of switching points is proportional to the 2 / 3 power of the product of dollar volume and volatility. Using trading data from the Korea Exchange (KRX) from 2008 to 2010, we estimate the exponent to be 0. 675 with standard error of 0. 005. Invariance explains about 93 % of the variation in the logarithm of the number of switching points each month across stocks...|$|R
