25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they often feel self-conscious or <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed,</b> and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E
25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} sexual {{harassment}} can vary. In research {{carried out by the}} EU Agency for Fundamental Human Rights research, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29 %) who has experienced sexual harassment says that she felt fearful {{as a result of the}} most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made her <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.|$|E

25|$|Since Lê Văn Hưu highly treasured the {{independence}} of Vietnam, he often had negative comments on historical figures who was considered by Lê Văn Hưu being more or less responsible {{for the loss of}} the country's autonomy to its northern neighbour such as the chancellor Lữ Gia of Nam Việt or Lý Nam Đế. While the contemporary opinion praised Lý Nam Đế as a national hero of Vietnam for his revolt against the Liang dynasty, Lê Văn Hưu criticized Lý Nam Đế's ability because he was ultimately defeated and hence Vietnam lost its independence one more time. However, Lê Văn Hưu saved his best praise for the Trưng Sisters who led the resistance movement against the Han dynasty and were finally put down by the army of Ma Yuan in 42. In Lê Văn Hưu's words, the men of Vietnam had to <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> of their surrender to the northerners while the Trưng Sisters, who were women, fiercely fought for the country. About Chinese rulers of Vietnam, Lê Văn Hưu gave favorable remarks for ones who contributed to the stability of the country, the historian respectfully called the prefect Sĩ Nhiếp as Sĩ Vương (King Sĩ) who kept the autonomous status of Vietnam from the direct administration of the Eastern Wu for a long period.|$|E

Bassist Wendy Drennen said that [...] "Unbreakable" [...] was about [...] "overcoming a {{defeated}} mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, [...] "Where {{are the people that}} accused me?" [...] Richardson said, [...] "The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> for accusing her ...

500|$|Such {{dramatic}} situations often polarize online communities. [...] Many members <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> {{for believing}} elaborate lies, while others remain staunch supporters. Members who admit to feigning their conditions often respond by implicating the gullibility of forum members, suggesting {{it is their}} own fault for being deceived. Feldman admits that an element of sadism may be evident {{in some of the}} more egregious abuses of trust. Pam Cohen, a grief counselor who witnessed the outpouring of emotion for Kaycee Nicole, likened the personal devastation resulting from genuine concern, sympathy, and support that forum members gave to the 19-year-old and her mother, only to discover none of it was true, to [...] "emotional rape". Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler, in Social Science Computer Review, address deception perpetrated on some forums—specifically IRC and multi-user dungeons—and state that masquerading is so common that hoaxes are expected, and their perpetrators are sometimes even praised for creating realistic ones.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America — free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E

2500|$|His {{rival in}} {{dramatic}} art (and supposedly in the affections of Glycera) was Philemon, {{who appears to}} have been more popular. Menander, however, believed himself to be the better dramatist, and, according to Aulus Gellius, used to ask Philemon: [...] "Don't you <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> whenever you gain a victory over me?" [...] According to Caecilius of Calacte (Porphyry in Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica) Menander was accused of plagiarism, as his The Superstitious Man was taken from The Augur of Antiphanes, but reworkings and variations on a theme of this sort were commonplace and so the charge is a complicated one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundaries}} between concepts of shame, guilt, and embarrassment {{are not easily}} delineated. According to cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict, shame {{is a violation of}} cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one's internal values. Thus shame arises when one's 'defects' are exposed to others, and results from the negative evaluation (whether real or imagined) of others; guilt, on the other hand, comes from one's own negative evaluation of oneself, for instance, when one acts contrary to one's values or idea of one's self. (Thus, {{it might be possible to}} <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> of thought or behavior that no one actually knows about [...] and conversely, to feel guilty about actions that gain the approval of others.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Peter Schäfer {{concluded}} that the references were not from the early tannaitic period (1st and 2nd centuries) but rather from the 3rd and 4th centuries, during the amoraic period. [...] He asserts that the references in the Babylonian Talmud were [...] "polemical counter-narratives that parody the New Testament stories, most notably the story of Jesus' birth and death" [...] and that the rabbinical authors {{were familiar with the}} Gospels (particularly the Gospel of John) in their form as the Diatessaron and the Peshitta, the New Testament of the Syrian Church. Schäfer argues that the message conveyed in the Talmud was a [...] "bold and self-confident" [...] assertion of correctness of Judaism, maintaining that [...] "there is no reason to <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> because we rightfully executed a blasphemer and idolater." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 19th century, the Breton {{language}} {{started to}} decline precipitously, {{mainly because of}} the Francization policy conducted under the Third Republic. On one hand, children were not allowed to speak Breton at school, and were punished by teachers if they did. Famously, signs in schools read: [...] "It is forbidden to speak Breton and to spit on the floor" [...] ("Il est interdit de parler Breton et de cracher par terre"). On the other hand, Breton (like Latin) was considered as a language that kept Brittany {{in the hands of the}} Roman Catholic church and learning French was a way, especially for women, to free themselves from the influence of the church. As a result, a generation of native Breton speakers were made to <b>feel</b> <b>ashamed</b> of their language and avoided speaking it or teaching it to their children. These factors contributed to the decline of Breton.|$|E
