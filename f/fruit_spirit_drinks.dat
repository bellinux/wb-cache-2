40|$|Two basic {{categories}} of the <b>spirit</b> <b>drink</b> Tequila can be distinguished according to Mexican law. For the high quality category "Tequila 100 % de Agave" only pure agave juice is allowed to be fermented and distilled. Otherwise, the product is a "Mixto-Tequila", which is manufactured by adding up to 49 % of sugar to the Agave wort. The sensory analysis using ranking methods showed significant differences between Tequila samples of both categories. The premium products with 100 % of Agave were preferred by the test panel. Especially matured products (reposado and añejo Tequilas) had a harmonically mellow aroma and were comparable to premium <b>fruit</b> <b>spirits</b> or whiskies. The worldwide trend leading to a preference of "Tequila 100 % de Agave" should be no longer ignored by the German market dominated so far by Mixto-products...|$|R

40|$|Cheap licit and artisanal illicit <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> {{have been}} {{associated}} with numerous outbreaks of alcohol poisoning especially with methanol. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of cheap <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> in Kibera slums in Nairobi County, Kenya. The samples consisted of cheap licit spirits (n = 11) and the artisanal <b>spirit</b> <b>drink,</b> ‘chang’aa’, (n = 28). The parameters of alcoholic strength and volatile composition were used as indicators of quality and were determined using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) respectively. The ranges for alcoholic strength were 42. 8 – 85. 8 % vol and 28. 3 – 56. 7 % vol for chang’aa and licit <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> respectively, while the pH ranges were 3. 3 – 4. 2 and 4. 4 – 4. 8 for chang’aa and licit <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> respectively. The majority of volatiles were found in artisanal spirits and they included higher alcohols, ethyl esters and carbonyl compounds. The alcoholic strength of all the artisanal spirits (100 %) and 91 % of the licit spirits was above the 40 % vol of standard spirits such as vodka. The high ethanol content of the alcohol products was the only element of public health significance in this study...|$|R

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} {{in the production of}} <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> and using them in the human diet, especially in the Southeast European and Mediterranean regions. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether and which spirits can serve, and to what extent, as a source of biologically active compounds in the human diet. Polyphenolic compounds are biologically active compounds of fruits, vegetables and derived beverages, which have been implicated in their antioxidant activity. Therefore, the total polyphenol content (TPC) and antioxidative properties of 46 <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> and liqueurs produced in Croatia were examined. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were estimated using spectrophotometric methods (Folin-Ciocalteu, DPPH and FRAP), while certain phenols were detected by the HPLC. It was established that <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> aged in wooden casks, such as wine or plum brandy, contain polyphenols ranging from 40 - 90 mg GAE/L (gallic acid equivalents), whereas walnut or sour cherry liquors contain much more polyphenols ranging from 680 - 3360 mg GAE/L. The antioxidant activity of analyzed <b>spirit</b> <b>drinks</b> was in correlation with TPC. Walnut and sour cherry liqueur samples had very high antioxidant activity, within the range of those obtained with 1. 26 mM Trolox-DPPH assay and 9. 5 mM Trolox-FRAP assay...|$|R

40|$|In 2004 and 2007 twelve {{countries}} {{joined the}} European Union (EU), bringing about {{significant changes in}} the field of European agriculture. One of the major changes was the transformation of the agri-food trade of these countries. This paper analyses the effects of EU enlargement on the competitiveness of <b>fruit</b> <b>spirits</b> in six Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), especially regarding geographical indications, by using the theory of revealed comparative advantages. Although the majority of the studied CEEC <b>fruit</b> <b>spirits</b> was both competitive and had a comparative advantage in the EU- 15 beverages market in the period 2001 - 2011, during this time the competitiveness in terms of quality and price of <b>fruit</b> <b>spirits</b> in the region declined. The results indicate that these countries are losing their market positions in their traditional <b>fruit</b> <b>spirit</b> sector in the EU- 15 beverages market {{in spite of the fact}} that the majority of these products have a geographical indication. These changes are in line with the overall trend of an increasing trade deficit in the overall beverages, spirits and vinegar market of the six CEECs with the EU- 15 after 2003. By contrast, the well-known grappa of Italy is shown to be competitive in terms of both price and quality during this period. It is clear that such products with geographical indications can be competitive in European markets...|$|R
