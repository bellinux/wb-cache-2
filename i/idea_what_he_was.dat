500|$|Adelina Poerio {{was cast}} as the {{fleeting}} red-coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome. Standing at only 4'2" [...] tall, she had {{a career as a}} singer. Renato Scarpa was cast as Inspector Longhi, despite not being able to speak English and so he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying in the film.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but you had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> or {{what he was going}} to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{returned}} to his parents' home in Harlem in 1923 with no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do next. He considered returning to music, but an old school friend suggested that he try boxing. At one amateur match, fight announcer Joe Humphries saw the name [...] "Canagata, Lee" [...] on the card he was using. He tossed the card aside and instead announced [...] "Canada Lee"—a name that Lee liked and adopted. In the amateur ring he won 90 out of 100 bouts and the national amateur lightweight title.|$|E
50|$|Years later, {{he falls}} in love with Yvonne (Michelle Gayle), while on {{assignment}} in Britain; she has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> really employed to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mabane is an ass!" [...] I grunted. [...] "Be off, Arthur, there's a good chap, and don't {{listen to}} him. He hasn't the least <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> talking about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my life," [...] said Mr. Skimpole, shrugging his {{shoulders}} with his engaging smile, [...] "I have {{not the least}} <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to do then. But I have no doubt he'll do it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Aaron {{surmised that}} this setting would also return the Apollo 12 {{telemetry}} to normal. When {{he made the}} recommendation to the Flight Director, [...] "Flight, try SCE to Aux", most of his mission control colleagues had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about. Both the flight director and the Capcom asked him to repeat the recommendation. Pete Conrad's response to the order was, [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] Fortunately Alan Bean {{was familiar with the}} location of the SCE switch inside the capsule, and flipped it to auxiliary. Telemetry was immediately restored, allowing the mission to continue. This earned Aaron the lasting respect of his colleagues, who declared that he was a [...] "steely-eyed missile man".|$|E
2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E

50|$|John spots her on {{the street}} one day and excitedly brings up their evening together, but Nora has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> talking about and is greatly embarrassed, because this happens in front of Tim. She tells John he has misidentified her, and they rush away, leaving John confused.|$|R
6000|$|She gave a strange, small {{laugh as}} she said, [...] "I am afraid you think I {{know a great}} deal more about my husband's work than I do. I haven't the least <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing," [...] she added presently, in a {{slightly}} different, that is a more explanatory, tone, as if she recognized in some degree the enormity of her confession. [...] "I don't read <b>what</b> <b>he</b> writes!" ...|$|R
50|$|One day Joey Perrone {{returns home}} {{unexpectedly}} {{while her husband}} is filling in the doctored figures on a chart. As she has never taken any interest in her husband's work, Joey has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing, but Chaz is so paranoid that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> seized by a sudden fear that she might report him. Eventually, Perrone sees no other way out of his imagined predicament than to kill his wife. He begins to meticulously plan the perfect murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that's curious," [...] said Mr. Barclay. [...] "Do {{you suppose}} {{he meant to}} set the bed on fire, or have you any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is amazing," [...] he admitted, [...] "but {{it is the}} truth. I know it for a fact. The man was {{absolutely}} beside himself, he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} washed your hands of Merwell, Nat," [...] replied Dave, with warmth. [...] "He {{is not the}} sort for any respectable fellow to {{associate}} with. But about that letter. Have you any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do?" ...|$|E
50|$|Ross {{arrives and}} tells {{everyone}} Carol is pregnant, while Phoebe finds the engagement ring. Ross tells his friends that Carol and Susan {{want him to}} be involved, but only if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> comfortable with that. Ross informs the group that Carol and Susan invited him to go to their first sonogram appointment tomorrow and <b>he</b> has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to do. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> still processing {{the fact that he has}} become a father, and he doesn't know where he fits in with two lesbian mothers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{just tell}} you <b>what</b> Saloonio is: <b>he's</b> a type. Shakespeare means him to embody the type of the perfect Italian gentleman. <b>He's</b> an <b>idea,</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> <b>he's</b> a symbol, he's a unit--" ...|$|R
60|$|Having {{no choice}} I nodded {{my head in}} assent, though I had not the faintest <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to do. The tumult lessened somewhat, and once more the warriors drew back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never ’ad no sort of <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{like when}} I jined the ship, an’ {{he was quite}} quiet and peaceable until we {{was out in the}} open water. Then the cloven hoof showed itself, an’ he kicked one o’ the men for coming on deck with a dirty face, an’ though the man told him he never did wash becos his skin was so delikit, he sent the bos’en to turn the hose on him.|$|E
60|$|There were no hummocks, however, in the {{neighbourhood}} {{to enable}} them to approach unseen; but the Esquimaux was prepared for such a contingency. He had brought a small sledge, of about two feet in length by {{a foot and a half}} in breadth, which he now unfastened from the large sledge, and proceeded quietly to arrange it, to the surprise of his companions, who had not the least <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to do, and watched his proceedings with much interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you," [...] Sabatini repeated, [...] "that not only am I ignorant {{as to how}} the man met with his death, but I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing in the house at all. The night Rosario was there it was different. They were on his track then, without a doubt, and they meant mischief. Since then, however, there has been a {{pronounced}} difference of opinion between the two branches of the revolutionary party--the one which I represent and the one which includes Lalonde and his friends. The consequence is that although we may be said to be working for the same ends, we have drawn a little apart. We have had no communications whatever with Lalonde and his friends since the murder of Rosario. Therefore, I can only repeat that I am entirely in the dark as to what that man was doing in my sister's rooms or how he met with his death. You must remember that these fellows are all more or less criminals. Lalonde, I believe, is something of an exception, but the rest of them are at war with Society to the extent of enriching themselves at the expense of their wealthier neighbors on every possible occasion. It is quite likely that the night they were watching Rosario it may have occurred to them that my sister's room contained a good many valuable trifles and was easily entered, especially as they seem to have had a meeting place close at hand. That, however, is pure surmise. You follow me?" ...|$|E
50|$|Elena {{gets to the}} {{hospital}} and asks Bonnie if she can do a spell to save her life but Bonnie is not trained enough to do something that difficult. Damon shows up and offers to give Caroline his blood to heal her. Elena has her doubts about it but she finally agrees after Bonnie's urge. Damon tries to bring up the kiss when he stays along with Elena but Elena has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> talking about. Jenna (Sara Canning) arrives and when Elena cannot remember talking to her either, Damon figures out that Katherine is back in town.|$|R
5000|$|The women try {{to check}} in on Dave, but he doesn't answer the door. They agree that someone should drop by later to make sure Dave is okay, but they all have things to do so Katherine tells them that she will get Mike to go over. When Mike stops by with Katherine's lasagne, he tries {{to tell him that}} he'll get through it and understands <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going through which causes Dave to lash out saying Mike should go back to his happy life with Katherine and to leave him alone. Mike leaves saying he [...] "doesn't have any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going through." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is during}} this period that he {{encounters}} an assassin named Clay who has the same powers as Jamie. Although killed after telling Jamie that the Multiple Man has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> truly <b>is,</b> Clay would come back later.|$|R
6000|$|Being angry was a relief, {{but it was}} {{not exactly}} a solution, and Bernard, at last, leaving his place, where {{for an hour or two}} he had been {{absolutely}} unconscious of everything that went on around him, wandered about for some time in deep restlessness and irritation. At one moment he thought of going back to Gordon's hotel, to see him, to explain. But then he became aware that he was too angry for that--to say nothing of Gordon's being too angry also; and, moreover, that there was nothing to explain. He was to marry Angela Vivian; that was a very simple fact--it needed no explanation. Was it so wonderful, so inconceivable, an incident so unlikely to happen? He went, as he always did on Sunday, to dine with Mrs. Vivian, and it seemed to him that he perceived in the two ladies some symptoms of a discomposure which had the same origin as his own. Bernard, on this occasion, at dinner, failed to make himself particularly agreeable; he ate fast--as if he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eating, and talked little; every now and then his eyes rested for some time upon Angela, with a strange, eagerly excited expression, as if he were looking her over and trying to make up his mind about her afresh. This young lady bore his inscrutable scrutiny with a deal of superficial composure; but she was also silent, and she returned his gaze, from time to time, with an air of unusual anxiety. She was thinking, of course, of Gordon, Bernard said to himself; and a woman's first meeting, in after years, with an ex-lover must always make a certain impression upon her. Gordon, however, had never been a lover, and if Bernard noted Angela's gravity it was not because he felt jealous. [...] "She is simply sorry for him," [...] he said to himself; and by the time he had finished his dinner it began to come back to him that he was sorry, too. Mrs. Vivian was probably sorry as well, for she had a slightly confused and preoccupied look--a look from which, even in the midst of his chagrin, Bernard extracted some entertainment. It was Mrs. Vivian's intermittent conscience that had been reminded of one of its lapses; her meeting with Gordon Wright had recalled the least exemplary episode of her life--the time when she whispered mercenary counsel in the ear of a daughter who sat, grave and pale, looking at her with eyes that wondered. Mrs. Vivian blushed a little now, when she met Bernard's eyes; and to remind herself that she was after all a virtuous woman, talked as much as possible about superior and harmless things--the beauty of the autumn weather, the pleasure of seeing French papas walking about on Sunday with their progeny in their hands, the peculiarities of the pulpit-oratory of the country as exemplified in the discourse of a Protestant pasteur whom she had been to hear in the morning.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{he was a}} young man, Mick had no idea he was {{different}} from other children. He discovered he {{was different}} when describing [...] "sparkiness" [...] with other children, who had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about.|$|E
5000|$|... "And {{he said it}} so smooth, so fast," [...] recalls Searles. [...] "We {{just kind}} of smiled and had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying. We were rookies. I {{had no idea what}} was going on. But every {{briefcase}} zipped up and closed and everyone sat up straight in their chairs. It was over.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the squad}} room, when Gene starts {{to discuss the}} case, Larry has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> talking about, as Larry is unaware of any murder. And when Gene goes to the house where he met Tory, another woman is living there. It is as if Tory never existed. Confused, Gene consults Police Department psychiatrist, Dr Bert James (David Ogden Stiers), who admits <b>he</b> doesn't {{understand}} <b>what</b> Gene is experiencing. As Gene continues writing his novel, <b>he</b> wonders <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on. Further investigation reveals that, under a different name, the woman that Gene knows as Tory {{was involved in a}} previous homicide case and that Larry knows about it.|$|R
50|$|K. {{receives}} {{a phone call}} summoning him to court, and the coming Sunday is arranged as the date. No time is set, but the address is given to him. The address {{turns out to be}} a huge tenement building. K. has to explore to find the court, which turns out to be in the attic. The room is airless, shabby and crowded, and although <b>he</b> has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> charged with, or what authorizes the process, K. makes a long speech denigrating the whole process, including the agents who arrested him; during this speech an attendant's wife and a man engage in sexual activities. K. then returns home.|$|R

5000|$|Only half awake, {{he thinks}} he is hallucinating when he finds his presumably dead wife sitting at his side asking him reproachfully why {{he has tried to}} murder her.

50|$|When we were {{beginning}} {{to work out the}} songs for Sunday Mornings, my friend Dave Gibbs, formerly of Gigolo Aunts and now Low Stars, said ‘Why don’t you record ‘You Can’t Count On Me’?’ I told him I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about. He said it was one of his favorite songs of mine and sent me an mp3 of my original demo.|$|E
5000|$|His callers, {{played by}} other Radio Hour regulars {{including}} Bill Murray, {{were subject to}} Ballantine's tart-tongued responses to their predictably obtuse opinions, typically capped by his addressing them sarcastically as [...] "Babe." [...] In one classic exchange, Murray's call-in character expresses irritation that inmates of a New York State maximum security hotel, recently {{the scene of the}} Attica Prison riots, are being given connubial visiting privileges which he disagrees with. Belzer's character inquires if the caller knows what the phrase [...] "boned up the ass" [...] means. When Murray admits that he does not, Belzer pithily suggests that <b>he</b> has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> complaining about.|$|R
