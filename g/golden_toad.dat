500|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} has likely exerted a major effect on {{amphibian}} declines. [...] For example, in the Monteverde Cloud Forest, {{a series of}} unusually warm years led to the mass disappearances of the Monteverde Harlequin frog and the <b>Golden</b> <b>Toad.</b> [...] An increased level of cloud cover, a result of geoengineering and global warming, which has warmed the nights and cooled daytime temperatures, has been blamed for facilitating the growth and proliferation of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the causative agent of the fungal infection chytridiomycosis).|$|E
500|$|Declines in {{amphibian}} {{populations were}} first widely {{recognized in the}} late 1980s, when a large gathering of herpetologists reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe. [...] Among these species, the <b>Golden</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo periglenes) endemic to Monteverde, Costa Rica, featured prominently. [...] It {{was the subject of}} scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989. Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (Atelopus varius), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, of 4,035 {{species of}} {{amphibians}} {{that depend on}} water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) {{were considered to be}} threatened. This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status. Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size. Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased UVB radiation, [...] and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors. A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss. Emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis [...] and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.|$|E

50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>toad's</b> main habitat {{was on a}} cold, wet ridge called Brillante. They {{would emerge}} in late March through April to mate {{for the first few}} weeks in {{rainwater}} pools amongst tree roots, where they also laid their eggs. 1500 <b>golden</b> <b>toads</b> were reported to breed at the site since 1972. The last documented breeding episode occurred from April-May 1987.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{records of}} <b>golden</b> <b>toads</b> were {{consistently}} collected, their rapid disappearance was well documented, yet the causes remain poorly understood. After 1989, {{there have been}} no verified documented sightings. The disappearance was originally attributed to a severe neotropical drought in 1987-1988, but other factors have since been treated as more likely causes. The IUCN has given numerous possible reasons for the species' extinction, including its [...] "restricted range, global warming, chytridiomycosis and airborne pollution". Jennifer Neville examined the different hypotheses explaining the extinction in her article [...] "The Case of the Golden Toad: Weather Patterns Lead to Decline", and concluded that Crump's El Niño hypothesis is [...] "clearly supported" [...] by the available data. In her article, Neville discussed the flaws in other hypotheses explaining the toad's decline. The UV-B radiation theory, which suggest that the decline in <b>golden</b> <b>toads</b> resulted from an increase in UV-B radiation, has little evidence supporting it because there was no high elevation UV-B radiation recorded, also, {{there is little evidence that}} an increase in UV-B radiation would have an effect on anurans. Another theory is that the anuran water loss from dry conditions helped cause high mortality rates among adults, although this point is hotly contested.|$|R
2500|$|Numerous {{articles}} by Chumbley followed, published in British and American occult journals, but no further books appeared until ONE: The Grimoire of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Toad</b> in 2000, described by Xoanon as: [...] "...the first full grimoire-text to treat specifically and from personal {{account of the}} Traditional East Anglian ritual called 'The Waters of the Moon': the solitary initiation of the so-called 'Toad-witch'." [...] The purpose of this traditional folk-magical rite is to obtain a specific bone from the flensed corpse of a toad; the bone is believed to bestow certain powers upon its owner, primarily control of animals. Chumbley's ONE, however, presents a thoroughly antinomian re-visioning of the ritual procedure and its results, combining ritual practice {{with a series of}} dramatic visions recounted in prose-poetry. In Chumbley's recension it becomes clear that the [...] "animal" [...] over which power is sought is the practitioner's own human self. Seventy-seven hand-bound copies of the book were offered for sale, each copy accompanied by a hand-written page of a sigillic [...] "inner grimoire", signed by the author, and an envelope containing a hand-painted talisman made from antique toadskin leather and a single blackthorn. A further three copies were retained [...] "for internal distribution"; these were bound in leather with an actual toad's head set into the front cover, with toadskin leather panelling on the rear.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, an American {{ecologist}} and herpetologist, Martha Crump, {{recorded the}} <b>golden</b> <b>toad's</b> mating rituals. In her book, In Search of the Golden Frog, she {{described it as}} [...] "one of the most incredible sights I've ever seen", and said they looked like [...] "statues, dazzling jewels on the forest floor". On April 15, 1987, Crump recorded in her field diary that she counted 133 toads mating in one [...] "kitchen sink-sized pool" [...] that she was observing. Five days later, she witnessed the pools in the area drying, which she attributed {{to the effects of}} the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, [...] "leaving behind desiccated eggs already covered in mold". The toads attempted to mate again that May. Of the 43,500 eggs that Crump found, only twenty-nine tadpoles survived the drying of the forest's ground.|$|R
5000|$|In {{conjunction}} with the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis, the climate-linked-epidemic hypothesis also suggests a correlation between climate change and the amphibian pathogen. Unlike the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis, the climate-linked-epidemic hypothesis does not assume a direct chain of events between warmer weather and disease outbreak. This interpretation assumes that global climate change has a direct link to species extinctions, arguing that [...] "the patterns of increasing dry days implicate rising global temperatures due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions." [...] Taking the results and recent findings that tie the <b>golden</b> <b>toad's</b> population crash to disease, the authors concluded that climate-driven epidemics are an immediate threat to biodiversity. It also points to {{a chain of events}} whereby this warming may accelerate disease development by translating into local or microscale temperature shifts—increases and decreases—favourable to Bd.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{versions}} of the Chinese folktale called Liúhǎi xì jīnchán 劉海戲金蟾 [...] "Liu Hai plays with the <b>golden</b> toad"Hai employed <b>toad</b> as a charger to carry him instantaneously from place to place. The creature was not entirely reconciled to this mode of life, and occasionally escaped by diving down the nearest well. Its passion for the gleam of gold, however, invariably led to its recapture, when its master dangled a string of cash before its eyes. He is popularly represented with one foot on the toad's head, holding in his hand a ribbon, or fillet, on which are strung five golden coins. The design is known as [...] "Liu Hai sporting with the toad" [...] (劉海戲蟾), and is regarded as highly auspicious and conducive to good fortune. Another version of the story, inconsistent with the last or the moon theory, is that the reptile lived in a deep pool and exuded a vapour poisonous to the neighborhood, and that it was thus hooked and destroyed by Liu Hai, exemplifying the fatal attraction of money to lure men to their ruin.

50|$|Wildlife {{diversity}} is very high; there are 441 species of amphibians and reptiles, 838 species of birds, 232 species of mammals and 181 species {{of fresh water}} fish. Costa Rica has high levels of endemism; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are endangered. According to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered. Some of the country's most endangered species are the Harpy eagle, the Giant anteater, the <b>Golden</b> <b>toad</b> and the Jaguar. IUCN reports the <b>Golden</b> <b>toad</b> as extinct.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> (Incilius periglenes, {{formerly}} Bufo periglenes) {{was a small}} true toad {{that was}} once abundant in a small, high-altitude region about 4 km2 in an area {{north of the city}} of Monteverde, Costa Rica. It was endemic to elfin cloud forest. Also called the Monte Verde toad, Alajuela toad and orange toad, it is commonly considered the [...] "poster child" [...] for the amphibian decline crisis. This toad was first described in 1966 by herpetologist Jay Savage. The last sighting of a single male <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> was on 15 May 1989, and it has since been classified as extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their lives in moist underground burrows, in particular during the dry season. The average lifespan of the <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> is unknown, but other amphibian species in the family Bufonidae have an average lifespan of 10-12 years.|$|E
50|$|Jay Savage {{discovered}} the <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> in 1964. From their discovery in 1964 for about 17 years, and from April to July in 1987, population sizes of ~1500 adult toads were reported. As {{the population was}} very small and localized, a reserve of 4 km2 was established around the known locality, eventually expanded to cover 105 km2. Only ten or eleven toads were seen in 1988, including one seen by Martha Crump, and none have been seen since May 15, 1989, when Crump last saw the same solitary male toad {{that she had seen}} the year before. The <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> was the first species to be verified to have gone extinct from the consequences of climate change.|$|E
50|$|The highland-dwelling <b>golden</b> <b>toad,</b> Bufo periglenes, has {{not been}} {{witnessed}} in its highly restricted habitat of the central mountain ranges of Costa Rica since 1989. Within one year, the number of juveniles counted at their most prevalent breeding site declined from over 1,500 individuals to only one. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared the <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> endangered, but it is likely extinct {{due to the lack}} of sightings since over two decades ago. Suspected causes for the toads probable extinction include a combination of intense El Nino weather patterns which resulted in a drought, increased pollution added to the environment, climate change, and an invasive fungal species, Chiriqui harlequin.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} between its {{discovery}} and disappearance, the <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> was commonly featured on posters promoting the biodiversity of Costa Rica. Holdridge's toad, which was declared extinct in 2008 but has since been rediscovered, lives in the same forest in Costa Rica.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} foreign {{visitors}} increased from 2,700 in 1980 to more than 40,000 in 1991.

50|$|The chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is {{responsible}} for chytridiomycosis, a disease of amphibians. Discovered in 1998 in Australia and Panama this disease is known to kill amphibians in large numbers, and has been suggested as a principal cause for the worldwide amphibian decline. Outbreaks of the fungus were found responsible for killing much of the Kihansi Spray Toad population in its native habitat of Tanzania, {{as well as the}} extinction of the <b>golden</b> <b>toad</b> in 1989.

50|$|For a {{few weeks}} in April, after the dry season ended and the forest became wetter, males would gather in large numbers near ground puddles {{and wait for the}} females.
