500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{write this}} novel, Grimwood did {{extensive}} research into brain surgery and epilepsy. Film producer William Castle {{took an interest}} in adapting Breakthrough for a movie, but the project was never realized. Breakthrough has certain parallels with David Williams' Second Sight (Simon and Schuster, 1977), coincidentally written the same year and later adapted for the TV movie, The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan (1979). Williams has commented, [...] "As the author of Second Sight, I {{have to tell you that}} until I read this Wikipedia page in 2004, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Ken Grimwood or his novel Breakthrough." ...|$|E
2500|$|R. N. Elliott's {{analysis}} of the mathematical properties of waves and patterns eventually led him to conclude that [...] "The Fibonacci Summation Series {{is the basis of}} The Wave Principle". Numbers from the Fibonacci sequence surface repeatedly in Elliott wave structures, including motive waves (1,3,5), a single full cycle (8waves), and the completed motive (89 waves) and corrective (55 waves) patterns. Elliott developed his market model before he realized that it reflects the Fibonacci sequence. [...] "When I discovered The Wave Principle action of market trends, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> either the Fibonacci Series or the Pythagorean Diagram".|$|E
