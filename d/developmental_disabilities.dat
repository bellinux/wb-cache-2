40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the {{movement}} to have education for all was launched at the World Conference that involved various international organizations such as UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and the World Bank. The main agenda for this conference was Education for All in the entire world. In Tanzania the aspect of education for all is not effectively implemented despite of having policies and legal framework that advocate education for all. The education should enhance teachers who teach children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and also create awareness in the society to accept children with special educational needs. However, children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> need extra attention in terms of curriculum adaptation, teaching methods, and availability {{of teaching and learning}} materials, assistive technology, assessment systems, as well as resources and funds for more assistance in adapting the school environment. This study addressed the issue of children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> by examining the challenges faced by teachers who teach children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and how they try to overcome these challenges. Local teachers in most of the primary schools in Tanzania lack training in special needs education for children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> Despite the Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP), that ensure education for all, the overall quality of primary education in Tanzania remains generally poor for children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> The shortages of teachers trained on special- educational needs-professionals, as well as the lack of teaching facilities, {{have a negative effect on}} the delivery of quality education to children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> In many schools, class sizes are too big for teachers to facilitate quality learning. The general purpose of this study is to find out what challenges teachers face when teaching children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> Very few studies on children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> have been conducted in Tanzania. Most of these few studies focused on secondary school level. Therefore there is a need to conduct such studies at the primary school level. The empirical investigation is guided by the following objectives: 1. To see Teachers understanding of <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> 2. To find out the approach and methods of teaching used by teachers when teaching children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> 3. To see if there are common activities between a unit for children with special educational needs and ordinary classes. 4. To find out to what extent the parents of children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> collaborate with special needs education teachers. The main research question for this master thesis is: What challenges do teachers face when teaching children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and how do they overcome them? The study has interviewed and observed four special needs education teachers who teach in two primary schools with a unit for children with special education needs. The study covered three classes. Two parents were interviewed. The study revealed challenges that are quite universal for teaching learners with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> Teachers in this study expressed the need for reduced class sizes, modern teaching materials, motivations to teachers, and additional support services from the government. Most teachers teaching children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> did not receive any special needs education training from the university, they feel that they are not qualified to teach the children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> This study revealed that the classrooms for children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> in Tanzania at large have poor learning environment to support the learners with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> The study reveals that collaboration between special needs education teachers and parents for children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> is necessary for the wellbeing of their children. Although the results of this study focused on Tanzania, the suggestions may be useful for other developing countries. In order to improve the poor learning environment for special needs educational for children with <b>developmental</b> <b>disability,</b> the following aspects are recommended. Specialized training facilities Resources; both human and materials Special needs education teachers Future research in this area should involve systematic, long-term development work across a range of sites and settings, which also allows for the examination of the impact of the innovations upon achievement. Such research is necessary if we are to advance knowledge about teaching and learning to understand how combinations of teaching approac...|$|R

5|$|In {{individuals}} with <b>developmental</b> <b>disabilities,</b> occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with <b>developmental</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E

This study sought to examine psychology {{graduate student}} training {{in the area of}} <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> across Canada. We invited students from every Canadian Psychological Association accredited Clinical Psychology, Clinical Neuropsychology, and Counselling Psychology program to participate in an online survey, distributed through university email lists. Three hundred and three students reported on the <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> content within their training and coursework, their perception of the adequacy of that content, and their ideas for program improvement. Results indicated that the majority of students believed it important to have training in <b>developmental</b> <b>disability,</b> yet struggled to obtain adequate didactic and experiential opportunities. The lack of sufficient training was most pronounced for students whose training was adult-focussed, but was also high for students with a lifespan or child focus. We discuss different possibilities for increasing <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> training opportunities, including integrating its content within courses on assessment and diagnosis, psychotherapy, and ethics, and providing students with supervision from psychologists who work with this population.
