5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E

Charles at first {{believed}} that the Umayyad forces were trying to lure him {{down the hill and}} into the open. This tactic <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to resist at all costs; he had in fact disciplined his troops for years to under no circumstances break formation and come out in the open.|$|E

25|$|Warner Bros. had optioned {{the film}} {{rights to the}} stage musical, and {{they were on the}} verge of expiring. With Camelot having proven to be more costly than anticipated, and its {{commercial}} success still undetermined since it had not been released, Jack L. Warner was having second thoughts about another musical project, but when he saw Petula Clark perform on her opening night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found the ideal Sharon.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done better acting. In the {{behind the scenes of}} On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E
25|$|In March 1978, Gacy lured a 26-year-old named Jeffrey Rignall {{into his}} car. Upon {{entering}} the car, {{the young man}} was chloroformed and driven to the house on Summerdale, where he was raped, tortured with various instruments including lit candles and whips, and repeatedly chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall was then driven to Lincoln Park, where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. Eventually he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment. Rignall was later informed the chloroform had permanently damaged his liver. Police were again informed of the assault, but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform haze of that night, Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He staked out the exit on the Expressway where <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been driven until—in April—he saw Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, which Rignall and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale. Police issued an arrest warrant, and Gacy was arrested on July 15. He was facing an impending trial for a battery charge for the Rignall incident when he was arrested in December for the murders.|$|E

25|$|After asking Gibson to {{take over}} his {{personal}} finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles, the Louis camp negotiated {{a deal with the}} IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with Ezzard Charles—who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott—was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458. Louis had to continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|Double world {{champion}} Alain Prost's McLaren {{had been having}} problems all weekend with the Frenchman finding the McLaren MP4/5 hard to set up, and when his two stop strategy was ruined by a clutch failure, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to continue the race having made just one of his scheduled two pit stops on the notoriously abrasive Rio circuit. He finished second. Nigel Mansell secured a surprising win for the Scuderia, with no problems despite ongoing gearbox faults all weekend {{and a lack of}} winter testing (Mansell also had the steering wheel come loose on the back straight and had to have it changed in his final stop, which luckily was scheduled for the end of that lap). The final step of the podium was taken by local Maurício Gugelmin. Grand Prix debutant Johnny Herbert, Derek Warwick and Alessandro Nannini scored the remaining points. Warwick was desperately unlucky. He lost over 20 seconds in a slow pit stop and only finished 17.8 seconds behind Mansell at the finish suggesting a win (which would have been both his and Arrows' first) or podium place had gone begging.|$|E
500|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{little chance}} of winning, Foraker {{challenged}} Taft, his fellow Cincinnatian, for the Republican nomination for president. [...] He hoped to secure a deal whereby he would endorse Taft in exchange for support in the senatorial election {{to be held in}} January 1909. [...] Roosevelt was determined to drive Foraker from politics, and Taft refused to deal. Taft won at each stage of the delegate-selection process, gaining all but two delegates from Ohio. [...] At the 1908 Republican National Convention, Taft received 702 votes and was nominated; Foraker received 16, of which 11 came from blacks.|$|E

500|$|Despite Dibnah's best efforts, {{planning}} permission was refused. [...] Although he appealed against the decision, {{a new series}} diverted his attention. [...] At the end of 2003 production began for Fred Dibnah's Made in Britain. With his friend, Alf Molyneux, Dibnah would tour the country on his completed traction engine, visiting the workshops that still could produce the parts needed for his antique vehicle. [...] His engine, however, was not yet complete and Dibnah's medical diagnosis was not good: <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{only a short time}} to live.

[...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." [...] Furthermore, [...] "if he was planning ahead, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|In Washington, Brooks was {{supported}} politically, but Baxter also had support {{because of the}} undemocratic way he {{had been removed from}} office. President Grant had already dealt with the outcome of the contested election for Governor of Louisiana Colfax massacre where federal troops had to be sent. As Brooks and Baxter scrambled for support in Washington, D.C., Grant pushed for the dispute to be settled in Arkansas. Baxter demanded the General Assembly be called into session. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> their support, but so did Brooks, so he and his men would not allow anyone to enter the capitol building. Brooks, on the other hand, had the support of the district court. He enlisted Little Rock's premiere lawyer, Uriah M. Rose, head of the still-prominent Rose Law Firm. However, Grant's decision would soon set in motion the demise of Brooks' governorship.|$|E

DeKnight knew Bart had faster than Clark, because in the comic, that is one advantage Flash has over Superman. DeKnight also featured Bart as a [...] "smart-ass", after being inspired by the sarcastic Flash that appears in the animated television series, Justice League. DeKnight's belief is that Bart enjoys his powers, and would not exhibit the more [...] "somber or serious" [...] characteristics of other character. As Gallner pointed out, Bart accepts who he is, and what he can do, and he even abuses his gifts somewhat. The difference between him and Clark is that Bart {{is not afraid to}} show the world what he can do. Gallner also suggested that in his character's initial appearance, Bart is living in a [...] "confused" [...] state, because he has developed these extraordinary powers, his parents do not accept him, and he ends up turning to thievery just to take care of himself.|$|E
500|$|On December 24, Khánh {{issued a}} {{declaration}} of independence from [...] "foreign manipulation", and condemned [...] "colonialism", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said [...] "The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state." [...] The newspaper said if the answer was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities.|$|E
