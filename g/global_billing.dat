30|$|The {{apparent}} {{impact of}} insurance status on patient follow-up {{may result in}} worse outcomes for patients, but the retrospective nature of this paper, which included a cohort of patients 3 – 7  years prior, prevented us from evaluating follow-up for 21 patients. It {{should be noted that}} only one patient without insurance who was discharged went on to have surgery. It is significant that most orthopedic practices in our city typically charge patients without insurance for initial consultation, and our hospital system often requires payment up front for surgical care if scheduled as an outpatient unless the patient qualifies for charity care. Immediate consultation and fracture care, both nonsurgical and surgical, can result in a bill for fracture care that allows subsequent follow-up to occur during the <b>global</b> <b>billing</b> period of fracture care. Patients may be seen regularly during this time without the need for additional surgeon’s fees, although additional radiographs may incur further charges. The upfront cost of surgery is not insignificant, and is typically too much of a financial burden for many families. Uninsured patients often obtain emergency Medicaid funding if they are admitted through the emergency department. Uninsured patients who are seen as an outpatient in the clinic often need to be admitted for surgery through the emergency department in order to bypass this barrier, adding further cost to the system.|$|E

50|$|For two hours, {{the players}} attempt to pass <b>Global</b> <b>Bills</b> that either affect either the number, the color configuration, or {{the value of}} their tokens. Bills are then put to a vote, with a {{majority}} required to pass a <b>Global</b> <b>Bill.</b> However, players also have two other options: Sign or Veto. If a bill is Signed, it automatically passes regardless of opposition; if it is Vetoed, it fails regardless of support. If both a Sign and a Veto is played on a bill, the side with more Sign or Veto votes prevails; if this number is equal, the normal votes to support or oppose determine the bill's fate. A Wild Card must be played to either Sign or Veto a bill; one Wild Card is given to each player at the outset, and if a player tries to Sign or Veto a bill without a Wild Card, they must forfeit all of their chips. Only seven bills may be in play at a time; any bills after the seventh that pass remove the oldest bill from the game.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that the receipt of {{adequate}} prenatal care is associated with improvements in pregnancy outcome, particularly a reduction in the risk of low birth weight. Since medical costs for these low birth weight infants are several times higher than for normal birth weight infants, one would expect that medical costs for newborns would be lower for babies whose mothers have had adequate prenatal care than for those with inadequate prenatal care. Explored in this paper is whether the reduction in Medicaid costs for newborn and post-partum maternal care is greater than the increase in prenatal costs for a Medicaid population. The analysis used a file of 12, 023 Missouri Medicaid records linked with the corresponding 1988 birth certificates. A modified version of the Kessner index was used to define the adequacy of prenatal care. Prenatal care costs were $ 233 higher for pregnancies with adequate prenatal care than for those in which prenatal care was inadequate. Newborn and post-partum costs starting within 60 days after the birth were $ 347 lower for the adequate prenatal care pregnancies, resulting in a savings of $ 1. 49 for each extra $ 1 spent on prenatal care. Among the other factors studied in determining this benefit to cost ratio were <b>global</b> <b>billing,</b> Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and participation in Medicaid under the expanded eligibility provisions that were effective in Missouri in 1988...|$|E
