40|$|Propulsion {{system and}} wing loading {{requirements}} are determined for a mechanical flap and an externally blown flap aircraft for various engine noise levels and two engine cycles. Both aircraft are sized to operate from a 914 m (3000 ft) runway and perform the same mission. For each aircraft concept, propulsion system sizing is demonstrated for two different engine cycles - one having a fan pressure ratio of 1. 5 and a bypass ratio of 9, {{and the other}} having a fan pressure ratio of 1. 25 and a bypass ratio of 17. 8.

In this way, the best airplane operating under one set of constraints can be compared with the best operating under another. A constant 30 -passenger fuselage and rubberized engines based on the General Electric CT- 7 were used as a baseline.

40|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> {{costs and}} noise impacts {{of a wide}} variety of Externally Blown Flap and Augmentor Wing STOL short haul {{transport}} aircraft designs were evaluated to study the costs of noise reduction for these types of aircraft.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{more efficient}} aircraft configurations which have less environmental impact, this paper develops a multidisciplinary analysis framework {{integrated with the}} airframe and propulsion analysis modules. The characteristics for propulsion, aerodynamics, weight, performance, cost, emissions, and noise can be rapidly predicted by the framework. The impact of propulsion installation with large diameter engines on aircraft weight and drag are considered in the framework. A wide-body aircraft was taken as an example for the optimization to investigate the tradeoffs between the cost metric and the environmental performance metrics. Several cases for single objective and multiobjective optimizations were performed. In the single objective optimizations, the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> cost, the cumulative noise, the oxides of nitrogen emissions during landing-takeoff cycle, and the mission oxides of nitrogen emissions were considered as an objective and minimized, respectively. The different objectives resulted in designs with different airframe parameters and engine cycle parameters. In the multiobjective optimizations, the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> costs and environmental performances were considered as the objectives simultaneously. The optimization results were the Pareto fronts for the minimum <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> costs and environmental performances, which illustrate the quantitative relationships between the economic metric and the environmental performances...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} {{characteristics and}} historical trends of long-haul air transportation are discussed. Various published estimates of modern airship <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> costs are presented and comparatively analyzed. The large discrepancies in these estimates are {{in large measure}} explained, allowing airship <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> costs to be estimated with some confidence. Indirect costs are also briefly discussed. Projected airship operating costs are compared with actual costs of competing modes such as airplanes, trucks, rail, and pipelines, and it is concluded that airships cannot economically compete with other long-haul modes. Thus attention is drawn to short-haul applications of the airship; and because short-haul missions lead to vehicle requirements that are considerably different from those for long-haul missions, it is concluded that the civil airship {{of the future is}} likely to bear little resemblance to those of the past...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} slender wing, {{supersonic}} airliners {{has been considered}} {{from the viewpoint of}} obtaining maximum space utilization, A relationship between <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> cost on trans-atlantic services and space utilization has been established, which shows, as might be expected, that the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> costs decrease as the utilization factor increases. A penalty associated with a high utility factor is a high wing loading. This leads to the necessity of using auxiliary lift when high utilization factors are obtained, It is shown that a propulsive engine modified to give jet lift at landing and possibly take-off {{is likely to be the}} best means of obtaining auxiliary lift. The optimum cruise height is less than that corresponding to maximum lift drag ratio because of the weight penalty associated with providing adequate thrust. The integrated layout is not suitable for airliners required to carry less than a hundred passengers, but becomes extremely attractive for a very large number of passengers In this case the central part of the wing area should be of constant depth with a cabin of side by side multi- bubble form. The delta planform is not ideal for an integrated layout, Better space utilization can be obtained using a pointed pear shaped Planform. Approximate calculations suggest that <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> costs of a 120 seat airliner can be reduced by as much as 25 % by using this type of layout...|$|R
